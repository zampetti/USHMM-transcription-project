Goldberg</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: This is Sunday, June 4, 1978.</span> <span id="s6">This is an interview of Dr. Margaret Ebert at the home of Hanna Goldberg in Yellow Springs, Ohio.</span> <span id="s7">Mrs. Ebert, first of all I want to thank you for coming today and being a guinea pig.</span> <span id="s8">You and I talked several times already, first in discussing the questions which might be included in the questionnaire and then, yesterday we began to talk a bit more specifically about your own background.</span> <span id="s9">I wonder if you would tell me again; where you were born, and when.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I was born in Karlsruhe, Baden, Germany on June 12, 1898.</span> <span id="s11">I attended school there.</span> <span id="s12">It was an absolutely mixed school.</span> <span id="s13">I was the only Jewish girl during the entire time I was in school.</span> <span id="s14">I never had any Jewish friends in my class, since I was never connected with any.</span> <span id="s15">We lived in a very comfortable way.</span> <span id="s16">My parents both were absolutely German by nationality and Jewish as religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: How did you come to this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My great-grandfather settled in town in 1712 or 13, shortly after the founding of the town.</span> <span id="s19">He was one of the very well estimated citizens.</span> <span id="s20">There was no question about religion at all.</span> <span id="s21">My grandfather inherited the store which had been founded in 1832 and my father came there as an employee and married the boss’ daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: So both of your parents were old citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My father grew up in Ludwigsburg near Stuttgart where his family had bought its house in 1708, shortly after the founding of that town.</span> <span id="s24">One of his ancestors had discovered a fire in the Stuttgart castle, he got the house as remuneration.</span> <span id="s25">The house is now back in the possession of the family, since it was not destroyed during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: How many brothers and sisters do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I have one brother who emigr0ated before me and who is in Atlanta, GA.</span> <span id="s28">He is Professor Emeritus from Georgia Tech.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: When did you leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: I left Germany on May 14, 1940 or 1939.</span> <span id="s31">We had lived in the same apartment since my husband and I got married in 1925.</span> <span id="s32">We had both attended the University of Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s33">He studied law.</span> <span id="s34">I got my PHD in social Work and Economics.</span> <span id="s35">He was a lawyer, as long as that was allowed by Hitler’s laws.</span> <span id="s36">After that he worked in different lines and emigrated in 1939, shortly after the Kristallnacht (the night of Nov. 10, 1938 when the various synagogues and Jewishly owned stores were desecrated, ransacked and burned and Jewish men were arrested at random) since we all tried to get our men out of Germany.</span> <span id="s37">He was lucky enough not to be taken to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: When your husband came to the U.S., why were you unable to come with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: He did not come to the U.S. because of the quota number for immigration into America.</span> <span id="s40">We all could not come immediately.</span> <span id="s41">We tried to get our men out of Germany.</span> <span id="s42">My husband lived in Scotland for a whole year.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: However you did not join him in Scotland?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: No, no!</span> <span id="s45">We met in the U.S., at the pier in NY, finally after a separation of one year; being separated during the start of the war, not being able to contact one another.</span> <span id="s46">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Your children?</span> <span id="s48">Do you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I have one daughter who lived with me in Germany.</span> <span id="s50">She had the possibility to go to Switzerland after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s51">She got so homesick that she came back and we lived together in Karlsruhe until the war started and we were evacuated.</span> <span id="s52">[That contradicts the earlier departure date from Germany given as May1939.</span> <span id="s53">However there Dr. Ebert had vacillated in her answers between 1940 and ’39 so probably 1940 was the right year].</span> <span id="s54">Then we moved to Mannheim.</span> <span id="s55">During all this time I worked as social worker for the HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), the Jewish Emigration Association, and tried to get as many people out of Germany as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Tell me a little about your family and home life.</span> <span id="s57">For example you said that your parents and yourself felt as if you were Germans in terms of nationality and Jewish in terms of religion.</span> <span id="s58">What sorts of practices did you uphold in terms of religious aspects?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: We went to synagogue on all the High Holy Days.</span> <span id="s60">We celebrated the Seder (Passover meal) and such things, but we had three maids.</span> <span id="s61">One of them was in the employ of our family for sixty years.</span> <span id="s62">She was Catholic and she took my brother and me every morning for a walk.</span> <span id="s63">It was only natural that we went every time to the Cathedral in Karlsruhe where she said the Mass while we had to keep quiet.</span> <span id="s64">Then we went home.</span> <span id="s65">One day she came to my mother and said “Now when you were growing up I could follow you, but now your children run much faster than you”.</span> <span id="s66">She didn’t realize that she was 20 years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Did your parents speak any other language besides German?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yes, we spoke one day French and the other day German, because my grandmother was French.</span> <span id="s69">So French was nearly like a second language for me!</span> <span id="s70">I never learned English.</span> <span id="s71">I learned it when I came to this country.</span> <span id="s72">In school we had six years of Latin and four years of Greek.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: When you think back to your childhood and to your family life, do you think yourself as being amongst the wealthier people in your community.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s75">We did not know what it meant not to have money.</span> <span id="s76">We learned it when we came to the U.S. with $.80 in our pocket.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Can you tell me what your father did?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: My father, as I have said, inherited the office of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s79">They had about 100 employees in the office.</span> <span id="s80">They had branches in London, Buenos Aires, in Tel Aviv and Rio de Janeiro.</span> <span id="s81">My parents traveled a lot, therefore it was only natural for us to meet people from other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: What about involvement in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: My grandfather already was head of the city council in Karlsruhe, and my father, after the death of my grandfather, became President of the Chamber of Commerce and served on the “Reichpostrat” (council for the German mails) and the “Reicheisenbahnrat” (council for the German railroads).</span> <span id="s84">He was also an expert for iron and steel, at the German-French peace conference in Paris.</span> <span id="s85">For all these reasons we were fully accepted.</span> <span id="s86">He also served on the Board of the Karlsruhe Technical Institute.</span> <span id="s87">We didn’t know anything except being German.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: You mentioned once before that your father had been elected to the Chamber of Commerce?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes, he was asked and elected to be President of the Chamber of Commerce in Jan. 1933.</span> <span id="s90">In the beginning of Feb. 1933, the Executive Secretary of the Chamber came and asked: “Mr. Elsace, wouldn’t you please resign because after Hitler is in power we can’t have a Jewish President.”</span> <span id="s91">(Hitler was appointed Chancellor on Jan, 1933)</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: What was his response to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: He said “Surely, immediately!</span> <span id="s94">You can have my resignation.”</span> <span id="s95">What else could he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Would you say that your parents associated with both Jews and non-Jews in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s98">We had lots of non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s99">Maybe more of these than Jewish ones.</span> <span id="s100">To us there was no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Were your parents involved in activities in the community amongst the Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: My grandfather was Synagogenrat, which means that he was one of the pillars of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s103">My mother was head of the Jewish women’s association.</span> <span id="s104">At this time it made no difference, that is until Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: You told us a good bit about your childhood.</span> <span id="s106">Are there any special events in your childhood which you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s108">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s109">We celebrated Chanukah (the feast of the eight days of lights of the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem after the re-conquest by the Maccabees) in my grandparents house, in the front part.</span> <span id="s110">In the back part was our old Lieschen, the old maid about whom I talked, who had her Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s111">In back we sang the Christmas carols and in front we sang the Chanukah songs.</span> <span id="s112">Everybody joined in both.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: What languages do you speak now, other than German and English?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: French, as well as a little Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Would you say that you are most comfortable in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s117">Absolutely!</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: This question is asked for purposes of this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s120">Because my daughter married a very beautiful American boy and, since she is married we have not spoken German at home because he doesn’t know any, so it is simpler that we speak English all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: I understand that you have grandchildren here also?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: I have six grandchildren.</span> <span id="s123">The oldest has graduated from Antioch and is now getting his Master’s in education.</span> <span id="s124">The next one is married in Denmark to a Danish girl.</span> <span id="s125">The next is a girl, a young woman, who lives here.</span> <span id="s126">She is working here and going to Wright State University.</span> <span id="s127">One is at Evergreen College, in Washington.</span> <span id="s128">We expect all of them home this summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Prior to Hitler coming to power, were you aware at any time, or do you recall being aware of any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: No!</span> <span id="s131">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s132">Especially not since our town was half Catholic, half Protestant.</span> <span id="s133">The Jewish community was absolutely accepted, in every way.</span> <span id="s134">I never felt any anti-Semitism, until Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Tell me when you first became aware of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: After Jan 30, 1933, when some of our non-Jewish friends avoided meeting us.</span> <span id="s137">However, before then, I can’t remember any anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s138">Not even during the time when I was the only girl during one term at Karlsruhe Tech.</span> <span id="s139">That school was established for the war veterans.</span> <span id="s140">I counted as a war veteran since I had done some service in WWI.</span> <span id="s141">I was the only one amongst 1,800 students.</span> <span id="s142">I didn’t feel any anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: By the time Hitler came to power your daughter Hanna was already 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: She was 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So she was in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: She was in school, in the public school.</span> <span id="s147">We had a playgroup for her, a Montessori player group, and she was the only Jewish girl there in a group of 12 kids.</span> <span id="s148">Then, after Hitler came to power, a Jewish teacher had to be started.</span> <span id="s149">She had, then, one of my cousins as a teacher.</span> <span id="s150">She suffered, but I believe that she will be interviewed herself, so I better leave it up to her, to see what she wants to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Could you describe some of the incidents of anti-Semitism, once Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s152">The incidents which happened in the community.</span> <span id="s153">You said that your non-Jewish friends avoided you.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yes, our non-Jewish friends avoided us but the old friends, especially, stuck to us through everything.</span> <span id="s155">I told you one little incident; the father of my brother’s best friend was the head of our passport office.</span> <span id="s156">I received my passport very easily and without any trouble.</span> <span id="s157">I also got my U.S. visa finally and we worked closely with the Swiss consul in Mannheim.</span> <span id="s158">He offered to give me a visa to stay in Bern, Switzerland for a week.</span> <span id="s159">Then I came to the Karlsruhe passport office and told the man that he should send my passport which already had the U.S. visa on it, to Mannheim to get my Swiss visa.</span> <span id="s160">He looked at me and said; “Doctor, why don’t you take it?</span> <span id="s161">That is much easier than mailing it.”</span> <span id="s162">People who were with me were simply flabbergasted that I got a passport with visa and that it wasn’t mailed.</span> <span id="s163">That was the way people trusted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: But these were your friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: He wasn’t a friend, he was an acquaintance.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Do you recall anything in the newspapers of that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: In the Frankfurter Zeitung (that was and still is not only the leading regional paper but also a recognized first class paper of the order of the St. Louis Dispatch), which I read regularly.</span> <span id="s168">I could not find much except for what the press office of the Reich put in it.</span> <span id="s169">Otherwise it was absolutely neutral.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: What about your daughter’s friends?</span> <span id="s171">Did she also lose friends from the public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yes, because the parents did not want them to be associated with Jews any longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: So the community in general answered in support of the anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: No!</span> <span id="s175">most people didn’t.</span> <span id="s176">they were afraid.</span> <span id="s177">A few hot heads, responded very actively but most of the people, especially the older people in town, of our age, were very understanding and very helpful.</span> <span id="s178">A typical thing was what happened after the Kristallnacht when our men were picked up; we had two ladies living downstairs in our house and, on the morning of Nov 11, 1938, one of them came upstairs and told my husband: “Leave immediately.</span> <span id="s179">The Gestapo (Geheime Staats Polizei or Secret National Police, this was the organization which carried out the anti-Jewish and other Nazi laws) has been here to pick you up.</span> <span id="s180">We said that you had a headache and that you couldn’t come downstairs.</span> <span id="s181">Go over to your in-laws so that they don’t find you when they come back”.</span> <span id="s182">They didn’t come back at all.</span> <span id="s183">These were two women who had joined the Women Hitlerite Organization.</span> <span id="s184">They had joined because they felt they had to but they were still the same people as before.</span> <span id="s185">My daughter went over to Germany with her family last year, to visit the places which she remembered.</span> <span id="s186">One of these women was still alive and she provided lodgings for the family for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: When did you feel that anti-Semitism became more prevalent?</span> <span id="s188">Or when people became more public with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: After the 1936 Olympics.</span> <span id="s190">That is when the new “Jewish laws” (the so called Nuremberg laws) were promulgated.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: What was the reaction to the new “Jewish laws”?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Big excitement for the big hate against the Jews.</span> <span id="s193">However they had to do it; they had to obey the laws; individuals couldn’t do anything but that.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: What about the Jews in your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: We all did not realize how bad it was, until after 36 that is.</span> <span id="s196">By that time the U.S. quota system was in effect (actually the “National quotas” for would be immigrants to the U.S. was the result of the laws of 1921, revised in 1927) and were enforced.</span> <span id="s197">As I said in my letter to the Yellow Springs News, “if the immigration laws had been applied with a little more consideration, millions of people could have been saved.”</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: However the U.S. was not the only place where people could go.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yes, but where should they go?</span> <span id="s200">England couldn’t take them, Italy was involved in the war itself.</span> <span id="s201">France took in a lot of people, until it was overrun by Hitler.</span> <span id="s202">Our Jewish people from Baden were all, or at least mostly, taken to the camps in Gurs in southern France.</span> <span id="s203">We had the possibility, originating from New York, to get a few people out -- when we could make the deposit.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: What was that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: It was G-U-R-S (spelled by ME.)</span> <span id="s206">It was in southern France, but it was in the unoccupied portion of France (i. e. the portion of France which between the defeat and surrender of France in Jun 1940 and the Allied landings in Algeria and Morocco in 1943 was governed from Vichy with the permission of the Germans.</span> <span id="s207">Gurs had been set up as an internment camp for Germans by France prior to the French defeat.)</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: What was its purpose?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Its purpose was to get the Jews concentrated so that they could be taken to the East (actually Gurs was close enough to Marseilles, where the U.S. and other consulates were, and the Jews were given day long permits to go to Marseilles in order to secure passage out of Europe if they, individually, could).</span> <span id="s210">The people from Gurs, the ones who could not get out anymore were taken to Auschwitz or to other camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Tell me what you were doing.</span> <span id="s212">Were you working at the time the Nazi’s came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I was working for the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s214">Right after I got my degree, I immediately started working as Executive Secretary for the so-called “Oberrat” which was the head organization for the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s215">I was there until Hanna was born.</span> <span id="s216">Afterwards I started again in that job.</span> <span id="s217">Later I was asked to take over the department of the HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society).</span> <span id="s218">This was led by the “Reichs Vertretung von Juden in Berlin).</span> <span id="s219">(The National Representation of Jews located in Berlin).</span> <span id="s220">I worked in close contact with the HIAS in the U.S., and its branch in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Your major responsibilities were?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: First it was to take care of all the Jews in (the German State of) Baden including to get the money from the State, which was collected with the German income tax.</span> <span id="s223">I had to distribute the money to the different communities.</span> <span id="s224">I also was to supervise Jewish life and Jewish education for all the people, including the young people.</span> <span id="s225">Then I worked for the emigration.</span> <span id="s226">I was terribly moved the other day, when in the time spot of Channel 7, the boat St. Louis which was taken back from Cuba was mentioned.</span> <span id="s227">Fifty people who had been in my charge were on it.</span> <span id="s228">All these people were killed after returning to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Could you tell me how the Nazi’s coming to power affected your everyday life?</span> <span id="s230">Shopping, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Not at all until the war started.</span> <span id="s232">When the rationing came in we got one egg per week per person, one eight-ounce glass of milk per child per week.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Was it any different for Jews and non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: It was the same for everyone.</span> <span id="s235">However there also was a black market where you could get stuff, and we could do it also.</span> <span id="s236">I never forgot that, after our evacuation to Mannheim, there was an old fish store where my in-laws had made their purchases.</span> <span id="s237">One day the owner of that store called me in and asked “Would you like a fish?”</span> <span id="s238">I said: “Sure, we could use it!”</span> <span id="s239">He gave me a fish but he had no paper to wrap it in, so I had to carry it home by its tail.</span> <span id="s240">It was in winter.</span> <span id="s241">It was a pretty cold experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: What happened to your family after the occupation (he probably means the start of the war).</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: My husband’s parents who were very well known in Berlin, my father-in-law was one of the best lawyers in Mannheim, both committed suicide on Oct 1, 1933, since they wanted their money to go to their sons so that they could emigrate.</span> <span id="s244">My parents both died in 1939 in Oct. and Nov., before I left.</span> <span id="s245">My brother was already in the U.S. My husband’s only brother was in England and his three children were in Holland; his wife was still in Germany.</span> <span id="s246">She was taken to Gurs (the camp in southern France where Jews from Baden were transported to after France was overrun in May-Jun 1940 and from where it was possible to emigrate), however we got her out.</span> <span id="s247">When I arrived in the U.S., I was greeted by my husband, my brother and sister-in-law with three children.</span> <span id="s248">I brought the fourth child, my daughter with me.</span> <span id="s249">After not knowing what money meant I was lucky enough to get a job as a housekeeper in a rooming house where we got free lodging and $5,00 pocket money a week.</span> <span id="s250">That was the money with which I fed the family.</span> <span id="s251">It was pretty hard to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about your experiences when you first came to this country?</span> <span id="s253">I am interested in the kind of changes.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: I didn’t know one word of English, that was the hardest.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: How did you learn English?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I picked it up.</span> <span id="s257">I never had any lesson, however the children who spoke only English taught me very rapidly.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: What about your husband and your brother-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: My husband had started to learn the optician’s trade in Scotland.</span> <span id="s260">Both brothers spoke English very well after living for one year, my husband’s brother in London and my husband in Glasgow.</span> <span id="s261">My husband got, by chance, a job as optician’s apprentice in Newark, N.J. and then a job in a shop in New York where he became a union member.</span> <span id="s262">My brother-in-law and his family settled, after my sister-in-law had come to the U.S., in Columbus (probably Ohio) and he got a job as an accountant.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Is that how you came to Yellow Springs?</span> <span id="s264">(Yellow Springs is about 18 miles east of Dayton, Ohio).</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: No!</span> <span id="s266">We lived in New York for 13 years.</span> <span id="s267">Hanna met her husband there.</span> <span id="s268">He was a conscientious objector.</span> <span id="s269">He was a boy from Indiana, a beautiful person.</span> <span id="s270">I always say that he is the best part of our family.</span> <span id="s271">They were close friends of Ralph and Lila Templing who had the School of Living in Safran and were brought here, to Yellow Springs, by Arthur Morgan.</span> <span id="s272">Hanna and Dick wanted to go to them for the summer, helping them with the school which they started here.</span> <span id="s273">They got stuck here because Lucy Morgan saw Dick painting her barn and liked them so much that she recommended him to Ernest Morgan.</span> <span id="s274">My son-in-law is still at the Book Plate Company.</span> <span id="s275">Now he is in charge of all the machines.</span> <span id="s276">(here ME does not talk distinctly enough for the Transcriber to be certain of understanding the tape correctly.</span> <span id="s277">The transcription is the best try).</span> <span id="s278">He has been there now for 32 years (the official name of the firm is the Antioch Book Plate Co.)</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: When you first came to the U.S. did you have any Jewish friends or associates?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: We had a few.</span> <span id="s281">My uncle, my father’s brother, was here.</span> <span id="s282">He was very helpful.</span> <span id="s283">We also had a few doctor friends who studied for their language exams and State Boards.</span> <span id="s284">They helped us immensely.</span> <span id="s285">I went to the Temple in New York once, on Yom Kippur 1940, because I wanted to say Kaddish (Jewish prayer for the remembrance of the dead) for my parents.</span> <span id="s286">The man in charge didn’t let me in, because I didn’t have a ticket and I was so fed up that we joined the Community Church in New York where Dr. Turney Tons (again the name is only an approximation) was an old friend of the family.</span> <span id="s287">He was very very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Could you tell me something about the Community Church.</span> <span id="s289">What is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: The Community Church is the oldest Unitarian Church in New York.</span> <span id="s291">It is absolutely liberal and absolutely taking in anybody who wants to recognize Jesus Christ as the last of the big prophets and not as the Savior.</span> <span id="s292">We said that this is absolutely true what we could join.</span> <span id="s293">My husband never had been Jewish.</span> <span id="s294">He grew up in Ethical Culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: But his family was Jewish by religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: They never acted Jewish in any way because they were absolutely liberal and absolutely removed from any religion in this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: So they identified basically with the Gentile world.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: No, they didn’t identify with any religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Had that been a long established tradition in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes, it had been a pretty long established tradition because my mother-in-law’s brother was infected at the time of the circumcision.</span> <span id="s301">Therefore the family didn’t want it anymore.</span> <span id="s302">He died shortly afterwards.</span> <span id="s303">So the boys (my husband and his brother) grew up absolutely free and without any traditional religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: I am going back now.</span> <span id="s305">When you were married, were you married in a Jewish ceremony?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: We had big troubles to get married.</span> <span id="s307">Because no Rabbi would have married us.</span> <span id="s308">However my uncle who was very, very well trained in Judaism -- he was the brother of my mother -- gave us the mot beautiful marriage ceremony.</span> <span id="s309">It was founded on the Jewish rituals.</span> <span id="s310">In Germany you don’t need any religious ceremony since you have to go to the city offices anyway and get your certificate of marriage.</span> <span id="s311">You don’t need any rabbi or minister, or anything, if you don’t want one.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: After you were married and you had a child did you continue to practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: I went to synagogue regularly and my husband stayed home!</span> <span id="s314">That is until Hitler came to power then he felt that he should show where he belongs and joined the Jewish religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: You joined the Unitarian Church and then you came here.</span> <span id="s316">To what extent have you continued.</span> <span id="s317">I know that you are identified as Jewish; but did you continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: We are members of the Society of Friends, of the Quakers; particularly since our son-in-law id a gentile.</span> <span id="s319">For that reason it was the only natural thing to do.</span> <span id="s320">We were very welcomed there even although they knew exactly where we stand.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Let me ask you then: you both, you and Paul, were well educated in Germany, before you left to come to the U.S., did you find that your education was, at all, helpful?</span> <span id="s322">I know that it obviously did not help you get a job as a housemaid.</span> <span id="s323">But was it helpful later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: It was helpful in coming to Yellow Springs.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: It was?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s327">I was here, helping our children move to their own house when the Felz Institute was looking for a librarian.</span> <span id="s328">I went to Dr. Sontag and I don’t know what impressed him but he hired me at once.</span> <span id="s329">I worked there for several months.</span> <span id="s330">We didn’t click too well.</span> <span id="s331">So Sontag said, after Labor Day, very nicely: “I think that you should take a part time job.</span> <span id="s332">This is too much for you to have a full time job and family at home.</span> <span id="s333">Why don’t you look for part time work and I will look for another librarian.”</span> <span id="s334">So I said: “why don’t you take Paul who is home.”</span> <span id="s335">A half an hour later my husband was my successor and I got part time work with Arthur Morgan and I worked there (at Antioch College in Yellow Springs of which Arthur Morgan was President).</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: What did Paul do prior to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: He was looking for a job here.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: He was not working?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: He had moved here because I had the job.</span> <span id="s340">We lived here, in this little apartment behind Hanna’s and we were very glad when he got the job and I could retire.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: How would you compare your life initially, when you first came here, besides the money, to what it was in Europe.</span> <span id="s342">Can you describe some experiences which you had which were either very different or similar to those which you had in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I was treated very nicely everywhere.</span> <span id="s344">I must say that I am always glad to be here and about the fact that I became a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: How long have you been a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Since the first possibility I had.</span> <span id="s347">That was in 1945.</span> <span id="s348">We got our first papers (that is the declaration of the intention to become a citizen of the U.S.) immediately, and applied for citizenship as soon as we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: How did you find life different here, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: First of all you are not spoiled with a maid in the house.</span> <span id="s351">You do everything yourself.</span> <span id="s352">That is the first thing that is different.</span> <span id="s353">The second thing is that it does not make so much of a difference whether you have money or not.</span> <span id="s354">There are a lot of possibilities in this country and lots of things which you can do without much money, particularly at the time when we lived in NYC.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: What sort of things?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Concerts!</span> <span id="s357">I remember two concerts by Toscanini which we attended with free tickets.</span> <span id="s358">Also we went to plays.</span> <span id="s359">Some people sent us tickets, or asked you to come with them to a performance.</span> <span id="s360">I must say that we were treated very very nicely.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Did your daughter go to school in the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Hanna went to high school in New York and then to Hunter College (one of the colleges of New York which were free, or nearly so for residents of NYC with proper high school credentials.</span> <span id="s363">Hunter was, at that time, set aside for women.)</span> <span id="s364">She graduated from there shortly after she was married.</span> <span id="s365">She is teaching here now at the Antioch School of Physical Education.</span> <span id="s366">She majored in Physical Education.</span> <span id="s367">She is also a teacher for home bound children in Xenia, Ohio (that is 11 miles south of Yellow Springs).</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: You and Paul have lived here for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Since 1953.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: That is 25 years.</span> <span id="s371">Do you and Paul speak English at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yes, at least mostly.</span> <span id="s373">Except when we get angry.</span> <span id="s374">Then we yell at each other in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Have you introduced German to your grandchildren?</span> <span id="s376">I know Hanna speaks German.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Hanna speaks German very well, but she never uses it.</span> <span id="s378">The grandchildren learned a little bit.</span> <span id="s379">I have been working for UNICEF (United Nations International Children Educational Foundation) for the last 19 years.</span> <span id="s380">They have a very nice game, which I gave to the grandchildren, called Lingo.</span> <span id="s381">In this game all the things are printed in different languages -- it is a game similar to Bingo.</span> <span id="s382">Through it the children learn as they play.</span> <span id="s383">Hanna wrote under the official languages everything in German.</span> <span id="s384">So they know a little bit.</span> <span id="s385">The two youngest who were with Hanna and Dick in Germany last summer speak a little bit now.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Hanna went back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Hanna and Dick went back last year with their two youngest children because our one grandson is married in Denmark.</span> <span id="s388">They went first through Germany and Switzerland before going up to visit with Tommy.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Have you ever been back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No!</span> <span id="s391">And I wouldn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: You wouldn’t go?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: If anybody asked me there is the past and here is the present and the future.</span> <span id="s394">I wouldn’t like to live through the past again!</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Do you ever think about your life in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes, in nightmares.</span> <span id="s397">When I dream about my time at the HIAS office.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: I don’t want to ask you about anything which would upset you but perhaps you can tell me a little bit about your experiences in that office.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: it was pretty hard, because you tried to get people out of Germany and tried to help them and you didn’t have enough possibilities.</span> <span id="s400">We saw about 10 or 15 clients a day, all in the same misery.</span> <span id="s401">You had a pretty hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: When was it no longer possible for people to leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: After the war started in 1939.</span> <span id="s404">I still had 25 people in Berlin in June 1939 to get them to Australia.</span> <span id="s405">The visas didn’t come in time.</span> <span id="s406">I never knew what happened to 20 of them.</span> <span id="s407">Five of them, I know what happened, since I met them in New York, by chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Would you say that the only reason why you stayed as long as you did, in Germany, was because of your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: No!</span> <span id="s410">It was because I didn’t get my U.S. visa in time.</span> <span id="s411">We had to register to get a number to go to the U.S. consulate.</span> <span id="s412">My number was not called until Feb. 1940.</span> <span id="s413">I was very, very lucky.</span> <span id="s414">I got on the last boat out of Italy, before Italy entered the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: You went from Germany to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: I got, through my work, acquainted with the Swiss consulate.</span> <span id="s417">They gave me a visa for Switzerland, otherwise I would have had to go over the Brenner Pass, directly to Italy.</span> <span id="s418">In this way I was able to stay a few days in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s419">The consul was very nice.</span> <span id="s420">He said: “You deserve a rest before you start life in the U.S.” so we could go through Switzerland before we caught the last boat, which left Genoa, Italy, before Italy entered the war.</span> <span id="s421">The U.S. did not allow any of their ships to go through any country at war, (with the Allies), therefore the next ship didn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Did your work for HIAS, no matter how difficult it may have been, with problems of trying to get visas and such for your clients, change.</span> <span id="s423">Would you describe your life to be the same or different, as time progressed in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: The first thing after the Kristallnacht is that I had to give up my car.</span> <span id="s425">I lost my driver’s license.</span> <span id="s426">Every Jew had to give up his driver’s license.</span> <span id="s427">That was a big handicap because I went to the Gestapo nearly every day, for one reason or another.</span> <span id="s428">Then we were asked to move out of our apartments if they were not in Jewish houses.</span> <span id="s429">Then we were no longer allowed to have maids under the age of 45, if they were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s430">That was another handicap.</span> <span id="s431">Then the rationing was pretty bad.</span> <span id="s432">It became worse and worse all the time.</span> <span id="s433">It was typical, for example that after the war started we were not allowed to buy clothing anymore.</span> <span id="s434">It was still the custom that if one of your relatives died you went into mourning, into black clothes.</span> <span id="s435">I could not even get a black dress, or a black coat anymore, when my parents died.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Were there any requirements placed on Jews in public?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A; We were not allowed to attend any concerts or theaters, or lectures.</span> <span id="s438">The other thing which was very hard, it didn’t affect me, because I left in time, but the Jews had to wear yellow bands.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: After the Kristallnacht, in 1938.</span> <span id="s441">We also had to use surnames, that is our own name and then, if you were a lady then “Sarah”, or if you were a man then “Abraham”.</span> <span id="s442">We were not allowed to sign anything without our second name.</span> <span id="s443">I always remember, when I got my U.S. visa I started to write “Dr. Margarete” and wanted to continue with “Sarah” but the girl pushed me and said: “you are in a free country.</span> <span id="s444">You don’t write Sarah here!”</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: This is a marvelous way to end this first interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: We went through the questionnaire rather quickly last time and what I would like to do now is to pick up on certain questions -- certain areas of the questionnaire and begin to pursue those.</span> <span id="s447">One area of great interest is your work with HIAS.</span> <span id="s448">You mentioned that you had worked for the organization after 1933.</span> <span id="s449">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: When did you first become affiliated with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: That was in 1934 when the man who was head of the HIAS was in Baden (the German state in which both Karlsruhe and Mannheim are located) left to return to the U.S.</span> <span id="s453">He had not given us the information which was necessary to register in Stuttgart at the consulate so that we got very high numbers to emigrate to the U.S.</span> <span id="s454">These were numbers on the quota to emigrate to the U.S., at that time.</span> <span id="s455">I remember that my family had the number 1050 (later the number 1850 was mentioned).</span> <span id="s456">That meant, at that time, a wait of at least four or five years.</span> <span id="s457">The man who made this mistake then left, and, left the whole mess for all of us to get resolved, went to the U.S. I met him one time in NYC again where he was one of the most hated men you can imagine.</span> <span id="s458">If he had worked really the right way we all could have come out much earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: So you actually registered for emigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: No, I had not registered because I didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s461">I registered finally when I was at the office and learned about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Now, how did you become professionally affiliated with HIAS?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I worked for the “Oberrat der Israeliten in Baden” (the superior council of the Jews in Baden) before I got married and then, after my marriage, until Hanna was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Would you tell me what that is in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: That is the highest office for the Jews in the State of Baden.</span> <span id="s466">It had been established in 1812.</span> <span id="s467">When I finished my studies in Heidelberg they were looking for a male lawyer to take the position, and when they couldn’t find one they took me as a volunteer.</span> <span id="s468">After four weeks they asked if I would stay.</span> <span id="s469">So, by that time, they knew me pretty well and knew that I could work, and could do the job that was needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: And what was that job?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: The job was to be Executive Director for the entire State of Baden, for the Jewish Communities.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: What sort of work did you do, in relation to the Jewish Communities?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: First of all I had to see that every community got their teacher and got their cantor, if they wanted one, their rabbi, if they wanted one.</span> <span id="s474">Secondly I had to see that the taxes which were taken by the state for the three state religions were used in the right way (in Germany individuals did not -- and probably still don’t -- pay for their churches and religious officials etc. by donations, as is done in the U.S., but paid an assessed tax which the state then prorated to the various religious needs as per a specific formula to the “three state religions” i.e. Protestant, Catholic and Jewish) Thirdly I had to get out a monthly newsletter to let all the people know what was going on.</span> <span id="s475">This was in the year 1921 and everything was very settled and quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: You worked there until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Until after I was pregnant with Hanna, which was in 1926.</span> <span id="s478">The beginning of ’26.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Then, after the birth of Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: I didn’t work then.</span> <span id="s481">Paul was settled as an attorney at law.</span> <span id="s482">I came from a pretty, not wealthy, but well settled family, so I didn’t need to work, until Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: When Hitler came to power you went back to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yes, because Paul lost his profession as a lawyer.</span> <span id="s485">He served in WWI, but not long enough to meet the criteria for remaining a lawyer, as per the newly promulgated laws.</span> <span id="s486">So I decided when HIAS offered me the job that I would take it.</span> <span id="s487">That job was to guide the HIAS department of Baden.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Would you tell me a little about HIAS and tell me the kind of work which you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: I tried to get as many Jewish people as possible out of Germany.</span> <span id="s490">I remember that one of the big things was legislation for the SS St. Louis which set out for Cuba (loaded with refugees trying to escape Nazi Germany but were refused landing privileges by various counties in the Americas the refugees were repatriated to Europe and many finished in extermination camps) and could not land there and was sent back.</span> <span id="s491">The people came partly to England and to France.</span> <span id="s492">Then we tried to get people out to Australia.</span> <span id="s493">We tried to get as many as possible to Palestine, which was at this time still an English protectorate.</span> <span id="s494">Palestine was very exclusive about admitting immigrants.</span> <span id="s495">If people didn’t have money they just didn’t want them to come.</span> <span id="s496">I had about 2,500 and 3,000 Jewish people still in Baden who, I had to try to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: What were the dates of your work with HIAS?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: I can look it up exactly, if you wish but approximately from 1934 or beginning of 1935 until I emigrated to the U.S. in February of 1940.</span> <span id="s499">I left my position on Dec. 1, ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Tell me: in your position there, what sorts of relationships did you have with the German authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Surprisingly, very good ones, because in our State of Baden most of the population was Catholic, and was not very much in favor of Hitler.</span> <span id="s502">Therefore, whenever I came to one of the offices or to one of the different places I was truly treated with very much respect and very well.</span> <span id="s503">I was not put into any concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Were any of your colleagues from the office?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Not in our office in Karlsruhe but from the offices in Munich and in Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Where the offices closed?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: The offices were then run by subordinates who didn’t know a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: You say that the U.S. had quotas.</span> <span id="s509">You mentioned the SS St. Louis.</span> <span id="s510">What sorts of procedures did a person have to go through who wished to leave Germany at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: They first had to try to find a place to go to.</span> <span id="s512">They had to have an affidavit from U.S. citizens or from citizens in Australia, or New Zealand .</span> <span id="s513">Then, secondly, they had to have the money for the transportation to the country.</span> <span id="s514">Finally they had to have a declaration of “clean health”, in the way of money and payment of taxes and duties, on things to be taken out, which they had to pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: You say that you dealt with 20,000 to 30, 000 people in that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: I would think that it would have gotten somewhat difficult -- more and more difficult, during the period.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: It was unbelievably difficult, especially after Kristallnacht, in 1938.</span> <span id="s519">Especially since we all felt that we have to get our men out first.</span> <span id="s520">Fast and as many as possible.</span> <span id="s521">We searched for relatives in England, or France, or Spain, or Italy, who could take our men in.</span> <span id="s522">That was the most important and acute thing then, because if we were able to get them out of concentration camps, or had been forgotten (i.e. they had escaped being arrested).</span> <span id="s523">We didn’t want them to stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s524">We didn’t know when something similar to Kristallnacht would happen again, with all the men being taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: When did Paul leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: He left Germany on May 12, 1939, just before the war started.</span> <span id="s527">We had a cousin in England, a cousin of my mother’s.</span> <span id="s528">who had studied with the help of my grandparents and was a very well settled engineer in Birmingham.</span> <span id="s529">I had written to him immediately after the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s530">He had vouched that Paul could stay with him and that he would give him enough money to live there, until he could emigrate to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: You were not alone that long.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: I was alone for one year and one day.</span> <span id="s533">But it was the most terrible time because in the meantime the war started and we couldn’t even write to each other.</span> <span id="s534">We had to write to people in Switzerland or Holland.</span> <span id="s535">They sent the letters on.</span> <span id="s536">If we mentioned any proper name, or any city, or any town, it was cut out of the letter by the censor.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: After the war broke out, in 1939, clearly it must have been more difficult for Jews to leave Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: It was nearly impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: And yet, you were able to get out!</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: It was almost impossible, except if you could get the transportation from Genoa to the U.S. France had entered the war so no American ships could go there or to England.</span> <span id="s541">It was only Spain or Genoa, in Italy.</span> <span id="s542">(It is felt that the reference to Spain includes Lisbon, Portugal.)</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: But Germany was still allowing Jews to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Yes, if you paid your duty.</span> <span id="s545">That meant; if you leave all the money you have.</span> <span id="s546">As a small example, when I finally got my declaration of “clean health” and could leave I finally had 5 DMarks in my pocket-book when I came to the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s547">The man at the border said “Sorry Madame, the 5 DMarks either have to be brought back to the German side’ -- we were already on the Swiss side “or you have to leave it here or you have to give it to the dependent people.”</span> <span id="s548">I said: “Here, taken it!</span> <span id="s549">I don’t need it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Who were you met by?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: We had friends who had offered already in 1938, after the Kristallnacht, to take Hanna, our daughter.</span> <span id="s552">She was with them for three weeks but then she was so terribly homesick that she came back to Germany.</span> <span id="s553">They offered that, anytime we could come we could stay with them.</span> <span id="s554">However I didn’t leave Germany until one week before the ship left.</span> <span id="s555">My husband had stayed with them for one week before he went to Scotland.</span> <span id="s556">The few little possessions in jewelry or antiques, which I had, had all gone to these friends in Switzerland, when Hanna went there.</span> <span id="s557">We, this lady and I, were sitting on the German side of the railroad station in Bale (44.</span> <span id="s558">17N, 7.</span> <span id="s559">40E) and I had my ring and bracelet and lorgnette with me.</span> <span id="s560">She suddenly said: “Oh, Hanna, give me the menu!”</span> <span id="s561">Then she took my lorgnette, which she never could use and said “Oh I will have some coffee” and put it in her pocketbook.</span> <span id="s562">Then she said: “Oh, give me your ring!”</span> <span id="s563">In this way the few things which I still have came out of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: How long were you in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: A week.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: And then you went to Genoa?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Yes, and from Genoa with the last U.S. steamer to NY, because, while we were on the steamer Italy entered the war, and there was no possibility anymore to get a U.S. boat in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Let’s go back again to your work with HIAS.</span> <span id="s569">I am most interested in the kind of procedures which were followed, the bureaucratic procedures.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: These procedures operated so that we got our instructions from Berlin, from the headquarters there.</span> <span id="s571">We were asked, for example, if Australia opened its doors up and they would take Jewish refugees, to select twenty people who had enough money to pay for their transportation to Australia and had a little money to stop there.</span> <span id="s572">So I selected 20 people from the entire state and wrote to them that there is a possibility; if you have around 30,000 DMarks please let me know immediately and we will try to get the visa.</span> <span id="s573">Then I gathered 12 people, out of the 20 selected, and took them to Berlin to meet the Australian consul there.</span> <span id="s574">They were all approved.</span> <span id="s575">In the meantime the war got worse and they couldn’t go anymore.</span> <span id="s576">However the German Reich, which had taken all their money, except for the money for transportation kept the money.</span> <span id="s577">(Australia declared war on Germany when England did.)</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: What happened to these people after they were no longer allowed to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: They stayed in Germany and then they were taken to Gurs.</span> <span id="s580">in France.</span> <span id="s581">Finally, if they had any relatives in the U.s. who could pay the deposit of $1,000, they were allowed to leave for the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: So, at the end, after ’39, the U.S. became the only place one could go to from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: The U.S. was the only possibility!</span> <span id="s584">However, the one thing which I always felt was very important, were the Roosevelt refugees.</span> <span id="s585">Roosevelt feared the terrible fate of all these people and allowed a certain number to come to upstate New York.</span> <span id="s586">I don’t know if you knew about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: I know a bit about it, but please tell me more.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Roosevelt offered to take 500 people, especially from amongst the people in France and Italy.</span> <span id="s589">People who were either sick or old or had relatives in the U.S.</span> <span id="s590">He allowed them to come to a fort (ME can not think of the name) near Oswego, New York There was a camp there, obviously not the type of camps in Europe.</span> <span id="s591">The people who arrived there, if they had any friends or relatives, who could give them money for them to live on for one year, in the U.S. could come out of the camp.</span> <span id="s592">However what does 500 mean from the millions who were taken to gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Why were they not allowed to go to Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Because there was no possibility of transportation, anymore, because of the war.</span> <span id="s595">You never knew if a boat would arrive.</span> <span id="s596">Most of the boats were sunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Life must have been very difficult at this time, for these people who remained.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: it was impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: How did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I was no longer there!</span> <span id="s601">I, thank’s God, was able to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: No, how did you as a person live, before you left, in 1940 -- and also the people you were working with.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: We had one egg a week, per person.</span> <span id="s604">Children under ten got one eight ounce cup of milk twice a week.</span> <span id="s605">Meat was impossible.</span> <span id="s606">Bread was like stone.</span> <span id="s607">I remember one little thing we did: we were evacuated, because our house in Karlsruhe, was in the Siegfried Line (the German defense line which was set up as a counterbalance to the French Maginot Line).</span> <span id="s608">So we had to leave in the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s609">I took my entire office to Mannheim.</span> <span id="s610">In Mannheim where Paul had grown up, and where our family was very well known we had a fish store.</span> <span id="s611">One day I passed and the owner called me: “Doctor, would you like a fish?”</span> <span id="s612">That was the winter of ’39 so I said: “Sure!</span> <span id="s613">If you have one”.</span> <span id="s614">She said: ‘Yes, I got some on the black market!”</span> <span id="s615">So I got one fish which I had to carry home by its tail because they had no paper to wrap it up.</span> <span id="s616">We were not allowed to go out after 8:pm, because of a curfew which lasted until 8:am.</span> <span id="s617">If you wanted to go out you had to go to the police and get a special permit.</span> <span id="s618">I got such permits because of my work.</span> <span id="s619">I must say that it was miserable that winter because there was not one light on the entire street.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: You were working and you were allowed to continue to work, due to the nature of your work; but what about these people, for example the people who were unable to get transportation to Australia, and who later went to camp Gurs in France?</span> <span id="s621">What happened to them during the interim period?</span> <span id="s622">How did they live?</span> <span id="s623">How did they eat?</span> <span id="s624">Where did they live?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: They got part of their money back when they couldn’t leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Part of their transportation money?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: No.</span> <span id="s628">Part of the money they had to give to the Reich.</span> <span id="s629">Their duties and taxes and such.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: I thought that you said that the Reich confiscated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Yes, confiscated everything; but when you couldn’t leave you got some money back.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: I see, what about their homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Except for the places in the Siegfried Line, they were all put into one apartment house, in one part of the city.</span> <span id="s634">You had to pay exorbitant duties to get an apartment, or to stay in one.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Did your society, HIAS, support these people in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: We tried to, as much as possible.</span> <span id="s637">We helped them as much as we could, sure!</span> <span id="s638">However everything was pretty limited.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: I understand that but, it seems to me, that these were people who had no jobs -- no work -- because they had given up their work to emigrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: They couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s641">You know that a Jewish doctor was not allowed to be a doctor any more, he became a “Jewish Healer”.</span> <span id="s642">A lawyer became a “Jewish Representative”.</span> <span id="s643">I was glad that I left before we had to wear the stars on our arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: When was the star introduced in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: In the fall of 1940.</span> <span id="s646">They made everything possible to degrade the Jews as much as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Can you recall any incidents, in your work, where the German authorities attempted to demean you?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: No!</span> <span id="s649">Not personally!</span> <span id="s650">I must say that this is one thing which I always appreciated.</span> <span id="s651">I think because of the status my and my husband’s family had in Baden, our entire family, I was never treated badly.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: And your co-workers?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: There were a few who were taken for several days to the jail or to a camp, but mostly they came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: At the period, or time, when one is living under great anxiety, how do you feel that your daughter fared under that pressure?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Very badly.</span> <span id="s656">I told you that they removed the entire studies of the children.</span> <span id="s657">Hanna did not bring any of her memorabilia with her, only two small pieces of marble of our synagogue.</span> <span id="s658">She was there when it was destroyed.</span> <span id="s659">However I believe that you may speak to Hanna yourself, she offered to be interviewed for the Holocaust History project.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: When was the synagogue destroyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: On Nov 10, 1938.</span> <span id="s662">It was the Kristallnacht!</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: After that, after Kristallnacht, to what extent did the Jews congregate?</span> <span id="s664">For prayer or whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: In one of the houses, or one of the apartments.</span> <span id="s666">We also had so-called “Cultural Assembly” where we had lectures, or plays, or concerts.</span> <span id="s667">However that was very hard to arrange, particularly after the war started, since as I told you, the cities were absolutely black at night.</span> <span id="s668">I will never forget when, before Christmas ’39, I had to take a trip to Lake Constance for one of my interviews.</span> <span id="s669">At Konstanz, the city on the lake, the German and Swiss cities are built together, so that they have no border through the entire city.</span> <span id="s670">Everything was like peacetime since they knew that if one of the air raids would occur, the planes could not distinguish between the Swiss and German soil.</span> <span id="s671">So they left everything alone.</span> <span id="s672">It was just overwhelming.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Interviewee: Dr. Margaret Ebert-----ME</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Interviewer Barbara Turoff-----BT</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: This is Barbara Turoff.</span> <span id="s676">It is Sunday, Aug 19, 1979 and we are sitting in the sitting room of Dr. Margaret Ebert’s home for the first of a series of interviews with Mrs. Ebert.</span> <span id="s677">(It appears that BT is not familiar with the previous interviews) Mrs. Ebert, why don’t we start by identifying yourself, telling us how old you are, what you are doing and whatever you wish to say.</span> <span id="s678">Then we will return to the way you were when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s679">Then, if we feel comfortable enough we can start really.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: First of all, I am not Dr. Margaret Ebert.</span> <span id="s681">I am Mrs. Paul Ebert.</span> <span id="s682">I left the doctor title in Europe.</span> <span id="s683">I use it only on my checks.</span> <span id="s684">Second of all, Bob Friedman did already do a lot of interviewing of myself.</span> <span id="s685">Maybe you could get the tape, that would save you time and it would make it easier for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: OK!</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: You asked about my age; I am 81 and I gave up my work for UNICEF last year since I felt that younger people should take over.</span> <span id="s688">I am now a housewife and I try to help wherever I can in the community.</span> <span id="s689">We are very lucky that my husband and I are together after 55 years of married life.</span> <span id="s690">Before that we studied together in Heidelberg for five years.</span> <span id="s691">So we are truly an old couple.</span> <span id="s692">We live here in Yellow Springs because we followed our daughter who got married in New York to a beautiful Hoosier from Indiana.</span> <span id="s693">They moved here because Dick found work here, at the Book Plate Company where he is now the chief of the entire machine department.</span> <span id="s694">He is in charge of all the machines there and very happy with his work.</span> <span id="s695">Our daughter got a degree from Hunter College, and got a teacher’s license in Ohio.</span> <span id="s696">She is now teaching at the Antioch School and in the Xenia school system.</span> <span id="s697">We have six grandchildren, one of whom is married and has a little baby who is now a few months old.</span> <span id="s698">However this grandson is in Denmark.</span> <span id="s699">All the others, live in the U.S.</span> <span id="s700">What else do you want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: I think that you have done a remarkable job in telling us where you are now.</span> <span id="s702">I guess that the question which will come up is how you reestablished yourself and did such a remarkable transference when you came to this country.</span> <span id="s703">Maybe we should just leave that.</span> <span id="s704">If going back is not too difficult for you could you please identify yourself in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: It is not difficult at all.</span> <span id="s706">When I came from my courses at the University of Heidelberg in 1921 I got the offer of a job immediately with the Oberraht der Israeliten.</span> <span id="s707">This means with the highest organization of Jews in the State of Baden.</span> <span id="s708">They had been looking for a male lawyer, however since they couldn’t find one, they took a female economist.</span> <span id="s709">I worked there until I got married, that was in 1925.</span> <span id="s710">I had a very interesting and a very good job and I was very happy in it, because I really build it up as well build it out.</span> <span id="s711">It had been neglected for many years and I had the possibility to really organize it.</span> <span id="s712">It was very funny.</span> <span id="s713">I met one of my father’s friends one day on the street, after I had been at my job for about six months.</span> <span id="s714">We had a little newspaper which I edited, in connection with my job.</span> <span id="s715">When he met me he said: “I don’t know the Dr. Ebert who works in your office, really seems to know his things.</span> <span id="s716">I never met him!”</span> <span id="s717">I laughed and said: “He is standing in front of you!”</span> <span id="s718">He said “What?</span> <span id="s719">You?”</span> <span id="s720">I said: “Yes!</span> <span id="s721">I am the Dr. Ebert.”</span> <span id="s722">So, I guess, I really did something for our community.</span> <span id="s723">I was charged with the welfare of about 50,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s724">One thing which was beautiful was that we were absolutely equal to the other religions.</span> <span id="s725">The money for the upkeep of our organization was collected with the state income tax (the same way as for the upkeep of churches and synagogues and their staffing).</span> <span id="s726">Ten per cent of the tax receipt went to the different religions.</span> <span id="s727">The Jewish income was treated exactly as any other.</span> <span id="s728">There was no discrimination, in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: If I can interrupt you now.</span> <span id="s730">I guess the question which so many people would ask is: “Officially German Jews were given equality with other Germans with the Weimar Republic?”</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: No!</span> <span id="s732">That equality existed since 1850.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: But that was only in parts of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: But wasn’t the official…</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: No, that was in most of the states (Germany was a conglomeration of relatively independent Principalities, Dukedoms, Free Cities etc. until after WWI and that conglomeration persisted administratively pretty much until WW II).</span> <span id="s737">In January, 1870 or 1871, when the “unification came” it was for all states.</span> <span id="s738">It was one Reich!</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: My recollection is that it was taken back in certain areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Under the Weimar Constitution, it seems that it was made throughout Germany.</span> <span id="s742">Am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: No!</span> <span id="s744">You are not.</span> <span id="s745">It was already since the Unification of 1870/71, that all states looked not on any religion.</span> <span id="s746">People were Germans by nationality and Jews by religion.</span> <span id="s747">We were equal to all the other religions.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s749">Let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s750">I had not intended to go into this this deeply right now but, since we are here let us deal with questions which trouble me -- and I believe would trouble a lot of people.</span> <span id="s751">Did you feel any change after WWI?</span> <span id="s752">Did Jews feel different, as a result of the Weimar Republic?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: It was a continuous line (before and after the end of WWI).</span> <span id="s755">You did not feel suddenly accepted?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: No!</span> <span id="s757">No!</span> <span id="s758">It was absolutely the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: What about all the anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s760">OK.</span> <span id="s761">Let me ask this other question, which, again, troubles me, so that I can try to understand.</span> <span id="s762">You went to the University?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: For so long it seemed to me there were dominant strains of anti-Semitism in terms of writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: No!</span> <span id="s766">absolutely not.</span> <span id="s767">I can tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s768">My great grand uncle got his medical degree in Heidelberg in the 1840’s He was a doctor in Karlsruhe.</span> <span id="s769">There was no discrimination in any way.</span> <span id="s770">My grandfather who was a very, not orthodox but religious Jew was President of the city council in Karlsruhe, at the turn of the century.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Now where did you grow up?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: I grew up in Karlsruhe, in Baden, on the Rhine River, in the southern part of Germany.</span> <span id="s773">I have in my files -- I didn’t bring much with me -- but I have a letter where my great grandfather got his citizenship in 1813.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: I am not that sophisticated as to what was happening in different parts of Germany, in relationship to Jews, but would you say that that particular area was different from most parts of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: No!</span> <span id="s776">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Would you say, are you aware, that in this country that there are places which; are more comfortable to live in for certain groups than other groups?</span> <span id="s778">Would you say that you were in a “preferable place to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A; No, it was everywhere the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: You wouldn’t feel uncomfortable, let us say, moving to another part of the country because you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s782">Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: For example Blacks, for a long time, wouldn’t move to the South or so.</span> <span id="s784">But you don’t feel that, as a Jew…</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: No!</span> <span id="s786">Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: You did not feel that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: No.</span> <span id="s789">It was simply a religious question.</span> <span id="s790">Not a question of citizenship.</span> <span id="s791">We were absolutely equal!</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Maybe that is legally.</span> <span id="s793">How did one feel personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Absolutely equal.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: But, one was not that conscious of watching out for certain things?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: No.</span> <span id="s797">Not until Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s798">Our father was a very good Jew; he was President of the Chamber of Commerce of Baden.</span> <span id="s799">He was President of the Chamber of Commerce of Baden.</span> <span id="s800">He was on the board of the Reich’s Bahn (the German Railroad, which was a corporation administered by the Reich, i.e. by Germany) and on the Board of the German Radio, not just for the State of Baden.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: OK, if one could put you in a category, what kind of religious practices did you follow?</span> <span id="s802">Would you say the Liberal Jewish tradition?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Absolutely Liberal (the question indicates somewhat of a lack of knowledge of the questioner who seems to expect divisions of Jews in Germany to be patterned after divisions of Jews in the U.S., which was not the case).</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Liberal Jews!</span> <span id="s805">Was that the dominant group?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: In Karlsruhe, we had a Jewish community.</span> <span id="s807">We had two synagogues.</span> <span id="s808">We had a Liberal and an Orthodox one (actually that was graduated per practice not philosophy).</span> <span id="s809">The Orthodox numbered 500 and the liberal numbered 5,000 members.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Did you relate to the Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: You didn’t feel that they were beneath you, or someone not to be associated with.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s814">We were Germans.</span> <span id="s815">It shows you by the fact that my father was lieutenant and my uncle was also a lieutenant in the German army.</span> <span id="s816">They were promoted because they had done their duty as Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s818">When you were in the University, there were so many leading philosophers who were anti-Semitic in terms of their writings.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Not in the South.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: I mean in the reading in the universities how did the professors deal with it (presumably meaning anti-Semitism)?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Absolutely we were equal to anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: OK but, when you were studying let us say you took philosophy courses…</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Yes, I took philosophy courses.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Well could you read?</span> <span id="s825">Let me say, could you remember the German philosophers?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Oh, sure!</span> <span id="s827">We read them all.</span> <span id="s828">We read the anti-Semitic ones, with the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: OK, how did your professors deal with that aspect?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: They looked at it as something funny.</span> <span id="s831">They didn’t take that seriously.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: How many Jewish professors were there.</span> <span id="s833">I don’t mean number wise, but would you way that their number was sizeable?</span> <span id="s834">Were they influential?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Influential and sizeable and absolutely not looked at as Jews.</span> <span id="s836">They were looked at as scientists.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Were you consciously aware of anti-Semitic professors?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: No!</span> <span id="s839">No.</span> <span id="s840">Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Because when Hitler came to power ,the universities seemed to be sources of anti-Semitism already.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: No.</span> <span id="s843">They were not so.</span> <span id="s844">It was the lowest grade of people who were for Hitler first.</span> <span id="s845">Afterwards they had all to follow the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s847">Again I can only go by what I read, and what I learned from what I read was that because of the unemployment situation, a lot of the younger students at the universities were very attracted to Hitler because they had no jobs , or for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s848">And that the university was a source (of anti-Semitism).</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: The question in Germany was not the unemployment at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Of course you wouldn’t know about this post WWI feeling.</span> <span id="s851">When did you graduate from the university?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: In 1921.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: In 1921.</span> <span id="s854">OK.</span> <span id="s855">That would have been different then.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Later on my father was on the Board of Trustees for the Karlsruhe Technical Institute, that was in the late twenties, and it lasted until Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s857">Then one of the other trustees came and said: “Mr. Elsace I am afraid you have to resign.</span> <span id="s858">We are not allowed to have Jews on our Board of Trustees anymore.”</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: That was when, in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Yes, in 1933 or ’34.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: What about the period -- as I do my readings -- more and more articles said that it didn’t happen overnight in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: it came since 1923.</span> <span id="s863">Then there was the hyperinflation in Germany.</span> <span id="s864">However it was only a very small proportion, especially in Baden.</span> <span id="s865">There they were pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: How were things in the twenties?</span> <span id="s867">Was there a dominant strain of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: From what I read there were two kinds of people.</span> <span id="s870">On the one hand there were the Liberals, the social Democrats you may call them politically; and on the other hand there were the…</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: You must have read only a very small part of the literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: I am sure that I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: That is so because I lived in it and we never felt anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s874">I can give you a small example: In 1932, the President of the Chamber of Commerce in Karlsruhe died.</span> <span id="s875">The Director came and asked my father to take over.</span> <span id="s876">In Jan 1933, he asked again: “Mr. Elsace ,wouldn’t you run for the Presidency?”</span> <span id="s877">Father very reluctantly agreed.</span> <span id="s878">On the first of February he came and said “Mr. Elsace I am sorry that I have to tell you that we have to ask you to resign, only because you are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s879">That is a small example.</span> <span id="s880">We were not looked at as Jews, we were looked at as citizens of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s882">This is difficult to answer, but we all, wherever we are deal within our own circle.</span> <span id="s883">For example in Yellow Springs there is a certain point of view and we tend to think that that is the point of view of the world; however when we step outside of Yellow Springs we discover that we really are a minority.</span> <span id="s884">Do you think that possibly your feelings, the fact that you didn’t feel anti-Semitism, maybe because you were surrounded by your own class of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: That you were really very isolated?</span> <span id="s887">That you didn’t feel what went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s889">We were not isolated.</span> <span id="s890">A little example; the first of January -- New Year’s Day was always the big celebration in the capitol of Baden.</span> <span id="s891">My parents had seats for the celebration at the first table.</span> <span id="s892">As always we had tickets for that table also and we didn’t want to go so we gave them to Paul’s brother.</span> <span id="s893">We said: “Oh, we can go next year!”</span> <span id="s894">That was simply natural; we were Germans, we were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s895">We were well situated and pretty well kept German people.</span> <span id="s896">That changed the moment Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s897">I never felt any anti-Semitism at all, either at the university or in our daily life.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: OK, if you can follow these skips and jumps and pursue where we are, were you politically active?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q; In the late ‘20’s did you have any concern about someone like Hitler taking power?</span> <span id="s901">That anti-Semitism was on the rise?</span> <span id="s902">When did you begin to be concerned about anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: After Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Not before?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: No.</span> <span id="s906">The trouble in Germany was that there were lots of splinter parties.</span> <span id="s907">The Liberals were splintered into lots of parties.</span> <span id="s908">There was not one Democratic and one Republican Party.</span> <span id="s909">Hitler would never have come to power if they could have joined hands.</span> <span id="s910">They didn’t though; and that was really the one thing which brought Hitler to power.</span> <span id="s911">He had part of the young folks behind him, particularly the disillusioned, who didn’t get jobs or who couldn’t find work, or didn’t want to find work.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s913">When the election of 1932 took place, were you concerned at that time; were you working with some groups to make sure that Hitler would be defeated or weren’t you that concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: That was their concern, not ours.</span> <span id="s915">We always felt that it is ridiculous, or silly, to think that they can come to power.</span> <span id="s916">If Hitler wouldn’t have had the big help from people outside of Germany he never could have reached it.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s918">What were you doing in the 20’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: I was working until I got married.</span> <span id="s920">When I married I resigned after Hanna was on her way and I was a housewife.</span> <span id="s921">However I did lots of volunteer work.</span> <span id="s922">It was typical that either mother or father were serving on several boards.</span> <span id="s923">We were simply not asked; “Are you Jewish or Catholic or Protestant?”</span> <span id="s924">We were citizens and we did our share.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: If I may ask you again, if you can bear with me, for digressing here, I am jut curious about the 20’s, I know that there was an active feminist movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Could you just tell me a little about it.</span> <span id="s928">I am not certain that we can make it a Jewish issue, or maybe relate it possibly with the Jewish women being more active in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: No!</span> <span id="s930">All were active in it and I remember the first election after the Weimar Constitution.</span> <span id="s931">I then was secretary to Marianne Weber, the wife of Max Weber, the famous economist.</span> <span id="s932">She was the first woman in our state parliament.</span> <span id="s933">I was her Secretary and there was no question of whether I was Jewish or what else.</span> <span id="s934">I was a worker and I helped.</span> <span id="s935">There was no Jewish or non-Jewish work to be done; it was political work.</span> <span id="s936">Marianne Weber was a member of the equivalent of the League of Women Voters since 1900.</span> <span id="s937">We all worked toward getting equality.</span> <span id="s938">One of my aunts studied in Berlin in 1869 and 70, both as a woman and as a Jew.</span> <span id="s939">There just was no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: What is interesting is that when Hitler assumed power the entire feminist movement collapsed together with the other liberal trends.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: You are saying “No!”</span> <span id="s943">But how were the women so eager to embrace Hitler?</span> <span id="s944">Knowing that Hitler’s position was such.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: They did not embrace him, they simply followed.</span> <span id="s946">Germans are people who follow a leader.</span> <span id="s947">If it is a leader on the right or on the left, the German people just followed.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s949">So you were doing volunteer work in the 20’s.</span> <span id="s950">You say that the election in 32 was not treated differently than any other election.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Elections were not like here every four years.</span> <span id="s952">Elections came every time when the leading parties collapsed (that is standard for the “Parliamentary System” except that the interval between elections may not exceed a given number of years).</span> <span id="s953">We had an election in 1931.</span> <span id="s954">After that time, in our State, Hitler had a very small minority.</span> <span id="s955">Don’t forget that Germany was divided into States, which had made a “Union” in 1871 and each state had it’s own elections, besides the elections to the Reichstag (the All-German Parliament).</span> <span id="s956">The elections to the Reichstag were not due until 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Let me ask you something else: in the 20’s or even going back before then, what were your feelings, your family’s feelings about the Zionist movement?</span> <span id="s958">How did you feel toward Zionism?</span> <span id="s959">Did you have friends who were Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Yes, we had friends who were Zionists.</span> <span id="s961">But we all did not take Zionism very seriously.</span> <span id="s962">I can give you a little example.</span> <span id="s963">My father had a big export business and in 1925 we had one branch in Palestine in either Jerusalem or Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s964">We also had one branch in London, one in Buenos Aires and one in Rio de Janeiro.</span> <span id="s965">My parents went to Palestine in the fall of 25 and were treated royally there and had big result.</span> <span id="s966">I never forgot when mother came home, how she laughed and said that she went to the “Mourning Wall’ (today this is called the “Wailing Wall”) on the day before Yom Kippur (the annual fast day for the Day of Atonement in the Jewish faith) and the guard came and said: “Madam, you have to leave, this place is only for Jews!”</span> <span id="s967">Mother said: “But I am Jewish!”</span> <span id="s968">The guard said: “you are German, yes, but Jewish of religion, so you can stay.”</span> <span id="s969">Mother looked absolutely “un-Jewish”.</span> <span id="s970">We always laughed about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Did you have friends who were Zionists at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Did you argue a great deal about Zionism?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: No.</span> <span id="s975">we ignored it.</span> <span id="s976">We felt that if there would be a Jewish state in Palestine which had been promised already I think in 1922 (the Balfour Declaration’ which advocated a Jewish state in Palestine was actually issued in 1917 in London) but it started as a British Mandate (by the treaty dismembering Turkey at the end of WWI).</span> <span id="s977">We were glad that people could go there but we never looked at it as a home state.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Could you see any parallel for example between Blacks in this country -- it is a little modified today -- that there are certain groups who say that they want to have their own state in Africa.</span> <span id="s979">That people want to go back to Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: But most Blacks laugh at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Would you say that the Jewish experience was not the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: We were Germans.</span> <span id="s985">Both families were Germans.</span> <span id="s986">My father’s family got the house in Ludwigsburg in 1706 (it was identified as 1708 earlier) and my mother’s family got the house in Karlsruhe in 1711 (again there’s a slip of one year).</span> <span id="s987">Paul’s family went back to 1648 in the same house in Bingen am Rhein.What else had we been except Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: OK, rather than go back to your experiences which Bob Friedman recorded, let us deal with your daughter now, with the kind of education she had.</span> <span id="s989">How old was she in the 20’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: She was 13, when we came to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: So let’s see, when was she born?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: In 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: She was born in 1926, so, in those few years did she enroll in a Jewish school?</span> <span id="s994">In a German school?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: She was in a German Kindergarten and in a German school until 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: What was her Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: No Jewish education.</span> <span id="s999">As a liberal Jew what did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: It was up to us what we did with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: What did you do with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: She went with us to the synagogue, and she learned a little Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1003">She used prayers and everything, but that was only a little sideline to her German education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: And socially, I mean where you lived, what was the street like, in the idea as to who was living next door.</span> <span id="s1005">Was it a Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s1008">Where did you live exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: In Hirschstrasse No 39 in Karlsruhe.</span> <span id="s1010">We never had any Jewish neighbors nor any questions about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Did you own your own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Could you describe the street, let’s say.</span> <span id="s1014">What did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: It was a very bourgeois street.</span> <span id="s1016">Across the street from us lived an old family.</span> <span id="s1017">The father of the family was a doctor.</span> <span id="s1018">He died.</span> <span id="s1019">The mother was living with her daughter who was a classmate of my mother’s.</span> <span id="s1020">It was typical that I had Hanna at home and she was overdue by four weeks when she was born.</span> <span id="s1021">The old lady came three days after Hanna was born and said “I know that you had your baby, because you didn’t put your beds out on the sixth”.</span> <span id="s1022">We always took all the things off the bed and put them into the window to air out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Now this woman was not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Naturally not.</span> <span id="s1025">There were no Jewish neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1027">How many houses were there on the street?</span> <span id="s1028">I want to get a picture, let us recreate the atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: It was a street like Xenia Avenue (one of the major streets in Yellow Springs).</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: So that is a long street.</span> <span id="s1031">Quite a few houses and you were the only Jews on this street, as far as you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Nobody knew what we were.</span> <span id="s1033">We just lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: There might have been other Jews, but you didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: There were not?</span> <span id="s1037">How did you know then?</span> <span id="s1038">You knew later on, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Later on, but not then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: But not then and you didn’t think much about it?</span> <span id="s1041">That is amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: It may be typical that we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1043">We rented the apartment from a doctor’s family who had moved away, and after I saw the book of Karlsruhe last January I wrote to the photographer who had taken all the photographs of Hanna and us.</span> <span id="s1044">That is wedding pictures, everything.</span> <span id="s1045">I wrote to him and told him that I saw this book at a family here in town, he comes from Karlsruhe too.</span> <span id="s1046">I wrote to him that we came out of Germany but that we didn’t bring any pictures or anything with us, we only got ourselves out and I asked him if he had, by any chance the negatives.</span> <span id="s1047">Two weeks later came lovely letter from his wife saying how glad they were that we are alive, that they have all the negatives and that they would print them for us.</span> <span id="s1048">She put it in the Karlsruhe paper.</span> <span id="s1049">I received letters.</span> <span id="s1050">You can’t imagine how many letters I got from old friends, all of them non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1051">One of these friends goes back to 1904.</span> <span id="s1052">This friend writes now regularly and I do the same.</span> <span id="s1053">It didn’t make any difference whether you were Jewish or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: OK, you lived on this street, I am trying to recreate your life, what it was like, and you had your volunteer activities.</span> <span id="s1055">Your close associates, your close friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Were not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Your close friends were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1058">Were you close friends with your neighbors?</span> <span id="s1059">Or were they just neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: We were in very good terms with all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: You had dinner parties at which your next door neighbors were guests?</span> <span id="s1062">Were there people your age who had young children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Yes, until Hitler came to power, that didn’t make any difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Was there any discussion ,politically oriented discussions, during those years Hitler was on the rise, before 1932?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: When Hitler became active part of them no longer wanted to be friends with us.</span> <span id="s1066">In particular not if they had any business with the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Now when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: After 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: But, before then did you ever discuss politics at dinner parties?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: We never discussed politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Is that typical that you did not discuss politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: We had our political views and we talked about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: You mean at the dinner table?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: …but we never talked about Hitler, because we never thought that he would come to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: It is Oct. 8, 1979 and I am concluding my interview with Mrs. Margaret Ebert.</span> <span id="s1076">Today is Oct. 8, 1979 and once again we are in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ebert.</span> <span id="s1077">This afternoon I, Barbara Turoff, am concluding interviews which were begun some six months ago by Bob Friedman.</span> <span id="s1078">First, Mrs. Ebert, let me thank you for your patience.</span> <span id="s1079">It has been a long, drawn out process .</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: It was not your fault.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Well, we appreciate the cooperation.</span> <span id="s1082">I let you listen to the interviews which you had with Bob Friedman.</span> <span id="s1083">I just wondered if you wish to add anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: I listened to them and they can just stand as they are,</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: OK, let me then see where we go with what I had.</span> <span id="s1086">I listened to the interview which I had with you and we had to stop in the middle (of an idea).</span> <span id="s1087">We were just talking about politics before Hitler took power.</span> <span id="s1088">You made the comment that, with friends, politics wasn’t discussed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: It was not discussed after Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s1090">Before Hitler came to power, the political discussions were very interesting.</span> <span id="s1091">We had, I think.</span> <span id="s1092">12 parties in Germany, or maybe there were 13, splinter parties.</span> <span id="s1093">We had the proportional voting system so that each party, or splinter party, got representation according to their percentage in the vote.</span> <span id="s1094">We belonged to the Democratic Party which had three or four representatives in the Reichstag.</span> <span id="s1095">We tried very hard to get more, but there were so many splinter parties that we had to have an accord to work together.</span> <span id="s1096">The Bourgeois parties worked together, mostly with the Social Democrats.</span> <span id="s1097">The one big party, especially in southern Germany, was the Centrum, which was a Catholic party.</span> <span id="s1098">In southern Germany, part of Baden and all of Bavaria were mostly Catholic.</span> <span id="s1099">You know that there was a big Centrum party and we all joined it with our parties to get our representatives together.</span> <span id="s1100">You know that in Germany there was a rule that “Is ragio is religio”, which means that whoever reigns had a right to force every one of his subjects to adopt his religion.</span> <span id="s1101">Because of that, the southern part i.e. part of Baden and Bavaria were Catholic.</span> <span id="s1102">Wurtenberg which is located in between was all Protestant.</span> <span id="s1103">So the Jews, in all these countries, especially in Baden got the voting right in 1810.</span> <span id="s1104">That was very early (it was the influence of the French Revolution which controlled the Rhine valley).</span> <span id="s1105">I have in my possession, a document -- one of the few things, which I have -- that my great grandfather became a citizen, in 1824 or 25.</span> <span id="s1106">That was a big thing and later on, when it wasn’t necessary anymore to have the religion of the reigning sovereign (Germany until the Weimar Constitution was adopted, had a number of hereditary kings, princes etc. each having his sovereignty) they still stuck to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Throughout the interviews that I was listening to, that is Bob Friedman’s and mine your allegiance, your thoughts, of yourself, were German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1109">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: And your Jewishness was…</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Your religion, yet, you were not really religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: I was not Orthodox within my religion, however we were liberal.</span> <span id="s1114">In Karlsruhe, where I grew up, there were two (Jewish) communities: one were the Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1115">The liberals were 5,000.</span> <span id="s1116">The Orthodox stick to all the religious regulations and all the dietary regulations.</span> <span id="s1117">The liberals kept what they wanted to keep but it wasn’t very much.</span> <span id="s1118">We did not keep a kosher household.</span> <span id="s1119">We went to the synagogue on the High Holy days.</span> <span id="s1120">I didn’t go (to synagogue) every Saturday, neither did my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Let me ask you this: after Hitler came to power and after the Nuremberg Laws etc. obviously you couldn’t think of yourself as being a German first, or a German at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: It is very hard to change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: I was going to say: “Did you then think of yourself first and foremost as a Jew?</span> <span id="s1124">Did you not think of yourself did you feel “identiless”?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: No.</span> <span id="s1126">no.</span> <span id="s1127">we felt that this madman will lose his power sometime and we will be back as Germans.</span> <span id="s1128">We were really blind in this respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: When did it change?</span> <span id="s1130">Did it change when you came to the U.S., or before that as a gradual process?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: No, it changed when we became stateless.</span> <span id="s1132">Our statehood was taken from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: What did you feel then?</span> <span id="s1134">Did you feel mostly Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Lost.</span> <span id="s1136">Absolutely lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Jewish by religion, but still not as a strong identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: No!</span> <span id="s1139">absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1140">However I was glad when we got our U.S. citizenship.</span> <span id="s1141">We applied for that as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s1142">We could apply for citizenship after five years and we got it after five and-a-half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: While you were still in Germany and you were rooted from what was going on in Germany, the German Culture, you might say, there was a Jewish Culture -- there was some theater and such.</span> <span id="s1144">Did you suddenly become very interested in Jewishness?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Yes, we became very interested in Jewish plays, in Jewish concerts, Jewish writers, Jewish conductors, Jewish composers.</span> <span id="s1146">That was because we felt that we at least have some cultural ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Did it take the place of, or did you still feel very lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: It did not supplant the German identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: No, it couldn’t, because you can’t lose the identity you grow up with, and in which your family lived for hundreds of years.</span> <span id="s1151">Don’t forget that our families lived in the same houses for such a long time, so that we simply didn’t feel that we could lose everything.</span> <span id="s1152">We were blind in every respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Let us jump in time for a moment!</span> <span id="s1154">As of today do you feel that you are an American first or Jewish.</span> <span id="s1155">Do you still feel that loss?</span> <span id="s1156">Have you been able to work it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: No!</span> <span id="s1158">Absolutely!</span> <span id="s1159">I am an American and I am happy and glad when I hear good German music or when I can go to one of the plays in English -- but plays of German origin.</span> <span id="s1160">I feel absolutely as an American citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Your grandchildren, they are Americans, they were born in this country, what is their association with Jewishness.</span> <span id="s1162">Are they Americans first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1164">We joined the Quakers, the Friends, when we arrived in Yellow Springs.</span> <span id="s1165">Our grandchildren belong to the Quaker meetings here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Do you feel that what happened in Germany has a real possibility of happening here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: I doubt it, because you always have to think that America is a conglomeration of so many nations and creeds and races.</span> <span id="s1168">I don’t think that anybody can come to power like Hitler.</span> <span id="s1169">And another thing: the Americans are much more independent.</span> <span id="s1170">The Germans always needed either a sovereign or leader -- a Fuhrer.</span> <span id="s1171">I always felt that they are, in this respect, like animals who need their leading animal.</span> <span id="s1172">In the U.S., that is impossible.</span> <span id="s1173">There are much too many different cultures and creeds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: I am certain that you have thought about this: what could you learn from what happened?</span> <span id="s1175">How things might have been different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1178">As a result of what happened, are you concerned that your grandchildren are primarily American and that their Jewishness is subordinate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Don’t forget that our son-in-law is gentile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: However in Germany, again, people whose families were half and half counted as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: But the ones who were not Jewish, that is not more than 1/8 Jewish were considered gentiles.</span> <span id="s1182">If someone had only a great grandmother or great grandfather who were Jewish, they were considered as Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Speaking about your son-in-law, something which you had said earlier -- and I did not want to interrupt you at the time -- you mentioned that he was a pacifist.</span> <span id="s1184">Was that at all upsetting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: No!</span> <span id="s1186">In the contrary.</span> <span id="s1187">I feel, the more I think about it, the better it is to be a pacifist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: But at the time he was a pacifist, that was during WWII.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: It was very courageous to show where he stands.</span> <span id="s1190">He did not avoid the civil service (she means non-military equivalent duty to military service) he was as a conscientious objector a firefighter in Oregon and then guinea pig for malaria research in New York.</span> <span id="s1191">He gave his time and activity to the state.</span> <span id="s1192">He just didn’t take up arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: At that time, however, if the majority of people had taken that position that would have been quite a different set of circumstances, in terms of dealing with the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Maybe, it would have kept us out of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: But that would not have solved the Nazi problem in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1197">I feel that France, England, Turkey, Italy, they all were against Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: But were they strong enough!</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1200">I feel that they would have been strong enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: You feel that they could have defeated the Nazi without the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1203">Yes.</span> <span id="s1204">I mean that the U.S. entered the war pretty late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: But very crucially.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: At a crucial time, but I feel that it was good to have the U.S. in.</span> <span id="s1207">I am not a separatist like many people are, but I felt that as long as the U.S. only sent money and men they don’t know what war means.</span> <span id="s1208">I am glad they don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: In line with your support of pacifism at this point, Israel takes a different kind of position.</span> <span id="s1210">How do you feel about Israel, what is your attitude towards Israel -- of their militant position?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: I think that it is admirable what Israel does.</span> <span id="s1212">It is beautiful, how they keep their own and how they keep their strength.</span> <span id="s1213">But, maybe, if they wouldn’t be so very militaristic.</span> <span id="s1214">Maybe they could have peace in the Middle East.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Specifically, are you referring to the Palestinian issue, to Lebanon, what do your views include?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: I felt very very happy when Sadat went to Israel and they tried to get peace at least with one country.</span> <span id="s1217">I feel now that all should try to get peace there, and not be Zionists in the sense that we want only Israel to have the power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: I view of all Jewish past experience, you still feel that the Jews should be much more compromising?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: I feel that -- that they should.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: If they are compromising they might lose the little they have to bargain with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A; No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1222">If they would compromise in the real sense of the word.</span> <span id="s1223">I feel that the more they work for peace, and the more they help Sadat and the other countries who are inclined toward them, the more they will have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: If we can go back a minute to what happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s1225">At first as accommodation was tried with Hitler and it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1226">That was Munich.</span> <span id="s1227">We got the feeling, if we work this out maybe we will get by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Hitler was a madman.</span> <span id="s1229">He was absolutely sick, and if anybody else would have had the courage to stand up against him, it would have been different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: But you say that the Arab-Israeli situation is very different kind of situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1232">Absolutely different from what it was with Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: This interview is kind of jumping back and forth, but I did not want to interrupt where we were going.</span> <span id="s1234">Going back once more to your experience of assisting people to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1235">When people still had a chance to select to go where they wanted to go, where did most people want to go?</span> <span id="s1236">Or could one make an assumption.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Oh, please!</span> <span id="s1238">Turn this off.</span> <span id="s1239">We didn’t have a choice!</span> <span id="s1240">Because the U.S. had the quota system.</span> <span id="s1241">People in Australia started to look how far it could go when it was too late.</span> <span id="s1242">Where should they have gone?</span> <span id="s1243">(Visas to countries like Cuba, Panama, China -- with entrance specified as Shanghai written in Chinese, “jokingly” translated to read “this visa is not to be used for entrance!”</span> <span id="s1244">were available to be purchased with no certainty of admission to these countries, if one ever actually got there --– see the story of the SS St. Louis)</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: What about Palestine?</span> <span id="s1246">Do you know much about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Palestine also had a very strong quota system (the number of people over 18 being admitted was controlled by the British in line with agreements with the Arabs specifically after the massacre of Jews culminating in 1936).</span> <span id="s1248">It was a particularly strong system in terms of money.</span> <span id="s1249">Nobody could go there without money (excepting only young children).</span> <span id="s1250">The German Jews didn’t have money anymore at all (after the confiscatory tax levied after the assassination of Embassy Counselor Von Radt and the Kristallnacht of 1938).</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: If I were to ask you, if it can be asked: what stands out in your mind about your experience in assisting people at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: The feeling of helplessness.</span> <span id="s1253">I felt really terribly frustrated because, wherever you turned, you got a “No!”</span> <span id="s1254">.</span> <span id="s1255">As I said in the beginning: “If the U.S. would not have had the quota system (the quota by nationality of the birthplace were set up by the Immigration Laws of 1921, revised 1927) it could have saved millions of lives”.</span> <span id="s1256">Because if people had had the possibility to come to other countries all would have taken the possibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Do you remember any special bargaining to get anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: There was no bargaining.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: I mean in terms of any sort of deals which you could have made?</span> <span id="s1260">I mean we are always seeking ways in which you could have done this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: We looked everywhere.</span> <span id="s1262">We searched and searched and searched and all the doors were closed.</span> <span id="s1263">Most of the people had some relatives or friends in the U.S., so that is where we concentrated.</span> <span id="s1264">If they could have come they would have loved to leave without anything except maybe their little personal belongings.</span> <span id="s1265">But, there was a quota number!</span> <span id="s1266">I can give you an example: we had the number “1850” (there was one number per family; the number was reported as being 1050 earlier) and 300 were allowed into the country yearly.</span> <span id="s1267">So we had expected to wait for six or seven years.</span> <span id="s1268">We were lucky that it went faster because many people did not use their numbers (some of the reasons for not using the numbers were death of the applicant or failure to be able to obtain an “adequate” affidavit of support).</span> <span id="s1269">We just came at the last possible moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: So, it wasn’t primarily that the Nazi didn’t let you out for a long time, it was just that there was no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: The Nazi’s were glad about the number of Jews who left.</span> <span id="s1272">They took all the money and belongings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Did that stop at ant point?</span> <span id="s1274">such as after 1940?</span> <span id="s1275">Even after 40 you could have left if there was a place to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: Yes, sure!</span> <span id="s1277">My sister-in-law was taken to the concentration camp at Gurs in southern France (after France fell in 1940).</span> <span id="s1278">People who were there could come out if the U.S. (or any other country) let them come in.</span> <span id="s1279">You had to deposit one thousand dollars to get one person out.</span> <span id="s1280">However who had one thousand dollars?</span> <span id="s1281">We were lucky enough, together with my brother-in-law to get that money together.</span> <span id="s1282">I never forget my ride in the subway in NY with a thousand dollar bill in my brassiere to make the deposit so that she could come out0.</span> <span id="s1283">There were many people in the same position (of having to bail relatives out) because the U.S. after 1940 was, in many ways, very cooperative to allow people still to come in.</span> <span id="s1284">(the quota numbers “opened up” after the Germans did overrun the Low countries, France, Norway, Denmark because so many applicants could not avail themselves of their numbers -- they “disappeared”).</span> <span id="s1285">We saved the life of my sister-in-law and several cousins who came on the same boat.</span> <span id="s1286">However this is passed!</span> <span id="s1287">It doesn’t help anymore to talk or think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: The tape will be running out soon so let me ask you two final questions.</span> <span id="s1289">One is that I am sure that, in addition to everybody who will listen to these interviews you, specifically want your grandchildren to listen.</span> <span id="s1290">What would you like to tell them?</span> <span id="s1291">What specifically do you want to leave them with?</span> <span id="s1292">I know that you said so much but is there some specific wisdom you want to leave them with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: The only thing which I can say is: “Try to be a good citizen, wherever you live.</span> <span id="s1294">Stick to your principles and reasons for being either a pacifist or a militarist, but stick to it and fight for it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: The last question ties into this is that I have so much admiration for you.</span> <span id="s1296">You are aged and yet you are young, you have youth.</span> <span id="s1297">You are a young 80.</span> <span id="s1298">To what do you attribute that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: That I have been keeping active, and that I do whatever I can to use my old profession to help.</span> <span id="s1300">I am now pretty much concerned with work in the community and I try to keep active as long as I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Did you feel all along that you would get out of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: You didn’t?</span> <span id="s1304">You didn’t have the belief that you would get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: No, it was like a dream that we came out.</span> <span id="s1306">Paul was in Scotland and we met in NY, after one year of separation.</span> <span id="s1307">That was the biggest thing in my life that we came together again.</span> <span id="s1308">We never expected to be settled somewhere again as we are here in Yellow Springs.</span> <span id="s1309">I am glad that we moved from NY here and have roots again.</span> <span id="s1310">Not only roots in going upwards with our grandchildren, but roots in Yellow Springs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Do you believe that everyone’s prime loyalty should be to their country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1313">Absolutely!</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: That is loyalty to their country, before their religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Absolutely because religion is something for everyone to pick for themselves and by themselves, however loyalty to the country ought to be something which everyone should show.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: So, in spite of your experience you still feel loyalty?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Yes, absolutely!</span> <span id="s1318">I never looked at Israel as citizenship.</span> <span id="s1319">I looked at it like religion.</span> <span id="s1320">I admire everyone who lives in Israel, and keeps it safe.</span> <span id="s1321">I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1322">I am very glad and happy in the U.S. I admire my cousins who live in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1324">It has been my experience and I am sure that everyone who listens will really appreciate what you have done for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1326">I did it because I felt that it is my duty to do it and also my pleasure because I feel that it should be preserved in some way.</span></p></body></html>
