Q. Why were you all involved with this party?
A. We had a so called democratic party. It was mostly creation and so socialists and other combinations and we were --

A. We were Austrian born, and the time before World II, after World I, Austria had 76 million population and she lost everything. She lost part of ________________ Czechoslovakia, Hungary, it was Hungarian Austrian monarchy.

Usually __________________ what was taught in his time, if you want to deceive your enemy tell him the truth because any way he doesn't believe you. So, the people didn't believe what Hitler thought. I know many Jews in Germany, they were more German than Germans themselves, but they didn't believe what Hitler was going to do. That was the problem.
Q. So, the people that lived near you didn't think it was going to be a problem?
A. Oh, yes, we thought. Not only did we have problems with Yugoslavia, that time after their King Alexander was assassinated in Marseilles, his son was not juvenile and he was declared as king, but since he was not 18 he get three people as advisors. Prince Paul and from the Creation one I don't remember the name now, and from the Slovanian, the three people directed him. One part of Austria would remain Yugoslavia, was tied to the _____________ signed the __________ agreement. So did Yugoslavia. That was not for the British and the other people against Hitler French.

Q. Was the country unanimous in opposing Hitler?
A. Oh, yes. Some people, for example, when Prince Paul --- his brother son to become king. He was in contact with the Italians and there was in following of Hitler. He told his son to avoid the war, to sign the papers _______________ British and stuff like that.

Q. Was this a very organized movement?
A. Yes, in the beginning it was organized. We had good contact with the British and they were supporting but not regularly. So we had to -- we was left with the Yugoslavian arms and that stuff. When Hitler came to Yugoslavia the communists were good friends so they had contact with Hitler. The communists told us that Hitler was going to show how to build socialism, so we should join Hitler. When Hitler then came in '41 later on before he went against the Soviet Union, when he hanged a couple of them in __________ they then start to run to organize the communist movement. We had not much communist so it was when Hitler marched in. Criminals somehow were released or escaped.

We organized and get -- I mean it was before the Germans come. So, we tried somehow to infiltrate to get what information what he was bragging about. Q. So, you actually got help from German people?
A. Not really, we didn't get from German any help.
Q. These people you're talking about?
A. That was personal friends. It had nothing to do with the organization. They didn't know what I think. The Germans therefore I was arrested so I mean, even they didn't trust the ___________, the native group. The Germans didn't trust many people. The Germans we didn't have -- we had a meeting or conference, we didn't never.
Q. So, how long were you doing this, organizing?
A. It was not long. I mean it was starting in '41 and I was then arrested in March '42 so it was not long.
Q. How did you get arrested, tell me about that?
A. I was coming from Italy and I had a friend, I forgot his ________, he was by the _______________, regular army. He was somehow given that information and he hate Hitler. So, his daughter was girlfriend for gestapo men and she betrayed them. So, she told them ________________. So, since he was a German citizen there was ______________ executed.

Later on my father is friends to the Yugoslavian police and the commander was the ________________, he was somehow sympathetic to the marxists, he did not like Hitler. It was '43 he committed suicide when he was called to Berlin. So, he sent me to Dachau, illegal. I was sentenced in the books for the gestapo I was executed, but he sent me to a concentration camp so I had that penalty. But I was mad because that penalty was better than the concentration camp.
Q. Now, I don't want to stop you but I have a question. What was life like in Yugoslavia in this period in Belgrade under the Germans? What was happening? I'm just trying to get a sense --?
A. _________________ you have to follow the laws and any sabotage any stuff they took from the city where it was endangered, they took hostage.

Q. What I'm trying to understand is, is did life go on as normal? Were people frightened by the situation?
A. Not much frightened -- you were frightened rather from the communist, the situation, but the Germans never took time to go to the country. They were watching the main routes to Greece to ___________ down there but you did not see them too much in the country.
Q. When you were involved with the resistance, were you personally aware of acts of sabotage?
A. Yes, we did not kill them but we stopped the British, stop the trains. _________________, and stuff.
Q. What stuff?
A. War material like ammunition and grenades. That was the main business. To stop them not to come a time when you spring the railroad track they come to take some time to repair, to come forward or you blow the train. It's not so easy to go forward. But they had so called _________ a special command to punish the population after this. All the area, when something happened, all fled the place. This was not pleasant to do such stuff, but we did.
Q. Were you personally involved in trying to stall the trains?
A. Oh, yes.
Q. You?
A. People, not necessarily myself.
Q. I want to know about you, yourself?
A. Me, myself, I did too, but you cannot do it by yourself. You have to have some group with you and we did.
Q. You had a group?
A. Yes.
Q. And you worked on stalling the trains?
A. Yes. One day I was to go somewhere else and it was 40 and I had to cross the railroad and the _____________ were in the bunkers watching the bridges. I saw some light.

Q. What other specific acts did you do for the resistance?
A. _________________. We first organized and took on the people to save them to organize companies to organize units. To provide information, front information and stuff like that. We had ________________ that's been illegal newspaper for information about front and situation and such stuff. It was meetings. You organized and everybody knows what they're doing and what they get to do.
Q. How did you get information?
A. We had radios, we had stuff. We listened to the BBC. It was not the voice of America, it was a different kind. So, we got from Switzerland.
Q. Was there a central meeting place?
A. No, some places we had to everybody with a radio with short waves and the radio was controlled by the Germans, but first they took the others, but you couldn't get it anyway. We got short waves and stuff. Many people are calling and they hid and they listened to this BBC or Switzerland. You get information and we had contact with ____________. So, you got from France. And Germany let you hear what they were bragging and so on.
Q. What kind of man was _______________?
A. Well, a very informed, political and stuff like this. We didn't trust British anyway so Britain thought if you were friend or enemy you get the same treatment. History, they tried Napoleon too. They are some like the Nazis, a little bit.
Q. So, are there any other examples you can remember of working with the resistance or should we move on?
A. There is not much to remember now. I was only a year or so with them.
Q. Any close calls for you? Any big risks you took?
A. If you walk through there you can be attacked by the communists. You have to live like a rabbit. To watch everything. It was, you get used to it and it's no big deal. You're young and you know what you want. You have to take precautions.
Q. What kind of precautions?
A. Precautions not to make mistake. You can't talk to -- we had special code words to talk like usually the organization is to talk, -- you can't talk to family or anybody.
Q. Did you see your family during this time?
A. Not much.
Q. Were you ever, other than that one time, were you ever caught or close to being caught?
A. Sometimes yes, I don't know what happened but the Germans went and blocked all the city and then everybody tried to get the military barracks and sometime some seems to me that they try us through the window, by passing the windows of the building. Then somebody with newspapers with holes, somebody was watching us but maybe I was lucky enough to be recognized or you get in trouble. For example, in Vienna, the gestapo didn't read the paper, and the guy sent me to the gestapo building. I went over there and I read this direction and I went out and didn't say anything.
Q. Were you afraid?
A. What can you be afraid? There is not much fear. If you are afraid you cannot think. You cannot be afraid. If you are afraid you stay home. That is the rule. You don't do it if you are afraid. Fear cannot be mixed with what you're doing. Somehow in split second you get, but you try to overcome and to survey the situation to take proper handling. Stuff you have to do.
Q. Did you ever have contact with the communists?
A. No, we'd kill each other, but I didn't have.
Q. I've done some reading and that's why I want to ask you this. Is my sense that the communists and the resistance army had different methods and had different goals?
A. Yes. We had two _______________ and the one I think was the rank. One was communists, the second one was ______________. The communists were almost trying to tell the tales of the Soviet Union and everything and they tried to do much as possible in killing the German soldiers to force the people to join them to create terror. For them there was something bigger so _______________ and so on and from the communists army this was terrible. They were worse than the Germans in many places. They were robbing from the people and take everything, money and food. The people mostly were afraid from the communists more than from the Germans in many places.
Q. Now, you figured out that it would be better to go to Dachau than to stay in prison?
A. Stay in prison, the penalty to be executed is better than to go to Dachau.
Q. So, what happened. Tell me about your going to Dachau?
A. Nothing. You were transported over there. You come before camp, you come to this quarantined barracks, blocks. And then after a couple weeks or 40 days you get registered. No, before you come there, you are staying in the snow and the rain and they give you the number. The transports bring in the ___________ and they establish the carts and then after this you go and are distributed to the blocks. In Dachau there were mostly after professionals and so, distribution. I come to an Austrian guy _____________, in block 16 and from that I was working with a Slovanian couple. We went to the ______________ , to the train on the railroad station. The couple was -- it was not -- with a black train. They were stealing the civilian -- as you go to work outside the camp in Mauthassen, in Dachau they give you civilian red paint and then later on I was working potato cell to peel the potatoes to sort them and to peel them. The guards, it was mostly this ____________ from Poland. They called a lot of Pollocks, the Germans, they so called ________________ where you put the core and you could fry the potato to eat. They didn't care too much. They took for themselves the potatoes. So, it was not something, not bad. Then in some walking across the street to plantation stuff, and many went to Sauxenhausen which was also a branch of Dachau. Then, there was one time I was no more drove outside camp. We were cleaning inside and then I don't know what for reason but 600 or so were transferred to Mauthaussen.
Q. Okay, let's talk a little more about Dachau? You were there for how long? What were the dates?
A. Almost one year.
Q. Do you remember the dates?
A. I came on November 5 in Dachau, 1942.
Q. And you left?
A. I left in October, end of October on a transport to Mauthaussen.
Q. In '43?
A. In '43, yes. I come also in November of '43, I don't remember the dates, to Mauthaussen. It was a terrible transport. We went from Dachau to Czechoslovakia. _______________ on the train that was not closed. The wagons were half _____________. It was snow and everything and we had to sleep on the floor in the wet. It took 14 days so we were staying a couple times and we come to Mauthaussen. I cannot remember the route.
Q. What was your impression of Dachau?
A. Organized pure political, best organized. I met many Austrians over there in block 4. The Czechs were kitchen personnel. It was not bad. Then you have to wash before you come -- same as Mauthaussen -- when you come to your block you have to wash first in your foot locker, and you have your meal or supper already. To your place, but you have to wash. You have to do, so it wasn't much to eat but discipline and not much terror from the SS inside the camp.
Q. The guards were okay?
A. Outside the guards were we had kapos to be the guards. The guards were washing us, so somehow we did it and not allowed to talk to us. The guard was different SS, not in camp, the block -- we had more difficulty with our kapos, with the person from he prison area in the camp.
Q. Why more difficulty?
A. Well, they were beating you. They were stealing your food. They were kicking you out to the work place. They didn't let you stay. You had to work outside camp, too. They keep you busy.
Q. These were German criminal prisoners?
A. Yes, as a political prisoner you could not get any position if you wanted. It was mostly criminal.
Q. Were there Jewish prisoners there?
A. In Dachau there was only one small guy that was cleaning the shoes for the SS. I don't know what happened to him later. First time Jews in Mauthaussen, Jews come 2,000 some. It was the last transport for the Jews and then in '45 they come from Auschwitz. As a Jew in Dachau and communist you could not survive. As a Jew or communist in Dachau they send you to Auschwitz or kill you there.
Q. While you were there, this happened?
A. Oh, yes. It was maybe some in the _________________ in the country, the role call -- when the work commander -- you had behind there there was the group, the small barrack. The shoe maker and so there was shops and behind them was the special section for the Jews. I do not know what happened to them, it was not much. We saw the yellow __________ and politically we had red. Criminals had green, homosexual had pink, the ____________ Jehovah and gypsies had blue.
Q. So there were Jewish prisoners there?
A. Yes, but not much. I did not have contact. They were isolated. What happened to them they send them to Auschwitz or destroyed over there.
Q. When you were working or had your appells in your barracks were you mixed with other prisoners or were you with only political prisoners?
A. We ______________ they brought special for the management, for the criminals. All of them were political or maybe the blue.
Q. I'm confused?
A. Blue triangle for the bible, so called gypsies or the Spanish. Spanish had good position, they were kitchen personnel.
Q. Did you say that the criminal prisoners and the political prisoners were the same?
A. No. The criminal were brought only for the management in the camp, for the kapos, or block ______________. The barrack was mostly Czechs that spoke German very well. Then it was criminal from the ______________ the main office ____________. This means they're for the camp and it was criminal. They were distributing them and organizing mostly criminals.
End of Tape 1
Tape 2
Q. We were talking about the different kinds of prisoners at Dachau and I'm wondering were you separated according to your type or did you work with people with different classifications.
A. With people who were French, I mean nobody your number and your name put you in the working group and you went to work.
Q. Did the political prisoners work with the POWs?
A. No. The POW was a different kind. It wasn't Geneva Convention, they were entitled to work but different procedure.
Q. Were some prisoners treated better than other prisoners?
A. I don't think so. I did not see. Maybe the homosexuals were treated better but the normal people, everybody the same.
Q. Did you come in contact with a lot of the homosexual prisoners?
A. No. It was not like it in the camp so they were isolated. They had all the good positions too. They were mostly musicians and stuff like this.
Q. Do you think the political prisoners were treated better than some of the other people?
A. No, this was wars. It was not different, we were all political except the camp personnel. It was from the instructions of the political department or gestapo. Many of them they get to go to the city. That was also different. In Germany I think the sentence required more than five years imprisonment they were executed, the death penalty it was. It was mostly, my kapo was a guy that stole a parcel in the post office. He was upstairs so that this should happening it means the end of the war. They were after the war to serve.
Q. Now, I remember reading that when you went to Dachau you were a clerk, in the administration?
A. No. I was not a clerk. A guy _____________, he was original in camp, a clerk and he saved my life. If I say I was an officer I could be executed. He said are you stupid. You say you are an employee. He changed my card. He saved my life. He was later on in the ______________, of Czechoslovakian decent. He saved my life. I was never in the office.
Q. What was an average day like?
A. You'd have to get up at 5:00 to wash, to get the coffee, not really coffee. It was from grain. If you are fast you get warm, if you're slow you get cold. That was morning. You had to go to roll call to get counted. Then, group formation. If you are attached to a working commander you have to join your kapo and then walk out. If you are not attached, they put you there and write your number and you work and you work until 6:00, 7:00, it depends, and then come back. We'd march, __________________. That was -- we had in Dachau Sunday was off and everybody was sitting somewhere preparing their stuff. You get wood down and in two weeks they were gone. ______________________, that was the daily life.
Q. When you came back from the fields, wherever you were working at 6:00 then what happened?
A. You had to wash yourself to get the sheets washed. They watched you shower, if you washed your face and head proper and you went inside to get your supper. It was in Mauthausen too. You had your food locker and it was already there you were sitting somewhere to eat.
Q. What did you eat?
A. You got this ________________ military bread, dry so it can stay ten years. Two pieces and they give you some margarine or some stuff. That was all, and some coffee. That was -- lunch you get some soup, some cabbage or beets or I don't know. It was mostly vegetable soup. You had to eat fast. You didn't have one hour or half hour. You had to eat and go to work. It was terrible. We stand under the tree, the slope, eating your soup. You cannot choose. I wasn't a big eater, so I'd save my lard so some people would have a piece of bread -- when they distributed the soup they left some of this in ________________ and you had to run to get this _______________ extra. Mostly the stuff they distributed they hit you with this spoon, it was not the kind of human. You see different kinds of people. What you learn in this civilization is the whole situation disappears, you are as you are born, animal. You see the animal behavior. It was terrible. For example, if you are the last and somebody fell down, you pick up the people in the front took care of him. They kill them on the way because they're hit and they didn't want to carry them because sometime you are weak too. They kill him before they brought them in the camp, so it was terrible. You see it was not too many relations because everybody wanted to save himself. Like _____________ says ________________________. It was not human. You tried to avoid everything and some people you can talk or communicated or you're thinking about past families and stuff. It was sad.
Q. Did you make any friend there? Did you have maybe a partner that you could help each other?
A. No, it was impossible because tomorrow you are taken to another commander or another barrack or the block. Not the kind you can deal with. I tried to be human with the people but not special relation.
Q. Did you have your own bed in the barracks?
A. We had three floors of bed. First, down there four, two heads are here and two heads are there. Second floor, the same. Third floor was three only. Two on one side and one. That was the beds. In Dachau, it was two peoples each but it depends on if there comes a new transport, the put in like sardines. This is you cannot change the positions. But anyway you are tired and sleep. Sometimes they were stealing their shoes. You cannot imagine. I read a book before I come to Dachau it was in the western something new, it was for the World War I. I forgot who wrote the book, in World War I. And the guy that escaped from Dachau went to Switzerland and he wrote about the concentration camp and it was something new, and there was a description of a Dachau book about concentration camp in Germany, and I could not imagine at all before I come in, you understand.
Q. Were there a lot of new transports coming in?
A. In Dachau they not come much, every three or four months. But Dachau keeps certain amounts of prisoners. I think they had 42,300 some and all the group, one group they said 42,000 sent to Mauthausen a year later, so they have -- I don't know how much they had to have and never exceed. I think it was before the SS decided to put the regime to work in the war industry and they took the ability in Austria, the industry facility, needed prisoners. The SS used them before they destroyed them. Dachau was only to work for the needs of the camp, industry stuff. We had to plant our own vegetables and take care of all the cleaning and stuff. Mauthaussen was the center. 80,000 prisoners came to Mauthaussen under different branches. Going to Mauthaussen was a different story. Mauthaussen was discipline too, so you get your food but you didn't stay long in Mauthaussen. I came in November I think. I was already in Christmas transport to _____________.
