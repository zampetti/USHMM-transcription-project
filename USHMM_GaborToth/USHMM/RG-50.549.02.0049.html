Let’s start with, y -- would you tell me your name a-as it was at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Frida Adler.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Frida Adler.</span> <span id="s30">And y -- where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I was born in Salatvina, which was at the time Czechoslovakia, Sep-September 14, 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s33">What -- You mentioned in your first interview that you moved to Belgium --</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: -- up -- a couple of years after you were born.</span> <span id="s36">Why did you family move from Czechoslovakia to Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s38">Children were not informed.</span> <span id="s39">I -- I -- Lot of -- There were a lot of immigration into Belgium to work the coal mines and the -- I think my father must have ended up in a steel factory.</span> <span id="s40">Why, exactly, I think -- I really don’t know, I mean, we never ask, we were never told, so I really don’t know what the reason was.</span> <span id="s41">But instead of coming to the States, we just -- we moved to Belgium, I guess.</span> <span id="s42">We went to Belgium on -- we arrived in Liège, Belgium, on May eight, 1929.</span> <span id="s43">I came to the States, landed in New York, on May eight, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Do you -- Do you do anything special on that date, or do you always remember when May eighth rolls around?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: I remember May eight, because the war started about that day.</span> <span id="s46">The Germans invaded Belgium.</span> <span id="s47">Yes, I remember May eight, because that’s when I lan -- I always remember May eight, when I landed in the State ands can’t forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Do you do anything to memoriali -- anything kind of -- do you have any kind of ritual that you do to memorialize that, or is it just something that you remember and keep [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: That just something I remember.</span> <span id="s50">No, I don’t do anything special, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s52">Had your family had a long history in Czechoslovakia, in Salatven-vena, before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: My grandparents came from Salitva, on both sides.</span> <span id="s54">Both my parents came from that city and all the f -- so far as I know, from both sides, mother and father, they both were from that town.</span> <span id="s55">I don’t know where they came from before, my son is trying to find ancestry and so far, on my father’s side, he can’t -- on the Adler, he cannot find anything.</span> <span id="s56">There are only four of us left on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s57">Two cousins in Belgium, one male, one female.</span> <span id="s58">One in Israel, he was born there, on my father’s youngest brother, and me in the States.</span> <span id="s59">On my mother’s side, there are quite a few cousins all over.</span> <span id="s60">One of them was in Equador, died about a year ago.</span> <span id="s61">Canada, the United States.</span> <span id="s62">They’re all over and I -- I didn’t know most of them, until I came to the States and then they came later than I did, but some in Israel, they’re about all over, on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s63">But no one seems to be able to tell me where we went back further.</span> <span id="s64">I tried to find out what my grandparents died of, but by the time it dawned on my to find out, all the people from that age -- from that era, were gone, so I have no idea.</span> <span id="s65">I think I was told my mother’s father, after World War One, develops wa -- wa -- I don’t know what kind of disease, diphtheria, whatever went around.</span> <span id="s66">I understand he worked for the railroad, that’s all I know.</span> <span id="s67">But we di -- we don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: What were your -- your parents names, and -- and what did they do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: My mother’s maiden name was Esaacovic, and she learned man’s tailoring when she was a young girl, that much I know.</span> <span id="s70">My father -- they were orphaned, they were both orphans when they were married.</span> <span id="s71">My father, I understand, came from a very poor family.</span> <span id="s72">There were seven children left, and they did the best they could, I guess, to support the children.</span> <span id="s73">Once you were poor, you were poor, I guess, there.</span> <span id="s74">And maybe that’s what brought them to -- you know, what -- that’s what made them -- wha -- to go to Belgium, and I -- he -- I know he lost his -- his job and I think he was in a stee -- in a -- a steel factory, because Belgium had that coal mines and steel factories.</span> <span id="s75">And then my -- what my mother did, she picked up the tailoring, but they -- she did it at home, and she did -- she worked for several tailors and made the pants.</span> <span id="s76">They cut and then we used to roll it up and bring it to the house, and -- and then eventually, she brought in somebody to help with the sewing, is the way -- and my father slowly did -- you know, yo-you iron with a -- with an iron that was heat -- that was heated.</span> <span id="s77">And he did the heavy work for her.</span> <span id="s78">And he eventually went into that, because after the war, that’s what he did.</span> <span id="s79">My father’s brother, one of the younger brother, also went to Belgium, and he was a tailor.</span> <span id="s80">And I guess he went into business after the war, to manufacture, instead of individual suits, that they went into manu -- quote, manufacturing, not to the -- to the extent that it was in the States, but that’s what they did is, they went into manufacturing men’s clothing, is what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So, your family was somewhat struggling financially, in those early years, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: As far back as I can remember.</span> <span id="s83">We didn’t feel it.</span> <span id="s84">I had wonderful parents, I -- they worked very hard, my mother worked very long hours and I remember wor -- I guess, during the -- what you call season, she worked very, very long hours, is -- is what I remember.</span> <span id="s85">We -- If w -- If they struggled financially, we didn’t get the brunt of it.</span> <span id="s86">I mean, I can’t place myself missing anything or -- or -- or being in need of anything.</span> <span id="s87">My father had a sister who did men’s shirts, you know, individual.</span> <span id="s88">All our clothes were made by dressmakers.</span> <span id="s89">The suits were made by my uncle, and she -- I remember my aunt did nightgowns for us.</span> <span id="s90">So, we were very well dressed, I don’t remember ever hav -- going hungry, so whatever they did, they provided for the children, we didn’t feel any need, or any loss, or -- or -- I don't recall anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: You mentioned the importance of their lo -- of your parents love and support for you, in helping you get through, after the war.</span> <span id="s92">What were their wishes for you, or what were their -- what do you think their goals were for you as --</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yeah, I didn’t want to -- I didn’t want to go to school.</span> <span id="s94">We didn’t have to go to high school, and I wanted dressmaking and dress designing, and they insisted that I get a high school diploma.</span> <span id="s95">So I was forced in going into high school.</span> <span id="s96">And in -- when the Germans invaded in 1940, they -- in Liège, I found out in -- I talked to someone who was from Antwerp they started sooner.</span> <span id="s97">But in Liège, where we were, they -- I continued going to school until 1942, and I -- just before I was to graduate, get my diploma, that’s when they start -- they didn’t allow Jews to go to school, and -- but when the war started, my parents kind -- bent, and I stayed in the same school that I went -- wha -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s98">Instead of going at -- academically, I went into a school where I was taking pattern making and dressmaking.</span> <span id="s99">They said --</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Vocational s --</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: The vocational school, they said it’s all right, as long as I get a high school dipo -- diploma, is -- is what happened.</span> <span id="s102">And I remember, couldn’t get fabrics, because it was war, and I remember distinctly, my si -- my middle sister had entered high school, and I took a coat that I had, took it completely apart, pressed, laid it flat, and learn -- and I made a -- cut the coat to fit her, to learn to make it.</span> <span id="s103">So I did not get my high school diploma, but I was just before graduation, so I was able to go to school.</span> <span id="s104">And then -- We spoke Yiddish at home, of course, until my parents learned French and even after that.</span> <span id="s105">We had a private tutor that came and taught us Yiddish, and I used to write the letters to the rest of the family, I guess, in Czechoslovakia, but I don’t remember how to read, or how to write Yiddish.</span> <span id="s106">I speak it, I understand it, but I can’t -- no longer read or write it.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: So when you lived in Liège, did you speak just Yiddish and French, or did you speak any other languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: No, no, f -- Yiddi -- We -- We spoke Yiddish and French.</span> <span id="s109">My parents spoke Hungarian when they didn’t want us to understand something.</span> <span id="s110">Otherwise, they -- Otherwise they -- what we -- we spoke Yiddish, I mean my -- my parents came from Orthodox background, and in Salitva, I guess the way of life was the -- th-the way of Jewish life in the calendar and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Will you tell the names of your -- your two sisters, and -- and tell us something about each of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Okay, my middle sister is Berta, she was -- we were two and a half years apart.</span> <span id="s113">She was -- loved dancing and whatever, but my parents didn’t go for the arts, for some reason or other.</span> <span id="s114">They felt education, that did not include it.</span> <span id="s115">And my little sister, Nellie, I don’t know what was wrong with her, I know she was very fragile at first, and of course, being the youngest, she was spoiled.</span> <span id="s116">That’s how I remember, I used to get angry at her, because everything I did, she wanted to do.</span> <span id="s117">I didn’t like chicken soup, so if I didn’t eat it, she didn’t want to eat it, and I was told that I would get it for both of us, because she did everything I did.</span> <span id="s118">I was a very finicky person, even in those days.</span> <span id="s119">For instance, I had a bicycle, and Berta had a bicycle, and then she outgrew that bicycle, it went to Nellie, so she -- Berta and I had to share a bicycle and if it rained on it, I would wipe it and take care of it and she was ma -- much more li -- much more relaxed about it.</span> <span id="s120">She was a very warm, very outgoing person.</span> <span id="s121">That’s -- That’s about all I can tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Okay, I’m just going to ask some questions about -- about the chronology of your wartime experiences.</span> <span id="s123">Okay, we know that the Germans invaded in ’40, and that from -- that -- that there were restrictions and so forth, and -- instituted sometime after the Germans started -- after the Germans occupied Belgium and Liège.</span> <span id="s124">And then, in 1942, you just mentioned that you -- you stopped high school.</span> <span id="s125">And then at some point, you mentioned in your first interview that your father was called to Dunkirk, to -- to build --</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Well, we do -- that’s -- that’s was the rumor.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: The first thing they did is call young people.</span> <span id="s129">I looked at -- at -- in an encyclopedia in the library and they did not mention the -- the -- the f -- the young people, because the two very close friends I had were called.</span> <span id="s130">And then later, they called men between certain ages, I -- I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s131">And the rumor was, I don’t know how true it was, that there -- we’re going to build fortifications in Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s132">Whether that was true or not I don’t know.</span> <span id="s133">And my father was called, and I’ll never forget him because it was a Saturday and I can see my father coming up the stairway, we lived on a -- above a -- a business, and he had his hair shaved, and my mother said -- asked him where he was going, and he said, “I’m going to report, because they say if the men go, they won’t touch the rest of the family.”</span> <span id="s134">And my mother said, “I don’t believe them, I don’t trust them.”</span> <span id="s135">And that’s when they decided -- it was a matter that I remember, of either trying to go across to France, which was very serious, because my cousin -- I -- my father’s sister’s boy, who was eight at the time, his mother had died, the father had remarried, and his wife ha -- his -- th-the woman he had remarried brought -- sh -- he’ll -- he left the woman with two children and she brought my cousin to us, so there were six of us to cross a border.</span> <span id="s136">You had to pay somebody to get you across.</span> <span id="s137">You didn’t know if you would make it.</span> <span id="s138">And then they turned to this Catholic family and that’s how we got the house where we went into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s140">So, your father just did not -- he evaded the call to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: You wanted to --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s144">[inaudible].</span> <span id="s145">Yeah, that, see?</span> <span id="s146">According to my notes, it star -- it started -- th-they called it a labor draft.</span> <span id="s147">I didn’t know at the time that’s what it was called, and it was in July, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: And d -- as a matter of fact, the couple who came in to join us in hiding afterwards, he was a friend of the family, he was the same age as my father’s brother, who had also moved to Belgium, and she had worked for my parents in, you know, helping with the sewing.</span> <span id="s150">He had gone on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Shlumalvit -- shl -- sh -- his name was Yankel Shlumavitch, Jacques.</span> <span id="s153">And they had a little boy, a b -- a baby, I don’t even think he was a year old.</span> <span id="s154">She was five years older than I, and -- and he went on the train and then this is how we knew -- I guess I don’t know to -- at which point we -- we went into hiding and I guess the -- the conductors, the people who worked on the train -- don’t forget these were Belgian citizens, opened the doors and said, “You’re going into,” -- I think Germany, or Poland, it was before they entered Germany -- “whoever wants to run, run.”</span> <span id="s155">And a lot of the young man who had gone, got off the train and went into hiding, but my father hadn’t gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s157">So, Yankel Shmulavits --</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: -- was married to Rasha?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Rachelle --</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Rachelle.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Y -- That’s right, you are right.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s164">And -- And yo-you all went into hiding at -- in this --</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: They joined -- Rachelle and Jacques and the baby joined us to -- i-i-in hiding.</span> <span id="s166">They were in the same house, we were in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s168">And do you -- the -- the Catholic family to whom the home you -- you were staying in belonged, do you know their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No, it -- the person who got -- who got us the house, okay -- we lived across the street from a church.</span> <span id="s170">Now, that part of Belgium is very, very Catholic, and there was a family -- it’s a long story -- one part -- one member of the family lived upstairs of us, and they were very close with the church.</span> <span id="s171">I mean, there’s Catholic, and, you know, no matter which religion, and wa -- one of the -- one of the sons was a Trappist.</span> <span id="s172">One of them had gone i -- was in the service, but came back and had gone to the country, and my parents turned to these people, and the one who had gone to the country knew about the house.</span> <span id="s173">The house belonged -- The house belonged to a -- was a guard house for the castle.</span> <span id="s174">And we -- I don’t know if these people knew we -- we occupied, you know, if the owner’s knew, that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s175">I know -- I remember, somehow or other f -- I knew that we paid the rent for six months.</span> <span id="s176">And after that, I don’t know what happened, I don’t know if we didn’t pay or anything, because I-I really -- I really cannot tell you, it was not brought up, so -- I did -- we did not know who -- we never met, we never knew who the people who owned the land, because it was on land that belonged -- is it a -- was it a count or a duke?</span> <span id="s177">I really -- I really can’t remember, because we never met him, didn’t even know he -- I don’t even remember their name.</span> <span id="s178">I don’t even know if they knew, at first, if it was a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s179">I don’t know how we got the house, I don’t know what information they gave us.</span> <span id="s180">The farmers around us, in no time at all, they knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s181">I mean, there was no -- no way of -- of hiding it, but as far as the owners, I have no idea, no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Was there a name of -- of the town where you were staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yeah, Gomzayodomon, yeah, Gomzayodomon.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: How far was it from Liège?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: You know, that’s a good question, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s186">We used to ride it by bicycle, my sister and I used to go into Liège by bicycle, and when I went later on and became a maid in the city, that’s how -- that’s why I went -- did not go out with my family.</span> <span id="s187">I used to go home by bicycle.</span> <span id="s188">It -- It was hard because it was hilly, but otherwise, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s189">I really, really -- I never looked into it, never asked.</span> <span id="s190">You know, we didn’t ask questions, I never -- even when I went back, I never asked how far it was.</span> <span id="s191">I did go -- I think I wen -- I don’t remember if I went by bus, or if my uncle had a car and took me there.</span> <span id="s192">I don’t even remember.</span> <span id="s193">But, you know, Belgium is a small country, so -- at the -- at the time it seemed big, but it’s a small country, next to this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: And you were staying at this place for 22 months, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Well, I was not there the whole time, because I eventually went to Liège, some -- into the home of -- this woman was a widow to a coal mining engineering -- engineer.</span> <span id="s196">And she had a son who was an Ob/Gyn, and he was about 40 years old, and you know, they used to receive patients in their home, and they needed a maid.</span> <span id="s197">So, they knew I was Jewish and I went to Liège, and walked around with a false ID, went home, traveled by bicycle and I was there when the Gestapo came --</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: -- to arrest the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: And do you know -- remember their names, the name of the -- of the woman and the son</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: [indecipherable] Dr. Bastin, B-a-s-t-i-n, I think, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s205">And so that was the son, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: And -- And the mother, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s208">So, somehow I’d seen the figure of 22 months --</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Well, we were in hiding 22 months from the time we went -- that -- that the -- the Germans started deporting the Jews from Liège until -- until liberation in September, so you count 22 months, is the way they counted it.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: So, it was around July ’42, til around May --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: -- May ’44?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: No, the allied troops came into Brussels, in September 1944.</span> <span id="s214">I remember it was just before my birthday, yeah.</span> <span id="s215">So I think the -- I think that whoever -- whoever counted the hiding, they figured 22 months.</span> <span id="s216">That’s all -- That’s all I know, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So, do you have a sense of the approximate time when you started to work as a maid for the -- for the doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: I -- I was 16 years old, I remember, because three days before my 17th birthday, which is September 14, I was allowed to go home every other weekend, meaning Saturday to Sunday, that was my time off.</span> <span id="s219">And I -- of course, I traveled by bicycle, and I don’t know what the trucks ran on, but not on gasoline and they were very slow going up the hills, it was a butane -- whatever comes -- smoke comes out of there, and it was -- we all did this, we hooked onto the truck.</span> <span id="s220">You know, it was an open ta -- panel truck.</span> <span id="s221">I’ll never forget it, I had a -- a skirt and blouse on, the -- the skirt, we used to call it jepaison, it was gathered, something like a trundle skirt and it had a bib, you know.</span> <span id="s222">And I -- There were two -- was it one or two guys on the back of the truck, and it had like a pole, and I hooked on with my left hand, to the pole, to go up the hill.</span> <span id="s223">And the wind was blowing, and my skirt caught on to the truck, and I guess I lost -- I got panicky, I didn’t want to tear the skirt, don’t forget you -- you couldn’t -- you couldn’t replace clothing, and I fell to my right side and broke my right collarbone.</span> <span id="s224">And they put me on the truck and I remember saying very distinctly in French, for some reason or other, this sticks very clear in my mind, I said, “Don’t let me die three days before my birthday.”</span> <span id="s225">So I knew I fell September 11, that’s how I remember.</span> <span id="s226">And they brought me home and I had to stay home and all they did is take gauze bandage and put my arm -- you know, no sling, no anything, and I have picture, I think they took it when they did the --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Mm-hm, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: -- it was on your video --</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: -- yeah, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: -- that -- that -- that wa -- that was in September, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: 1942, it would have been, right?</span> <span id="s234">That was going to be your 16th birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s236">That must have been ’43, because you know, I didn’t keep track of wh -- of when we went, I -- I never knew that these things were going to come up, but no, I was in the house at first, for quite a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: And I was 16 -- between my 16th and 17th birthday that we were in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s240">So that, when you broke your col-collarbone a few days before your 17th -- 17th birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Three days before, I say, “Don’t let me die three days before my birthday.”</span> <span id="s242">That I remember distinctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: And you didn’t get any medical treatment at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yeah, there isn’t anything they can know, I ma -- my bone -- my bone is still not set right.</span> <span id="s245">I don’t feel it, I have no pain.</span> <span id="s246">I was told that I would suffer the rest of my life with arthritis.</span> <span id="s247">I don’t even know that it’s broken.</span> <span id="s248">I don’t feel it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s249">I think it’s not until year -- not that many years ago that they came up with something to set collarbones, there isn’t much they could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Okay, that -- that makes it clearer, and then -- let me just pause for a second.</span> <span id="s251">As far a -- d-- so you mentioned that you had false identification papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: So did you have extensive contact with the underground while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: I?</span> <span id="s255">No.</span> <span id="s256">I think my father did, from what came up afterwards, but we were not told.</span> <span id="s257">I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s258">I don’t know, everything was done to protect the children and I guess they didn’t tell us too much.</span> <span id="s259">All I -- I -- I really don’t know, because you know, it’s not like today where the kids know everything, and -- but we didn’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s260">I -- I have a feeling that my father, I-I -- I don’t know, he either went to the farmers to get food for the underground -- I really couldn’t tell you, I have no idea of what my fa-father might have done or not done, as far as the underground.</span> <span id="s261">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s263">You got word at some point, that your mother and your sisters had been --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: -- deported -- arrested.</span> <span id="s266">You -- At that time, I assume you were working as a maid, still?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Yes, I was -- I was in Liège, I was with Madam Bastin, the do -- and Dr. Bastin, and that was the weekend I was to go home.</span> <span id="s268">And I got a call, and it was code -- a coded, so they didn’t say the Gestapo arrest your family, cause you had to be careful what you talked on the phone.</span> <span id="s269">And I did understand when they told me not to go home.</span> <span id="s270">And my father was in the hospital, that’s why my father was not deported.</span> <span id="s271">And I’m trying to think.</span> <span id="s272">I have to remember in French.</span> <span id="s273">Hopital de Labarvare, I think it’s called, and he had entered the hospital on Friday.</span> <span id="s274">He had either an ear infection, an eye infection, I don’t know, and the doctor felt he should go in the hospital.</span> <span id="s275">And my sister Berta was supposed to bring in shaving cream and soap, you know, they didn’t provide them.</span> <span id="s276">And I got ahold of Dr. Bastin, of course, and he had my father released from the hospital, and we got on a bus to go home, to go back to that -- to the house, and that’s when we found out exactly what happened, they came at five o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s277">And the farmers tried to save the children, my mother tried to save the children.</span> <span id="s278">From one of the farmers we -- we were told that one of the Gestapo asked my little sister -- and they didn’t ask -- he asked -- they ask where my father was, and my little sister answered, “He’s in the hospital.”</span> <span id="s279">I understand he slapped her because she was lying, which was the truth.</span> <span id="s280">That’s what we got from the farmers who were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Was it a farmer who had called to -- to give you in code, the information?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: No, no, I -- you know, I cannot -- it sounds terrible, I cannot remember who called me.</span> <span id="s283">It might have been the same man who helped us with the papers.</span> <span id="s284">I really don’t know, I cannot remember who called me, cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s286">Going to flip the tape over.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: This is tape two, side B, of an interview with Frida Wallenstein.</span> <span id="s289">And -- And then you mentioned in your video interview, it’s -- le -- correct me if I’m wrong, but it sounded as if the Bastin -- Dr. Bastin, and -- and Madam Bastin, thought that it was too dangerous for you to stay with them any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: And then you went -- yo -- did you -- where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: I went -- I went, very temporarily with Monsieur, Madame Libare.</span> <span id="s293">They ha -- They were the ones we communicated with w-while my -- my -- you know, while they were all in the citadel, on the outskirts of Liège.</span> <span id="s294">There were packages that went and notes slipped in.</span> <span id="s295">Don’t forget the -- the civilians worked and went back and forth and they were very anti-German.</span> <span id="s296">And I went there, but at that ti -- I don’t know, I must have stayed a very, very short time, maybe a couple days.</span> <span id="s297">Monsieur Libare had been called to go to work to Germany, because they were losing on the Russian front at the time, and they called -- we’re talking Gentiles, Catholic where I was, to go to work the factories.</span> <span id="s298">They needed manpower while their man went on the front.</span> <span id="s299">And what happened is these -- these men -- my father was also called on his false ID with it, and the -- I guess, quote, the mayor, from the village, who had -- where -- we had ID’s where we were registered in the register, so in case they took the ID’s, they could check we were there.</span> <span id="s300">He notified them that they made a mistake on my father’s age and made -- they made him 10 years older, so he didn’t go.</span> <span id="s301">But, what happened with the other people, and in -- like with Monsieur Libare, the -- the man would go on the train, hand in their papers, a-an-and get off the other side of the train and go home.</span> <span id="s302">So you had a lot of the Gentiles, who were, quote, hiding, th -- i -- were not legitimate -- were -- were hiding at home, so when I went there, they were afraid they would come for him and find me, or they’d come for -- for me, and f-f -- and -- and you know, find him, so I stayed there, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Were they in Lie-Liège?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Liège, yeah, that was in Liège, and then Madame Bastin had a daughter, very, very nice, who was married t-to a lawyer and they had a little boy called Jacques, I remember he used to come in the kitchen and I used to help him with my homework -- with his -- my home -- with his homework.</span> <span id="s305">And I guess it’s through them, that they found a lawyer, it was a woman lawyer, and I went to her house and stayed with her for a very short time, because then they took the Jews from the citadel and shipped them to Marlene, where they gathered the Jews from Belgium, to ship them out.</span> <span id="s306">And that’s when I went to Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s308">How did you get word that the Jews -- that -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: That they went with -- from --</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: -- finch -- that you -- that they were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: How did I get --</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: That your -- That your mother and sisters were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Well, we knew, somehow, that they were sending them to Marlene.</span> <span id="s314">As a matter of fact, they kept it from my father, because my father just wanted to go out with his wife and the children.</span> <span id="s315">My father just never was the same afterwards.</span> <span id="s316">And who it was, I don’t know, but somebody knew that -- well, it’s li -- you know, like the -- the man who got on the train and somebody said, you know, “You’re -- You’re being deported, whoever wants to run, run.”</span> <span id="s317">I have no idea who -- you -- words got around.</span> <span id="s318">It’s like, when there was sabotage, it was -- word spread like wildfire that -- that the people were being stopped, there was a sabotage and people were arrested.</span> <span id="s319">I don’t know, we -- all I know, that we knew they were going out t-to Marlene and that’s when I went to Brussels, and stayed the last three months of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Wh -- And how did you know where to go?</span> <span id="s321">How did you make arrangements of where to stay in Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: I stayed in Brussels with a couple by the name of -- his name was David Friedman.</span> <span id="s323">As a matter of fact, his family, same family, owned a Buick agency here.</span> <span id="s324">I mean, I’m going back to the original owner in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s325">And, as a matter of fact, he was a brother to Jacques Slomovitch.</span> <span id="s326">Why they had different names, I never understood, but they were brothers.</span> <span id="s327">And he was in bru -- in Brussels, and his home was never touched, because he had married a German woman who was not Jewish, and he -- they had a son, yo -- yo -- yo -- Hakeem, I don’t know how to pronounce it in English.</span> <span id="s328">And I went there because I wanted to send packages to -- to -- to my family in -- in -- in Marlene.</span> <span id="s329">But they didn’t stay long enough for me to send any packages.</span> <span id="s330">And I don’t know, it was Madame Friedman, I don’t know how she knew, she said, “No,” she said, “they’re -- they’ve been de -- they’re -- they were deported.”</span> <span id="s331">And I never sent packages into ma -- into Marlene, because Marlene was close to Brussels, and who would have taken the package.</span> <span id="s332">You know, the -- all this was kept quiet, so I re -- I have no names, I have -- I have no idea how she found out, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s333">I remember, because she forced me to go to the show at the time.</span> <span id="s334">I don’t -- You know, we didn’t know about the concentration camps the way they were, with the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s335">I remember crying like crazy and she forced me to go to the show with, I think y-yo -- Hakeem, with her son.</span> <span id="s336">That’s how I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: But you had -- you had no -- it sounded like you weren’t sure about what deportation meant at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Right.</span> <span id="s339">We didn’t know -- We didn’t know the gas chambers, we didn’t know the torture.</span> <span id="s340">I didn’t know anyway.</span> <span id="s341">There were Germans who had es -- Jews, and who had escaped from Germany, into Belgium, but the -- the concentration camps as far as the gas chambers, not th -- in -- if my parents knew, they didn’t tell us.</span> <span id="s342">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s343">I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: And during the time that you were in Brussels, th -- I -- I -- you se -- mentioned in your testimony that your father was arrested at some point --</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Point.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: When did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: It happened right after my mother and sisters were arrested.</span> <span id="s348">I understand he went to the police and he said -- I don’t know the details, that he had stolen -- I guess what they -- what -- what the underground did -- is -- you know, farmers had to turn in their quotas whether it was wheat, eggs, butter.</span> <span id="s349">And what they -- what the underground would do is go to the farmers and get loads of stuff, that found it’s way on the Black Market, found it’s way -- you know, you had -- I remember the two amer -- th-the plane that fell, and I know they never caught whoever was in -- in the plane and we were told there was an American plane.</span> <span id="s350">Then you had the underground, it had to be [indecipherable] and things, and then the -- the farmers would call and say they were robbed, and I don’t know if that’s what my father participated in, but they arrested him and they put him in jail.</span> <span id="s351">And he would come up for trial and I -- he hired a lawyer and I went and I told the lawyer, I’ll never forget it, “Get my father liberated, or freed, whatever,” and I said, “I’ll kill you.”</span> <span id="s352">Because I knew that he would have arrested him and deported him.</span> <span id="s353">So, he would come up for trial, they would postpone his trial.</span> <span id="s354">And then when war was over, I had to get a lawyer, because we were foreign citizen, we were not Belgian citizen, and because he had committed a crime, I guess, they were going to deport him.</span> <span id="s355">So it took a lawyer.</span> <span id="s356">I turned -- I think I went to -- to -- to Madame Bastin’s son-in-law, yeah, to have him -- whatever he did, he did.</span> <span id="s357">I -- He never took a fee or anything, and -- and my father was let go and stayed in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Let me make sure that I understand why you told the lawyer, “You free my father or I’ll kill you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Is the -- because --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Be-Becau-Because, he was going around, and I guess he wanted to -- to -- to be with -- with -- with my mother and with the children and I guess that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s362">I don’t know what else, he was trying every which way to -- to -- to -- to free them.</span> <span id="s363">As a matter of fact, there was somebody -- I think it’s pretty true that he paid to have my mother and the children out of -- out of the citadel and then it never worked out because I think it was true that there were -- we’re talking German soldiers, we’re not talking Nazi, we’re talking German soldiers, who would take money and be bribed and let -- you know, help people escape from there.</span> <span id="s364">I don’t know deta -- you know, this was all -- all hush hush and I left right after the war, so I never found out a lot of things.</span> <span id="s365">But you have to realize that he -- in the citadel, you had people who were accused of -- of sabotage and things, and they went into the citadel, not just Jews.</span> <span id="s366">So, I know when I saw Rachelle years later in Israel, she told me that a -- a German soldier pa -- brought her milk and passed it through the bar to give to the baby.</span> <span id="s367">So, there was something going on that the detail -- you know, nothing was talked about and I left shortly -- a year after the war, when it was still war torn and people were coming back, so I never got details.</span> <span id="s368">And I guess I never went into any details.</span> <span id="s369">I didn’t ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: So it was your concern that if your father was freed, he would just get himself deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yeah, you got it, that’s right.</span> <span id="s372">Whatever that meant, I don’t know if I realized the f -- the full meaning of it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s373">I -- I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s374">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: But you had the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: -- impression that your father was not s-stable.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Oh, that’s right.</span> <span id="s379">He didn’t care what happened to him.</span> <span id="s380">He didn’t care -- for -- after that, he -- he didn’t care.</span> <span id="s381">As a matter of fact, when he died 10 years later -- he had remarried, and I did see his widow, and she told me he never -- he never overcame the loss of my mother and the si -- and my sisters, he never.</span> <span id="s382">He didn’t care, because he had a -- a blood clot, a thrombophlebitis, thrombophlebosis, whatever it is, and he was told to, you know, flat in bed, you know, to -- until the -- all the clot dissolved, and he didn’t care, and that’s why -- my understanding was that’s why he died, the -- that the blood clot traveled and killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: When was that, that he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: 19 -- November 18, 19 -- whata -- ’55.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Okay, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Not -- Not so long after the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Well, 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: 10 years, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: So, it sound -- my impression is that you were -- you had been, as a girl, fairly sheltered by your parents, and they had protected you, and -- and you -- and you had not -- you hadn’t been rich, but you had been well taken care of --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: And now, all of a sudden, towards the end of the war, after your mother and sister were deported, you were -- you were like the head of the family, and the kids --</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: I was left alone, I had to battle for myself.</span> <span id="s397">I had money; we each had 200 dollars sewn into our coat, and my aunts address in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s398">And I found myself completely -- I guess completely grown up.</span> <span id="s399">I mean, I was left alone, I mean I was -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s400">I -- Well, actually, we matured -- we call it matured, when we went into hiding, and when I was a maid in -- in the Bastin’s house.</span> <span id="s401">She was not a very nice person.</span> <span id="s402">He was.</span> <span id="s403">He was -- I -- He married, years later, my school friend wrote to me.</span> <span id="s404">She -- She was not very nice to work for, she -- first of all, I was a live-in maid and there was a woman who was supposed to come -- I don’t remember, two times, or three times a week, and she quit and I was doing the work of two people in a house that was kept immaculate, with -- don’t ask.</span> <span id="s405">So, I had to fight her off, too, I mean, she was very demanding.</span> <span id="s406">You know how i -- I -- I was -- I was a -- I was a kid, I was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s407">I look at my grandchildren and I think to myself, oh my God, I were -- what do I -- how was I doing at that age.</span> <span id="s408">This is what’s happening to me now.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: How did you adjust to that roll that had suddenly been thrust on you of just being so responsible?</span> <span id="s410">Did you -- Was it -- Were you able to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: I -- I guess I had no choice and then I went back to live with my father, my aunt and uncle -- my father’s brother and his wife, who had managed to go to -- to -- to France, came back with two children.</span> <span id="s412">And I fought, and my father and I fought and that’s why I came to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Yeah, you talked about that some in your first interview, of that difficulty --</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: -- with your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: He was not the same any more.</span> <span id="s419">I just -- It was his idea to come to the States to my aunt, you know, it was not -- i-it -- it’s so hard to go into those details, you know.</span> <span id="s420">My cousin, who was deported with my mother, is -- the father came back, made it through Switzerland, because his wife was pregnant and Switzerland allowed, I think that’s what I was -- we were told, the pregnant women.</span> <span id="s421">And he came back and he blamed my mo -- my mother, my father for the boy going out with my mother.</span> <span id="s422">And I was so mad at my father because he let him live with us.</span> <span id="s423">And we were very cramped, we had three rooms, my aunt and uncle came and I could tell you stories, but it’s not -- it really isn’t worth it, it just -- it was not the same life, I mean we had a makeshift apartment, we were bombed, we were -- you couldn’t get places to live, and I don’t know, whatever.</span> <span id="s424">And my cousin, who is now in Paris, was left alone and she came to live with us for awhile and my aunt -- my aunt -- don’t want to go into it, in case she listens to it.</span> <span id="s425">It was not pleasant, it was very -- it was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s426">It’s -- It was not normal life, although my father did get food and we never went hungry, but otherwise, it was no life.</span> <span id="s427">It wasn’t the same any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: And this was in bru -- did you stay in Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: No, no, in Liège.</span> <span id="s430">I went ba -- I c -- I came -- I came back.</span> <span id="s431">I wanted to be with my father for my 18th birthday and I got on a train in Brussels, got as far Louvain, couldn’t go any further, because I didn’t realize they were still fighting, I guess, arou -- in the outskirts of Liège, and we got on a ni -- I don’t know how many of us got -- got on a -- on a American jeep and we finished and went into Liège, and I went to Monsieur and Madame Libare, and stayed there until I got to -- my father was freed and I went to live with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Where did he live at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Who, my father?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yo -- Yo -- Well, we got a pla -- we got a quota half a house, or whatever you want to call it, and we got together.</span> <span id="s436">I stayed with Monsieur and Madame Libare until then.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Was there any issue of property that you had lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: No, no, no, we -- we didn’t own -- we don’t -- we didn’t own property.</span> <span id="s439">We wal -- We always rented.</span> <span id="s440">And I don’t know who took -- who t -- who emptied the belongings in the house in the country.</span> <span id="s441">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s442">There’s so many -- I -- I -- I didn’t inquire, I didn’t -- I didn’t dig into it.</span> <span id="s443">I guess -- I don’t know, if I think back, who knows what I was thinking?</span> <span id="s444">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s445">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s446">Didn’t ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: And at that time, was -- were you all -- you and your father still holding out some -- some hope that even though what you knew that you thought maybe your family would come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: People -- People were coming out of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s449">As a matter of fact, Rachelle is the only one who survived.</span> <span id="s450">And he would go to fortune tellers, he kept hoping and hoping, and I remember some guy came out of the concentration camp, and I remember him s -- telling my father, “Don’t hope, I took the bodies out myself from the gas chambers.”</span> <span id="s451">It was somebody who was from Liège, who knew them.</span> <span id="s452">And then Rachelle came back, and I did see her.</span> <span id="s453">When I saw her in Israel, many years later, she couldn’t remember that I saw her before I came to the States.</span> <span id="s454">And we didn’t talk in the -- they didn’t talk in those days.</span> <span id="s455">And I left, but w-what I understood afterwards is my father blamed Rachelle for my mother being exterminated, because when they went into the camps, they didn’t know -- they were separating the women and, you know, with children, and the story I got is somebody told Rachelle to hand the baby to my mother.</span> <span id="s456">So my father felt that she went into the gas cham -- because, immediately they went in, because she handed the baby to my mother.</span> <span id="s457">The story I got when I went back is, they didn’t know what was happening and she handed the baby to my mother not knowing that that was going to happen.</span> <span id="s458">My cousin was then 10 years old, and I was told -- and I can’t remember who said, that came out of the concentration camp, said that my sister Berta was given the option of going with the women or to go with my mother, and she chose to go with my mother.</span> <span id="s459">How true, who knows?</span> <span id="s460">But that’s what we were told.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: And this was Auschwitz, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Auschwitz, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Do you -- So, when Rachelle came back, you -- she didn’t talk to you at all about what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s465">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Do you remember seeing her again, and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: -- just about that mom -- what that moment was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: She -- I -- I -- I can see her, but I can’t think of what we talked about.</span> <span id="s470">I know she was sterilized by Mengele.</span> <span id="s471">She couldn't have children, or something.</span> <span id="s472">And I don’t even know if I understood the feel -- full meaning of it.</span> <span id="s473">Don’t forget, we were -- we didn’t have sex education and war, y-you do -- you don’t appreciate the full meaning of it.</span> <span id="s474">I -- Even when I saw her a year later -- years later, when I went to Israel -- I have a letter from her, too, because I -- that’s how I found out the dates and the details and she says this was very hard for her to talk about.</span> <span id="s475">That’s all I know.</span> <span id="s476">I never dug into it, I never faced th-the -- what really happened, until many years later, until I went back to Belgium and my aunt told me, but I -- I didn’t want -- I guess now that -- in retrospect, I didn’t want to know.</span> <span id="s477">I was one of these people who didn’t want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Were you having hopes for the future at that point?</span> <span id="s479">Were you thinking about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s481">I had no thought of future, had no thought of anything, just a ca -- I guess day to day.</span> <span id="s482">You’re asking me things, you know, and how did I feel?</span> <span id="s483">In those days I just -- nope, absolutely nothing, and was -- my father, or some -- we contacted my aunt in Cleveland and I came to Cleveland, is what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s485">You di -- Did you have any preference of where you would go?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: I had no choice, because my -- the only relative we had in the States, was my aunt in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s487">And I -- She signed the affidavit for me, so I had no choice, I had to come to Cleveland, I had to come to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: How long did you stay in Liège before leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Well, we were live -- the war was over in September ’44, and I left Belgium, I got on the boat in LeHavre in May one, 1945 -- ’40 si -- wait a minute, I came in ’46 -- ’46, yeah, and that’s when I left.</span> <span id="s490">So I stayed in Liège from September 1944, to just -- well, I left Liège, because I stayed overnight in Paris, to the beginning of May.</span> <span id="s491">I left -- I left May one from LeHavre and arrived in New York May eight, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So that year before you left Liège, you -- you’re living with your father and -- and with -- can you tell me the names of the other people you were</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Well my -- my father’s brother Josef and his wife Hosa, and their two children, William and Mary, who were little tots.</span> <span id="s494">And I saw them again as teenagers, I went back a year after my father died.</span> <span id="s495">Then I went back once more and then two years ago, I went with Elder Hostel to France and my cousin Miriam, who’s a married woman with two young adult children, came to Paris and we spend the day together.</span> <span id="s496">So, that what was left in Liège, and then I -- my fa -- one of my father’s brother, Gesa, we made contact with him, through my cousin from Israel, and he came to the States via his wife, because on my father’s side, there was no one.</span> <span id="s497">And I remember before I left Belgium, we heard from him, and he had applied to come to the States and I was going to wait for him, and he says, “No, you go ahead, and I’ll join you afterwards.”</span> <span id="s498">He came about two years later, and he went to New York, and I practically ran to New York.</span> <span id="s499">I got on the Empire State train and I went in on a -- I think it was a decoration weekend, or Fourth of July, and boy, that Grand Central Station was mobbed.</span> <span id="s500">He recognized me for some ra -- reason or other, because he used to travel and he used to come to Liège -- I mean, my mother, th -- the whole family adored my mother, and he was in New York, and then he had TB of the spine and moved -- was transferred to Denver, to the National Jewish Hospital there.</span> <span id="s501">And he -- he was the only one, my uncle in Liège died.</span> <span id="s502">He had a heart murmur or something when he was a kid and he died of a heart condition.</span> <span id="s503">My uncle, my father’s -- I guess -- I don’t know if he was the youngest or -- or his sister was the youngest.</span> <span id="s504">She died of childbirth [indecipherable] abortion.</span> <span id="s505">Th-Th-The brother, Libou, was sent to Israel, he was 11 years old, and we heard from him after the war, and he was killed with a shrapnel in his yard, he was on -- I don’t know, he was on the kibbutz, or they had sent money to him already.</span> <span id="s506">When they were fighting -- they had the war to become Israel, and I’m in touch with my cousin still yet, who was born you know, in -- in Israel, he lived in Denver, so that’s the four of us left, but otherwise there is -- there’s no one left on my father’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Was there any possibility of staying in Liège, or was that out of the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s509">The papers were made.</span> <span id="s510">As a matter of fact, if it would a happened later, this is -- was a f -- cousin of my father, he was the same age as my Uncle Josef and he came up through Italy with the Jewish Brigade, and somehow or other was -- knew we were in Liège, and he found us in Liège, and as a matter of fact, he stayed with me in Brussels until I got on the train to go to Paris to come to the States.</span> <span id="s511">Had it happened later, he probably would have arranged for me to go to -- to what was at the time, Palestine.</span> <span id="s512">Th -- Could have very easily ended up in Israel, as well as in pa -- as -- as well in -- as in the States.</span> <span id="s513">I mean, it was just timing I guess, because when -- by the time he came to Belgium, I -- the -- the paperwork had already started to come to the States, and I never reversed it.</span> <span id="s514">I wasn’t thinking, really.</span> <span id="s515">I got cold feet.</span> <span id="s516">When I got off the boat, I was one of the last one to get off the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s519">Everybody was off but me.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Just going back for a minute.</span> <span id="s521">Did -- Did you have any Zionist feelings at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s523">I think as a kid, you know, you remember vaguely, I must have belonged to something that had to do with the Zionism, but I don’t remember -- it just something very vague.</span> <span id="s524">Vi -- I don’t even know the name of the organization, I remember little si -- I’m go -- I remember going to meetings, but it’s so vague, I couldn’t even tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: I just couldn’t even tell you, because the only one who went to -- to, at the time Palestine, was my father’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s528">You mentioned that -- that your family was -- was religious and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: They came -- They came -- My -- Both my [indecipherable] that was life in the -- in the country, were Orthodox, but in Liège, they didn’t keep it.</span> <span id="s530">They a -- a small Jewish community.</span> <span id="s531">My father was not a believer.</span> <span id="s532">We went to services and was because of my mother.</span> <span id="s533">My father was not into it.</span> <span id="s534">I remember he used to talk and they gave him a hard time for Bar Mitzvah, because he couldn’t afford a new suit or something like that.</span> <span id="s535">My father was not into it, and then my Uncle Gesa, who was a waiter, and travel and used to come to Belgium, I guess he didn’t keep kosher and for whatever reason or other, I don’t think we kept kosher any more.</span> <span id="s536">And then we had the war.</span> <span id="s537">But I know my mother, even when -- because we had food on Black Market in Belgium, would not touch, like pork.</span> <span id="s538">She could not -- She did not touch it.</span> <span id="s539">I don’t th -- End of Tape One Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: No, you can never predict who’s going to be interested, and who isn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: But see, my son was not -- didn’t dig into it either, and then he was going to dig into it with my -- my -- my late uncle in Denver, and my uncle died of a heart attack, so he never got -- he wanted his experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s543">This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Frida Wallenstein.</span> <span id="s544">Before we go on to talk about your journey, I wanted to ask you about Judaism after the war.</span> <span id="s545">We were just talking about how -- what your family’s religion was before the war.</span> <span id="s546">Did Judaism play a role right after the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Not one bit.</span> <span id="s548">I -- The -- We had a synagogue, Orthodox of course, and the rabbi had gone to Russia on a visit and got caught during the war, so we didn’t even have a rabbi.</span> <span id="s549">I went to the synagogue because I knew I had a male cousin and I had two female cousins, and I thought maybe I would run into their husbands, which I never did.</span> <span id="s550">My cousin Louie was in Manila.</span> <span id="s551">I don’t know where Al was, the one -- I-I-I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s552">So I never found them, but there was, I guess soldiers, somebody gave money.</span> <span id="s553">I had never heard of Hanukkah, not that I remembered giving money for the kids.</span> <span id="s554">I never saw anything, I -- the only reason I went to se -- to the synagogue was to see if maybe I could turn up one of my cousins.</span> <span id="s555">But there was no contact with the religion, at least on my -- on my part, and on my father’s part, I don’t remember anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Okay, so you left from LeHavre on what boat?</span> <span id="s557">And -- And around when?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Oh, okay, I left le -- I went from Liège to Brussels, war torn -- first of all, I had trouble getting a passport, because Czech -- where I was born became Russia, and we were told we could remain Czech or become Russian, and we found out my father could not remain Czech because he had not served in the armed forces.</span> <span id="s559">So I had to go to Brussels, and I don’t remember who suggested I go to the Office of the Foreign Ministry in Brussels, and I had to get papers to prove that I was no longer a Czech citizen.</span> <span id="s560">And I didn’t get what a passport, they call it a laissez-passe, which means let through, translated literally, good for one year, and so I could put my visa on.</span> <span id="s561">I had to go to Antwerp to get my visa, and it was through a school friend, not a Jewish girl, whose father worked downtown, next to the town major’s office.</span> <span id="s562">He didn’t speak French, he didn’t -- a-and my -- my friend’s father didn’t speak English and they wrote a letter to the embassy and I got a visa much sooner than -- than if I would have waited on a regular basis, because after I came to the States, my father told me that I got called to go get my visa.</span> <span id="s563">And you couldn’t get passage because the GI’s were coming back, the war brides were coming.</span> <span id="s564">And I can still see the travel agent.</span> <span id="s565">I was at a friend’s house and he says, “I got passage for you.”</span> <span id="s566">And I found my father, he had to borrow money to -- to pay for my passage.</span> <span id="s567">And I went from Liège to Brussels with my father, and this cousin from Israel, and I remember he told my father, “You go back, I’m a soldier, I’ll be able to get transportation.”</span> <span id="s568">And I think it took me longer to go through the border of Belgium, France, than it took me to travel, because, you know, it was still after the war.</span> <span id="s569">France was still war -- we had everything, food, everything, France didn’t.</span> <span id="s570">Stayed overnight in Paris.</span> <span id="s571">I met a woman on the train, and somebody on the train, a French woman -- there was Black Market going on between Belgium and Germany, Belgium and France, and she picked up the Belgian accent, and wanted to know if we had Belgian money -- and stayed in Paris overnight.</span> <span id="s572">And there was a young girl who had married a GI, and this woman was very sophisticated, and we went to LeHavre.</span> <span id="s573">War -- Was in ruins, I remember the debris and everything.</span> <span id="s574">And I came on a boat, that I used to call a ship, called the SS Uruguay.</span> <span id="s575">And we were 10 in a cabin, and we landed in New York on May eight, in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Why didn’t your father go with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: There was no reason for him to come to the States, I mean, he didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s578">It would have had to be my aunt, was my mother’s sister, would have signed the papers, he -- he -- I don’t know, I never asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: But he thought it would be better for you to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: It was bet -- It was better, it just -- it just -- I wou -- I -- I was a young woman, he -- he just -- he just didn’t know how to handle it.</span> <span id="s581">We were fighting, we were arguing, we were -- I remember he didn’t allow me to wear lipstick, I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s582">Lots and lots of reasons.</span> <span id="s583">I just -- It -- It’s very hard to go into it, and very personal, so I -- it just didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s584">I don’t even realize what I was doing by coming to the States, truthfully.</span> <span id="s585">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: What were the thoughts in your head in the time that you were in -- on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: What were the thoughts?</span> <span id="s588">I think I was blank.</span> <span id="s589">I -- I -- I don’t think I thought anything, all I -- the -- the only thing I remember, I saw raw celery for the first time in my life, served on the ship, and I thought, “Who eats raw celery?”</span> <span id="s590">And I think maybe I realized what I did, is when I went -- when we landed, when -- you know, when -- when we docked, I should say, and my aunt, my uncle and my cousin Louie had a ca -- my cousin Louie had a car, drove to New York.</span> <span id="s591">There were two families who had known my mother back in Czechoslovakia, who had migrated to New York years ago, and they left my mother about the same age I came, and I guess they must have -- th -- th -- my aunt and uncle came -- came to the dock where -- where we -- where we docked there, and my cousin had just borrowed a hat from one of the people on -- on -- on the thi -- because they couldn’t imagine what was happening to me, and I think I was afraid to get off the boat.</span> <span id="s592">I really was afraid to get off the boat.</span> <span id="s593">I -- I know they were cleaning -- I think maybe the whole boat was cl -- was cleaned by the time I got off.</span> <span id="s594">And I think that’s when -- I think that’s when I got scared, but until then, no.</span> <span id="s595">First of all, I was a little seasick, not too much, I remember, and you were with te -- you know, nine other people in the cabin and I don’t -- I think my mind didn’t even project into anything at all.</span> <span id="s596">I mean, I didn’t even think of language barrier.</span> <span id="s597">I didn’t think of anything.</span> <span id="s598">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Did you speak any English?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I did a little bit, because I had studied English six years prior to coming to the States, and maybe I have a knack for languages.</span> <span id="s601">I mean, it came out upside down and everything, but I managed -- I -- I-I remember sitting down and writing letters in English, with the dictionary.</span> <span id="s602">I don’t know how, because two years is not a lot.</span> <span id="s603">But, what saved me with my aunt is I spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s604">See, she spoke Hungarian, but I was able to communicate fluently in Yiddish, so that I was able -- I had no problem at home.</span> <span id="s605">I had no problem whatsoever.</span> <span id="s606">And then -- And then I found myself living -- I di -- I didn’t think of anything.</span> <span id="s607">I don’t remember even being concerned about language barrier, I didn’t even think of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: And so you got off in New York, and then traveled to Cleveland?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: By car, yeah.</span> <span id="s610">We stayed in New York overnight.</span> <span id="s611">I remember my -- they took me to a store and they bought me a coat and I thought it was the ugliest thing, but it wasn’t -- you know, don’t forget, the styles were entirely different.</span> <span id="s612">I came with a coat, it used to be a navy blanket, and my uncle was a tailor, you know, he had come back, and he made it for me.</span> <span id="s613">I mean, you couldn’t get fabrics, you couldn’t -- this is how y -- this is war torn, this is -- and I remember it was a fuchsia coat, I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s614">I think I have a picture in it, with black lapels and a ba -- a belt.</span> <span id="s615">And I wanted bananas, because for money you could get just about everything in Belgium, and the first boat, the banana boats came in just as I was leaving, and I remember my aunt eventually hiding the bananas, cause she was afraid I would get sick.</span> <span id="s616">And I remember distinctly, I had a soft boiled egg, and I had never seen this, where they crack the egg, and put it in a little dish.</span> <span id="s617">I was used to eat it in the shell, in a -- in an egg holder, and I thought my stomach was going to turn, and I couldn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s618">But what saved me is, you know, especi -- and with the p -- even the people who knew my parents, it -- to families, is -- is the Yiddish, I was able to communicate in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: What was your aunt’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Lana Bern, she -- yeah, Lana Bern.</span> <span id="s621">She had three children, one daughter in California, one daughter who was married already, in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s622">She lived a -- wait a minute, Edna li -- no, Edna lived upstairs, yeah.</span> <span id="s623">She had a two family with a third floor, and my cousin Louie wasn’t married and was still living with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Ah, just backtracking for a moment, what -- do you remember what your first impressions were of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Of New York itself?</span> <span id="s626">No.</span> <span id="s627">The im -- what a -- what really impressed me is, you know, we drove back from new -- we drove from New York to Cleveland, so we’re through Pennsylvania, and I just looked at the vastness of this country, I just -- I think I was awed, I was numb.</span> <span id="s628">That im -- New York, I don’t remember anything from New York, I mean, as far as the city, I mean, we didn’t -- we didn’t sightsee, I mean, these people were anxious to see me and to learn and -- and things like that.</span> <span id="s629">What awed me was the country, and my cousin Louie was teasing me, something about the mountains and going through it, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s630">I mean, the ten -- there was the Pennsylvania Turnpike, but not the Ohio Turnpike, and then it turned dark and he continued driving, but during daylight, I just looked at all that Pennsylvania country and I just -- I wa -- just awed.</span> <span id="s631">But New York?</span> <span id="s632">No, I didn’t remember New York, I didn’t -- I didn’t go -- I don’t even remember which store we went to go shopping for my coat.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Did -- Did you talk to your near relatives at all about where you had come from, what had hap -- just happened to you, what you were going through?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: What -- What happened when I came to my aunt, okay, is there is a -- a -- quite a community from Solotvona in Cleveland, and people came to see me, I was -- there was one guy, I don’t know how he got here before me, because he was a DP, he had been in the concentration camp, and he came to see me also.</span> <span id="s635">And people came to get information, news, and I kept saying -- I guess I must have been quote boatlag, I don’t know, is there such a thing?</span> <span id="s636">And I kept saying, I don’t know anything, because I was in Belgium, so I could not bring them any news or anything from before the war from Solotvona, because I was two and a half years old when my f -- you know, when we left to Belgium.</span> <span id="s637">I had distant cousins who came, I mean people came because they wanted -- they wanted news from Solotvona, and I -- and I remember k -- kept -- in Yiddish kept -- that I remember distinctly, I kept saying, “I don’t know anything, I wasn’t there,” and you know, and -- and what saved me again was the Yiddish because these people, from that generation came and -- and spoke Yiddish, and I couldn’t give them any information, but nobody asked me information about Belgium because they came -- they came from -- from -- from Czechoslo -- fr -- Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, whatever it was when they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Did you feel that you had anyone who was really interested in -- in you and what you had been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s640">As a matter of fact, what I had is I found myself, for the first time, in a Jewish environment.</span> <span id="s641">Grew up in a Catholic environment.</span> <span id="s642">And I remember distinctly that even with my aunt, that I had to defend the Catholics.</span> <span id="s643">I had to tell them that Catholics saved my life.</span> <span id="s644">Catholic risked their lives to save my life.</span> <span id="s645">Catholics were tormented, especially in Liège.</span> <span id="s646">I don’t know -- I don’t know about the other part, I just met somebody from Antwerp.</span> <span id="s647">The -- The walone, th-th-the -- the French ones were very, very anti-Germans.</span> <span id="s648">I didn’t know from -- I didn’t know any anti-Semitism, unt-until Hitler started in ’42.</span> <span id="s649">And I don’t think they -- they -- they comprehended that.</span> <span id="s650">That is something I really -- th-that’s what came up, is Catholic helped me, Catholic risked their lives.</span> <span id="s651">Catholic were persecu -- not to the extent the Jews were.</span> <span id="s652">You know, they didn’t -- they couldn’t take the whole country and send them to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s653">That’s what I had -- What happened to me?</span> <span id="s654">I -- I ha -- trying to remember my -- my aunt knew by then that my mother was gone, but I don’t think they brought up too much at that time, of -- you know, America was getting over, I guess, depression, the war, the bo -- the boys were coming back from the service.</span> <span id="s655">And it’s someth -- it’s not something that was talked about that much.</span> <span id="s656">I remember, I don’t know if I was setting the table, clearing up the table or what.</span> <span id="s657">My mother -- My aunt, excuse me, my aunt said something about milladec, faishadec, you know, dairy made, and I said, “What’s that?”</span> <span id="s658">And my aunt said, “What do you mean, you -- what’s milladec and faishadec, didn’t your mother keep it?”</span> <span id="s659">Oh, sure, my mother kept it, four years of war, two years in hiding, how are you going to keep the -- the -- the kosher laws, she didn’t even keep them before -- before the war.</span> <span id="s660">That I remember, and it’s interesting, because I -- my aunt lit candles on the Sabbath, on Friday, and it came -- I had forgotten about that, it -- it’s interesting what you remember distinctly, what you remember vaguely.</span> <span id="s661">I had completely forgotten about candles and blessing the candles, and then I remembered when I saw her doing it, and then when girlfriend of mine did it, and it just -- I can see my mother lighting this -- you know, and -- and blessing this -- the Sabbath candles, but I had completely forgotten about it.</span> <span id="s662">And I never kept anything, to this day I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Did you start going to services?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s665">I don’t -- I’m not practicing, I’m not a believer.</span> <span id="s666">I keep -- I -- Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur is something that is very vivid in my mind.</span> <span id="s667">I don’t remember Hanukkah, I remember one seder.</span> <span id="s668">Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, I will not -- you know, I -- I -- what I do at home is my business.</span> <span id="s669">I didn’t go to work.</span> <span id="s670">I go for the holidays because I have very close friends who are traditional and I go for breaking the fast and I go for this, but I am not -- I -- Passover, I don’t observe.</span> <span id="s671">I respect, but I don’t observe.</span> <span id="s672">What I do at home is my business.</span> <span id="s673">I’m not -- I’m not into it.</span> <span id="s674">I -- What happened to my mother shouldn’t have happened if religion was supposed to be what it’s wa -- that’s the way I feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Was it -- It sounds to me like an interesting kind of role reversal.</span> <span id="s676">I think people would assume that having lived in Europe during the Nazi era, that you would be especially aware of anti-Semitism, and that the people in America, would be oh, you know, we -- we don’t live in an anti-Semitic country, but it sounds like it was kind of opposite of that and that you came into a community that was -- that was very aware of their Judaism, and -- and very aware of -- of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s677">Was it difficult for you to maintain your identity of not -- not being oriented towards Judaism?</span> <span id="s678">Was that a conflict at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: No, it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s680">I mean, I remember -- you know, I made friends right away, all -- they were all American girls, they felt sorry for me.</span> <span id="s681">I still see them to this day, they had a sorority from high school.</span> <span id="s682">We just had a reunion because somebody came in from out of town.</span> <span id="s683">And I remember going on the high holy days with a girlfriend, and we went from one synagogue to the other, but as far as religion, religion for me to keep, that’s not what directed me, I did what everybody else did.</span> <span id="s684">I will -- do remember distinctly, when came Yom Kippur, and my aunt wanted me to go to synagogue to say yisker for my mother, and I refused.</span> <span id="s685">I said, “That means I’ll bury my mother.”</span> <span id="s686">That I remember distinctly.</span> <span id="s687">In retrospect, I think I did not accept for -- what really happened.</span> <span id="s688">First of all, I didn’t know the details.</span> <span id="s689">People didn’t talk in those days, right off, and re -- you have to realize I -- I -- I didn’t associate with the Europeans, with the DP’s who came.</span> <span id="s690">Cousins came -- I had made American friends, and I went with them, and these were 18 year old girls who -- who I don’t think talked about -- who talked about the Holocaust, outside maybe of the DP’s who came, I have no idea because I had no contact with them.</span> <span id="s691">I worked the sewing factory and they came there, but nobody talked about it, so religion-wise, no, I had to fight and say again with the Catholics, I had -- I had to tell them that I did not face anti-Semitism, and I think -- I think that was something that was hard for them to accept until I left my aunt, and then inna -- it wa -- it was never talked about.</span> <span id="s692">I worked in the sewing factory, there were all American girl -- girls, until the DP’s came, and we had, I think, a Hungarian forewoman, and I don’t speak Hungarian.</span> <span id="s693">I just found myself more in common with the American girls.</span> <span id="s694">Maybe I was anxious to become Americanized, or whatever, whatever, and all the people that affiliated with even the factory, were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s695">Fa -- The friends that I made were Jewish, but the environment where I worked was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s696">And even when I changed factories, I think I was the only Jewish girl working there, when I went to Prinz beeterman.</span> <span id="s697">I never felt out of place working among -- among non-Jews.</span> <span id="s698">I would never -- never felt out of place, never felt different or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Did you ever experience any anti-Semitism in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: No, no, no, because I worked in the sewing industry, which was Jewish owned, but I had heard at -- over the years, as the girls went out for jobs, I heard about discrimination in hiring Jews, some of the companies.</span> <span id="s701">But I personally, no, no, never.</span> <span id="s702">I was very good friends with -- when I was at Prinz beeterman, pe-people of Catholic-Polish extract, I mean di -- didn’t talk religion, religion didn’t come into it.</span> <span id="s703">I -- I -- I -- I -- I never experienced it personally, no, nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: What were y -- What were your -- your -- you’re starting to get settled in the Cleveland area, you’re starting to get familiar with -- with this new country.</span> <span id="s705">What --</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Very difficult.</span> <span id="s707">I said I was a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s708">I have what they call golden hands, meaning I’m very, very good with my hands.</span> <span id="s709">And Cleveland was a center for the manufacturing of clothing.</span> <span id="s710">To -- My aunt took me to Lampoles, and of course I was grabbed off, and I was in shock, because they had rows of sewing machines.</span> <span id="s711">I was not used to it.</span> <span id="s712">And I tried to tell them that I had gone to school, that I wa -- I was eight -- I was almost -- just about 20.</span> <span id="s713">And I told them I was a high school graduate.</span> <span id="s714">I was -- I wasn’t graduated the high s -- it was easier to say that I was educated.</span> <span id="s715">Looked like kid, didn’t speak English but very little.</span> <span id="s716">And for some reason or other -- the only thing years later I could think of is, the environment I found myself, I could take my aunt -- even my parents, how much schooling did they have?</span> <span id="s717">And I think they put us all in the same package.</span> <span id="s718">Now, the DP’s who came, also didn’t have the education, because Germany invited -- invaded, you know, much earlier, and they looked at me, and I guess they thought we were stupid, and they just put us in the same pot of the people who ga -- don’t forget, during World War Two, there was no immigration, and they put me to put piecework.</span> <span id="s719">And -- And I was raised with clothes handmade, hand finished.</span> <span id="s720">And I wanted to go back, but I couldn’t because my laissez-passe was good for one year and it was hard.</span> <span id="s721">It was very had to -- t-to adjust to the way of life.</span> <span id="s722">I had trouble with some of the foods a little bit.</span> <span id="s723">I didn’t have the best facilities living with my aunt, because my cousin was still living at home, he wasn’t married and I slept on the couch.</span> <span id="s724">I lived with my aunt for three months.</span> <span id="s725">And then I moved in with a couple, she was British, he was a soldier in England, and he had married a British girl.</span> <span id="s726">I eventually no -- moved with them.</span> <span id="s727">In those days, girls didn’t rent apartments.</span> <span id="s728">And he was the brother of a very close friend of mine, to this day, I’m very, very close, it’s like family with me.</span> <span id="s729">And I lived with them, but the facilities, don’t want to go into detail, couldn’t -- i-it just -- just for a short time.</span> <span id="s730">And I had been introduced to a -- a girl two year -- Esther, Esther Berkowitch, two years older than I was.</span> <span id="s731">And she knew of this couple who had a two family off Kinsmen, 154 in Kinsmen, and they had two rooms that they rented.</span> <span id="s732">Like I say, they didn’t have apartments, we rented rooms, and they were -- oh, I think they were about 80, even in those days, and they were ru -- Russian immigrants, spoke very little English and they hesitated in taking in a girl in the room, because, you know, werl washes her hair, puts bobby pins, in those days.</span> <span id="s733">But I did move in with them, and I found a family, really.</span> <span id="s734">I got very close with one of their daughter-in-law, and I lived there.</span> <span id="s735">I was dating very heavy and it worked out very nicely, because I spoke Yiddish fluently.</span> <span id="s736">And I went to work on the streetcar, and lived with them until I got married, really.</span> <span id="s737">Until I got married in 1948, in November 1948, and I lived with them.</span> <span id="s738">And I adjusted.</span> <span id="s739">First of all, I did try to go back to visit my father, but after the real hard adjustment was over, couldn’t get a passport, cause I was not a Czech res -- citizen, I was not a Russian citizen, and I was not an American citizen.</span> <span id="s740">So I couldn’t -- I couldn’t get a passport, I couldn’t travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: How did -- So you had this pass to stay for a year, what happened after the years was up?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Oh no, no, it was good for one year, it couldn’t be renewed, it couldn’t be renewed.</span> <span id="s743">I -- I mean, there was no way -- there was no way I could renew it, and -- and it was a te -- a t -- a temporary, quote, passport.</span> <span id="s744">I mean, only cer -- because I was migrating to the States, so I couldn’t get a passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s746">So -- So the idea was you were to stay in the States until a certain amount of time, when you would get -- be -- you said [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: [indecipherable] become an American citizen, which I couldn’t wait, and I -- because I married an American citizen, if you were in the States one year, and married to an American citizen one year at that time, you could become a citizen sooner than the five year wait.</span> <span id="s748">So I got -- I became an American citizen in four years, as opposed to five years, is what I did.</span> <span id="s749">But I was -- I came, what they call in French Sol nationalite determinet, which means I had no nationality.</span> <span id="s750">And I -- That was it.</span> <span id="s751">So I couldn’t get a passport to go back and then I adjusted, and I made friends.</span> <span id="s752">I went to sorority meetings, didn’t understand a word, and concentrated on trying to understand.</span> <span id="s753">And I remember my girlfriends used to burst out laughing every so often because of my French -- very, very French pronunciation.</span> <span id="s754">I -- Whatever it came out -- I found out years, years later, I met a young woman here in the complex who was from France, and she came for a short time, and for the -- bud -- my -- a few years ago, I was already speaking English fluently, even lost my French accent, and I heard her, with her pronunciation, and I says, “No wonder my girlfriends used to burst out laughing.”</span> <span id="s755">I learned -- I remember when I learned -- I used the word douche the first time.</span> <span id="s756">In French, a shower was a douche, so I took a douche, and they were laughing, and I -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: I think she’d go into my life and after the [indecipherable] because I went to school, and became a secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s759">When did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: I married in ’48.</span> <span id="s761">When my son was born in ’51, we moved to Sandusky, Ohio, which is not far from here, Aceder Point, and we lived there for seven years.</span> <span id="s762">My husband became ill.</span> <span id="s763">I was working in the factory until shortly before my son was born.</span> <span id="s764">I had female trouble, he was born early, I had a difficult pregnancy.</span> <span id="s765">We moved to Sandusky, and we struggled.</span> <span id="s766">Financially, emotionally, but we made very good friends.</span> <span id="s767">I made some very, very good friends in Sandusky.</span> <span id="s768">It’s much developed since then.</span> <span id="s769">And there was no pla -- we didn’t have money, so we made friends, we babysat for each other.</span> <span id="s770">Spend -- We had friends, we went for Christmas dinner, Easter dinner.</span> <span id="s771">There was a small Jewish community, we were not active with it.</span> <span id="s772">We were turned down to go to services because we didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s773">That was also a slap in the face.</span> <span id="s774">And my hus became quite ill, was hospitalized, and I moved back to Cleveland.</span> <span id="s775">Tried to get back into the sewing industry, went to Prinz beeterman, but the place had changed, ended up doing alterations in small stores.</span> <span id="s776">My son was young, went to Jewish Family Service, got no help.</span> <span id="s777">I very hurt feelings and very -- not bitter any more, but -- and I went to work in small stores with alterations, which paid very, very little.</span> <span id="s778">My husband came out of the hospital, went into practice.</span> <span id="s779">I went to work for him, then he was hospitalized again for a very, very long time.</span> <span id="s780">And I worked with a Social Worker, to cope with his illness, to cope with my child.</span> <span id="s781">I was very, very concerned about my child, and I worked with a Social Worker, and then eventually with the child psychi -- my son was alright, but it was to help me cope, and to try to keep him as even as can be.</span> <span id="s782">And it was through the help of a Social Worker, at the VA, that I had the guts to go to school, and take classes to become a secretary.</span> <span id="s783">I saw the writing on the wall, I didn't know how long my husband would be ill, and I couldn’t stay in the sewing industry, I worked for a small store, there were long layoffs, there were short hours.</span> <span id="s784">And they didn’t have the Social Security laws where you get Social Security for -- for an ill person, it came later.</span> <span id="s785">And I went -- I went to Dyke first, and then I went to Tri-C, because Dyke was expensive, and I finished off there.</span> <span id="s786">And I was working half a day, going to school, borrowed a tape machine, and I’m talking an old tape, to -- to do my shorthand, which I never used eventually, anyway.</span> <span id="s787">Was very nervous, was very self-conscious, and it was through the help of a Social Worker that gave me enough confidence to say -- you know, I was a foreign background, my accent was much heavier.</span> <span id="s788">I spoke English fluently, but I had never had real formal English.</span> <span id="s789">I went to Tri-C, took an English class.</span> <span id="s790">Got me more confused than anything.</span> <span id="s791">And I ended up applying at University Hospitals, couldn’t pass the typing test, I was so nervous.</span> <span id="s792">I did pass the spelling test, but in those days I used to go -- in French they spell it this way, in English it’s this way, I was still, because I hadn’t worked with the English language.</span> <span id="s793">And I -- You have to be at the right place at the right time, and they had someone who took care of secretaries.</span> <span id="s794">I was coming out of school, I mean, I -- I had -- I had the certificates for passing the typing and everything, and I guess I made -- not I guess, I made an impression on the head of personnel at the time.</span> <span id="s795">I was a foreign background, I was in the sewing industry, and in those days, adults didn’t go back to school, very, very few, and I went to Tri-C, I think I met one or two adults who went to school.</span> <span id="s796">And the doctor who hired me, he -- they told me later they felt sorry for me, because I guess I was very scared, I was very self-conscious.</span> <span id="s797">I was self-conscious of my English, and I thought I would go to work.</span> <span id="s798">Even though I didn’t pass the typing test, they sent me to three interviews.</span> <span id="s799">I never made the third one, and I took this one.</span> <span id="s800">And I went -- I worked for him for 10 years, because he left University Hospitals, and I was going to work three years and better myself financially, but the work was so interesting, because there was research, because of the affiliation with Case West -- well, it was Western Reserve then, Case Western Reserve.</span> <span id="s801">And he left, and I stayed on for three years, and I julo -- just loved my work, the best thing I did was leaving the sewing industry.</span> <span id="s802">I was way down financially when my husband got sick.</span> <span id="s803">I -- His brother saved me with a few dollars.</span> <span id="s804">I didn’t have money to feed my kid at the time.</span> <span id="s805">I -- The sewing industry, I struggled -- I did get some money, was it Social Security at the time, a little bit, and I managed to survive.</span> <span id="s806">And once I went into become a secretary, my su -- I was divorced, my husband wanted to -- the divorce, and my son went to live with him, and I got on my feet.</span> <span id="s807">And the best thing I did was to leave the sewing industry.</span> <span id="s808">My mother used to say, “It’s much easier to work with your brain, than to work with your back,” which I couldn’t see at the time.</span> <span id="s809">And I worked in an environment that was intellectual, even though I was not much of an intellect, but I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s810">We had a lot of people coming and going and I just loved my work, because those were the days of the typewriters, we typed and we typed and we typed.</span> <span id="s811">And it so happened that everybody was foreign.</span> <span id="s812">The director was foreign, the associate director was -- he was f -- grew up in Austria, the associate director was from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s813">We had a technician from India, with -- one time there was -- the supervising technician was the only one who was an American person.</span> <span id="s814">And I ended up, for some reason or other, my English was very, very good, and I started slowly editing the manuscript.</span> <span id="s815">We’re talking technical manuscript research.</span> <span id="s816">And first with the commas, and with the this, and slowly but surely, over the years, I edited from one paragraph to the other, from one part to the other, and I didn’t allow him to put my name on as whatever he produced, and produ -- the only place I allowed him to acknowledge me, he wrote a book on babies born with birth defects in the brain, because I was secretary to the Division of Neuropathology.</span> <span id="s817">And that’s the only place my -- that I allowed him to recognize m -- I used to tease him, I says, “I don’t want to be affiliated with this.”</span> <span id="s818">And the work was very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s819">He left --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Reinhart Friede.</span> <span id="s822">It was very interesting, because my name is Frida, but his was F-r-i-e-d-e, and only twice was there a mi-mix up, because I didn’t hear the doctor in front of Friede, otherwise -- and I spell mine F-r-i-d-a.</span> <span id="s823">But, we -- only twice it happened that the names were confused.</span> <span id="s824">And he was a very straight faced, he looked very stern, but oh, did we have fun.</span> <span id="s825">I mean, we had technicians who were a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s826">I never lost a day’s pay.</span> <span id="s827">I learned to get on my feet, I learned to invest money, in a small way.</span> <span id="s828">And I ret -- And then, they had a new director who came, who was a complete opposite, Dr. Gambetti.</span> <span id="s829">P. Luigi Gambetti, with such different personality, I thought I would never make it, and for three years, it just didn’t work, and his wife wa -- he’s an MD, his wife is a Ph.D., and she came, she’s from South America, and it took three years to adjust, and to this day, I go and I visit with them, I invite them for dinner.</span> <span id="s830">Their daughters came in from out of town, I went.</span> <span id="s831">And I was able to say, “Dr. Gambetti, I don’t understand Italian.”</span> <span id="s832">And I was able to close the door and say, “You have to hear me,” because his mind was someplace else, and I was handling a lot, a lot of money on grants.</span> <span id="s833">And I retired from there just in time, before -- as the health industry is changing, there’s no more Division of Neuropathology, as far as the hospital is concerned.</span> <span id="s834">I had hospital work, and bulk of my work was Case Western Reserve University, because of the research, and they eventually hired another secretary, she took my place as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s835">And I ended up handling grants, and I kept screaming, “I trained to be a secretary, not a bookkeeper.”</span> <span id="s836">Finally got the stuff on the computer, and it was double work, because the computer did not communicate with the accounting department of Case Western Reserve University.</span> <span id="s837">So I was projecting on the computer, and multiplying, but then I still had statements every month.</span> <span id="s838">And I just didn’t like my work any more, because I didn’t do the manuscripts.</span> <span id="s839">You know, the word processors came out.</span> <span id="s840">I didn’t read them over and over.</span> <span id="s841">Today they are all type, they are all manuscripts more or less, change them, you know, on the word processors.</span> <span id="s842">So it just wasn’t the same and the set up with the administrators who are changing, and I got out just in time.</span> <span id="s843">I don’t think I could have survived it.</span> <span id="s844">But I learned a lot, my mind was working and he gave me a party when I retired, Dr. Gambetti.</span> <span id="s845">No secretary had what I had.</span> <span id="s846">He -- Dr. Russman, the ass-associate director, had a daughter who was doing, on the side or second job, or whate -- she did catering on her own, and we went to the conference room in one of the -- in the Bowwell Center.</span> <span id="s847">And he gave me a going away party with beef tenderloin, white wine, flowers, you name it.</span> <span id="s848">And I know what displeased me is I had to invite everybody in the -- in the Institute of Pathology, even the people I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s849">I had to think of people from Case Western Reserve that I had a lot of contact, from the hospital.</span> <span id="s850">I think I had about 100 - 110 people.</span> <span id="s851">And we had a storm that day.</span> <span id="s852">My girlfriend from Beria never made it, they were iced in.</span> <span id="s853">And they presented me with a gift certificate that just about covered a cruise, because I told -- I was so tired, I was trying to wind up everything, not to leave loose ends, be -- by the time I left, and it didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s854">Everything changed afterwards, anyway.</span> <span id="s855">And that’s the going away he gave me.</span> <span id="s856">I went shortly after, with a tray of candy and was able to write a note, “I know it’s because of you that I had this.”</span> <span id="s857">Today they couldn’t do it, because the money isn’t there, but that’s -- that’s what I got as a going away for retiring.</span> <span id="s858">It was such a different environment than the sewing industry, especially in the small shops.</span> <span id="s859">I worked in -- in the sewing industry I worked with, at the time, many Polish immigr -- DP’s actually, who had gone through anti-Semitism, the camps.</span> <span id="s860">And when you sew, your mind is not occupied, so they would tr -- you know, they would talk about different things.</span> <span id="s861">And they -- I was raised whatever I do is good enough, and I was not afraid of anything.</span> <span id="s862">I mean, tar -- I was a shy girl and everything, I mean, talk about what was left, after that I just blossomed out until I wasn’t afraid of anything, and I wasn’t afraid to speak back.</span> <span id="s863">And it -- the store I worked in, it was the couple who owned it.</span> <span id="s864">He was low key, she was -- I don’t know why these people were afraid of her, she used to come down and I don’t know.</span> <span id="s865">The bookkeeper was an American born American, and she thought she was something better than anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: You’re talking about the alteration store?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: The alterations, and the store, she -- I mean, I faced her -- I -- I was not -- I was not concern, I mean I just put her straight.</span> <span id="s868">And I used -- I remember one time, I say, “What are you afraid of?”</span> <span id="s869">I says, “We all leave, they can’t keep the store going, they need us.”</span> <span id="s870">You know, there was six or seven of us working there.</span> <span id="s871">So, when I left there, my biggest pleasure was, as I was going to school and working there, and I decided I had to give up the working, ya -- because I couldn’t practice my typing.</span> <span id="s872">I did well in shorthand, but not in typing, and I just couldn’t keep up.</span> <span id="s873">My husband was hospitalized out of town, and I was driving back and forth on the weekend.</span> <span id="s874">And my biggest pleasure was when I went in and I was hired, through University Hospitals, I bought a used car, and I went in, because I had befriended -- her name is -- was Litta Ridman, she was 80 years old at the time.</span> <span id="s875">And I came in with the keys, and I said -- not knowing what I was walking into, I said, “I’m secretary to the professor of neuropathology at Western Reserve University,” and was it Fran, the bookkeeper or was it the owner Mr. Philips, who say, “What’s neuropathology?”</span> <span id="s876">And as a foreigner, it made me feel so gra, because I don’t know why, in the small stores, they just -- they try to -- to make you look down.</span> <span id="s877">And the head fitter was a German woman, Jewish woman, who knew less than I did in alterations, I guess, for some reason or other, she had learned, and really was -- at times she was alright.</span> <span id="s878">She had a husband who had MS or something.</span> <span id="s879">She had problems, but I just put my foot down, because I said, “She has problems, so do I.” And I remember a couple times, I took a gown and I threw it at her, because I knew more than she did as far -- nobody could take away the sewing from me.</span> <span id="s880">Took me a hard time struggling to become a secretary because I was confident in sewing, but not as a secretary.</span> <span id="s881">B-Yet after working there, it worked out all right.</span> <span id="s882">I mean, I was confident, I was comfortable, I was respected and I worked in an environment that, you know, the hospi -- it wasn’t even the hospital, it really is pathology, neuropathol -- you know, you get cornered in one small division -- where I was respected, and there -- there -- there ca -- there th -- you had MD’s, Ph.D.’s, and very play -- you know, nobody put on the air, you were accepted, on -- on -- on -- on a same level.</span> <span id="s883">So I -- I worked myself out, and I started, quote, living.</span> <span id="s884">It’s not a full life.</span> <span id="s885">My son went off to Kent, married.</span> <span id="s886">I have three beautiful granddaughters.</span> <span id="s887">One just graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s888">She is off to college in va -- in Virginia, she’s off to college.</span> <span id="s889">Alicia just turned 18, Whitney will be 16 in September, and Erica, the little one, just was Bats Mitzvahed in May.</span> <span id="s890">And I hoped to go back and forth to Virginia, really.</span> <span id="s891">Besides, I’ve been traveling on a trip, a big trip once a year.</span> <span id="s892">And it’s hard to see my grandchildren grow up, because I look at them and think to myself, “Oh my God, that’s the age I was that Germans walked in on that time.”</span> <span id="s893">And things are surfacing, I guess, that maybe I pushed back, that I didn’t want to face.</span> <span id="s894">I have guilt feelings, when things are very, very bad for me.</span> <span id="s895">Not lately, so much.</span> <span id="s896">When I’ve gone through difficult times, I have felt that I was being punished, that I deserved it, because I didn’t suffer the same as my family did.</span> <span id="s897">And it -- it just happens every so often, and I think what I’m going to do now is try to call it quote, finalize.</span> <span id="s898">I’m going to look into a trip to go [indecipherable] feeling -- and I know there’s nothing there, to go to yadva -- to -- not to Yad Vashem, to Auschwitz, just to get it out of my system.</span> <span id="s899">And for many years, I thought, oh maybe my sister is floating around someplace, and doesn’t know where she is.</span> <span id="s900">And I think, as I get older, I realize how alone I am.</span> <span id="s901">I have no sisters, I have no nieces.</span> <span id="s902">My husband comes from a ra -- broken family, and I have no nieces and nephews.</span> <span id="s903">The fe -- cousins that I have -- I have one that I’m pretty close with.</span> <span id="s904">But he’s quite ill now, is -- as it is, their children live in the same area where my son lives, all three of them.</span> <span id="s905">But I have, as far as family, family, but I ha -- I have no close ties.</span> <span id="s906">But I have -- still have friends from -- I met when I came to the States.</span> <span id="s907">My girlfriend Esther, with whom I’m very, very close, died many, many years ago, of breast cancer.</span> <span id="s908">Many years ago.</span> <span id="s909">And I have two of the -- the girls that I met from the sorority that I consider family.</span> <span id="s910">I go there -- I -- I’m not invited, I’m expected.</span> <span id="s911">But what happens, we’re all getting older, so now the children are doing the holidays and it so happen they’re out of town.</span> <span id="s912">So, my life is changing a little bit, you know, as far as that’s concerned.</span> <span id="s913">But they’re -- they’re two friends -- I have other ones too, that I can depend on, and I consider family, but you realize, I don’t know why, it scares me sometimes, because I don’t want to get depressed, I don’t want to run into -- to the elderly lev -- you know, left alone or something like that.</span> <span id="s914">And -- And to feel, you know, I do -- I do get down, but everybody does at one time or other.</span> <span id="s915">I seem to overcome it, and I’m very thankful for what I have, really.</span> <span id="s916">I’m comfortable financially.</span> <span id="s917">I take one big trip, at least once a year.</span> <span id="s918">Went to the -- a national parts la -- parks last year with a friend.</span> <span id="s919">The year before, I was in France.</span> <span id="s920">I have plans to go to Iceland in September.</span> <span id="s921">I’ve gone with Elder Hostel, and I go for short trips to an Elder Hostel with a friend, or I’ve gone by myself.</span> <span id="s922">I went to Equador by myself, had a strange room mate, the same thing to France, and that’s about it, really.</span> <span id="s923">But the guilt -- the guilt -- the guilt is there, the guilt is.</span> <span id="s924">Although I don’t face real hard times, like when my husband was ill, and things came up, and it’s a terrible, terrible feeling.</span> <span id="s925">I used to also shudder when I used to hear the airplanes, when they had the propellers, but now they have the jets.</span> <span id="s926">But I -- When the airplanes used to go, I just -- just absolutely shuddered, but now with the prope -- with the jets, you don’t get it, so I -- I don’t feel it any more.</span> <span id="s927">I don’t quite have the nightmares I used to -- to have.</span> <span id="s928">I guess I’m settling, I guess.</span> <span id="s929">Trying to enjoy my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s930">Not one of them belongs to me, they all take after the father’s side of the family, their grandfather, and the middle one takes after her mother’s side of the family, because one is strawberry blonde, two redheads.</span> <span id="s931">And the eyes and the shapes, there isn’t one that belongs to my side of the family, nothing’s come out.</span> <span id="s932">But, make the best of it.</span> <span id="s933">So, I’m not unhappy, it’s maybe not a full life, but I’m contented, make the best of it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: I have few questions.</span> <span id="s935">One is, if you’re -- just talking about your idea of going to Auschwitz to get -- to get it out of your system --</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: -- and I -- and I -- it reminded me of what you said about after you arrived in the U.S., and -- and your aunt had wanted you go and say yisker for your mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: -- and you weren’t ready, because you didn’t want to bury her.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Is this kind of like saying I’m ready to -- to bury her, or did that ever happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: I -- I’m -- You know, first of all, when I went back to Belgium, 10 years after I came -- a year after my father died, my aunt brought up some of the ho-horrors, which I didn’t want to listen to.</span> <span id="s943">And then people started talking about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s944">I never -- When I talked about it, I talked about my years in hiding, things like that.</span> <span id="s945">I did not talk about what happened in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s946">When it really, really surfaced is when I was interviewed for the museum, and I had to bring all that up.</span> <span id="s947">I had to dig in on -- oh, and I saw -- I saw Rachelle in Israel, spent a -- a night -- a day with her.</span> <span id="s948">I dug into a lot of things, and then I worked with a young man, I can’t think -- I have his name written down, and he sent me -- I have the papers that show the number of th -- their records that were kept in Liège, of the numbers of the transport.</span> <span id="s949">And I guess -- No, I think I’ve accepted it, I just -- I just -- there’s some -- I don’t know if I’ll go, but I’m going to look into it, just to -- I don’t know what good it’ll do just to -- I don’t know why, I mean it’s not going to do any good.</span> <span id="s950">There’s very little left, I’m aware of it.</span> <span id="s951">And maybe go and see eastern Europe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s952">I don’t know why I have to do it.</span> <span id="s953">But I’ve accepted a long time ago, if you can accept some -- something like that, there’s still -- I don’t know, some feelings or something.</span> <span id="s954">And now, with the grandchildren sometimes asking questions, it -- it has -- it has to -- it has to be accepted.</span> <span id="s955">I mean, there’s no two ways about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: What do your grandchildren ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s958">Not much, not much, not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: You were mentioning earlier that -- that one of them is particularly interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: The little one has asked me -- excuse me -- more questions.</span> <span id="s961">Sh -- I had her in the car with me, by myself, and she said, “Your mother died,” or something like that, and she started asking me -- when she just did a -- a project on immigration, and I gave her all the papers, and she did ask me why I left my father, which was very hard for me to explain.</span> <span id="s962">You know, there’s -- there were such hard feelings, there’s no -- no need to bring it up any more, it’s in -- in the past, and I just told her my father thought it was better for me to be with my aunt.</span> <span id="s963">She’s asked me more questions.</span> <span id="s964">Alicia, I guess through projects in school, I remember I had to tell her something, and I can’t remember what.</span> <span id="s965">Whitney, the middle one, has never asked me any questions, but that doesn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s966">My son never asked questions either.</span> <span id="s967">I did hide the pictures, because everybody had died, and yet, when he le -- heard about -- that’s how I found out about the museum, and he told me about it, he apparently was very well aware of it, and what’s interesting is he named -- Whitney, the middle one -- I don’t know how you -- they ended up with Whitney after my mother, he said that it should always be remembered.</span> <span id="s968">And even when the girls have the Bats Mitzvah, he does bring up that my family perished in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s969">It’s interesting, because I was never very traditional.</span> <span id="s970">He was not Bar Mitzahed, but he became very close with the temple, and the -- the girls are very -- course, well, he became involved somehow or other, even though I never pushed it.</span> <span id="s971">And I did all this for my children, so lot of things surfaced when I did the interviews, and things.</span> <span id="s972">As a matter of fact, my son, when he was in Kent -- I didn’t mention it, when he went to Kent, they had the Yom Kippur war, and he raised money for i -- for i -- for Israel.</span> <span id="s973">He and his room mate, they lived in the Hillel House, the Hi-Hillel had rented a house and he -- and he’s still friends with this guy, occupied the third floor, the upstairs.</span> <span id="s974">And they raised money for Israel.</span> <span id="s975">They made the national news as a matter of fact, because they raised money for -- he had -- it was a ham operator and when he told me was president of Hillel, I almost flipped because, I mean, you know, so I guess even though I was not traditional in keeping the holidays, so to speak, and things like that, there’s some Jewishness in him and the girls are -- went through Bats Mitzvah and everything like that, so something is projected on him.</span> <span id="s976">And it’s hard to tell with Alicia how much she feels or how much she does or -- you never know, and first of all, they live long distance.</span> <span id="s977">Maybe if they lived in town, it would be different, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s978">Whitney’s the only one who never asked, but she’s the quiet one.</span> <span id="s979">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Frida Wallenstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: -- and so, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: You’re doing very well, but I know it’s hard.</span> <span id="s984">I appreciate you doing it.</span> <span id="s985">I wanted to ask you about -- about speaking, too, because you were mentioning about your -- the testimony that you did for the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s986">I believe that was in 1990.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s988">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: And -- And you mentioned that it was -- that it was difficult to talk about it.</span> <span id="s990">Was that the first time that you had sat down and -- and tried to tell your story, through, of what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Yes, that was the first time.</span> <span id="s992">That was the very first time, and I really had to dig, and you know, sh -- I remember her saying, “How did you feel?”</span> <span id="s993">I had to stop and think, I mean, how did I feel?</span> <span id="s994">I don’t know, it’s not things that I think about.</span> <span id="s995">So you have to dig up all these memories and all these feelings.</span> <span id="s996">How did you feel?</span> <span id="s997">I -- I don’t know how I felt, I had to stop and think.</span> <span id="s998">Was I scared?</span> <span id="s999">Sure, we were scared at times.</span> <span id="s1000">What did I feel when my mother -- when I found out about my mother being deported?</span> <span id="s1001">I remember crying in Brussels, I remember, and Madame Freidman forced me to go to -- I hated her, but she forced me to go to the shul, she thought it would be better for me.</span> <span id="s1002">You float around, you have no thoughts.</span> <span id="s1003">Why I came to the States?</span> <span id="s1004">Who knows?</span> <span id="s1005">I have no idea -- I really don’t know, you -- you do things, you -- you don’t think.</span> <span id="s1006">I -- I didn’t have an average teenage life.</span> <span id="s1007">I mean, I look at my grandchildren and I don’t know what I would have done.</span> <span id="s1008">Of course, no matter what war, not war, every generation i-is different The kids are so much more aware than we were.</span> <span id="s1009">There’s television, there’s e-mail, there’s internet.</span> <span id="s1010">I mean, they’re -- we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1011">We didn’t -- We didn’t question, we didn’t ask.</span> <span id="s1012">I mean, children were to be seen and not heard, so I don’t know, don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s1013">So, I have to dig in, to really stop and think, and remember things.</span> <span id="s1014">I know -- I don’t even know if we were really cousin, my c -- we refer to her as cousin, her name is also Frida.</span> <span id="s1015">She lived in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1016">I came to the States, and I found out years later that she went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1017">She married -- She married a French Algerian and she lives in Paris, and I’ve seen her twice, and then we dig into things and some things she remembers and some things I remember.</span> <span id="s1018">But the first time this came about -- I don’t think it did the second time, she -- she had to wake me up during the night because I had nightmares.</span> <span id="s1019">When I was in Paris two years ago, and my cousin Miriam came in from Brussels, we spend the day together, she had questions about her father and thing.</span> <span id="s1020">And I had to stop and think, because we grew up as -- we didn’t question, you know.</span> <span id="s1021">Turn it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: Is th -- Have you -- Did you find, when you did your testimony for the Holocaust Museum in 1990, was it important to you in some way, to have talked about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: I did it originally to -- to -- what made me do it, because my son wanted me to do it.</span> <span id="s1024">I think until then, I did not appreciate the importance of having testimonies, you know, so that, well, the non-believers will never believe it happened, but that there should be something that -- from survivors, t-to prove that these things really existed.</span> <span id="s1025">I never thought of it in those terms before, never thought of it until Mark called me.</span> <span id="s1026">As a matter of fa -- I didn’t think they would take my -- my -- my story, because when he first told them, I says, “Mark, they won’t be interested, because I was not in the concentration camps.”</span> <span id="s1027">But apparently it was more than just for -- from people in the concentration camps, so -- but I didn’t -- I didn’t see the importance of it until -- until then.</span> <span id="s1028">And -- And now, with the girls getting older, the grandchildren getting older and asking questions, and things like that, I feel it’s important that there’s testimony, what it -- what will happen years later, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1029">Look what’s happening in Yugosla -- it still goes on, it doesn’t stop it, but at least there’s proof, whoever wants to believe it, to know that it really happened.</span> <span id="s1030">And we’re slowly dying off, so there isn’t -- you know, a lot of people have died since, and cannot testify.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: And for yourself, personally, was it important in any way, or is it not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: I never -- I never thought of it as being important for me.</span> <span id="s1033">I only thought of it as being important for my -- for my son, and for my grandchildren, is -- I felt it was important.</span> <span id="s1034">I, for myself, I mean, no, I didn’t -- I didn’t think of it that way, anyway, no.</span> <span id="s1035">And I’m doing this also because of that, because it’s very difficult, you have to dig up memories that are very difficult, you have to dig up feelings, you have to expose your feelings.</span> <span id="s1036">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: [indecipherable] You were talking a little earlier about your -- your work, in the doctor’s office, and I just wanted to know when -- when you started that work, and -- and when you retired?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: I retired December, 1991, the end of the year.</span> <span id="s1039">I worked for 27 years.</span> <span id="s1040">When did I start?</span> <span id="s1041">1975 - 1976, is when I started, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: And then -- And then, before that, you were talking about how you had -- you’d worked in the -- in -- in alterations, and that you had had trouble with -- when you were looking for work, is it -- as a seamstress, was it the Jewish Social Services, or -- did you find that -- that, during that time when you were struggling to find work, were y -- did you feel that you were being discriminated against in some way, or not respected, or what was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: No, no, y-you mean, the w -- to find work?</span> <span id="s1044">I had no trouble finding work in alterations.</span> <span id="s1045">That was wide open.</span> <span id="s1046">There was no money in it, that’s what made me leave.</span> <span id="s1047">Bec -- I didn’t go for the department stores for some reason or other.</span> <span id="s1048">I went to the small shops, and sewing industry is predominantly Jewish, and I worked with, you know, a -- in -- in those days, DP’s.</span> <span id="s1049">I mean, today it’s entirely different.</span> <span id="s1050">I left because first of all my mind -- your -- y-your mind is not occupied, so you talk, and you bring up things.</span> <span id="s1051">I was having problems because my husband was ill at the time, and -- and y-you have too much time -- y-your mind is free.</span> <span id="s1052">In other words, your hands are busy, but not your mind.</span> <span id="s1053">And I needed a better income than doing alterations.</span> <span id="s1054">As a matter of fact, I just bought something in one of the department stores, and I had a pair of pants shortened, because I don’t have the -- the mach -- my machine is old and it doesn’t have some of the stuff that I need.</span> <span id="s1055">And I -- I don’t sew any more, and I did talk to the -- the woman who fitted me.</span> <span id="s1056">It’s -- I asked her -- she’s from Greece, I don’t know what her background is, and I let her know that I was a fitter, cause the first one I had was terrible, was somebody new, new in the country and I knew she was not a fitter.</span> <span id="s1057">And I asked for a real fitter.</span> <span id="s1058">Anyway, she came and she said she was from Greece, and I let her know the training, and you know, my background.</span> <span id="s1059">And I said I luckily left it, because they didn’t pay.</span> <span id="s1060">And she did tell me that it pays much better.</span> <span id="s1061">I says, but not as well, probably, as the tailors, because the tailors supported the families, even if they did alteration, and she said yes, it was on the same par.</span> <span id="s1062">So I guess things have changed.</span> <span id="s1063">I don’t know which -- at which point in life, but at the time -- at the time I did alterations, I even -- I did well.</span> <span id="s1064">The dress shop where I had worked before I went to school, I -- they were paying a dollar and a quarter an hour, I got a dollar and a half.</span> <span id="s1065">I ti -- he asked me to come and help.</span> <span id="s1066">And I went -- A friend of mine, who was a secretary says, “Frida,” she says --I was very nervous, very self-conscious about becoming a secretary, I -- my foreign background, and this and that.</span> <span id="s1067">And she said, “Go on temporaries, that’s a good way to start.”</span> <span id="s1068">And I got a job for one day at -- at a TV station.</span> <span id="s1069">And I remember -- What did I make?</span> <span id="s1070">In -- th -- Mr. Philips called me back.</span> <span id="s1071">Oh, and I said, “Unless you pay me two dollars an,” -- oh yeah, they were paying me two dollars an hour, temporary.</span> <span id="s1072">I didn’t know -- I didn’t do anything, I di -- and he -- he never -- he never took me, so -- and there were long layoff seasons.</span> <span id="s1073">They weren’t fair in the way they were laying off people.</span> <span id="s1074">M -- Talking small store, and if I was five minutes late, I lost the five minutes.</span> <span id="s1075">And I went to work for University Hospitals, for some reason or other, I don’t remember what I paid for bread yesterday, but I -- that was two dollars an hour, even at 40 hours, which I didn’t put in, it would have been 80 dollars, and I was --what did I earn?</span> <span id="s1076">Oh, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1077">I want -- I wa -- I was earning so much more it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1078">I mean, there’s no comparison, and like I say, and a -- I retired with a pension, which I -- I don’t know if the stores do it, and the small stores are slowly disappearing.</span> <span id="s1079">They can’t survive with all the -- all this -- chain stores, so that’s what made me leave, I knew I had to support myself in a different way and I said, I don’t care what I do, I never, never want to face what I faced when my son was seven year old, where I did not have money to go buy food to feed him.</span> <span id="s1080">And it never happened again, so I -- I -- I had illnesses, I had surgeries, I never lost a day’s work which wouldn’t have happened in those days in the sewing industry.</span> <span id="s1081">And the factories, th-the sewing factories, the garment far -- factory had slowly, over the years, moved south for -- for lower wages, and now, of course, they come from overseas, so I had to get out of -- of that environment.</span> <span id="s1082">And whether the department stores pay better, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1083">Sometimes I think I should wan -- go back for a little bit part time, just to learn to deal with the new fabrics, and the new things.</span> <span id="s1084">I still -- I still, I think, have a touch for it.</span> <span id="s1085">I went through a period where I sewed all my clothes, I’m very had to fit.</span> <span id="s1086">But you can’t get the fabrics in Cleveland any more.</span> <span id="s1087">There’s one fabric shop left, but you da -- can’t get the fine wools, and the silks, and the -- I can’t even knit, because there are no knit shops.</span> <span id="s1088">I can’t get the yarns, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1089">That’s what I miss.</span> <span id="s1090">But I have no regret that I went to -- to where -- to what I did, the environment was entirely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: What year was your son born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: October 14, 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: And you were married when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: I was married novem -- wait a minute, I was married November nine, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: How did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: A girlfriend went someplace, and my husband was there and I don’t know, somehow or other, something came up about my speaking French, and he had studied French, and that’s how -- he called me, and that’s how I met him.</span> <span id="s1097">I was going with someone from South Bend, Indiana at the time.</span> <span id="s1098">I remember going by train to South Bend, Indiana.</span> <span id="s1099">I had a distant cousin there, where I had spent some time, and I had met somebody.</span> <span id="s1100">That’s how I met my husband, to a girlfriend -- through a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1101">And he called me because he had studied French, and he remembered.</span> <span id="s1102">He has a fantastic memory.</span> <span id="s1103">And that’s how I met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: What was his profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: He was podiatrist.</span> <span id="s1106">He was in school at the time.</span> <span id="s1107">He was in school, he had two mo -- it was supposed to be one year, and the year he was there, he -- they extended the class to two years.</span> <span id="s1108">And graduated, and he went into podiatry.</span> <span id="s1109">But in those days they were called chiropodists, and they didn’t have -- they were very limited on what they could do, you know.</span> <span id="s1110">No surgery, they couldn’t even prescribe an aspirin or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1111">And we moved to Sandusky and then just -- no matter how hard he tried it, it never -- it never took off.</span> <span id="s1112">That’s why we came back to Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1113">His illness, and then whatever.</span> <span id="s1114">And then I couldn’t go to work in Sandusky because I was married to a doctor and I didn’t have a profession.</span> <span id="s1115">And it was through somebody I had befriended there, that she suggested I do alterations at home, and I says, “Wait a minute, I don’t do alterations, I’m a dressma -- I know how to make a garment, but I don’t know alternations.”</span> <span id="s1116">And it was through her -- I would make hems and things like that, and I made a little bit of money on the side.</span> <span id="s1117">And that’s how I went into alterations when I came back to Cleveland, because I tried the sewing factory, but the sewing industry was not the same, I couldn’t earn money or -- or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1118">And I couldn’t ear-earn enough to support my son.</span> <span id="s1119">And eventually, the Social Security laws came out, so I was able to earn, and I got Social Secur -- just as I got my job at University Hospitals, I got Social Security for him and for my son, until he reached, you know, age where they didn’t give it.</span> <span id="s1120">So that helped me, because I couldn’t -- I couldn’t survive on what I was making.</span> <span id="s1121">I was a -- making 80 -- 80 something dollar -- 80 -- was it 86 dollars a week, or something.</span> <span id="s1122">87.50, now I remember, a week.</span> <span id="s1123">As opposed to a dollar and a quarter, or a dollar and a half an hour.</span> <span id="s1124">And then I had benefits.</span> <span id="s1125">I had sick days.</span> <span id="s1126">And when -- I used to get sick every three weeks, not every month, I needed a day off.</span> <span id="s1127">I was, you know, in bed.</span> <span id="s1128">So, a-all together, it worked out very nicely.</span> <span id="s1129">And it was a different environment.</span> <span id="s1130">I never thought of going into an intellectual background, but it was marvelous.</span> <span id="s1131">I mean, it was very enlightening.</span> <span id="s1132">We had what they call now Research Associate they call them.</span> <span id="s1133">People who came from different countries for two years, to do research.</span> <span id="s1134">So you had a very diversified background, and it was very -- it was very good, it was very enlightening, it was not backbreaking, you know.</span> <span id="s1135">If I had stayed in the sewing industry, I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be even living here, even though it’s not high rent or anything.</span> <span id="s1136">I would -- I would be on subsidi -- I would have to be in subsidized apartments.</span> <span id="s1137">Nothing wrong with it, I know a lot of people in it, but at least I’m free to come and go, and -- as I want, and live where I want, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Course, yeah, that came out of my tape, I know.</span> <span id="s1140">I did not feel different at any time for being Jewish while I grew up in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Mm-hm, yeah, that did come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: That did come out, because that is very true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Well, I -- we were just talking a little bit off tape about your experience in coming to the -- to the U.S. and I wondered if you would talk a little bit about that again, about the religion question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1149">Oh, I -- I knew I was coming to a melting spot.</span> <span id="s1150">I mean, I didn’t understand the -- the -- the real details, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1151">I knew, even with the -- with the slavery, but didn’t understand the full extent of it, until I lived with it and was exposed to it.</span> <span id="s1152">And when I would go someplace and fill out a -- when I went to Lampole, which is -- was a sewing factory, one of the big ones in Cleveland, and I was shocked that they ask what my nationality was.</span> <span id="s1153">And when I told -- I don’t remember who I told, my family, somebody, I said, “I marked Czechoslovakia.”</span> <span id="s1154">And they said, “You should have said Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1155">I says, “Jewish is a religion, it’s not a nationality.”</span> <span id="s1156">I had to argue wh-why are people so conscious of what religion somebody is.</span> <span id="s1157">I will discuss the differences if I have a-an -- an intelligent conversation.</span> <span id="s1158">I worked with an Indian girl, you know, from India.</span> <span id="s1159">I worked with a Black -- what they call a-an African American girl, and that was the beginning of -- where the -- the Blacks were, you know, being absorbed, and things like that, and talk openly -- I will talk about it.</span> <span id="s1160">But, people will say to me about somebody, “Are they ja -- is he, or is she Jewish?”</span> <span id="s1161">I says, “It never entered my mind to ask.”</span> <span id="s1162">Because I take a person the way they are an-an-and I -- and I don’t think what are they.</span> <span id="s1163">I couldn’t understand, also, why they went into ethnic backgrounds, but I’m learning, I’m learning.</span> <span id="s1164">It’s interesting to find what is their background, you know, where their parents came from, because those are cultures.</span> <span id="s1165">That I can understand.</span> <span id="s1166">We’ll discuss the -- I -- I would like to take a class in comparative religion, because I don’t know anything about the Islamic religion, and I think it’s very interesting, they all have their points.</span> <span id="s1167">And that is something that really amazed me, w -- and at the time, I did not understand what’s the difference what my nationality is, but now I understand.</span> <span id="s1168">It’s just -- I just took a class on immigration, through the elder campus at Tri-C, and the professor was very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s1169">He happened to be Slov-Slovenian?</span> <span id="s1170">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1171">And he had taught at Case Western Reserve and everything.</span> <span id="s1172">And we reached a point about the bilingual, the Spanish.</span> <span id="s1173">And I told him he opened my eyes.</span> <span id="s1174">I always felt, wait a minute, I spoke French, nobody bothered to have things translated in French, explain -- I had to learn English.</span> <span id="s1175">Everybody who came had to learn English.</span> <span id="s1176">And he pointed out to -- to us that Spanish, you take Mexico, Texas, they were the Spanish people, and the British were stronger, so the -- the English wa -- language prevailed, and everything Anglican took over.</span> <span id="s1177">And I looked at him, and I says -- he said, “Oh, they didn’t emigrate.</span> <span id="s1178">They were forced into becoming part of the -- you know, of ameri -- part of the United States, and the English language was dumped into them, but that’s taking away what is right for them.”</span> <span id="s1179">And I said, “Okay, now I understand, now I’m willing to accept that it should be, if necessary, bilingual.”</span> <span id="s1180">First of all, it wouldn’t hurt, but you think, “Wait a minute, I barely spoke any English, I had to learn English.”</span> <span id="s1181">But I can see their point, and I knew that the streets were not paved with gold, that much I knew.</span> <span id="s1182">How hard it was to work, I don’t know, I was never made to [indecipherable] work, the factory flabbergasted me, because there were rows of machines, and it was piecework, and I was used to have one garment at the time, hand finished.</span> <span id="s1183">I remember going with my girlfriend Elaine shopping for clothes and what I used to do is turn everything inside out to see if it was finished.</span> <span id="s1184">And she didn’t want to go shopping, because even in those days, everything, you know, was -- was unfinished on the inside.</span> <span id="s1185">And I learned to -- to do piecework.</span> <span id="s1186">And then you had the oil that went around constantly around the machine.</span> <span id="s1187">They also had -- They didn’t have a lunchroom, per se, they had a room where you brought your lunch, and -- and you ate in that back room.</span> <span id="s1188">But you have to realize in the sewing factories, in the summertime, you worked on winter clothes.</span> <span id="s1189">Wool, the lint.</span> <span id="s1190">And we always changed clothes.</span> <span id="s1191">I had what they call wrap around, they don’t see them any more.</span> <span id="s1192">And I was just flabbergasted that that were the circumstances.</span> <span id="s1193">I wanted to take up dressmaking and dress designing again, and the foreman, Mr. Harris, I remember his name, said to me, “Frida, don’t waste your time in Cleveland, you have to go to New York.”</span> <span id="s1194">And then I met my husband and I got married, so I never went through with it.</span> <span id="s1195">But I had learned through somebody about Prinz beeterman.</span> <span id="s1196">They made suits and coats, and they made a better garment.</span> <span id="s1197">Some things were still finished by hand.</span> <span id="s1198">And I had put an application in and I think I had put an application for hand sewing for some reason or other, and they never called me.</span> <span id="s1199">And somebody -- I ran into somebody who said they were hired.</span> <span id="s1200">So I re-contacted Prinz beeterman, and I went to work there where the conditions were much, much better.</span> <span id="s1201">I made a lot more money by the hour.</span> <span id="s1202">I was making a dollar something at Prinz beeterman, I went -- I mean at Lampoles.</span> <span id="s1203">Went to Prinz beeterman, and I went up as high as three dollars something an hour piecework.</span> <span id="s1204">And we had a lunchroom and everything.</span> <span id="s1205">So the -- the environment was entirely -- entirely different.</span> <span id="s1206">It was whiter, it was cleaner.</span> <span id="s1207">And you have to realize, you worked in the sewing factory, sometimes it reached a hundred degrees in the work room.</span> <span id="s1208">I think one of the -- it was a si -- a knit factory, I can’t think of the name, they were not far from where we were on Euclid, and they moved in the suburbs, and they had air conditioning, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1209">And then I was told at -- how bad it was -- I don’t know what years it was, where they had the fire in New York, in the garment factories, because of the condition and they didn’t care about their people.</span> <span id="s1210">So these are the things that -- I think that awed me that -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1211">And then I used to think, oh, I reached a point in my life I used to think, wonder what my life would have been if I would have stayed in Belgium?</span> <span id="s1212">I don’t think I would have struggled as hard as I did after I came to the States.</span> <span id="s1213">The hardest part, financially, was when my husband was ill and hospitalized, first for six months, then he was all right for three years, went back into practice.</span> <span id="s1214">I worked for him.</span> <span id="s1215">An -- B-But the first time with no money -- I mean, no money.</span> <span id="s1216">Two months behind in the rent, utilities, you name it.</span> <span id="s1217">And I had no one to turn to.</span> <span id="s1218">I must say that the small Jewish community in Sandusky rallied, and somebody came to my -- to the house and ask me if I needed anything.</span> <span id="s1219">As it is, I didn’t need it, because my husband’s brother gave us 500 dollars, we -- which helped me overcome the worst of it, and then I sold the house.</span> <span id="s1220">I didn’t make any money on it, but I salvaged some money and moved to Cleveland, which a -- I figured, I wonder -- the rent was 90 - 96 dollars, and then they raised it 10 dollars.</span> <span id="s1221">And I figured, as long as the money lasts, I’ll stay there.</span> <span id="s1222">And it turned out all right.</span> <span id="s1223">My husband came out of the hospital, went into practice and we got on our feet, quote, financially, and managed to survive.</span> <span id="s1224">And then -- I wasn’t wealthy, but I was -- I had my head above water.</span> <span id="s1225">And my concern was always, I left an eight year old child at home alone while I went to work.</span> <span id="s1226">He had no way of reaching me at the factory.</span> <span id="s1227">And luckily, it was through some friends who lived in the same complex, that I knew they kept an eye on Mark.</span> <span id="s1228">Like, he came home for lunch, and I would prepare his lunch, and I had a little TV tray -- table so he could have it, and years, years later, I -- some people would made comment because he went to Kent State University, and when he’d come home, I would have a glass of milk, and I would have a sandwich wrapped, and people used to make comments about it, and I said, “You didn’t have what I had, where I had to leave a child to come home to an empty house.”</span> <span id="s1229">I hate when -- I -- I like when people have comments, and my daughter-in-law teased for the longest time, because Mark was terrible in the morning, I couldn’t get him out of bed.</span> <span id="s1230">And the only way I could get him to sit up wa -- I used to squeeze fresh orange juice, and I would go and say, “Mark,” and I would hand him a glass of orange juice.</span> <span id="s1231">And that got -- that got him sitting up in bed.</span> <span id="s1232">But the -- the financial difficulties were really, really bad.</span> <span id="s1233">I don’t think I thought of that time of even going back or anything.</span> <span id="s1234">I also -- There were some hard feeling that I n -- that I never, never cleared my mind, is my father adored children.</span> <span id="s1235">He never came to see his grandson.</span> <span id="s1236">I did want to go back, and they offered me the fare for a boat or something, but I never told my father that I didn’t have any money and how badly I was struggling financially.</span> <span id="s1237">When I went back a year after he died, my uncle -- my father’s brother Josef was still living, and she said, “Why didn’t you ever tell your father?”</span> <span id="s1238">And I guess I had too much pride.</span> <span id="s1239">I never told him, I never -- and I understand he died, he had established his business.</span> <span id="s1240">My father died a well-to-do man, but I never -- I never asked for anything.</span> <span id="s1241">I guess we were raised -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Did you -- This is tape number three, side B.</span> <span id="s1243">Did you ever see your father again then, after you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1245">It was a Friday, early in the morning, we lived in Sandusky, and I got a phone call, it was the telegram office.</span> <span id="s1246">Didn’t speak French.</span> <span id="s1247">My uncle was sending me a telegram, and they said in French, “Ton pere decee,” and that’s when I screamed, because they were saying my father was deceased, and I screamed, and my husband came to the phone.</span> <span id="s1248">I had no money, I had no passport, and I never went, I never saw him again, never.</span> <span id="s1249">And I went back a year later.</span> <span id="s1250">And I went -- I saw his widow.</span> <span id="s1251">I found out that my father was very unhappily married.</span> <span id="s1252">He had imported a woman from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1253">You know, must say this, when I came to the States, the Americans thought Europeans were not discriminating because, well, we had a couple African from Belgium Congo, but you didn’t have the discrimination against the Black population, like here.</span> <span id="s1254">But you wonder why there is a war going on in Yugoslavia?</span> <span id="s1255">My father wouldn’t have touched a Polish woman.</span> <span id="s1256">The -- The Czechs didn’t like the Polish, the -- the Polish didn’t like the Lithuanian, I mean the -- i-i-it’s th-the ethnic background, it’s amazing, it does exist.</span> <span id="s1257">And she told me he never wa -- came.</span> <span id="s1258">He walked around with my mother’s pictures and my sister’s pictures.</span> <span id="s1259">And I went in to see her because my father had a ring from my mother, and I wanted it.</span> <span id="s1260">And I thought, if she’s wearing it, I was going to take it.</span> <span id="s1261">She wasn’t wearing it.</span> <span id="s1262">And they had a couple things that were salvaged from -- I guess when my mother was taken away.</span> <span id="s1263">I don’t even know who stored them, never found out, never asked.</span> <span id="s1264">And I guess everything came, and I took the train back to Brussels because my Uncle Josef had moved to Brussels, and the only family I had was in Brussels.</span> <span id="s1265">But I had gone to Liège because my father, very shortly, maybe two weeks before he died, had made out a will leaving everything to his wife.</span> <span id="s1266">And I found out that in Belgium you cannot disinherit a child.</span> <span id="s1267">S -- Thr-Through a school friend in Liège, I -- with whom I was still corresponding, she got me a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1268">I got a few dollars, not much.</span> <span id="s1269">I did go back to Belgium, but I had to go to Brussels, because my uncle was there, but the lawyer was in Liège.</span> <span id="s1270">And of course, I walked in on my father’s widow, and she did not know I was coming.</span> <span id="s1271">And I guess walking and seeing just a -- a couple personal belongings -- she did give me the linens my mother had made by hand, I still have them, as her trousseau when she was a young girl.</span> <span id="s1272">And I’ll never forget I went back to Belgium and it was dusk, and I was sitting in the living room, and I was crying.</span> <span id="s1273">And my aunt came in, and she says, “What are you crying like an imbecile?”</span> <span id="s1274">And I just could not -- I could not relate to her.</span> <span id="s1275">She’s -- I don’t know, she raves about her -- she’s crazy about her son, her daughter, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1276">And th -- She doesn’t have the warmth.</span> <span id="s1277">And she went through -- after they started picking up the Jews, they ended up in southern France.</span> <span id="s1278">They did have a hard time, they didn’t go out to camps, because -- I remember they said in one camp they deported the Hungarians, so they said they were Czech, and then the other camp they said deported the Czech, so they said they were Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1279">So they managed to survive.</span> <span id="s1280">They had two children.</span> <span id="s1281">And I don’t know what kind of camps they were, because I never asked.</span> <span id="s1282">Her -- My aunt’s family, she had a mother, a father, two sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s1283">When the Germans invaded Belgium, they got on a train -- see, we tried to go to -- to France, we didn’t know they were going to invade France, her family got on a train, and the whole family was killed from the bombing, from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1284">But yet, when I fell apart at the seams and came back to Brussels, and I was crying.</span> <span id="s1285">I just couldn’t -- I couldn’t explain to her, I was exposed to -- t-t-to -- to -- to my war years, to -- to -- to -- you know, living in the States, I put everything in the back.</span> <span id="s1286">I -- I -- I guess maybe I did it intentionally, I didn’t think of those things.</span> <span id="s1287">You push something out of your way, push things out of your mind, didn’t face what really happened in the camps.</span> <span id="s1288">And here I was, and I went back and all this faced me, and everything surfaced, and she just couldn’t -- I don’t think she could appreciate it.</span> <span id="s1289">So that’s the hard time I went through.</span> <span id="s1290">And I did tell her -- she wanted to know why I didn’t come as soon as my father died, because we had a business, and his widow emptied th-th-the stocks and things, so she didn’t pay the taxes the way it should, and I -- who even thought of it?</span> <span id="s1291">As difficult a time as I had with my father after the war, he was a fantastic father as children.</span> <span id="s1292">During the war he -- he -- we -- we had everything.</span> <span id="s1293">My father did Black Market.</span> <span id="s1294">We never went hungry.</span> <span id="s1295">He -- When he used to -- to go to the farmers and bring eggs and butter and salt on his bicycle, and -- and sell it.</span> <span id="s1296">We never -- We never went hungry.</span> <span id="s1297">So, what happened after, was the effect of whatever happened to him that maybe didn’t appreciate at the time.</span> <span id="s1298">Now that I have th -- what I know is guilt feelings, because you survived, I think maybe he had guilt feelings of having survived untouched.</span> <span id="s1299">Maybe it would have been different if he had gone out to the camps and survived, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1300">But as I matured and got older and faced the truth what happened, maybe he had guilt feelings.</span> <span id="s1301">I don’t know, he never talked about it.</span> <span id="s1302">And then, when my Uncle Gesa came, and I used to visit him quite often, I used to go to Denver about twice a year.</span> <span id="s1303">Went with Mark, then went by myself.</span> <span id="s1304">After surgery I went there.</span> <span id="s1305">And I used to say to him, “Why didn’t he come to the States to see his grandchild?”</span> <span id="s1306">And he just raised his shoulders and never answered, so I don’t know -- I don’t know why he came.</span> <span id="s1307">As a matter of fact, my cousin Miriam told me in Paris that he was very good to her.</span> <span id="s1308">He was very good to her, and what happened, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1309">As children, I mean, we were provided for, we had caring parents.</span> <span id="s1310">I don’t wish any more on any other child.</span> <span id="s1311">Financially, we didn’t have much.</span> <span id="s1312">I didn’t know what a doll was, I don’t think they ever bought me a doll.</span> <span id="s1313">I think the dolls I got was from the schools.</span> <span id="s1314">The schools, at Christmastime used to give -- I remember I had a doll.</span> <span id="s1315">You have to remember they were the breakable dolls.</span> <span id="s1316">And I remember I put it on the window sill, and there were some lu -- leftovers from the sewing my mother did, and the thing pushed the doll away and the doll broke, but they never replaced it.</span> <span id="s1317">Bicycles we had, because we needed it for transportation.</span> <span id="s1318">And after my accident -- I had an accident before we went into hiding.</span> <span id="s1319">I went out to the country with my sister Berta and another friend, and I don’t know what happened, we went ou -- I remember going uphill, and we had to walk and it was a hot day, and I wanted to sit down, and I -- I can’t place it this time if my sister said it, or the other girl said it, they say, “Oh, Frida, now the hill goes down.”</span> <span id="s1320">And I got on the bicycle, and I remember as if yesterday -- I don’t remember if it’s my sister or the other girl, yelled, “Frida, you’re losing your pedals.”</span> <span id="s1321">I fainted and I went down the hill in a fainted state.</span> <span id="s1322">I guess th-the power of rolling down.</span> <span id="s1323">And I went into -- I don’t know if it was -- it was a building, I don’t know if it was a castle.</span> <span id="s1324">And it was somebody of aristocracy, and they brought me back with their chauffeurs, to the house.</span> <span id="s1325">And I remember they gave my mother smelling salts, because one side of my face was damaged, and I must have had a slight brain concussion, because if somebody moved a chair or something, I couldn’t take the noise.</span> <span id="s1326">And my mother didn’t wanted me to ride a bicycle.</span> <span id="s1327">My father went -- somehow or other found a second hand bicycle, so, you know, things were not produced, and I got another bicycle.</span> <span id="s1328">So I had that accident, and then I had an accident three days before my birthday, my 17th birthday.</span> <span id="s1329">But whatever could be provided for us, schooling, we had private tutors to help us more, but not the arts, or music or anything.</span> <span id="s1330">First of all, I was not interested.</span> <span id="s1331">Berta was, but I guess they felt that it was not important, so we didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s1332">I remember going to an opera with a neighbor.</span> <span id="s1333">I went to see Faust.</span> <span id="s1334">But they did not participate in the arts in any way.</span> <span id="s1335">I never questioned it, never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Is that an interest of yours now?</span> <span id="s1337">Are -- Are you interested in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Oh, I -- I like classical music and the person who got me into it is my husband, he’s very musically oriented.</span> <span id="s1339">He plays the clarinet.</span> <span id="s1340">And he would put on classical music.</span> <span id="s1341">When I went to high school, I went to the extension, because the school was crowded, and behind us was the Conservatory of Music, it’s well known in Europe.</span> <span id="s1342">And then we would hear the students who were just learning.</span> <span id="s1343">Do you know what it sounds like when they learn?</span> <span id="s1344">I had no desire, I had no interest, but now I do enjoy classical music, to a certain extent, I don’t like chamber music, I never learned to appreciate it.</span> <span id="s1345">I haven’t learned to appreciate opera, although I did go to one at the Institute of Music, with somebody who lived in one of the other buildings here.</span> <span id="s1346">But I ushered at Severence Hall with -- which is the -- you know, the Cleveland orchestra?</span> <span id="s1347">And I do enjoy classical music, I go to it.</span> <span id="s1348">I go to the art museum whenever there is an exhibit, when we had the art shows, I love to walk outside.</span> <span id="s1349">If you have enough time, you should go see the -- the museums, because Cleveland has a beautiful, beautiful Museum of Art, and Severance Hall they’re just remodeling.</span> <span id="s1350">I just signed up to volunteer when they reo -- they’re -- they’re going to be playing downtown in one of the halls, but i -- they’re moving back in January, after the remodeling, and I signed up to volunteer, so I am into classical music.</span> <span id="s1351">My son played the trumpet, quite musically oriented.</span> <span id="s1352">He gave it up when he went to Kent, don’t ask me why.</span> <span id="s1353">One granddaughter is interested in dancing and music, and she does play the flute.</span> <span id="s1354">The other ones, no.</span> <span id="s1355">But me, I have no desire to play an instrument, and I enjoy certain types of music, but it was not in our education or in our backgrounds or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Did you go back to Belgium any other time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1358">When my uncle died in Denver, and two years later, my aunt died.</span> <span id="s1359">I didn’t know at the time, but I was the executor for both wills.</span> <span id="s1360">One of the heirs, my aunts nephew, was in Bratislava in Czechoslovakia, who was Communist at the time, managed to manipulate the money so the money didn’t go into Czechoslovakia, and I was in correspondence with him.</span> <span id="s1361">And somehow or other, I decided to go to Europe.</span> <span id="s1362">Dr. Freide was in Switzerland at th -- at the time, in a -- in Zurich.</span> <span id="s1363">And I was in correspondence with him because there were still some strands left behind, and so on.</span> <span id="s1364">And I wrote to him I was going to go to Czechoslovakia, and he said, “If you go to Czechoslovakia, stop in Zurich, we’ll show you the mountains.”</span> <span id="s1365">So what I did, I traveled on my own.</span> <span id="s1366">I went to Zurich.</span> <span id="s1367">He did offer for me to stay with them and I said no.</span> <span id="s1368">They got me a little hotel you don’t get through the travel agencies here, and Switzerland is very clean, so I got a room, and you could tell the shower was added on.</span> <span id="s1369">And I had breakfast and I took a couple trips.</span> <span id="s1370">So I stayed in Zurich for two days, took some trips, went to Bratislava.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: When did my uncle die?</span> <span id="s1373">Let’s see, 20 -- [indecipherable] died about 20 -- 22 -- about -- a good 20 years ago.</span> <span id="s1374">I don’t have my passport and I don’t remember exactly the year, but it’s t -- about 20 years ago, and I went to Bratislava, which is Communist at the time.</span> <span id="s1375">I had to have 10 dollars per day, couldn’t spend it, the stores were empty.</span> <span id="s1376">And I stayed with my -- with Eugene and Magda, my aunt’s nephew and niece.</span> <span id="s1377">Didn’t see much.</span> <span id="s1378">Spent a week there.</span> <span id="s1379">Went from Bratislava to Brussels, which was a waste of time.</span> <span id="s1380">Willy, my cousin, took me to see the city.</span> <span id="s1381">I had spent three months in Brussels, I had no desire to see it, I didn’t do -- oh, I did take a trip into the Flemish part, on my own.</span> <span id="s1382">It was -- I have no -- I grew up feeling as a Belgian citizen cha -- chain -- sang the national anthem, and then after I came to the States, I realized I really would have never been a citizen, although my father died shortly before becoming a citizen of Belgium.</span> <span id="s1383">You don’t become automatically like in the States.</span> <span id="s1384">And then I went from Brussels, I went to Paris to see Frida and spend a week with her.</span> <span id="s1385">And then I -- And then I came back here.</span> <span id="s1386">And then, let’s see, did I go back again?</span> <span id="s1387">No, I was out, I never went back.</span> <span id="s1388">I have no desire to go back.</span> <span id="s1389">I know Miriam said to me, “Why don’t you go work for the common market.</span> <span id="s1390">You’re bilingual.”</span> <span id="s1391">By then I was losing my Fre -- when I say losing my French, I excelled in French, but to speak two languages, and translate, are two different things.</span> <span id="s1392">You need a training and a background, and I have to stop and think, “How do you say that in French?”</span> <span id="s1393">I finally met some people, quite by -- was just a freak, I took the Rapid to go downtown and this woman sat next to me and she had a little brochure, and I says, “Oh, I didn’t know the Americans were interested in Moliere.”</span> <span id="s1394">And she happens -- I don’t know where she learned French, but she introduced me to a group, and they’re strictly women, we get -- they get together twice a month, at Beechwood Place, and from 10 to 12, and then on Friday they get together at somebody’s home, and everybody brings something, just for the purpose of speaking French.</span> <span id="s1395">So I’ve gotten back into speaking French, and it’s not a word of English, until you turn to somebody who just came back from France, who has close contact, and you say, “How do you say such and such in French?”</span> <span id="s1396">Nobody could remember how to say flush a toilet in French.</span> <span id="s1397">And I read French books.</span> <span id="s1398">I go down to the library about once a month.</span> <span id="s1399">Cleveland library downtown, the main library is magnificent.</span> <span id="s1400">I have -- going to go down next week, I think, because they built a new building, and they re-did the old building, which was closed, and I got to know -- they had a -- the foreign literature library, and she just sent me a book.</span> <span id="s1401">She knows the authors I like, or if she sees a book on Belgium, she’ll send it to me.</span> <span id="s1402">One of them she sent me was all about the percentages of Catholic -- Cath -- Catholicism.</span> <span id="s1403">Still have some words with trouble.</span> <span id="s1404">So I do that, and I do have the opportunity of getting together with people to speak French.</span> <span id="s1405">And my granddaughters are taking Spanish.</span> <span id="s1406">But they’re long distance, you know, so it doesn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s1407">As a matter of -- th -- Alicia called me, she said, “I have to take a language, I don’t know what to take, maybe German.”</span> <span id="s1408">And I didn’t want to tell her don’t.</span> <span id="s1409">I did say, “Oh, [indecipherable] you don’t want German.”</span> <span id="s1410">I said, “[indecipherable] to take French,” I said, “but take Spanish, it’s much more useful, you know, in the States.”</span> <span id="s1411">So I don’t know what she’s going -- she’s going to do what she wants to do.</span> <span id="s1412">She said something about taking Japanese, but she’s not going into something where it would be required, so I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1413">But I do speak French.</span> <span id="s1414">I have very little opportunity to speak Yiddish, and I trip on my words, bring in the English words, because the older generation is dying away, so the young people -- I’m sure my little sister probably didn’t even speak Yiddish, probably understood it, but the young generations don’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1415">We have a lot of Russian emigrants, but the Russians are like the Germans, they don’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1416">Best of all, they couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1417">Every so often I find them, and I’ll say, “Do you speak Yiddish?”</span> <span id="s1418">So I can communicate with them.</span> <span id="s1419">And maybe I’ll break down -- I think Workman’s Circle has classes in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1420">Maybe I should go back to it, maybe it’ll come back.</span> <span id="s1421">I just remember a couple letters of the alphabet.</span> <span id="s1422">Don’t know what good it is, but I did read articles that in Israel they’re te -- teaching Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1423">In my generation they always said, “A Jew can go anywhere, he’s never lost, as long as he speaks Yiddish.”</span> <span id="s1424">But it’s not true any more.</span> <span id="s1425">In my generation, when I was young, yes.</span> <span id="s1426">It did come in handy.</span> <span id="s1427">I went to Israel twice, the first time on my own.</span> <span id="s1428">I was going to take a tour, and some reason or other, I remember my cousin, the one who was in Belgium, as a soldier, I remember his address.</span> <span id="s1429">They were pioneers on a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1430">And I wrote to him, and I said, “I want to come to Israel, I want to take a tour, but I’d like to see you again and meet your family.”</span> <span id="s1431">And he said, “Don’t take a tour, come to the kibbutz.”</span> <span id="s1432">So I went on my own to the kibbutz, I arrived on a Friday, before sundown, and on Saturday, my mother’s side of the family came.</span> <span id="s1433">My mother had a niece in Belgium and she went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1434">And through the family I got her sister’s address and they all invited me, which I didn’t accept, but they grabbed me off, and I was taken to -- to visit Israel.</span> <span id="s1435">I took one tour, that was it.</span> <span id="s1436">Everybody else took me around, and then I went on the kibbutz and lived on the kibbutz, and got a taste, if you can, on a couple days at the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1437">Then I went back a number of years later -- oh, that time I traveled by bus everywhere.</span> <span id="s1438">It was marvelous, because you meet more people, you learn more.</span> <span id="s1439">And I took a bus back from ji -- di -- from Jerusalem to the kibbutz, and they dropped me off into the kibbutz, and my uncle had shown -- my cousin had shown me, “See Frida, this is the street I live on.”</span> <span id="s1440">And I said, “Sfee, you want me to remember?</span> <span id="s1441">It’s in Hebrew.”</span> <span id="s1442">So when I got off on the kibbutz, there was a man with a bicycle and he was a-a-an older man, and I looked at him, and I took a chance, and he was one of the Europeans from that generation, who had gone to Israel, and I was able to speak with him in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1443">So he took me to my cousin’s house.</span> <span id="s1444">The second time I went, I went as a volunteer for the army.</span> <span id="s1445">I didn’t like the experience, and the thing that saved me is every weekend we were off, so I went to the different -- to the various members of the family.</span> <span id="s1446">I didn’t tour as -- that much, this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: A volunteer for the Israeli army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Y-Yeah, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1449">They needed volunteers.</span> <span id="s1450">That started during the -- one of the wars or something, where all their people were fighting, and they needed people, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1451">And I ended up working -- I ended up being placed on a ca -- on an army camp that was -- packed medical supplies for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1452">My cousin from Belgium, her granddaughter happened to be in the army, right on the next camp, next to it, where the soldiers were.</span> <span id="s1453">Teela.</span> <span id="s1454">She was an officer.</span> <span id="s1455">And she came and she found me, because I had written to them that I would be there.</span> <span id="s1456">And we got a ride back to her house and then coming back we took a train and we took a bus.</span> <span id="s1457">Some experience.</span> <span id="s1458">So I stayed there for two weeks.</span> <span id="s1459">I didn’t extend my trip, but I did go to my cousin’s kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1460">And I just had -- something came up in Denver, and I was in contact with what I call my sabber cousin, who lived in Denver.</span> <span id="s1461">And he called me twice.</span> <span id="s1462">I recognized his voice, they have a definite ang -- you know, they speak English fluently.</span> <span id="s1463">And he says, “Why don’t you come to Israel?”</span> <span id="s1464">I says, “You know, maybe you make me feel like going, but I want to see areas where I’ve never visited before.”</span> <span id="s1465">So I decided to go to Iceland in September.</span> <span id="s1466">I don’t know wha -- what I -- I understand is very beautiful terrain.</span> <span id="s1467">Equador was very enlightening.</span> <span id="s1468">People say Equador?</span> <span id="s1469">What’s in Equador?</span> <span id="s1470">Well, it’s different cultures.</span> <span id="s1471">And that’s what I like to do.</span> <span id="s1472">And whether I’ll go to eastern Europe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1473">One t -- One -- One step at a time.</span> <span id="s1474">First of all, I have to make sure -- I’m getting older.</span> <span id="s1475">That’s why I walk, to keep my legs active, and make sure --</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Very lively.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: To a certain extent, to a certain extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: What year was it that you went to Israel, volunteering with the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: You know, you’re aski -- I would have -- I think maybe my passport shows it.</span> <span id="s1480">Let’s see, I went to France last year, da --</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Ball park figure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s1483">Maybe five years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: And did you -- did you s -- s -- tell me about your visits with Rachelle when you returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Ah, the first time I went.</span> <span id="s1486">What happened is, I went to Israel the year after I went back to Belgium again.</span> <span id="s1487">When I went Switzerland, and that.</span> <span id="s1488">And my aunt in Belgium was the same age as Rachelle.</span> <span id="s1489">My aunt didn’t like Rachelle either.</span> <span id="s1490">And she gave me Rachelle’s name -- she had remarried, and her address.</span> <span id="s1491">And I wrote to Rachelle, and some reason or other -- trying to remember if I didn’t get an answer, somehow or other, I got the answer three months later.</span> <span id="s1492">I found the letter after I came back.</span> <span id="s1493">And everywhere I went, I kept saying, there is somebody I want to see, but I can’t read the Hebrew telephone books.</span> <span id="s1494">And I ended up at a cousin’s house that I had not met before.</span> <span id="s1495">They were brothers and sisters from the one who lived in Belgium, and I didn’t know they were brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s1496">And I was at Leelee -- Leelee’s house, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, as a matter of fact, and I says, “Leelee,” I says, “I need -- I want to get in touch with Rachelle, but I can’t read the telephone,” and she says, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1497">Somehow or other, I don’t know if she called information, she looked in the phone book, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1498">And I say, “I can’t call on my own, because I don’t speak Hebrew, and the Europeans who had gone, did not speak English.”</span> <span id="s1499">Now they all -- all -- all the Israelis speak English.</span> <span id="s1500">And she got on the phone one evening, and in Hebrew, and she said, “Frida, it’s the right Rachelle.”</span> <span id="s1501">And I got on the phone, she was crying.</span> <span id="s1502">And what I did is I took a bus and I stayed with her.</span> <span id="s1503">I did not sightsee, I did not do anything.</span> <span id="s1504">And I remember, had a dress with a little breast pocket, and I was going to a kibbutz on the outskirts of Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1505">These close friends that I have, who live on the west side of Cleveland, had two daughters who were in Israel for several months on kibbutz, and I had told, I says, “Sally,” I said, “I don’t care what, I want to see Cindy and Sharon.”</span> <span id="s1506">And one lived in a remote kibbutz that was just being established.</span> <span id="s1507">My cousin Sfee borrowed a car and took me there and just visited for a short time.</span> <span id="s1508">But Sharon was in a kibbutz where I had access with a bus, and Rachelle put me in a cab, and I remember she gave me money to pay for the cab, and I says, “Rachelle,” I says, “I’m not a child any more, I’m an adult.</span> <span id="s1509">I have money, I can afford.”</span> <span id="s1510">She insisted.</span> <span id="s1511">And she spoke -- I don’t know if she picked up some Arabic, or it was in Hebrew, she put me in cab to Tel Aviv, because all the buses leave from Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1512">And I got to Tel Aviv, it was -- my son had warned me, it was like letting lions out of a cage.</span> <span id="s1513">Saturday evening, the Sabbath is broken, and all the buses were lined up right behind the other.</span> <span id="s1514">I mean, the station has been remodeled since, when I went the second time.</span> <span id="s1515">And I had the name of the kibbutz written down on a piece of paper, until I learned to say kibbutz malach hameeshem, but at the time I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1516">And I missed the bus.</span> <span id="s1517">With all those bus, you know, with the cab driver dropped me off, and I guess I missed my bus.</span> <span id="s1518">And this soldier approached me, it was very interesting event.</span> <span id="s1519">The soldier saw me, you know, with a little suitcase, and he approached me, and I told him where I was going.</span> <span id="s1520">It happened to be he was in the -- once they serve in -- they have to back in the reserve once a year, until they reach a certain age.</span> <span id="s1521">He was a young Frenchman who as a -- who had survived a war younger than I wa -- he was younger than -- you know, about my age, I think.</span> <span id="s1522">And he went to Israel after the war, and it s -- turns out that his wife’s name was also Frida, and he stayed with me in Tel Aviv, until I got on the next bus.</span> <span id="s1523">Told the bus driver where I was going, and what happened, the kibbutz as a business had a -- a motel.</span> <span id="s1524">Well, the bus went to the motel and they had a cop -- End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: So, tape four, side A, and you just -- I have a cramp in my knee.</span> <span id="s1526">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1527">Do you want to finish that story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: All right, I went -- I went to the -- to the American wi -- common because I had told Sharon, I says, “Get me a room at the motel.”</span> <span id="s1529">She says oh, she went and there was a room available for me.</span> <span id="s1530">Didn’t have a closet, the shower -- the water was cold.</span> <span id="s1531">And the next day, I went to take a bus to sightsee Jerusalem, because I only had one day, and I missed the bus to take me into Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1532">And there was a man there who was from the outskirts of Detroit, and he had lived at the kibbutz for about seven years, and I got talking to him, waiting for the next bus.</span> <span id="s1533">And he said he took groups of students o-on -- on -- sightseeing and things like that.</span> <span id="s1534">And he had an appointment, and I met him -- he says, “I’ll meet you at the bus station at 11 o’clock, and he walked me for three solid hours, in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1535">And the one day I didn’t sightsee was when I spend the day with Rachelle.</span> <span id="s1536">When I went back the second time, I wrote to her, never got an answer.</span> <span id="s1537">I told somebody her address, couldn’t find it, and I know the let -- I don’t know what happened to Rachelle.</span> <span id="s1538">Have no idea, have no idea what happened to her.</span> <span id="s1539">It breaks my heart, because he husband had died.</span> <span id="s1540">Her -- You know, the man she -- she married in Israel.</span> <span id="s1541">So I don’t know what happened, I tried in the worst way.</span> <span id="s1542">I don’t know if I could have contacted an agency or what.</span> <span id="s1543">I still -- I still have her address and nodob -- nobody seemed to locate the street or anything.</span> <span id="s1544">So I’ve lost contact with her.</span> <span id="s1545">I still have contact with my aunt in Brussels.</span> <span id="s1546">I send her Jewish New Year’s card.</span> <span id="s1547">I’m in touch with Frida in Paris.</span> <span id="s1548">And I do -- I have contact with my mother’s side of the family, the daughter of the cousin who lived in Belgium, I send a New Year’s card.</span> <span id="s1549">As a matter of fact, my granddaughter Alicia, the oldest one, went to Israel, and she did spend time -- her name is also Rachelle, my dau -- my cousin from Belgium, her daughter, she spent some time with her.</span> <span id="s1550">My cousin Ahoud, and Ruth, my sabber cousin, happened to be in England at the time.</span> <span id="s1551">I wrote to them, and then I got a letter from England that he was stationed there on his job for a couple of years.</span> <span id="s1552">And I told her I’ll never forgive her for not going to see my cousin Sfee, because he’s elderly, I’m the only relative he has.</span> <span id="s1553">But it’s not somebody I cou -- have lot of correspondence, and I can’t get through to -- now that they have telephones in -- in the kibbutz, I did call one time, and for some reason or other, I don’t know what has changed, I can’t get -- I can’t get ahold of them on the telephone.</span> <span id="s1554">And my sabber cousin, Ahoud, is the same cousin as I am, and I -- I should ask him for his phone number, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1555">I have to call him one of these days and see if he can give me a phone number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: What’s Sfee’s last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Well, Nishri, N-i-s-h-r-i, and you know, again, we go back ma -- not asking questions now.</span> <span id="s1558">He is a first cousin to my father.</span> <span id="s1559">He left at a young age, he married a woman, I think she’s of Polish background.</span> <span id="s1560">I never asked him about my grandparents.</span> <span id="s1561">I would assume that his last name, European, was Adler.</span> <span id="s1562">I mean, he’s on my father’s side of the family, but when I was there, his hearing was going, his eyesight was going.</span> <span id="s1563">He was still clear minded.</span> <span id="s1564">I haven’t heard anything, his wife was still very active.</span> <span id="s1565">She was a midwife, and he -- when I went there, he used to go to -- to the fields, and bring food to the people who worked t-the fields, a-at the kibbutz, and I went with him.</span> <span id="s1566">They treated me -- I mean, they didn’t know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s1567">If I had a -- a -- you know, they have the main meals in -- in -- in the common dining room, but Ahoud and Ruth came, and she served some soup, and she used to bake.</span> <span id="s1568">If I as much as picked up the cup to put it to the sink, she would slap my hands, she wouldn’t let me do anything.</span> <span id="s1569">She was so glad that I was in touch -- in touch with them, and that’s the only contact I have.</span> <span id="s1570">And Miriam I don’t hear from.</span> <span id="s1571">She was in the States on business, and she was in New York, but she didn’t tell me until the last minute, so I couldn’t go to New York, and I did get a letter from her mother, saying she was due to come to the States, I don’t know if it was Chicago or what, and I had told her, I says, “Miriam, if you let me know ahead of time, then I’ll come, I’ll stay in a hotel and I’ll spend time with you.”</span> <span id="s1572">Well, I don’t know if she didn’t come, she didn’t contact me.</span> <span id="s1573">She did contact me when she was in New York.</span> <span id="s1574">And I had it to -- a hard ta -- she kept changing hotels, so I had a hard time tracking her.</span> <span id="s1575">My aunt came to the States one time, many years ago, when my son lived in Connecticut, and he and his wife went to New York, they drove and met her, because she went to visit somebody from Belgium, and the woman spoke English, and I guess French, and she was a translator.</span> <span id="s1576">And then she came -- it was interesting, she came a second time, but she didn’t tell me until the last minute.</span> <span id="s1577">She went to Florida, to somebody.</span> <span id="s1578">And I say, “Why didn’t you tell me?</span> <span id="s1579">I was going to Florida once a year to visit friends.”</span> <span id="s1580">But I never saw her.</span> <span id="s1581">It was too late, and I wasn’t going to pay the high fare of the last minute fares to go to -- to -- to flori -- she was in Miami and I was going to Fort Lauderdale.</span> <span id="s1582">So I have no contact with any of them.</span> <span id="s1583">I had a cousin in Los Angeles, I vi -- my aunt, the one from Denver’s daughter, lived in Los Angeles, I spend time with her.</span> <span id="s1584">I have a cousin too, that I met after the war, who lived in eng -- in Cleveland, went to Los Angeles, and I do have contact with one of the cousins in Canada.</span> <span id="s1585">But otherwise -- and one of them here in -- two of them, I -- actually I somehow or other re-made contact with Lana’s daughter, to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s1586">Louie died many years ago, with a -- of a brain tumor, so -- but from my father’s generation, from -- you know, from -- there’s a -- Sfee’s the only one in Israel from that generation, really.</span> <span id="s1587">There is no one else left, no one else.</span> <span id="s1588">And on my mother’s side -- on my father’s side, that generation, everyone was gone.</span> <span id="s1589">On my mother’s side -- oh no, wait a minute, on my mother’s side, one uncle had remained, their two girls and my cousin Paul in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1590">And I understand he was one of the oldest survivors of the camp, and he stayed in Czechoslovakia, Romania, every time there’s a war, and every time they divide the country, it becomes another country.</span> <span id="s1591">I was Russian after World War Two, now it’s Ukraine.</span> <span id="s1592">And he eventually came to the States, but his mind was not -- he was in his 70’s, he had gone through World War Two, he was in a nursing home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: Izaquavic.</span> <span id="s1595">What was it?</span> <span id="s1596">Oh, all of a sudden I can’t think of his name, and I met him, and he -- the only way he could know who I was is by telling him whose daughter I was.</span> <span id="s1597">You -- Because he remembered my moth -- you know, that’s the way they said, they said, so and so’s daughter, so and so’s son.</span> <span id="s1598">Oh, all of a sudden --</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: How -- How was he related?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: My mother’s father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: He -- Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: My mother’s -- excuse me, my mother’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: Yeah, he was the only sa -- survivor on my mother’s side, from that generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: And when you said he was one of the oldest survivors of the camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: Of the camps, he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: -- which camp -- which camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Who knows how many camps he was in, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1609">I think he ended up in -- I -- he might have been in Auschwitz when he was liberated, I -- I -- I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1610">You know, these are the things we didn’t ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: You know, this is going back -- oh, I know what his name was.</span> <span id="s1613">The Jewish name was Moishevolv.</span> <span id="s1614">Now I remember.</span> <span id="s1615">And I met him, but he could only relate to me of saying I was Hya’s daughter.</span> <span id="s1616">And he stayed with the su -- with -- with the -- the son, he stayed with the -- with the daughter.</span> <span id="s1617">I don’t know, he died, I think of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s1618">He was in a -- on a picnic or something like that, so he didn’t live very long after he came to the States.</span> <span id="s1619">And that’s about it, I mean, nothing else, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Is there anything else that you -- that you want to say in conclusion?</span> <span id="s1621">I mean, I’m just -- I’m thinking of one statement that you said that sticks in my head, is that you said, you know, that you haven’t lived a full life, and I -- I wondered what you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: You mean a full life now?</span> <span id="s1623">Well I -- You know, my -- my -- my children live out of town, and you know I was raised to -- to -- to be a mu -- to be married, to have a -- a-and be a mother and everything, and so I live alone, so I don’t ha -- well, I don’t have the male companionship.</span> <span id="s1624">I dated.</span> <span id="s1625">I -- I went out a lot, I -- I had male companionship for -- for quite a number of years.</span> <span id="s1626">You reach my age, and I’m too active for some of them.</span> <span id="s1627">I’m still fairly active.</span> <span id="s1628">And I’m thankful that I have the friends that I have, that I can keep busy.</span> <span id="s1629">I volunteered.</span> <span id="s1630">I just lost my job volunteering, I have to find another one.</span> <span id="s1631">I did date entry.</span> <span id="s1632">I go back to the hospital and talk with Dr. Gambetti.</span> <span id="s1633">I keep active and I keep busy, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s1634">And I started taking classes because I want to keep my mind working, and I have to find a niche for my volunteer work, because the woman I work for is fantastic.</span> <span id="s1635">I still have contact with her, and I go there for the holidays.</span> <span id="s1636">As a matter of fact, she called me this morning and I said, “The museum?”</span> <span id="s1637">I says, “Well,” I said, “I wanted the museum, there’s an exhibit.”</span> <span id="s1638">And I say I want to go down to the library, because I was not available the day they had the grand opening for the old library, they remodeled the original building.</span> <span id="s1639">So we’re going to the library with her.</span> <span id="s1640">So I’m thankful for the -- that I’m quote, healthy.</span> <span id="s1641">That I have the friends that I have and I’m not isolated, and if I don’t have to spend 10 years in a nursing home, I’m fi -- I’m fine financially, too, but I’m tha -- can’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s1642">And my son is doing well, and the children are growing up, away from me.</span> <span id="s1643">That’s the thing, that I missed it.</span> <span id="s1644">Not now so much, but when they were little, is to see them, you know, grow up, but they were here four times a year, and I went there, so -- and I went when Alicia had -- the oldest one had her tonsils out.</span> <span id="s1645">But I missed a lot of the little things, you know, affairs in school.</span> <span id="s1646">Oh, Whitney was acting in some plays, and I went because she had a play, but it’s not -- it’s not as often as I would have liked.</span> <span id="s1647">But all that is gone, so have to take it from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1651">Thank you so much.</span> <span id="s1652">I think we could probably go on all day, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: I’ll spare you from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: Yeah, yeah, well you’re the one who keeps bringing all these things up.</span> <span id="s1656">I don’t know how you do it.</span> <span id="s1657">Aren’t you tired?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Endlessly curious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: You mean, you’re going back tonight?</span> <span id="s1660">You’re going --</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1662">We’ll see.</span> <span id="s1663">Well, this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Frida Wallenstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">End of Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives
