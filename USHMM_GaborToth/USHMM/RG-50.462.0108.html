beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s3">GH: I gave you these two pictures because I think they will both interest your audience.</span> <span id="s4">One is one of the few pictures of the grown man [Franz Rosenzweig] before he fell sick, because he had only very few years of healthy adult life.</span> <span id="s5">When he came out of the war, that was in 1918, and in 1921 latest, his illness began.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">FS: What kind of illness did he have?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">GH: What they call now Lou Gehrig's disease.1</span></p> <p><span id="s8">FS: Was it a blood disease?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">GH: No, it's a brain disease.</span> <span id="s10">It's a deterioration of all the, not a brain disease, it's a little like multiple sclerosis, only much worse.</span> <span id="s11">You may have seen in the [Jewish] Exponent last week a report on the Einstein memorial service in Princeton, where a physicist who continues Einstein's work brought a paper which was obviously one of the most important papers of the conference, but he could not give it himself because he had to have it read.</span> <span id="s12">He has the same disease.</span> <span id="s13">I cut it out.</span> <span id="s14">That may give you an idea.</span> <span id="s15">And I think the best thing is if I now don't talk too much now about my memories of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">FS: The voice you hear now is the voice of Dr. Gertrude Hallo, a very dear friend, who was a contemporary of Franz Rosenzweig.</span> <span id="s17">The voice you will hear now again is Gertrude Hallo's voice and her own experiences with Rosenzweig.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">GH: My husband2 and I were rather close to him for quite a number of years.</span> <span id="s19">Franz Rosenzweig was the only child of a well-to-do rather assimilated Jewish family of the upper middle class population of the town of Kassel.</span> <span id="s20">He was an extremely gifted child and young man, brilliant in many ways.</span> <span id="s21">He--interrupt it for a moment--in 1979 will bring the 50th yahrzeit of a man who must be counted among the great personalities in modern Jewry--Franz Rosenzweig.</span> <span id="s22">I consider it my duty and privilege to say a few words in his memory because both my late husband and I knew him personally and belonged to the circle of his friends.</span> <span id="s23">The name Franz Rosenzweig is well known to Jewish and Christian philosophers and students of religion because of his important writings and of his influence on generations of young people during his lifetime in Germany and posthumously in America.</span> <span id="s24">He deserves to be commemorated by every Jew who is concerned about the survival of Judaism in the world of today, and because of his personality and his unique life.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Franz Rosenzweig was born in 1886 as the only child of an upper-middle-class family of great wealth, intense cultural interests, a strong social consciousness, and an unquestioned identification with the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s26">He was intellectually brilliant, artistically and musically gifted, and had a strong-willed, captivating personality.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Beginning with adolescence, he was made restless by a lack of inner directiveness.</span> <span id="s28">He switched at the university from subject to subject, medicine, science, philosophy, history.</span> <span id="s29">His brilliant intellect mastered all these studies, but they did not satisfy his inner searching.</span> <span id="s30">So he tried to turn to religion.</span> <span id="s31">The liberal form of Judaism in his parents' home and the local synagogue left him frustrated, as the superficial Jewish instruction had done in school.</span> <span id="s32">Under the influence of close friends who had embraced Christianity with the fervor which was really much similar to that of the Jewish followers of Jesus in Jesus' lifetime.</span> <span id="s33">After endless discussions with them, Franz Rosenzweig came really close to converting himself, but something subconscious kept him back.</span> <span id="s34">Maybe it was the heritage of his forebears which had been very actively Jewish.</span> <span id="s35">This held him back.</span> <span id="s36">He wanted to know real Judaism before deciding to leave it.</span> <span id="s37">For this purpose, he spent the whole Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement] from Kol Nidrei [means all vows] to Ne'ila [means closing]3 in 1913 in a small Orthodox shul in the east end of Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">This first look into a completely Jewish world shook him to the core of his being.</span> <span id="s39">He realized that he did not have to embrace an alien creed in order to satisfy his yearning, that he had been about to abandon what he had not known to be his very own.</span> <span id="s40">Conversion, he told his mother, is no longer necessary and, therefore, no longer possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">As a natural and indispensable consequence, he resolved to put himself under the Law and to devote his life to a two-fold goal.</span> <span id="s42">He would himself learn in the traditional Jewish way of Lernen, and he would work for a better Jewish education of children and adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">With the energy and impatience which was really characteristic of him altogether, he started immediately in both directions.</span> <span id="s44">Not even the outbreak of World War I in the summer of 1914 could deter him from his scruples.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Though Rosenzweig spent practically the entire four years of the war at the front, as a male nurse in Belgium first and then mainly as an anti-aircraft gunner in the high mountains of the Balkans, even though he did that, neither the rigors and monotony of army life nor fear of death could deter him from studying, thinking, and writing.</span> <span id="s46">On the contrary, it seems as if the regular daily routine of his military duties, the invigorating mountain air, and the absence of all distractions had strengthened him in mind and body to such a degree that without the help of reference books, teachers, or congenial discussions, he produced in these years the first draft of his writings on the relationship of Judaism and Christianity, his plans for Jewish education and for teacher training, and above all what he called the germ cell of his main work, the Star of Redemption, the latter on army postcards which he sent for safekeeping to his mother.</span> <span id="s47">"What a correspondence that fellow has!"</span> <span id="s48">said the other soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Contacts with Sephardi Jews in Macedonia and with Polish Jews in Warsaw made deep and lasting impressions on him, as shown in his letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">In many ways the war years can be looked upon as the years which concluded Rosenzweig's education and his preparation for the life and the responsibility of the adult man.</span> <span id="s51">Immediately after Rosenzweig's discharge from the army, this life started in the most promising way.</span> <span id="s52">It is as if everything was coming his way.</span> <span id="s53">He put the finishing touches on the Star [of Redemption], this hard-to-read book on philosophy and theology, Judaism and Christianity, the individual and the community, life and death.</span> <span id="s54">It uses a new method of thinking and a language all his own.</span> <span id="s55">It found a publisher immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Almost simultaneously, Rosenzweig's doctoral thesis on the role of the philosopher in a militaristic state was accepted, and his professor invited him to start on an academic career.</span> <span id="s57">But he declined this most flattering offer because it would interfere with his decision to lead an entirely Jewish life.</span> <span id="s58">"I cannot serve two masters," he said in a letter to his professor.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Instead, he accepted enthusiastically an offer from the Frankfurt Jewish Community to become the director of their adult education program, promising him the freedom to remodel it according to his own ideas and ideals, and a liberal enough budget to engage competent teachers.</span> <span id="s60">He used both to create the Institute of Free Jewish Learning, for which he had tried to interest the Jewish leadership in many printed pamphlets and personal letters for years.</span> <span id="s61">He modeled it loosely as a modern form of the medieval bet hamidrash, in which the teachers did not lecture and the students did not passively listen but where all learned with and from one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">This Freie JÃ¼dische Lehrhaus became an immediate success in Frankfurt and was imitated in most Jewish communities in pre-Hitler Germany.</span> <span id="s63">Its influence and even the name can still be traced in Jewish education in Israel and the Diaspora including America.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">And last not least, Rosenzweig married.</span> <span id="s65">He married a girl who he could have found, as he wrote to my husband, but did not marry, years earlier, and who was glad to provide the kosher household and share life according to the halachic commandments which he wanted and felt he could lead without giving up his theoretic adherence to Jewish liberalism.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Thus, everything seemed to fall into place and to lead him in the direction to which the last words of the Star had guided him--into life.</span> <span id="s67">Rosenzweig looked forward to many active years in which his theories would pass the test of realization to life of continued Jewish learning under the best authorities, and of increased service to the Jewish community, and, best of all, to a life of marital and domestic happiness enhanced by the prospect of fatherhood.</span> <span id="s68">He did not want to write any more books until, as an old man, he would feel justified to compile a kind of modern Shulkhan Arukh, which would dissolve the apparent discrepancy between halakhah and life in the modern world, as well as that of his personal attempt to combine Orthodox practice with liberal thought.</span> <span id="s69">But that was not to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">After only two short years, Rosenzweig began to notice increasing difficulties in speaking, walking, swallowing, and even breathing and writing.</span> <span id="s71">These symptoms were soon diagnosed as the beginning of the same crippling disease which killed Lou Gehrig.</span> <span id="s72">Medical science had no cure.</span> <span id="s73">The difficulties made in the beginning such rapid progress that he was not expected to live for more than months.</span> <span id="s74">It became, however, clear very soon that he would have a probably long period of increasing physical disability ahead of him, which, however, did not then and would never impair his mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Rosenzweig accepted this fate without despair and without self-pity.</span> <span id="s76">He and his devoted wife concentrated their energy and their mental ability on designing and providing all the technical means and gadgets and the help they might need, and all their spiritual strength on the task not to let the difficulties, as Rosenzweig called his disabilities, get the better of them, and to create as normal a childhood as possible for their son, who was born about one-half year after the outbreak of the disease.</span> <span id="s77">It is not possible to tell here now how they did it and what it cost them in sorrow and pain and heartache.</span> <span id="s78">They succeeded, and these last eight years of Rosenzweig's life became in a sense his most important ones, truly a verification of the Jewish life which he had postulated in his writings.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">This attracted a number of young people, many of them university students, in search of their own Jewish identity.</span> <span id="s80">They came year after year every Shabbat morning to the Rosenzweigs' modest attic apartment and held services in the book-lined living room in which Rosenzweig spent all his days, kept tied to a highbacked arm chair.</span> <span id="s81">He participated almost to the last year of his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">There was always a minyan but, of course, the membership of the group changed constantly.</span> <span id="s83">Some of the members are today quite well known, as for instance Abraham Heschel, Erich Fromm, Ernst Simon, Nahum Glatzer.</span> <span id="s84">On weekdays there was an almost constant stream of visitors, many of whom were not close friends and relatives, and who did not just want to perform the mitzvah of visiting the sick, but who came to discuss philosophical and theological problems.</span> <span id="s85">Among them were probably as many believing Christians as Jews.</span> <span id="s86">Some of these visitors were or became quite famous, as Martin Buber, with whom he started a new translation of the Bible into German; Leo Baeck, the foremost German rabbi, who conferred on Rosenzweig the title of Morenu, our teacher; Hanna Rovina, the star actress of the Hebrew theater, Habima.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">His disabilities, of course, caused Rosenzweig to return to the writing of books, which he had foresworn in the first exuberance of influencing people in direct personal contact.</span> <span id="s88">And again, as in the war years, his stubborn energy refused to take adverse circumstances into account, neither his own disabilities nor the exhaustion of his ailing wife, without whose support he would have been a helpless cripple.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">In this way he managed not only to maintain an enormous correspondence but he also wrote and published a long line of books, articles, and reviews of importance.</span> <span id="s90">He concentrated on translating from Hebrew into German, because he wanted to reach especially the assimilated Jews who knew no or little Hebrew.</span> <span id="s91">The above mentioned translation of the Bible was undertaken to replace the popular translation by Martin Luther, which was widely used by Jews, with one which did more justice to the Hebrew language and the fundamental Jewish character of the Bible.</span> <span id="s92">Rosenzweig worked on it until his last year, and finished the translation of Isaiah.</span> <span id="s93">He translated further 60 hymns of the Spanish-Jewish poet Yehuda Halevy and published them with an epilogue in copious notes.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Among the many essays and articles which he wrote, in addition, perhaps the most important is the preface to the collective Jewish writings of Hermann Cohen, who had been Rosenzweig's teacher at the Jewish Institute of Instruction in Berlin.</span> <span id="s95">It is so important because it deals in depth with the problems which were so important for German Jews and perhaps are so important again for American Jews today, namely, the question whether--namely the relationship between philosophy and religion and that between Judaism and the Western culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Rosenzweig's main concern however, especially in the beginning of his illness, was whether his beloved Lehrhaus might die, or worse, might revert to the old unessential courses.</span> <span id="s97">He tried to save it by appointing his younger friend and disciple, my husband, as his substitute to run the institute under his close supervision, firm control, and according to his very definite directives.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">That worked out very well for almost two years, and the Lehrhaus flourished and grew as it had done under Rosenzweig's own directorship.</span> <span id="s99">But gradually fundamental differences on the question of how to live and how to teach came to the fore, and attempts to discuss them freely and so to resolve them became so frustrating and painful that my husband felt it his duty to hand in his resignation, and that it was accepted.</span> <span id="s100">It is to the everlasting credit of both men that they respected each other's standpoint, and remained friends until the end of their lives, which came so tragically early to both.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Rosenzweig died on December 9, 1929, two weeks before his 43rd birthday.</span> <span id="s102">The paralysis had reached the vital organs, and a cold leading to pneumonia ended his life.</span> <span id="s103">But his work did not die with him.</span> <span id="s104">The Lehrhaus survived in Frankfurt and other major Jewish communities in Germany, even into the first years of the Hitler era, and became the model for a number of similar institutes in America, England, and Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Rosenzweig's most important writings, even the difficult Star, were translated into Hebrew and English and thoroughly studied by Jewish and Christian scholars and students.</span> <span id="s106">The Star, for instance, became a textbook for the Judaic studies of major American universities.</span> <span id="s107">There is no doubt that Rosenzweig has had influence on the ecumenical attempts at understanding between the two religions.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">In the '50's and '60's, a veritable flood of books, essays, and articles swamped the book market, making a casual remark of Rosenzweig's, that he did not expect to be known until fifty years after his death, almost into a prophetic prediction.</span> <span id="s109">Quite a few of these publications did not try any serious analysis of his system or did not enter into dialogue about his thesis.</span> <span id="s110">They concentrated on the man, romanticizing him as ba'al t'shuvah and pitying him as a martyr.</span> <span id="s111">Nothing could have been less appropriate than this kind of hero worship for Rosenzweig, who berated relatives and friends with bitter sarcasm for similar attempts.</span> <span id="s112">He was no saint and no do-gooder.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Basically, however, it is absolutely correct to focus the interest on the man and his life, and not on his philosophical system and his theological teachings.</span> <span id="s114">For this I see two reasons: Rosenzweig verifies with his actions his ideas, brings them to life, and makes them visible for everybody, whether one understands his theories or not.</span> <span id="s115">He really does what perhaps Exodus 24:7 means, when the Israelites say after Moses has read the Ten Commandments to them, na'aseh v'nishmah, namely, "We will do what the Lord commands and then through doing, we will understand."</span> <span id="s116">And perhaps more to the point, it seems that all integration and assimilation into Western culture confronts American Jews with Jewish identity problems, which are very similar to those which alienated so many educated German Jews in Rosenzweig's time and brought even him to the very brink.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Tape 1, side 2: [Long pause before tape starts.]</span></p> <p><span id="s118">FS: You will now hear my friend Gertrude Hallo giving her life's experience on the Jewish scene in Germany in the 1920's and the personal relationship between Mrs. Hallo, her husband, and Franz Rosenzweig.</span> <span id="s119">The next voice you hear is Gertrude Hallo.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">GH: In order to give a true picture of what happened to Jews, and especially young Jews, in the 1920's, I have to go further back.</span> <span id="s121">I must make something clear, which may not be easy for Americans today to see clearly, that except for the Zionist movement, Zionism was really far from our consciousness.</span> <span id="s122">For us, the problem was our personal fight for Jewish identity, especially in view of the growing racist and anti-Jewish movements which preceded the Hitler years.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">FS: Were you ever part of the Zionist movement, Gertrude?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">GH: No, no.</span> <span id="s125">I was--I even began really strongly, like many Jews in Germany, in a kind of hostile attitude towards the Zionism, for two reasons.</span> <span id="s126">We could not accept the fact, could not understand the fact that we were not considered as the Germans in the way we felt to be.</span> <span id="s127">We felt what is different between Germans in general and German Jews was religion, and this we could and did talk out with German friends who were as much and as little Christian as we were Jewish, if this can explain it.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">But even more so, what held us back, when embracing Zionism, was that it came to us as, not so much a Jewish movement, but as a British movement.</span> <span id="s129">The Balfour Declaration was given by what was at that time, not in the '20's but before, at the bitter end of the First World War, the bitter Feind, bitter enemy of Germany.</span> <span id="s130">And the first thing I, for instance, knew about the Balfour Declaration and Zionism was a flood of leaflets strewn by airplanes into German cities: "Jews of Germany, join the Zionist movement and get your own homeland.</span> <span id="s131">You are no longer welcome in Germany," in English language and in as a war propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">FS: In the early '20's were you aware of the fact that you were excluded from the various vÃ¶lkisch [national] movements like the Pfadfinder and other youth organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">GH: To a certain degree, yes, but not in the way that we were excluded, but that young Jews wanted to be among themselves.</span> <span id="s134">And all this did not start in the '20's.</span> <span id="s135">In the '20's this was a finished development.</span> <span id="s136">When the whole youth movement in the modern sense started in England, but it came to Germany before the First World War in the form of WandervÃ¶gel [wandering birds - a youth group] and in the form of--I don't remember the other names.</span> <span id="s137">They were not so important.</span> <span id="s138">It was a movement back to nature, back to the enjoyment of nature, of hiking, and the simple life, in opposition to the comfortable bourgeois life of the parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">FS: Do you remember any of the leaders of the Jewish youth movements?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">GH: I certainly do, and I'll come to that.</span> <span id="s141">But I must tell you that even the Zionist Jewish movement started out of the German youth movement, the WandervÃ¶gel Bewegung [movement].</span> <span id="s142">And there was in 1913 a big meeting of all the youth groups with all the paraphernalia of being against the civilized bourgeois meeting.</span> <span id="s143">In this...</span></p> <p><span id="s144">FS: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s145">Being against, can you explain that.</span> <span id="s146">I do not quite understand it.</span> <span id="s147">This big convention, it was against what?</span> <span id="s148">I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">GH: It was--the convention was not in the, not against, what was against--this was the feeling of the young people was that they were caught in the lifestyle of their parents, which they rejected in the way in which so many of today's youth reject the comfortable bourgeois life of their parents, Jewish and non-Jews alike, and which drives today so many young people into the cults, drove the young people in Germany, in the time of about 1905 or 6 or about that time, up to the beginning of the First World War, and it culminated in this big movement or this big convention, pour neissen [phonetic].</span> <span id="s150">Anybody who has gone through the youth movement here probably has heard this being true.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">And in this big convention the beginning Jewish groups were involved, too.</span> <span id="s152">It began as a special Jewish youth movement within the German youth movement and gradually, partly due to the experiences of the First World War and the beginning racist undertone of the German movement, then came the split.</span> <span id="s153">And there were two different groups among the Jewish youth movement.</span> <span id="s154">One was the Zionist movement, the Blue/White, Blau-Weiss.</span> <span id="s155">They adopted the Mogen-Dovid and they adopted the blue and white colors and to meet all their needs.</span> <span id="s156">They were the first ones to really feel that their religion was not the only thing which divided or which separated the Jewish youth movement from the general German movements.</span> <span id="s157">And then there was the German-oriented group, the Comrades, they called themselves, die Kameraden.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">FS: Was this a Jewish or a German movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">GH: It is a movement of the non-Zionist Jewish youth in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">FS: Were they accepted by their Christian counterparts as Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">GH: That I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s162">They certainly were not accepted by the beginning racist German movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">FS: Was the racist movement strong as long back as you remember?</span> <span id="s164">Was the racist movement strong in 1913 already?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">GH: Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s166">There was a racist movement, not so much among the youth but among the grown-ups, as way back as the beginning 19th century.</span> <span id="s167">It started with an Englishman.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">FS: Chamberlain.4</span></p> <p><span id="s169">GH: Yes, Chamberlain.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">FS: Let's not go back to that.</span> <span id="s171">Let's continue on.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">GH: So this had gone on and on, and it found its first general acceptance and it first came into public knowledge with Wagner.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">FS: Are you referring to Richard Wagner?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">GH: Yes.</span> <span id="s175">That was the beginning of the racist Teutonic movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">FS: And which decade do you think this racist Teutonic movement started?</span> <span id="s177">Where did it have its origin?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">GH: It became dangerous after the end of the First World War.</span> <span id="s179">And there were many, many causes to help it along--the defeat in the war, the poverty, the inflation, the destruction of the economic basis for everything.</span> <span id="s180">And as usual, who can you blame?</span> <span id="s181">The Jews.</span> <span id="s182">And that was the nightstick which they held over us.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">FS: When do you think you or your husband, when did you hear of Hitler first?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">GH: Well, we all heard of Hitler first when he published his Mein Kampf.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">FS: Then you didn't know, you didn't pay any importance to the fact that Hitler's march took place in Munich?</span> <span id="s186">[Hitler's effort in 1923 to overthrow the government.]</span></p> <p><span id="s187">GH: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s188">And we who were at the universities, we got to feel it first.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">FS: Where did you attend the university?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">GH: In GÃ¶ttingen and in Munich.</span> <span id="s191">And of course, you could not be in Munich without noticing what was going on.</span> <span id="s192">But still, we did not take it seriously enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">FS: Do you remember anything about the so-called Soviet Republic of Bavaria?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">GH: Certainly.</span> <span id="s195">I even was on the Theresienwiese when it was proclaimed, from sheer curiosity.</span> <span id="s196">But then I got afraid before they started the march through the city.</span> <span id="s197">And it is true that this movement, which raised the anger and the hate of not only the racists, but of all anti-communist parts of the population, in which it raised all the fears that there were Jews in leading positions.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">FS: Many Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">GH: Quite a few, not so many, but leading ones and the ones who were the vocal ones.</span> <span id="s200">I still see Eisner, Kurt Eisner, standing under the big statue of the Bavaria on the Theresienwiese in Munich, and inside the thousands and thousands of people.</span> <span id="s201">I knew relatively little of all this.</span> <span id="s202">I was involved during the last years in the university in the student movements, especially under the leadership of Max Weber, the really founder of the, of sociology, and who wrote very interesting and very important books on the sociology of religion, especially the Jewish religion, which he considered a pariah religion and all this would be too far.</span> <span id="s203">But when the real political movement started, around 1920, I had just married, had one child after the other.</span> <span id="s204">We were glad to know where our next meal would come from and so onto participate in any political actions.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">FS: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s206">Can you tell me before you go too far now, could you tell me everything you know about the Free Corps [Frei Korps] and the destruction of the labor movement in Bavaria?</span> <span id="s207">Do you remember any of that?</span> <span id="s208">What did the Free Corps, what did they consist of?</span> <span id="s209">Who paid them?</span> <span id="s210">Who financed this group?</span> <span id="s211">Who organized it?</span> <span id="s212">Who led it?</span> <span id="s213">Do you remember any of these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">GH: I remember a little of it and this conquest of Munich, for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">FS: Conquest by whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">GH: By the Free Corps, in which the leaders of the RÃ¤terepublik, that means the German Soviet Republic of Bavaria, were killed, near the Landau an der Isar.</span> <span id="s217">A brother of my mother-in-law was the physician of this corps, so little was it at that time specifically anti-Jewish.</span> <span id="s218">The leaders knew it and meant it, but it was not really known in the public.</span> <span id="s219">It was the fight against the Communist conquest of Germany, which never went further than Munich.</span> <span id="s220">And I was in Berlin, where I had my first job, when the Kapp Putsch took place.</span> <span id="s221">[1920]</span></p> <p><span id="s222">FS: I was just going to ask you to tell me all you know about Kapp Putsch.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">GH: I lived through all these things.</span> <span id="s224">And now that you ask me, memories that I had completely forgotten come back to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">FS: Tell me, did the leader of the Kapp Putsch finally wind up as a very harmless individual, a refugee in Sweden?</span> <span id="s226">What do you remember about the Kapp Putsch?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">GH: What I remember is, first, that he putsched up the labor movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">FS: Who is he?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">GH: Kapp.5</span></p> <p><span id="s230">FS: So you remember his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">GH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">FS: It doesn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">GH: No, I don't remember but I can easily look it up if it's of interest for you.</span> <span id="s234">And he then concentrated in the spring of 1920 on Berlin.</span> <span id="s235">The first success he had was a general strike of all workers, like we have them here.</span> <span id="s236">The whole city came to a standstill.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">FS: This was a strike against Kapp?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">GH: No, no, for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">FS: Oh, for Kapp.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">GH: Yes, against the incredible and incredibly bad economic, social, political situation in Germany.</span> <span id="s241">It was the time when the inflation grew and grew.</span> <span id="s242">It's unbelievable for me just today that inflation can grow and grow, as it does in America now, and not only the Schieber [racketeers] and the scoundrels could live comfortably.</span> <span id="s243">We all were used to be so poor that very little else had room in our heads and in our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">FS: Gertrude, in the books I've studied about this period, there seems to be a consensus that the inflation was really very much desired by the big German industrial interests, because they were able to borrow money to finance their various undertakings and they knew very well that they didn't have to pay this money back because by the time the debentures became due, the debt was nonexistent.</span> <span id="s245">So, many of the authors seem to agree on the fact that inflation was in the interests of big industry, big business.</span> <span id="s246">Do you feel the same thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">GH: Is that so different from what we have now?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">FS: That's the question I was going to ask you.</span> <span id="s249">Is the inflation being helped along in America by big American industry, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">GH: I think so.</span> <span id="s251">But it does not hit so hard, because thanks to the American credit system, everybody who has an American credit card or credit card of any kind, profits in his little way for his consumer status as the big conglomerates do it on a big scale.</span> <span id="s252">And that was not known in Germany of that time, and nobody would give credit for consumers.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">FS: In those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">GH: No.</span> <span id="s255">You had to pay cash.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">FS: Let's go back to the Kapp Putsch.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">GH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">FS: Was this a military Putsch?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">GH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">FS: Were there any of the well known military figures of World War I involved?</span> <span id="s261">Was Ludendorff involved in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">GH: Yes, very strongly.</span> <span id="s263">I think Ludendorff whether he was involved in the Kapp Putsch especially I don't know, because the Kapp Putsch was concentrated much more in northern Germany and Ludendorff lived in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s264">But he was definitely strongly involved and probably the military consultant of the Nazi movements in its early days.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">FS: When you read first about the Nazi movement, at that time, were there any of the figures who later accompanied Hitler in his rise to power and his conquest of Europe, were any of those figures like Goering, Goebbels, were they part of the scene at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">GH: Yes, yes, yes both of them.</span> <span id="s267">Then another man by the name of Rosenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">FS: Alfred Rosenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">GH: Yes, the intellect.</span> <span id="s270">He collected Jewish cult and cultural subjects for his museum of the Jews.</span> <span id="s271">Quite a few of the property of the former Jewish congregations were saved this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">FA: That was in Strassburg during the Second World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">GH: In Strassburg and in Frankfurt or near Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s274">I don't remember where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">FS: When Hitler's putsch in Munich in 1923 failed, did the then existing Jewish leaders feel that the danger of this man had passed?</span> <span id="s276">Did you hear that?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">GH: Yes, much too much, because far too few, and that includes me too, too many failed to really see the seriousness of the situation.</span> <span id="s278">And that is something which haunts me, because I have the feeling that the American Jews repeat much of this blindness and ostrich-like attitude.</span> <span id="s279">Too many still think it cannot happen here.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">FS: To which extent do you fault the Jews for the rise of Hitler?</span> <span id="s281">Do you feel that the Jews were too visible by being in the professions, doctors, lawyers, or by being wholesalers of farm produce?</span> <span id="s282">Where do you think was our biggest contribution to our destruction?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">GH: I used to think that it was what you just said.</span> <span id="s284">I have begun to think that I was mistaken in thinking so.</span> <span id="s285">Regardless of what we did, we were blamed, as always.</span> <span id="s286">If you keep too much to yourself, you are blamed by those who hate you, and there are many.</span> <span id="s287">And if you try to be as everybody else, you still stick out like a sore thumb.</span> <span id="s288">Whatever we do, [Telephone rings] we do wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Tape 2, side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s290">GH: ...participated in as it appears in my memory.</span> <span id="s291">An eye-witness testimony is not always the best one.</span> <span id="s292">Many things I either have forgotten, many things I do not know because I was not actively enough involved in it, and many things appear to me now different from what I thought of them then.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">FS: Now, let's go over the Jewish participation in German art and culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">GH: Which was tremendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">FS: Was it an additive to German culture or was it a detriment to German culture or was it a detriment to Jews to have participated in such a grand style?</span> <span id="s296">Just roam all over the place and tell us everything you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">GH: Well, it is too big a bite for one person.</span> <span id="s298">But certainly it was much higher percentage-wise than the percentage of Jews in the German population.</span> <span id="s299">This had several reasons.</span> <span id="s300">One, of course, was that so many of the Jews were living in the metropolitan areas where the theaters were...</span></p> <p><span id="s301">FS: In the cities, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">GH: Mostly Berlin, to a large extent Berlin.</span> <span id="s303">In other cities, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">FS: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">GH: Such as Munich and a few cities of a medium size--Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s306">Frankfurt and Berlin were the most Jewish of the big cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">FS: Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">GH: I don't know whether there were many artists and writers of more than local fame.</span> <span id="s309">I don't know of any.</span> <span id="s310">But at sometime or the other, I think everyone was in Berlin, at sometime or the other of his or her own life.</span> <span id="s311">And this started long before the First World War.</span> <span id="s312">Names like Mahler in music, Liebermann in art, Kaiser and Werfel and Wassermann.</span> <span id="s313">It's a long, long list of names and they to a very large degree, really dominated the style.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">FS: Did the Germans as a whole, the people you knew within your social caste, did they applaud the fact that Jews participated in art or was it resented by them?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">GH: It was different in many ways from case to case.</span> <span id="s316">Of course, my personal experience was with people who did not resent the Jews.</span> <span id="s317">With the others, I had no contact.</span> <span id="s318">And when I was still in school, my best friends, other than the Jewish girls, were daughters of pastors and professors and high school teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">FS: Gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">GH: Gentiles.</span> <span id="s321">And I still have contact with them as far as they are still alive.</span> <span id="s322">They sought me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">FS: Did they seek you out as an individual, or did they seek you out because you were the only Jew who measured up to their level?</span> <span id="s324">Did they resent the Jews as a whole?</span> <span id="s325">What do you remember about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">GH: Those who resented the Jews, they were hostile to me in class.</span> <span id="s327">It did not dawn on me, and this is pre-war time I'm talking about now, I was not aware of the basis for it.</span> <span id="s328">I thought they didn't like me, and so I kept to myself until later on, when one of the girls with whom I became good friends, mostly after school, the Catholic daughter of a public school teacher, and then she told me, "They didn't mind you.</span> <span id="s329">They were antisemites.</span> <span id="s330">You were too naive to notice it."</span> <span id="s331">But to live with risches [meanness, menace, antisemitism] was an everyday experience and you did not waste your time thinking about it.</span> <span id="s332">And the very peculiar experience in this, my personal experience, is that many of the former schoolmates--we were then all long in college or were married and had children or were in professions--they came to me then and sought me out and said, "If we only had known where antisemitism can lead, we might have fought it earlier when there was still time."</span></p> <p><span id="s333">FS: When you were of marriageable age, was intermarriage a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">GH: It was no, I don't know.</span> <span id="s335">It happened, but I don't think it was so general a problem.</span> <span id="s336">It became later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">FS: By later on you're referring to which period?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">GH: The late Twenties.</span> <span id="s339">It was a real problem earlier, in the first time after the Emancipation, and especially of Jewish girls marrying outside of their own faith.</span> <span id="s340">In playing a role at this, I don't know whether you have--that was in the beginning of the 19th century--and there were tragic ones.</span> <span id="s341">Some of them, those young men and women converted for religious reasons, others for social reasons, and it was invariably the end of the Jewish part.</span> <span id="s342">The Jewish part converted immediately and sometimes with a feeling of self-hate.</span> <span id="s343">But I don't think that it was in my lifetime to such a degree that the Jewish community felt threatened by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">FS: Can we digress from that and go specifically to your association, your and your husband's association and personal relations with Franz Rosenzweig?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">GH: Yes.</span> <span id="s346">It started out, the relationship between my husband and Franz Rosenzweig, before I knew either one of them, because as a young schoolboy my later husband went through the same religious yearning and the dissatisfaction with his Jewishness which came out of sheer ignorance of what Judaism really entailed.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">FS: What year are we talking about now?</span> <span id="s348">Just put us in a time frame.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">GH: That was around 1910, no, a little later.</span> <span id="s350">It was in the beginning years of the war.</span> <span id="s351">And Franz Rosenzweig helped him on his way back into Judaism with the same means which he had found for himself by taking him into services in real Yiddish shuls.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">FS: Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">GH: Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">FS: This was in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">GH: In Berlin.</span> <span id="s356">I don't even know whether this was or whether he took Rudi into a shul in Berlin or someplace else.</span> <span id="s357">I knew both of them.</span> <span id="s358">I knew of Franz Rosenzweig, and my later husband was younger than I am.</span> <span id="s359">He was a boyfriend of my sister.</span> <span id="s360">And he started to come to me too, with his problems.</span> <span id="s361">And on this basis I met Franz Rosenzweig at the wedding of a good friend of mine to Franz Rosenzweig's cousin.</span> <span id="s362">And we spent the whole evening discussing the problems of Rudi Hallo.</span> <span id="s363">[Laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s364">FS: He was at that time not your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">GH: He wasn't even my fiancÃ©.</span> <span id="s366">And I could never think of him in this way.</span> <span id="s367">This came pretty shortly after this, and started completely on this basis because in a way we were not so different.</span> <span id="s368">I went through the same problems myself, of a more or less un-Jewish upbringing, a parental home without any religion, and not belonging anywhere.</span> <span id="s369">And that was something I could not stand.</span> <span id="s370">When I was 12, 13 years old, I couldn't wait until I would be 14, when you had the religious possibility to decide which religion you wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">FS: Who gave you that possibility, your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">GH: No, the law.</span> <span id="s373">There was no division between the church and state.</span> <span id="s374">You had to belong to a church, and the synagogue was a church in this sense, which was in many ways very easy for the Jewish congregations.</span> <span id="s375">The contributions were taxes and were collected by the state in percentage of your state income tax.</span> <span id="s376">And the rabbis were hired civil servants and paid by the state out of these taxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">FS: So at age 14 you could choose...</span></p> <p><span id="s378">GH: You could decide; you could choose.</span> <span id="s379">And when I was about 12, I felt as soon as I have the right to, I will be baptized.</span> <span id="s380">And I knew my father would object, but not because I didn't choose to be Jewish, but because I chose to become, in an official way, a member of a religious community.</span> <span id="s381">He had lost his belief in a personal God and everything at a pretty young age, and that was the end for him.</span> <span id="s382">He never thought of leaving Judaism and he was very active all his life, first in the social and welfare work of the congregation, and then in his fight against antisemitism.</span> <span id="s383">It was his conviction that religion in any organized form was a self-deception.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">FS: Let's go back to Franz Rosenzweig.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">IS: We'll be here all night long.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">GH: What time is it?</span> <span id="s387">Oh, no we won't.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">FS: Now we were going to talk about your personal relationship, you and your husband's with the Rosenzweigs.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">GH: The relationship between Franz Rosenzweig and Rudi was an inherited relationship.</span> <span id="s390">Their mothers were close friends and Franz Rosenzweig was so much older than both my husband and I were, that the friendship was always like big brother and little boy in those years.</span> <span id="s391">And we got engaged at the same time and then we were treated as engaged couple, very often with adults in the Rosenzweig's household.</span> <span id="s392">And among the letters which have been collected and published are many to my husband.</span> <span id="s393">If you are interested, I can loan you the volume of letters and you can find these out.</span> <span id="s394">And it is worthwhile for you to get an idea of the man Rosenzweig to read through these letters.</span> <span id="s395">Do you still read German?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">FS: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">GH: Because they have not been translated; only a few of them have been translated.</span> <span id="s398">You can read all of that.</span> <span id="s399">And then when his illness came, I was very often in...</span></p> <p><span id="s400">FS: This is Rosenzweig's illness?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">GH: Yes, Rosenzweig's illness.</span> <span id="s402">I was very often in Frankfurt to help out, to help out in the household, especially when his wife, with whom I became close friends and still am close friends--she is still alive--when she expected the baby, and had to take it a little easier.</span> <span id="s403">And I learned to take dictation from him, which was really very difficult.</span> <span id="s404">His illness has been described so often that it's--I don't know how much you should enter into that.</span> <span id="s405">But it was a very, very difficult time.</span> <span id="s406">How it was possible to live the life he lived without any physical abilities left except for breathing, hardly swallowing.</span> <span id="s407">He could in the end only move a little bit of the little finger of his left hand.</span> <span id="s408">And there was a typewriter in Germany called Erika where you did not hit the keys, but where you moved a stylus, and then there was a transmission which then moved the keys and, I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s409">He had constructed somehow a strengthening of this transmission so that this small movement of his left finger made the stylus move the key of this letter, which always meant the first letter of the word.</span> <span id="s410">And the person to whom he dictated had to guess what it meant.</span> <span id="s411">And when you guessed the right word, then he nodded.</span> <span id="s412">That he could do.</span> <span id="s413">And when it was wrong, he shook his head with such a furious expression that you knew what he meant.</span> <span id="s414">And in this way with the help of his wife--she was really in the end the only one who could follow him--he wrote all these books.</span> <span id="s415">Incredible.</span> <span id="s416">Of course, they were well off, so they had all the help in the household for his care.</span> <span id="s417">That meant money could buy, but it couldn't buy too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">FS: Was he of a working family?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">GH: Yes.</span> <span id="s420">Very much so.</span> <span id="s421">So I was in the household very often and was very often, most of the time, in this minyan and helped prepare it, which was a tremendous job every Friday afternoon to turn this room which was a sick room, the living room, the dining room, the schoolroom, all in one, to turn it into a chapel.</span> <span id="s422">And it was so Orthodox that you had to put a curtain at the back of the room for the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">FS: What kind of relations did you have with Rosenzweig's children?</span> <span id="s424">Did they know you as a friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">GH: There was only this one boy, because after that, the boy was conceived when the illness must have already been in him.</span> <span id="s426">But, fortunately, he was a perfectly normal child.</span> <span id="s427">I still have a relationship with him and with his wife.</span> <span id="s428">But his wife is a non-Jewish German woman who came after the First World War6 with a so-called SÃ¼hneaktion to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">FS: What is SÃ¼hneaktion?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">GH: That was a movement and is still probably.</span> <span id="s431">I don't know whether it still exists among the young Germans, the generation which was born in the early or late '20's, feeling the guilt of what the Nazis did and felt called upon to atone for it.</span> <span id="s432">SÃ¼hne is atonement.</span> <span id="s433">And it was called the SÃ¼hneaktion.</span> <span id="s434">They came to Israel in groups, went into the kibbutzim to do the dirtiest and heaviest work.</span> <span id="s435">And I think that this girl joined the SÃ¼hneaktion mainly under the influence of Rosenzweig's books which she had read.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">FS: When you say this girl, whom are you referring to specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">GH: The wife of Franz Rosenzweig's son.</span> <span id="s438">And she converted to Judaism and married him in his second marriage.</span> <span id="s439">He had been married before to a Dutch Jewish girl who was--he was in a kibbutz as a child with Youth Aliyah and he married another Jewish girl from Holland who had gone before or during the conquest of Holland by the Nazis, escaped, and gone to Israel with the Youth Aliyah, too.</span> <span id="s440">They were in the same kibbutz and married, but their marriage was rather unhappy.</span> <span id="s441">Later on, he married this German girl, who converted and is a very, very strong Zionist and working for peace with the Arabs.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">FS: Do you remember any comments by Franz Rosenzweig in respect to Hitler or his movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">GH: No, I don't remember any.</span> <span id="s444">It was very much out of his sphere.</span> <span id="s445">Don't forget, he died in 1929, four years before the Nazis came into power.</span> <span id="s446">He knew about them and he was quite concerned about what would become of Jews and Germans living together.</span> <span id="s447">But he saw it all under the aspect of religion, history, culture, which could in all our minds exist Jewishly as well as Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">FS: Now what do you remember from your husband's comments, fears, and experiences during the rise of the Hitler regime?</span> <span id="s449">Or your own, for that matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">GH: My own, because that was not a matter of the, the difference between men and women or boys and girls.</span> <span id="s451">We feared it, and I will never forget when we, too, saw the Brownshirts marching in Hamburg, where my husband had gone for a lecture in the Warburg Institute which he had to give, and where he fell sick with virus pneumonia and died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">FS: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">GH: It was in January, 1933.</span> <span id="s454">He died on the 21st of January, and on the 23rd, the day when he was buried, Hitler became Reichskanzler.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">FS: Tell me, as the 1920's came to an end and the Zentralpartei, which is the party of the German Catholics, provided Germany with...</span></p> <p><span id="s456">GH: It's Zentrumspartei...</span></p> <p><span id="s457">FS: Zentrumspartei provided Germany with ineffective chancellors, von Papen, BrÃ¼ning--what do you remember about these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">GH: Only Erzberger was Zentrumspartei.</span> <span id="s459">The others were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">FS: BrÃ¼ning was Zentrumspartei.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">GH: He was Catholic but I don't think he was Zentrumspartei, but I may be mistaken about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">FS: What do you remember about these crucial years which really, in my opinion, initiated the age of Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">GH: Yes, it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">FS: What do you remember about these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">GH: I remember mostly the helplessness against the enemies outside and inside.</span> <span id="s466">With all the differences, their struggle and their frustrating struggle is quite similar in many ways to Carter and his inability to get a firm hold on the foreign and domestic policies of America.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">FS: By helplessness, you speak not of government...</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Tape 2, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s469">FS: You are giving me the information which I read in [unclear] experiences.</span> <span id="s470">Through your own experiences, if your experiences are covered in every history book.</span> <span id="s471">[Tape off, then on] I will live another 40 years.</span> <span id="s472">I am not a youngster.</span> <span id="s473">I am 60 years old.</span> <span id="s474">But in 30 years the entire German Jewish community in Philadelphia will only be a memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">GH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">FS: Will only be a memory.</span> <span id="s477">And you're really one of the very few who still have the knowledge of putting personal experience of this period into the hands of these future students.</span> <span id="s478">And therefore I would ask you to try to remember.</span> <span id="s479">Because von Papen and General von Schleicher preceded Hitler to the chancellery.</span> <span id="s480">And I believe this period--I believe von Papen was chancellor for two years and General von Schleicher was chancellor for one month.</span> <span id="s481">And this period in Jewish history is of such utmost importance that your judgment and your memories also are of utmost importance.</span> <span id="s482">So try to remember what you remember about this period.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">GH: What I remember is our frustration with the lack of ability and efficiency in the government.</span> <span id="s484">We saw all these movements like the Kapp Putsch, like the growing inflation, like the inability to get at last and at least rid of the reparation payments which added so much to the inflation and the economic distress of Germany.</span> <span id="s485">Nothing worked.</span> <span id="s486">The money got worth less and less and less.</span> <span id="s487">And the Schieber, the swindlers, those who had gotten rich in the war through swindle and everything, they got more and more out of it.</span> <span id="s488">So we shared the criticism.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">FS: But I'm trying to get into the twilight of Hitlerism.</span> <span id="s490">Can you step forward a little bit and go to 1930?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">GH: Yes.</span> <span id="s492">I had started to tell you, first of all the shock when Hitler really made a kind of private army.</span> <span id="s493">And these uniformed Brownshirts with their terrible swastika armbands marched through the streets to the tunes of the Hitlerlied: "Wenn das Judenblut voun Messer springt."</span> <span id="s494">[spritzt]</span></p> <p><span id="s495">FS: When the blood of the Jews runs off the sharp knives...</span></p> <p><span id="s496">GH: Yes.</span> <span id="s497">And no police, no Reichswehr, that means army, nobody even lifted a finger.</span> <span id="s498">Just fear and fear and fear, and the wish that the bad dream might pass away.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">FS: This was the Jewish attitude, hoping would just disappear?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">GH: Yes, really strongly.</span> <span id="s501">And those, like all the people I knew more closely, knew and felt it will not just disappear.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">FS: Was there any Jewish leadership, any, prominent Jews, who spoke out and pointed out the danger of this movement?</span> <span id="s503">Do you remember any prominent Jews, who were leading German Jews, who were trying to direct the Jews to disband it?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">GH: Not in general, but the moment we were excluded from the general life, all of the German Jewry, at least in the big cities and those interested in spiritual and cultural life, got together, formed their own organizations, provided their own education for adults and for children, had excellent lectures and classes and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">FS: You're referring to the actual Hitler time, Hitler period now?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">GH: Yes.</span> <span id="s507">It's because then the doomsday had come.</span> <span id="s508">And it is not true that the German Jews just went to be slaughtered like sheep.</span> <span id="s509">They had no choice but being slaughtered, but as upright men and women and knowing for what they were suffering.</span> <span id="s510">The ones who were completely lost, and among whom there were so many suicides, were those who still lived in the daydream that they were not meant because they were such good Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">FS: Here's a question.</span> <span id="s512">I've never been able to get an answer.</span> <span id="s513">I remember--at this time I was 13 or 14, I remember in what's now the German Democratic Republic, I believe it was in Dessau or Leipzig, there was a Jewish group which was affiliated or thought to be affiliated with Hitler and the leader of this group was Naumann.</span> <span id="s514">What do you remember about Naumann?</span> <span id="s515">7</span></p> <p><span id="s516">GH: Ach, wir sind unsere eigene Schande.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">FS: Can you translate that?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">GH: "We are our own disgrace," with a big sign over his chest marching in a Hitler rally.</span> <span id="s519">That was a small but very vocal splinter group despised by everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">FS: And they actively collaborated with Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">GH: They would have if they had been allowed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">FS: There's a school of thought today that Hitler actually overestimated the need of antisemitism in order to capture the German government.</span> <span id="s523">That he would have captured the German government without being an official antisemitic party, and that he could have used the Jews in revitalizing German industry after he took over in 1933.</span> <span id="s524">I read that in a recent book, only the author's name escapes me.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">GH: Do you refer to the half-fiction book, The City Without Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">PS: No.</span> <span id="s527">But have you ever heard this discussed?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">GH: Yes, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s529">But to my feeling and my judgment is sheer nonsense.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">FS: You feel that the success of the entire movement was built upon antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">GH: Not only on antisemitism but of this misty glorification of the Herrenvolk, of the Teutonic psyche, and what have you.</span> <span id="s532">There, with logic and practical ideas he could not have conquered the masses.</span> <span id="s533">His whole charisma depended on such a slogan.</span> <span id="s534">And what was better than to have a scapegoat in the beginning, and then all the idealistic people followed him, too.</span> <span id="s535">And when they recognized what this all meant, when the concentration camps and all that began, it was too late.</span> <span id="s536">I can always only refer to the present time.</span> <span id="s537">That's why I am so fearful of the complacency with which all of America, and led by the American Civil Liberties Union, thinks it cannot happen here and defends the constitutional rights of the Nazis, of people who do not make any secret, but boast of misusing the constitutional rights in order to destroy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">FS: I think we should at this point call it an evening.</span> <span id="s539">After we have digested all these masses of information you have given to our brains and our tape recorder...</span></p> <p><span id="s540">GH: And cut out a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">FS: ...perhaps we someday could...</span></p> <p><span id="s542">GH: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">FS: ...speak about it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">GH: But don't make it my lecture.</span> <span id="s545">I haven't been asked to give a lecture.</span> <span id="s546">You...</span></p> <p><span id="s547">FS: Thank you very much, Gertrude, for this wonderful evening, for being such a gracious hostess, and for letting my wonderful wife and myself pick your brain.</span> <span id="s548">Good night.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">GH: You're very welcome to everything.</span> <span id="s550">Thank you very much.</span></p></body></html>
