SCHIFF</span></p> <p><span id="s10">July 27, 2000 Beginning Tape One, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff, conducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27, 2000, in Forest Hills, New York.</span> <span id="s12">This is tape number one, side A. Mrs. Schiff, would you please tell me your name at birth, and when and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: My name is Gabriele D. Schiff.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Hamburg, Germany, on October fifth, 1914.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Could you tell me briefly about your family, and about your home life in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born to a physician and his wife.</span> <span id="s17">We had a very assimilated home life.</span> <span id="s18">I was the youngest of four children.</span> <span id="s19">I went to high school, as far as I could get in Germany.</span> <span id="s20">It was all under the Whymar Republic, which of course, 1933, was taken over by Hitler, and my schooling, at least my formal schooling, came to an end.</span> <span id="s21">And at that time, one had to think slowly, about preparation for leaving Germany.</span> <span id="s22">I was about 16 at the time, and it was a very difficult Germany, and the most uneasy time for Jews, but an e -- uneasy time for Germany, all around.</span> <span id="s23">Vesters, strikes, and on the whole, you are looking how to create a future.</span> <span id="s24">My first job, as I always wanted to be a social worker, from my seventh year on, I became a secretary in a Jewish girl’s orphanage.</span> <span id="s25">And at that time, it became clear that the girls who had no German passports, mostly of them Polish orphans, would be sent back to Poland.</span> <span id="s26">It was partly my job to help prepare the children for a life that we really couldn’t foresee, but it certainly meant separation, separation from the place they knew, as well as if they had relatives, separation from relatives, into the unknown.</span> <span id="s27">I have done that about a year, and then decided to better learn England, prepare -- English -- to prepare for eventual immigration.</span> <span id="s28">I went to England, and tried to learn shorthand and typing.</span> <span id="s29">I never did very well.</span> <span id="s30">I worked in household, but then a letter came from a colleague in Hamburg, telling me that there were still so many children that could possibly go out -- correction, not so many, but some.</span> <span id="s31">And I decided, against anybody’s advice, to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s32">And I stayed in Germany for about a year, and again, helped children, also worked for the German Jewish community.</span> <span id="s33">It’s interesting that even though we had very assimilated, from the very beginning, my 50 year career in social work, was almost all in Jewish social work.</span> <span id="s34">I prepared for my immigration, which was very difficult for many reasons, which perhaps we don’t have to go into.</span> <span id="s35">The secret police at one time got hold of me, which was not a pleasant experience.</span> <span id="s36">They took my passport away, and eventually I got out of Germany, because one of my English friends, a former boyfriend, wrote me a fake letter that he was going to marry me, and I would become an English citizen, and set a date for our marriage.</span> <span id="s37">And at that point, I got my passport back, and left in a hurry.</span> <span id="s38">Again, I stayed in England for a very short time.</span> <span id="s39">I didn’t work.</span> <span id="s40">By that time my mother and my oldest brother had immigrated to England, and so it was a bit of a family reunion.</span> <span id="s41">It’s all not [indecipherable] clear in my memory, but somewhat like it.</span> <span id="s42">And my brother from America, where I als -- also had a brother, came.</span> <span id="s43">He was a lawyer here, working for the office of Price Administration, he must have been the levelator.</span> <span id="s44">Anyhow, he picked me up, and we came together to America.</span> <span id="s45">And it was a little funny story when I arrived here.</span> <span id="s46">People who thought I’d gone into the wilderness in America, my aunts, etcetera, had given me, of all things, tea kettles.</span> <span id="s47">So when I arrived here, and the customs opened my stuff, I was surrounded by the tea kettles, and the customs official looked at me and said, “Golly, what do you want to do?</span> <span id="s48">Trade with the Indians?”</span> <span id="s49">That’s the beginning of America.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: When did you arrive to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: In 1937, in September.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: So, just briefly maybe, we’ll turn back to your years in Hamburg, and could you tell me a little bit more?</span> <span id="s53">Was your family observant of religious holidays?</span> <span id="s54">A: No, we were very assimilated.</span> <span id="s55">Yes, proforma -- it’s a harsh word, but we did observe Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s56">Actually, I still do it, even though my life had gone up and down in between.</span> <span id="s57">And we were an upper class, very well known family.</span> <span id="s58">And what you did was always being looked at by others.</span> <span id="s59">But, I should mention my mother -- and I’ve inherited that from her, liked to help people, and she always volunteered.</span> <span id="s60">And she had what she called office hours in our house, and she would counsel people.</span> <span id="s61">And as a child of seven, I was sitting under the table, listening to these stories, and that’s why I decided I wanted to help.</span> <span id="s62">And another -- and that’s the last story of my past, we had a big house, and I had a governess, as ever -- anybody had to, had a little money in Germany.</span> <span id="s63">And I was always afraid when the governess had the day out, and I was alone in the big house.</span> <span id="s64">So my father, to comfort me one day, bought me a big, chocolate teddy bear, and said that, “He’ll keep you company.”</span> <span id="s65">I didn’t want chocolate bear, I wanted somebody to talk to.</span> <span id="s66">So I cried.</span> <span id="s67">So my father, who was a little impatient, said, “Well, you are but spoiled.</span> <span id="s68">There are many poor children who have no teddy bears.”</span> <span id="s69">I said nothing, and I thought.</span> <span id="s70">Day before, we had taken a walk, and my governess had said, “Let’s walk slowly here,” no, correction again, “let’s walk fast, because this is where the poor children live.”</span> <span id="s71">So, I thought, teddy bear, poor children.</span> <span id="s72">So during afternoon, I ran around, back to that neighborhood with my chocolate bear, and when I saw a little girl that looked poor to me, pressed the chocolate teddy bear into her arms.</span> <span id="s73">Once later, my mother was playing bridge, and one of her partners said, “Our neighborhood is changing, because an absolutely strange girl walked up to my little daughter, and gave her a teddy bear.”</span> <span id="s74">And I always say, “I have spent my life giving teddy bears to the wrong people.”</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: You said that your family was a total of seven children?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Four.</span> <span id="s77">Four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Oh, I thought you said that you were one of seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: No.</span> <span id="s80">One of four.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: The youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: And briefly, would you tell me what happened to your family members, your immediate family members through the war years?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yeah, we were very lucky, we all got out of Germany, but not together.</span> <span id="s85">We have never been together again as a family.</span> <span id="s86">My mother left a little later than I did, to England, which she lived -- let’s see, she left after Crystal night, and only got out because my Dutch brother-in-law came from Paris to take her out with the help of the Dutch consulate.</span> <span id="s87">He came, and he was politically quite on the left, and had brought quite a few fake Dutch passports, and got out two or three well known writers, who were in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s88">One of them, Eric Musam, some people may be interested him, he was later killed, but he got him out.</span> <span id="s89">So [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And did you have any encounters with anti-Semitism when you were growing up in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Who hasn’t?</span> <span id="s92">Yes, and I only gi -- I had all -- I -- I had, as everybody else did, I remember well my first encounter, when I was, well, maybe 12.</span> <span id="s93">I had a girlfriend, very blonde, and very Aryan, and her father was an architect, and we were quote, best friends, end quote.</span> <span id="s94">And from one day to another, she said, with tears in her eyes, “My father forbade me to play with you any longer, because you are Jewish, and he belongs to a certain German organization, and would be a danger for him if his daughter is running around with a Jewish girl.”</span> <span id="s95">That was my very first -- and, I had to give you all these things you get from everybody, because of course, you met it everywhere, from your greengrocer -- and you met the other, too, people who stood up for you, and perhaps a most outstanding one was we had a super in our house, and he denounced my mother to the Secret Police, and denounced me, too, because I had a non-Jewish boyfriend, which was against the Nuremberg laws.</span> <span id="s96">So, I mean, we had our share of this, but compared what later on happened in eastern Europe, it’s all chicken feed.</span> <span id="s97">No [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s99">I think we can perhaps move on then, to your early years in America, and what you did when you first arrived.</span> <span id="s100">Any striking first impressions that you had, and that you’d like to recount?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Cause New York is overwhelming if you come from Germany, and my family -- I had an aunt here, who was very well-to-do, and was very nice to me, but I didn't fit into that type of society at all.</span> <span id="s102">I looked European, English was bad, politically I was too much interested in Social Democrats.</span> <span id="s103">They were very nice to me, but I didn’t want to play the role of a poor relative, that’s just not in me.</span> <span id="s104">And I had a Quaker friend in Philadelphia, who was a teacher of music.</span> <span id="s105">And we had been through a lot in Hamburg together, we had gone to school together.</span> <span id="s106">So I phoned her, and said, “Etta, please get me a job, any job.”</span> <span id="s107">And she came through.</span> <span id="s108">And I lived in the house of a lovely Quaker family, where my friend Etta also had a room.</span> <span id="s109">And I did a little a-around the house.</span> <span id="s110">I’m really not very well trained in that respect, but they were very good pe -- were actually lovely people.</span> <span id="s111">I took a little bit care of children.</span> <span id="s112">And money I didn’t have.</span> <span id="s113">Furs I had, but no money.</span> <span id="s114">And the man of the house, who was a lawyer, professor of law, discovered that I have a usable brain.</span> <span id="s115">And he thought to get anywhere in this country, I would have to study, and get at least a Bachelor.</span> <span id="s116">And he gave me a chance just try for a scholarship in a very good American college in Swarthmore, which has helped me for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s117">And they again were very nice, because they believed me.</span> <span id="s118">I had my examination for the university in Germany, which I didn’t have, but I said I had lost it.</span> <span id="s119">And I could make up for it in an examination, I passed with very good grades, and so I got through Swarthmore in two years.</span> <span id="s120">That, of course, was a big help, because then, during those two years, I used my furniture, rented an apartment with borrowed money, and sublet rooms to other students.</span> <span id="s121">And that way, I got through college.</span> <span id="s122">I just missed feeb -- Phi Beta Kappa, which I’m really angry about, because I had the cooking to do for -- and I had it easy because I majored in English, which was not in English literature, but I minored in German, so it meant I could concentrate on my major.</span> <span id="s123">And later on, I took psychology.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: So when you were in school, you were also focused to some extent on social work again?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Never left my mind.</span> <span id="s126">I did not tell you that before I even mentioned Swarthmore, I had gone to the Pennsylvania School of Social Work, who had told me I could not study social work if I wouldn’t have an America Bachelor.</span> <span id="s127">It was very different times, and that was one reason why I was so glad to go to Swarthmore.</span> <span id="s128">And the day I had my Bachelor, I went back to the University of Pennsylvania, I say, “Here I am, please let me in.”</span> <span id="s129">They were very psychologically oriented at that time, and they seriously said to me, “Well, you know, you will have to work with people who know pain, and suffering.</span> <span id="s130">And to know that, you have to know it yourself.</span> <span id="s131">Did you ever have any suffering and pain?”</span> <span id="s132">And I said, “Yeah, I just left my family in Europe, I make a very precarious living here.</span> <span id="s133">I’ve met many good things, but I’ve also met [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Did you have much fear in you when you arrived in the United States?</span> <span id="s135">Do you recall having that kind of emotion?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I recall having a lot of anxiety.</span> <span id="s137">Not so much fear, which is very much related.</span> <span id="s138">I didn’t think I would not get through, that never occurred to me.</span> <span id="s139">But I didn’t know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: And what did you continue to hear about developments in Germany and Europe during this part of your schooling, and your early years in the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: To be honest, I was so concentrating on daily life, that it was not very real to me.</span> <span id="s142">I knew what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s143">I was dead sure, if I’d ever become a citizen, I would go and try to help rebuild.</span> <span id="s144">I felt guilty.</span> <span id="s145">I was safe, and my friends were not.</span> <span id="s146">I was in close contact with the Quakers, who were the only organization, I believe, who could, at that time, get into Germany, even could -- and get into the camps.</span> <span id="s147">And they, at that time, were starting their so-called refugee section, and they ask me to work in it, and to set it up.</span> <span id="s148">And so I knew particularly about Germany, that people had lost their jobs, difficulties in getting out, were taken to camps, but if I’m very honest, for instance, Crystal night is not in my memory as the overwhelming experience it was, becu -- I think like, human beings, and young ones, you think about studying, about your boyfriends, about whatever the day brings.</span> <span id="s149">Yes, it’s all going on in Germany, and you also -- at least I was, a little bit cruel, and you thought, “Why didn’t these people get out?”</span> <span id="s150">Later on, I [indecipherable] they couldn’t, but I was somewhat mixed up in my thinking.</span> <span id="s151">It came back more and more when I -- at the refugee section, as my daily bread, and had to write and answer letters from Germany, people pleading for so-called affidavits.</span> <span id="s152">And while I was working with Quakers, I was sent to get affidavits, and I was, of all things, going to Iowa.</span> <span id="s153">Now, imagine this German Jewish girl, with fairly good English, but still not -- still the the English English.</span> <span id="s154">I was sent to farmers, who in their turn had rarely heard of Jews.</span> <span id="s155">So we had a great time not -- of learning each other.</span> <span id="s156">They showed me their farm, and they showed me everything they a -- and they talk with thee and thou, as the Quakers does.</span> <span id="s157">And whatever they showed me, I’d never seen before.</span> <span id="s158">And the very nice old farmer got a little impatient, and showed me a cow, and said, “Did thee ever see a cow?”</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So when were you in Iowa, and what exactly were you trying to accomplish while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: The latter I can answer first one.</span> <span id="s161">Probably in ’38 - ’39.</span> <span id="s162">It’s vague, but I think so, because ’39, I went to college, so it must have been before ’39.</span> <span id="s163">What was your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: And what were you trying to accomplish while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: I was charged to get affidavits of support for refugees who were still in Europe, and wanted to come to this country.</span> <span id="s166">And somebody had to guarantee that they would not become a charge of welfare.</span> <span id="s167">And I got quite a few affidavits, because I could plead my cause.</span> <span id="s168">I had seen it.</span> <span id="s169">And I did that, really until I went to college, working for the Quakers, being a counselor in a refugee camp.</span> <span id="s170">Now, this was a Quaker camp for refugees who had already arrived in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: And where was this refugee camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: In Nyak, New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Can you give a little more description of the camp, and the individuals you helped there?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s175">The people who were there, were very often couples where one part was not Jewish, or a -- some were political refugees, and not Jewish.</span> <span id="s176">The Quakers helped everybody.</span> <span id="s177">The majority had Jewish blood, it was not that they were -- I don’t think we had an Orthodox Jew in the camp.</span> <span id="s178">But it was comparatively young people, it were majority professional people, who needed retraining in this country, and the director of that camp was a minister.</span> <span id="s179">That was a -- an interesting experience for me, and I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s180">And the camp was run like all camps, there’s lots of language classes, and community interest.</span> <span id="s181">Some sport, but very little, the people had other interest at that kind than sport.</span> <span id="s182">Was a lot of writing to find where relatives were, and you [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s183">There, you never forget -- forgot that there was a war.</span> <span id="s184">I mean, not the war [indecipherable], but there was liberation for a war.</span> <span id="s185">And it had the most intellectual group that I’ve ever met in camps.</span> <span id="s186">Oh gosh, I have another camptery.</span> <span id="s187">Okay, a -- and I know that I wrote what I called a national hymn for that camp, which we sang for [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s188">I can’t sing, I don’t know music, but I wrote it.</span> <span id="s189">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Do you remember it?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No.</span> <span id="s192">I know where the camp was, Sky Island on the Hudson, and that was a refrain of it, everything was beautiful in Sky Island of the Hudson, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s193">I threw all that stuff out, today it would be interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Approximately how many refugees were in that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I really can’t -- can only guess a hundred, wild guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: And how long were you working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Two summers.</span> <span id="s198">It only existed during the summer, for people who couldn’t afford a real vacation, and who needed an effer -- American atmosphere.</span> <span id="s199">The food was so American, they had difficulty in eating -- well, it was very well meant, very human, and was in the estate of an American psychiatrist, who still is around, Dr. Viola Bernard.</span> <span id="s200">She still may be [indecipherable] the museum.</span> <span id="s201">She’s not Jewish, but very, very interested.</span> <span id="s202">And she had a beautiful estate, and the faucets were sort of heads of lions, so you can imagine.</span> <span id="s203">Okay, so much for that.</span> <span id="s204">And after one summer, in ’39, I started college.</span> <span id="s205">And in college, I had to run interesti -- I had many lovely, lovely experiences.</span> <span id="s206">But one experience that fits is, I was a -- later on -- is that true?</span> <span id="s207">No, doesn’t happen in college, comes a little later.</span> <span id="s208">So I graduated, made many friends.</span> <span id="s209">Was interesting to me, that there, we really didn’t know who was Jewish, and who was not.</span> <span id="s210">You know, that was such a difference.</span> <span id="s211">I was a rarity at that time, because refugees weren’t so many at that time.</span> <span id="s212">And I know, I get along with people, and I had a great time, and eventually I graduated, in ’41.</span> <span id="s213">And there was no question I’d go to school of social work, I got another scholarship, which meant another job on the side, but these things are typical for an immigré.</span> <span id="s214">And I kept my apartment with my furniture, I rented a room -- separate rooms.</span> <span id="s215">And began to be more involved with refugee questions.</span> <span id="s216">I had a room mate who was very much on the left political, and didn’t let me forget that it was Fascists who did all this.</span> <span id="s217">And we were very young.</span> <span id="s218">And I always get involved in strange things, so I was -- well -- political involvements, so stay out of it.</span> <span id="s219">And I found life very interesting, got much more Americanized.</span> <span id="s220">Had a very easy time in school of social work.</span> <span id="s221">My placement was with the children’s agency, and it all seemed to me very easy.</span> <span id="s222">I don’t know why they made so much fuss about it.</span> <span id="s223">The only bad thing was, I had in the morning, and in the evening, to travel for over an hour, through all of Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s224">So much for that.</span> <span id="s225">I still was in touch with the Quakers, I still have them out with the refugee faction.</span> <span id="s226">And I always have had a great respect and love for the Quakers, but never wanted to convert, because I always thought, you don’t run away from something that’s difficult into something that’s easier.</span> <span id="s227">So the Quakers were asked by the War Education Authority -- this is now ’41.</span> <span id="s228">Don’t hold me to the dates.</span> <span id="s229">Not ’41, I had a -- nonsense. ’</span> <span id="s230">43, I graduated from school of social work.</span> <span id="s231">There is something I don’t remember, and that’s what -- I think right after school, I went to Maryland, to the state hospital, because I was more and more interested in psychiatric social work.</span> <span id="s232">And I spent one difficult year in a state hospital near Sikesville, Maryland.</span> <span id="s233">And that was a -- hospital of about 3,000 patients, and five physicians.</span> <span id="s234">And there I became very much aware of Europe and it’s difficulties, because the majority of our five physicians had come from Europe, and had escaped Hitler.</span> <span id="s235">And there were also one Jewish physician who was American.</span> <span id="s236">And I told you, I get involved, sometimes I also in the wrong place.</span> <span id="s237">I became, in my free time, the director of the recreation for our camp of -- of conscientious objectors.</span> <span id="s238">I could wro -- write a book about it if I want.</span> <span id="s239">And that was not liked by the American attendants, because they had their husbands in the war, here was this one Jewish female, and she was playing around with the people who were trying to escape war duty, and messed up situation, I was in between vics.</span> <span id="s240">And the Jewish doctor, saw me going with my CO friends, a whole unit of them, singing Christmas carols.</span> <span id="s241">He called me to his office, and sa -- and said, “If I wouldn’t be punished, I would spank you.</span> <span id="s242">You are no [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s243">You tried to be a Christian,” -- which I never tried, I just like to go around with some [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s244">And he gave me hell.</span> <span id="s245">So I got it from Jewish side.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: This is tape number one, side B, of an interview with Gabriele D. Schiff.</span> <span id="s248">Mrs. Schiff, would you please tell me about your reaction to the start of World War Two, while you were in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: What, of course, I remember first of all, was that I was suddenly an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s250">I’d been thrown out of my country, to come to America, and find myself an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s251">I could not have a camera, I could not have a short wave radio.</span> <span id="s252">And for every trip, I had to get permission from Washington, which means my brother, who was in Washington, working for the government, I could only go and see him with special permission, which I got.</span> <span id="s253">I didn’t go too often, but he came to me.</span> <span id="s254">I -- these are individual things.</span> <span id="s255">My outstanding best friends at that time, were the director of the labor relations board in Philadelphia, and his wife.</span> <span id="s256">And they were ardent pacifists.</span> <span id="s257">And on the day the we -- war broke out, they asked me, “How do you feel about it?”</span> <span id="s258">And impulsively, I said, “I’m glad that,” -- now this is when America got into the war, -- “that America is getting into the war, because that will give the allies more power.”</span> <span id="s259">And they looked at me in disgust, and said, “How can you be glad about any war?”</span> <span id="s260">And I said, “Is it better when people are slaughtered in camps?</span> <span id="s261">Do you want that to go on for eternity?”</span> <span id="s262">So we had a very long discussion.</span> <span id="s263">We stayed friends afterwards, and we both kept our opinions.</span> <span id="s264">They were pacifists.</span> <span id="s265">I had been a pacifist for a good time of my life.</span> <span id="s266">As a matter of fact, when in Germany, I was the youngest member of the [indecipherable] for Human Rights.</span> <span id="s267">So, that will always be my interest.</span> <span id="s268">But, I changed when Hitler came, and I gave up the pacifist, I just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s269">But that’s my outstanding memory.</span> <span id="s270">And then, of course, it was the anxiety, I couldn’t get letters from Europe.</span> <span id="s271">I had heard so much about the first World War, because I was born in the beginning.</span> <span id="s272">But when I was five and six, the memory was still very strong, my parents, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s273">So, I knew what was going to happen, and I also had a ration book during the war, but I suppose everybody had it.</span> <span id="s274">I don’t know, I was in an institution, in that camp -- no, in the state hospital, and we got very little to eat, but I realized it was still much more than they had in Europe.</span> <span id="s275">And then, of course, I had very strong sympathies for the allies, and once in awhile, I got letters smuggled from England, or from my sister in France.</span> <span id="s276">I suffer always for some contact, somebody asked me this question.</span> <span id="s277">I don’t remember if the letters were censored or not.</span> <span id="s278">I don’t think I ever was out of contact with my mother.</span> <span id="s279">I looked -- I kept my mother’s address, but not the war time, one, so I -- I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s280">I remember how I threw my camera into a river, because I wasn’t permitted to have it.</span> <span id="s281">Why I didn’t give it to an American colleague, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s282">And I -- I did not have too many Jewish friends while I was in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s283">I had roo -- Jewish room mates, but one was American, and as I implied, very much on the left.</span> <span id="s284">The other was also from Germany, and very assimilated.</span> <span id="s285">And so certainly we were interested, we read the papers, and we hoped that war would be over.</span> <span id="s286">But we also tried very hard to live from day to day.</span> <span id="s287">Now, this changed for me in 1943 or four.</span> <span id="s288">I’m really not good with figures.</span> <span id="s289">When the War Education asked me -- War Education Authority, to go to Oswego, New York.</span> <span id="s290">And Oswego was a camp, it was a former army camp that had barracks, and awful ones.</span> <span id="s291">And there’s barbed wire around.</span> <span id="s292">It always amazes me, the only time I personally have been in the camp, with barbed wire, and real barracks, was in America.</span> <span id="s293">Because I was always insisted on living right in the camps, because you can’t be of help if you are billeted in a hotel outside.</span> <span id="s294">And these were a thousand refugees, who had been in -- yeah, it was called concentration camps, but were not extermination camps, in Italy.</span> <span id="s295">One was called Perramonte, just for your information.</span> <span id="s296">And the refugees, the majority, by far, were Jewish.</span> <span id="s297">I think we had about five non-Jewish people, but we had some.</span> <span id="s298">We had some Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s299">And Dr. Ruth Gruber, who was the assistant to all [indecipherable] acres, who was an -- high in the government, had been sent to Europe to select from different camps, a thousand refugees.</span> <span id="s300">These had been invited by President Roosevelt, with the idea that Italy was starving, and he would at -- at least take a thousand mouths out.</span> <span id="s301">Well, it’s really not a very bright idea, but it helped a thousand people.</span> <span id="s302">And they were invited to -- the whole time, they didn’t know if they could stay in this country.</span> <span id="s303">And what that means psychologically, you can’t do it -- can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s304">Actually, one was sent back because he was insane.</span> <span id="s305">The others eventually stayed here, in ’45.</span> <span id="s306">And I’ve met them over the -- my career in social work, all over the place.</span> <span id="s307">And that was my first camp ex -- no -- well, the other was a vacation camp, this was a camp with all the difficulties of a camp.</span> <span id="s308">People not having any privacy.</span> <span id="s309">Some people died.</span> <span id="s310">One person died shoveling snow.</span> <span id="s311">The administration was blamed for that.</span> <span id="s312">I got an [indecipherable] to later camp life.</span> <span id="s313">The food was always [indecipherable], it’s always in camps.</span> <span id="s314">People have to have an outlet for all their feelings, so they fight for food.</span> <span id="s315">We had a few birth.</span> <span id="s316">We had a hospital run by a Jewish laf -- doctor, who was supervised by Dr. Ruth, who had already an MD in America.</span> <span id="s317">In the hospital, I had an operation, and I remember my refugee doctor very well.</span> <span id="s318">However, it went all right.</span> <span id="s319">It was an ope -- operation, an appendix, and they found an ovary was -- they took out an ovary that shouldn’t have taken out [indecipherable] forget.</span> <span id="s320">And I stayed in that camp, almost through the end.</span> <span id="s321">I think I left a month before.</span> <span id="s322">People eventually got the permission to stay.</span> <span id="s323">Most of them came to New York.</span> <span id="s324">Ruth Gruber co-wrote a book about Oswego, “Safe Haven.”</span> <span id="s325">I disagree with the book, but anyhow --</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Can you explain why?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I -- Because she saw a side from the point of view of a rather optimistic American.</span> <span id="s328">She worked very hard, I mean, she really -- she helped.</span> <span id="s329">These people wouldn’t have been here without her, but how she described the camp, I don’t quite agree with.</span> <span id="s330">I saw more conflict than she did.</span> <span id="s331">But ac -- but we are still good friends, I still see her, and Oswego people have also [indecipherable] word?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Community?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Community.</span> <span id="s334">They meet once in awhile, cause we all are old people now.</span> <span id="s335">And some of them died, some of them have grandchildren.</span> <span id="s336">The grandchildren I met in my last job, and some of them, because in that job, among other things, I ran a scholarship committee for refugee, and second and third generation.</span> <span id="s337">And suddenly, some of my Oswego grandchildren turned up.</span> <span id="s338">[indecipherable], they are very bright, and good students.</span> <span id="s339">Europeans know how to study.</span> <span id="s340">So, you see, that’s why I say my life is so interwoven, one with each other, Quakers from all occasional [indecipherable] etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Can we go back momentarily to your very first experiences, helping refugees, and that’s when you were working with the Quakers.</span> <span id="s342">And could you give a little more detail as to how you started to get involved in that kind of work?</span> <span id="s343">Was it through the friend in Philadelphia, or someone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I tell you, my girlfriend, whom I knew from school, was a Quaker, and was a daughter of the deeding Quaker in Germany.</span> <span id="s345">Somebody writes a book about it, and interviewed me.</span> <span id="s346">So, through her, it was natural that I met other Quakers.</span> <span id="s347">And I met a professor of social work, Hetta Calls, from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s348">She was a professor of social work in Bryn Mawr, and for quite some time I stayed in her house, and she was a president at that time, or the founder of this refugee section, and she knew that I knew typing, a little shorthand.</span> <span id="s349">And she introduced me as her secretary to the American Friend Service Committee in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s350">And I was very lucky, I got to know Rufus Jones, and Kelly, and learned to loved, and admired a lot.</span> <span id="s351">And met my first -- I was a refugee of -- myself at that time, really in the camp.</span> <span id="s352">What I had to do as a secretary was really mostly writing letters, trying to search for people, trying to get affidavits, trying to talk to lawyers.</span> <span id="s353">A little bit helping people to adjust.</span> <span id="s354">Helping them to get lessons for car driving.</span> <span id="s355">Women didn’t really know how to drive.</span> <span id="s356">I don’t know how to -- not today.</span> <span id="s357">And it was not that common in Germany, or Austria.</span> <span id="s358">The refugees at that time are mostly from Germany -- not in the camp Oswego, but what I imagine Philadelphia was pretty much German Jewish [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Where was the camp that was run by the Quakers, the two summers?</span> <span id="s360">Where exactly was that located?</span> <span id="s361">A: In Nyak, N-y-a-k, New York.</span> <span id="s362">It’s how -- it’s about an hour from here, upstate, in Westchester.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s364">So, after that experience, the experience with the camps, the two summers in a row, then eventually, you were able to work in Oswego with refugees, and that work there, what was your daily responsibilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Taking histories, in case people could stay in this country.</span> <span id="s366">Taking histories for the sponsoring agency.</span> <span id="s367">Helping people to adjust to camp life.</span> <span id="s368">No European knows camp.</span> <span id="s369">And that men should do the cooking, don’t tell me.</span> <span id="s370">And to see that the hospital functioned.</span> <span id="s371">We were just -- every religion had a -- a -- [indecipherable] what’s the word?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Every religion had a place of worship of some kind, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: No, it had a person from every religion was a social worker.</span> <span id="s374">[indecipherable] one wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Some representative?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yes, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s377">And also a -- a Jewish agency.</span> <span id="s378">I was really quick repre-representative there.</span> <span id="s379">The Jewish agency admaroon became my best friend, she just died.</span> <span id="s380">And the Catholic had one, too.</span> <span id="s381">And there were lots and lots of adjustment question.</span> <span id="s382">People had left their homes, didn’t know where the other person was, the family was torn.</span> <span id="s383">A -- and as I say, we had to take very complete histories for the government, no personal really, but there you had to know the facts, and the facts were not too well known.</span> <span id="s384">And -- and they had had the camp experience in Italy, and some had illnesses, and some had venereal illnesses, and we suddenly had the last [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s385">You had to ha -- make the things work, you know?</span> <span id="s386">The idea, to be behind wired bar -- barbed wire, we had -- we had to be in this free country, in a camp.</span> <span id="s387">So it was really psychiatric social work, and immigration work.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: How many --</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: How many other people were working in that camp, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Hard to say.</span> <span id="s392">We had about -- we had a director, and a deputy director, American.</span> <span id="s393">We had about four social worker.</span> <span id="s394">We had a head nurse, and I think some other nurses.</span> <span id="s395">We had teachers, we had -- no -- no teachers there, the children could go out of camp to school.</span> <span id="s396">It was a fight, but we got to school.</span> <span id="s397">We were always fighting.</span> <span id="s398">I think that’s about what was there, and then all sorts of people came from other agencies to study these strange animals from Europe.</span> <span id="s399">But the biggest group was Polish, and the second group was Yugoslav, and they couldn’t stand each other.</span> <span id="s400">And we also had a non-Jewish prince from Lithuania, who got into fis -- a fist fight with somebody else, because they both thought they were princes.</span> <span id="s401">I mean, anything and everything possible.</span> <span id="s402">We did have a library, we did have lectures, we did have good concerts, there were good musicians among the group.</span> <span id="s403">It was daily living.</span> <span id="s404">Was a lot of anxiety.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: There are about a thousand --</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: -- refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: And mostly Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: And from which countries, primarily?</span> <span id="s412">You said --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yugoslavia, Poland, Austria, Germany.</span> <span id="s414">But were far the most from Yugoslavia, and Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: And what was the age range of the refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Newly born, to about 90.</span> <span id="s417">We had children being born there.</span> <span id="s418">So we had kindergarten also.</span> <span id="s419">The age range was really everything that had been in camp in Italy, and they had it all ages, like.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: And there were elderly people, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: At that time, over 50 seemed elderly to me.</span> <span id="s422">I can’t remember real old people, my age, for instance, my age now.</span> <span id="s423">I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s424">I remember mostly i -- in their 20’s, and then in their 50’s, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: What were your own living conditions like in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: I had a room, we all had rooms.</span> <span id="s427">Not in the barrack, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s428">I cannot remember where we ate, I think it was in a mutual dining room where all the staff ate.</span> <span id="s429">I lately think it was all in a private house, where the officers had lived, when it was a military camp.</span> <span id="s430">But, I remember well my little room, but funny, you know how [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Did you do much socializing with the other refugees, or the individuals you were working with?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Both.</span> <span id="s433">I made good friends among my colleagues, still went on -- until now, I mean, we are now older, have died ,or God knows what.</span> <span id="s434">And about the refugees, I also made friends.</span> <span id="s435">And that was quite acceptable, not in all camps I’ve worked in, but this was quite acceptable.</span> <span id="s436">I had a young man interested in me in that time, and so had my colleague.</span> <span id="s437">It was all very romantic, and we got to know them very well, and some of them, on later stages, became my clients.</span> <span id="s438">One -- for instance, my agency, when I say my agency, I mean Self Help.</span> <span id="s439">I worked 39 years, so it sort of became mine, build a house here in Cos-Cosina Boulevard for displaced persons, and -- a big apartment house.</span> <span id="s440">And one of the first people to move in was a client from -- of mine, from Oswego.</span> <span id="s441">So ways always cross again.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: How long were you in Oswego?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Pretty much from beginning to end, just in a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: What were the dates, approximately?</span> <span id="s445">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Yeah, from ’44, to ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Were you paid to do that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s449">Wallit -- well, the government paid me.</span> <span id="s450">No idea what, but they did pay me.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: And had you received any very specific, specialized training for working with refugees by that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Just my heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: What would you say you were able to learn about the war, or other events taking place in Europe, from the refugees, that you had not learned elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: I did not know that there were camps in Italy.</span> <span id="s455">I did not know the war conditions.</span> <span id="s456">Yugoslavia had an awful secret pol -- police, Usetasha.</span> <span id="s457">I had not known of that existence, and the madness, and the badness of the war was really beginning to come home to me, when I heard these people who had escaped by night over the mountains.</span> <span id="s458">Who had sent children to other countries.</span> <span id="s459">The living with danger, the constant being afraid some knock at the door will be the secret police, and you’ll be taken away.</span> <span id="s460">It became all a reality.</span> <span id="s461">And, of course, I was there when Roosevelt died, and that had a terrific effect on the camp population.</span> <span id="s462">They were really depressed.</span> <span id="s463">It’s something that is now a -- people don’t want to acknowledge, American Jewish people, that Roosevelt made many mistakes.</span> <span id="s464">But he also was a big hope for people.</span> <span id="s465">And, of course the ones who came to America loved him for that in -- invitation, and they were devastated when he died.</span> <span id="s466">They couldn’t know that Truman did much more perhaps, in the end, but it was really a -- a major depression.</span> <span id="s467">I always felt that all the deaths they had seen in Europe were suddenly coming to life again by the death of Roosevelt, who had sort of been a power figure to them.</span> <span id="s468">So all that made the whole time much more real to me.</span> <span id="s469">I -- also, I didn’t have as much of a private life.</span> <span id="s470">In Philadelphia things were going on, but here you read the papers much more, and people had a country, but they had lost their parents.</span> <span id="s471">You saw, actually the people.</span> <span id="s472">[indecipherable] had been in the hospital, the doctor had refused to take care of them.</span> <span id="s473">And for the first time you really heard it, from word -- by mouth.</span> <span id="s474">So yes, it -- I always said this was my oderver to camp life.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Did Roosevelt’s death also represent great uncertainty?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s477">It did represent great uncertainty.</span> <span id="s478">There was uncertainty anyhow, about who would come next, and how would he handle it?</span> <span id="s479">It just brought home the nothinglessness, of the refugees.</span> <span id="s480">No country, nowhere really to go, no profession, they couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s481">Just emptiness, all gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Were there cultural or religious activities in the camp?</span> <span id="s483">I believe you already mentioned concerts, so there were some cultural activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s485">There were -- you had to be very careful what you did, because there were these great political differences.</span> <span id="s486">And you very easy got into a fistfight or something of that sort.</span> <span id="s487">So we tried -- we tried to have lectures, but not about politics, if possible.</span> <span id="s488">Oh yes, we had the other thing.</span> <span id="s489">As we were supposedly strange animals, yeah, they sent us a psychiatrist from Chicago, who was supposed to help people.</span> <span id="s490">I think he may have been of European origin.</span> <span id="s491">He certainly didn’t know how to handle people in camp.</span> <span id="s492">And he asked questions you ask in your private office, but they are do -- not applying to camp life.</span> <span id="s493">But the administration was very proud, we had a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s494">We were glad when he left, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Dreyfuss.</span> <span id="s497">I think that’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Did you have much success in helping individuals find family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: We didn’t do too much of that in that camp.</span> <span id="s500">There was another outfit what worked out of England, a location service, which matched thousands of families, but we didn’t do it, we didn’t know how to do it there.</span> <span id="s501">And we really were extremely busy with keeping things under control.</span> <span id="s502">People went on hunger strike, it -- all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s503">They fought with each other.</span> <span id="s504">As I say, somebody died shoveling snow, and family thought the administration should never have allowed him to shovel snow.</span> <span id="s505">And that’s the only one I remember, there may be other ones.</span> <span id="s506">And had organize that people were visitor in the hospital.</span> <span id="s507">They were always so busy, the men were not so busy, the men had a difficult time to take women’s jobs, like cleaning the barrack rooms they had.</span> <span id="s508">We had single men, and they had to take care of their shabby, little apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: How would you characterize the political tensions that you referred to earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: They were old border tensions, between the Yugoslav and the Austrians.</span> <span id="s511">And then there are always fights between the Poles, and the Germans, I mean [indecipherable] traditionally have a little fight.</span> <span id="s512">It was not really politics as such, it was just old enemy.</span> <span id="s513">It was excited people who would use every little incident to get excited about.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Were people housed together with other individuals of the same nationality, or was it a mixed housing situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: I can’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s516">I think they were [indecipherable] but I am not sure.</span> <span id="s517">I think there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: And you were mentioning earlier about men having to take on roles that traditionally were carried out by women.</span> <span id="s519">Were men and women essentially doing the same type of work in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yeah, I think the men helped in the kitchen, but so did the women, but I know we couldn’t get the men to work in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add about your time in Oswego, before we move on?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: No, not really, no.</span> <span id="s523">I forgot to say that during my time in Maryland, I became a citizen.</span> <span id="s524">That’s important because I wanted too much to be a citizen, to eventually go to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: What was the process like in becoming a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: You know, it’s all 60 years ago.</span> <span id="s527">I had to bring a witness.</span> <span id="s528">I was the only one to be naturalized, and funny enough, in the small town of Westminster, Maryland, they hadn’t naturalized anybody, as far as I know.</span> <span id="s529">Anyhow, I hold number one certificate.</span> <span id="s530">And of course, I was afraid, I should know some American history, and I know I got questions, what makes a suggestion a bill, when it had to become a bill, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff, conducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27, 2000, in Forest Hills, New York.</span> <span id="s533">This is tape number two, side A. On the last tape, we were speaking about your time in Oswego, and -- where you were working with refugees, and now perhaps you can tell me what you did after you finished your time in Oswego.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: When I came back from Oswego, I had moved from Philadelphia to New York, and I was waiting for papers to clear, to go eventually to Europe.</span> <span id="s535">I went back to a job I had had before, and that’s the juvenile court.</span> <span id="s536">I was always interested in working with delinquent youngsters -- so-called delinquent.</span> <span id="s537">And I worked for what’s called Youth House for boys, and later for Youth House for girls.</span> <span id="s538">Again, as a psychiatric social worker, taking histories this time for the judge to have -- make decisions what to do with a youngster, send him home, go to placement, or whatever was indicated.</span> <span id="s539">I had done that early in the game, I forgot which year.</span> <span id="s540">I did it again when I came back from Oswego, and that was by the middle of ’45.</span> <span id="s541">And I did it until the end of ’46, when I went, with the Joint Distribution Committee, to Europe.</span> <span id="s542">I had been in touch with the Joint a long time before.</span> <span id="s543">Actually, I’d known about it all my life, cause my family was very instrumental in it’s creation.</span> <span id="s544">And the Joint was one of the agencies working in Europe after the war.</span> <span id="s545">The other was UNRRA.</span> <span id="s546">Those were the two main agencies.</span> <span id="s547">Of course, every religion had it’s representation.</span> <span id="s548">The Joint, and the U.S. Army, and the UNRRA was p-part of it, were really the most constructive factors in rebuilding.</span> <span id="s549">I am very aware that they are under a lot of criticism, but having been on the spot, I can say that they performed a miracle.</span> <span id="s550">Europe at that time was chaos, people not knowing where they came from, not knowing where they were going, practically not knowing who they are.</span> <span id="s551">The Joint and UNRRA [indecipherable] really established camps, with the help of the army, for various groups, eventually for all people.</span> <span id="s552">There have been so many camps, and they were different in the different zones.</span> <span id="s553">You had the British zone, and you had the American zone.</span> <span id="s554">I can’t remember if they had a Russian zone, but they had three zones.</span> <span id="s555">And em -- each zone had it’s country director, and then there was a director for all the work, in Paris.</span> <span id="s556">He was in charge of it all.</span> <span id="s557">I know that when I came over, I was first going to Paris, to be oriented toward what was expected to me -- of me, and to be assigned to a country.</span> <span id="s558">I did not know when I left here where I would go.</span> <span id="s559">I assumed it would be Germany or Austria because of the language.</span> <span id="s560">To my great surprise it was Italy.</span> <span id="s561">And my much bigger surprise came, I went to Rome, because the capital always was the center where the Joint worked out of, and I spent a few weeks in a sort of reception camp called Genechita, City of the Movies.</span> <span id="s562">It was the Hollywood of Italy.</span> <span id="s563">And that was a camp for every refugees that had been picked up.</span> <span id="s564">Every nation, and wi -- religion.</span> <span id="s565">Men, women, children.</span> <span id="s566">I don’t know how many.</span> <span id="s567">To me it seemed thousands, it may not have been.</span> <span id="s568">And that camp, I remember as a nightmare.</span> <span id="s569">If you ask me who administered it, I do not know any more.</span> <span id="s570">I know it had no individual rooms.</span> <span id="s571">There were partitions between the families, sort of made of sheets -- bedsheets, where you could hear every noise from the neighboring bed, which means your private life was open to the children, open to each other.</span> <span id="s572">It may be part because it was my first real camp, but I was absolutely overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s573">The second day I was there, there was a rumor that a Chinese had killed his wife.</span> <span id="s574">If that was so or not, I have no idea, but everybody talked about it.</span> <span id="s575">That was, in my memory, the most primitive camp, but as I say, I had just arrived, I had no basis of comparison.</span> <span id="s576">In a way it was good, because every other camp seemed like -- not paradise, but at least not like hell.</span> <span id="s577">And I must say, I don’t remember anything of the beauty of Rome, which I had not seen before.</span> <span id="s578">I only remember this miles of humanity, badly dressed, hungry, cold -- it was winter, I came so -- in February, I think.</span> <span id="s579">And -- and then I was told I was to go to Milano, because I had experience with hospital work, and [indecipherable] work.</span> <span id="s580">And I got on long train ride.</span> <span id="s581">It still was right after the war, and people always forget, your trains weren’t running.</span> <span id="s582">Italy itself had no food.</span> <span id="s583">The people were under the impression still of the war.</span> <span id="s584">Yes, they had won the war, oh, Italy didn’t here -- take it back, I’m not sure Italy won.</span> <span id="s585">But they were -- everything was gray and gray.</span> <span id="s586">And it took us very, very long to get from Rome to Milano, which usually takes a night.</span> <span id="s587">Sleeping [indecipherable] didn’t work, it was -- Italy was just a country in which a war had raged.</span> <span id="s588">And one shouldn’t forget, it wasn’t only all Displaced Persons, it was all the Italians themselves.</span> <span id="s589">You were hungry, and tired, and had no work.</span> <span id="s590">When I arrived in Milano, this rehabilitation center, being a former hotel, looked like absolute luxury.</span> <span id="s591">I did not stay in the place.</span> <span id="s592">I think that had had reasons, because it was tuberculosis all over the place.</span> <span id="s593">We had, as far as I remember, no children.</span> <span id="s594">Some younger people.</span> <span id="s595">I remember a young woman, perhaps in her early 20’s, from Yugoslavia, who had survived with her parents, and they had gone through hell, and she had ch -- tuberculosis, and died, very much at the beginning of -- and I never forget it, I can still paint her face.</span> <span id="s596">And that -- it’s really difficult to talk about, because it’s a double experience.</span> <span id="s597">Here you had survivors faced with death again.</span> <span id="s598">Now, what that meant to them, I can’t imagine, I can only feel a little bit in my fingertips.</span> <span id="s599">And still you had the same political groups fighting each other, that was the Hungarians and the Poles.</span> <span id="s600">All Jewish people, but different ideas, different religious traditions.</span> <span id="s601">Being angry at the world.</span> <span id="s602">This is [indecipherable] people.</span> <span id="s603">I remember three of young men who were not even 20 -- I mention that because you, at that age, could survive, and then in the 30’s and 40’s.</span> <span id="s604">You hadn’t many old people survive, and you hadn’t many children survive.</span> <span id="s605">Not in these camps.</span> <span id="s606">We had a doctor from South Africa, who was the M.D. director of the camp, and we had Displaced Persons physicians.</span> <span id="s607">We had about three physicians.</span> <span id="s608">Now, either ask me how many patients, I really don’t know, about a hundred, could be mistaken.</span> <span id="s609">Too long ago to ve -- to remember figures.</span> <span id="s610">And, what perhaps has to be mentioned is that was the time where streptomycin was a rarity.</span> <span id="s611">The doctors practically only had lermotorax to work with, which was a much more complicated procedure, nobody [indecipherable] it could be dangerous.</span> <span id="s612">Also, for the TB doctors, they had to stand very long.</span> <span id="s613">This is procedure, and I know once or twice somebody fainted.</span> <span id="s614">And streptomycin, we always had to get on the Black Market.</span> <span id="s615">Now, this was the center of the Black Market.</span> <span id="s616">You exchanged streptomycin for either coffee or cigarettes.</span> <span id="s617">And the accepted -- accepted currency were cigarettes.</span> <span id="s618">And -- and the other thing was, there was something -- the army run co -- called the PX, which was like a shopping center, with a very low prices.</span> <span id="s619">And we had, as American, or an English workers, we could buy there, and we could exchange.</span> <span id="s620">There are also two currencies.</span> <span id="s621">There was green dollar, and oh, what was the other called?</span> <span id="s622">A script.</span> <span id="s623">A script, as far as I remember, you couldn't take out of the country, I don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s624">The green dollar was much better, and you could get anything for a green dollar, from two dollars to [indecipherable] dollars, there was no rule or regulation.</span> <span id="s625">And there was a fight to get food, because the Germans had no food themselves.</span> <span id="s626">And all these things are of course, forgotten.</span> <span id="s627">Now, one of these stories -- oh, I don’t know how many, have been in articles I have written over the years.</span> <span id="s628">They are not very new.</span> <span id="s629">I’ve told them before.</span> <span id="s630">But one can’t duplicate them, I can’t invent new ones.</span> <span id="s631">And one which shows you the difficulty with food.</span> <span id="s632">Jewish holidays, of course, played a very, very big role.</span> <span id="s633">And these were the first holidays in freedom.</span> <span id="s634">So, my people in the -- I call it camp, it’s really abcenter, wanted to be like home, and have geese and chickens for Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s635">Now how to put loose geese and chickens, when all I had was the canned goods the Joint hand me?</span> <span id="s636">Now, many, many of my people weren’t even used to that.</span> <span id="s637">So, the only thing to do was to ask if any of the DP’s would be able to look after live chicken and geese, and there was somebody.</span> <span id="s638">So then I went to the mayor of this little village, and asked if I could have some, I would bargain against canned peas, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s639">Well, they let me have some.</span> <span id="s640">So, in our DP Center, we had guk, guk, guk, guk.</span> <span id="s641">And they were a big excitement, we had them for a few months.</span> <span id="s642">We had to feed them, they were like everybody else, starving.</span> <span id="s643">And the whole group, of course, was very much interested.</span> <span id="s644">And Rosh Hashanah came.</span> <span id="s645">We had a cook who was German and not Jewish, so he cooked the beasts, and when he was cooking them, to get the feathers out, he used boiling water, and when he did that -- you know what a mushkia is?</span> <span id="s646">The Jewish [indecipherable] overseers, which we would have foster, came in, and he looked at it and said, “Trayfa, no good, no good.</span> <span id="s647">You can’t eat them.</span> <span id="s648">Now tell your community what happened.”</span> <span id="s649">I said, “We m -- have to find a way out.</span> <span id="s650">This means life to them.”</span> <span id="s651">Well, I had an Orthodox part, a community, they all wanted to go right to America, and the un-Orthodox want to go what was then Palestine.</span> <span id="s652">Now, the un-Orthodox said, “We can eat -- eat it.”</span> <span id="s653">The Orthodox says, “Trayfa, trayfa, it can’t be done.”</span> <span id="s654">Then the Orthodox committee came to me and said, “You know, you have to ask a miracle rabbi.”</span> <span id="s655">A-Again this gentleman assimilated [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s656">Well, eventually, I found a miracle rabbi in a camp in Austria.</span> <span id="s657">Now, try to phone, in occupied Germany after the war from one country to another.</span> <span id="s658">I had to call General Clay’s office, who was the commander of all of the German zones, and I got some soldier who thought I was utterly nuts.</span> <span id="s659">“What do you want, chicken?</span> <span id="s660">Buy some chicken.”</span> <span id="s661">“Excuse me, I have to,” -- “All right, you get clearance.”</span> <span id="s662">I get clearance, I call for the wonder rabbi, and I get him.</span> <span id="s663">And he says, “First of all, are you a Jewish daughter?</span> <span id="s664">Well, this is a very difficult question, I have to think about it.</span> <span id="s665">Would you call back in two hour?”</span> <span id="s666">I said, “But the things have to be cooked.</span> <span id="s667">I have no time to waste, I have excited people.”</span> <span id="s668">Call back.</span> <span id="s669">So I go through the whole thing again, get the same soldier to Clay’s office, who just -- who just shakes his head, I am sure, but gives me clearance.</span> <span id="s670">And then I get the answer, it’s a little difficult to translate from the German Jewish.</span> <span id="s671">“If the geese and the chickens were boiled in water that was higher than the boiling mark, then they are trayfa, but if that was lower, if was water right out of the faucet, then they can be eaten.”</span> <span id="s672">So I was on very good terms with a young DP camp director, who had had a baby.</span> <span id="s673">I said to him, “Please, you bathed your baby this morning in hot water from the faucet?”</span> <span id="s674">He knew exactly what I was doing, said, “Yes, Miss Tarenberg, I did.”</span> <span id="s675">I went back, called my two committees together, and said, “That’s the answer from the [indecipherable] rabbi, we can’t go any higher, and we are going to eat the animals.”</span> <span id="s676">And we did.</span> <span id="s677">But these stories, once in a lifetime.</span> <span id="s678">Bad food is in all institutions, one of the main cause for trouble, because people don’t have so many things to fight about, and they let out all their hostility, their fear, their anxiety, on food.</span> <span id="s679">And I have had so many debates about food, you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s680">In the three centers I worked in.</span> <span id="s681">So that was part of it, but the emotional atmosphere on these holidays, with the families, some were all over the place, if they were alive, was really unforgettable.</span> <span id="s682">On a more cheerful note, we had our first wedding in camp.</span> <span id="s683">And that again is a story, how overly sensitive people are under those conditions.</span> <span id="s684">This young couple wanted to go Aliyah beth -- you know what it is?</span> <span id="s685">To Palestine.</span> <span id="s686">And when they married -- at that time, of course, we had to create a wedding dress.</span> <span id="s687">Well, the Joint had sent us lots and lots of material for cottons, and out of the cotton material, we made dr-dresses for the whole group.</span> <span id="s688">And in a actual over-identification, I made myself a dress, too.</span> <span id="s689">We must have looked like a flower garden.</span> <span id="s690">Anyhow, when they married, I wanted to give them a wedding present.</span> <span id="s691">You don’t have very much to give, and anyhow, money seemed to be the most important.</span> <span id="s692">Well, I took some lira and put them in an envelope, which was from my office, it was a little torn, and the young lady first said -- didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s693">And much later came to me and said, “I didn’t thank you, because I was annoyed, because you didn’t take care enough to put that money in a nice envelope, and write something nice on it.</span> <span id="s694">We are taking that money, not for our personal gratification, but we’ll give it to Aliyah beth.”</span> <span id="s695">I said, “You’re welcome, if that gives you satisfaction.</span> <span id="s696">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s697">I surely didn’t want to hurt you.”</span> <span id="s698">But that’s typical for the over-sensitivity.</span> <span id="s699">That was a Greek girl from Saronica.</span> <span id="s700">And I found them a particularly sensitive group.</span> <span id="s701">I don’t know as much as [indecipherable] that I know about the other European countries.</span> <span id="s702">But they are a very sensitive group to work with.</span> <span id="s703">We had quite a few.</span> <span id="s704">We also had a supposedly Sephardic Jews -- Jew, from Greece somewhere, who turned out not to be Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s705">He was a Turk, and when a -- when he got angry, took a saber out -- I was talking -- and run around with a saber, but he ran away, end of story.</span> <span id="s706">As I say, the interesting thing is that all that I remember so well, probably because I felt guilty that I couldn’t do more to help them, that they all have forgotten the bad part, and of course, compared to the concentration camp, this at least meant some security, but that they didn’t know to which country they would go.</span> <span id="s707">I remember one woman who had a utterby breakdown, with good reason.</span> <span id="s708">She had waited and waited for her husband, eventually located him in Poland, but he was married to another woman, he had thought she was dead.</span> <span id="s709">And -- help.</span> <span id="s710">And then, a young lady who really -- later in this country, when I met her, by chance in the street, became a friend of mine, had marched all the way from Romania, that was days and nights.</span> <span id="s711">And she was young, she was almost a year -- a year -- was about 17 or 18, and almost all her family had been killed, but one brother who had gone to Palestine.</span> <span id="s712">And she tried violently to make an adjustment once she’ll come to America.</span> <span id="s713">Had bad case of TB.</span> <span id="s714">They all had TB, but this was one of the worst.</span> <span id="s715">And I looked after her, I s -- sat up at night with her, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s716">You do what you think has to be done.</span> <span id="s717">It’s not always social work, what’s [indecipherable] happen.</span> <span id="s718">And one day we got a cable from Palestine that her brother had died in the war against England.</span> <span id="s719">Now I had the nice job to tell.</span> <span id="s720">And of course, she practically lost her mind, and so for quite a few nights I stayed with her in her room, and played, as well as I could, mother figure, but -- and she never got over, not even today, is happily married, but she had to tell all her past.</span> <span id="s721">Many didn’t talk about their past, but she felt she want to describe the halls, and there were many children.</span> <span id="s722">It was a very religious home.</span> <span id="s723">And so every day, we set aside a certain hour for telling.</span> <span id="s724">And then I left, and I didn’t hear about her.</span> <span id="s725">I thought of her sometimes.</span> <span id="s726">I had a picture, with a very nice dedication.</span> <span id="s727">And really, 40 years went by, and I -- I’m here in Forest Hills in a street, in front of a store, looking at some hats.</span> <span id="s728">And a very tiny voice behind me said, “Aren’t you Miss Tarenberg?”</span> <span id="s729">That was Celie, that’s her name, Celia.</span> <span id="s730">And she had come to this country, had gotten TB again, was in a TB sanitarium.</span> <span id="s731">Had married, happily.</span> <span id="s732">Her husband died.</span> <span id="s733">Had married again, living quite near here.</span> <span id="s734">Has two wonderful children, and is a very good business woman, which I’d never thought.</span> <span id="s735">Had [indecipherable] in business.</span> <span id="s736">We see each other once in awhile.</span> <span id="s737">It’s gone -- I never [indecipherable] something, I cannot identify this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s738">You find that in DP camps, people became either very, almost fanatically religious, or said a God who lets concentration camps happen.</span> <span id="s739">It’s very difficult to say something to either.</span> <span id="s740">But I found that over and over again.</span> <span id="s741">And it’s interesting that the stories I got at that time, went riva -- really well, just about liberated from camps, were quite different than what you get today.</span> <span id="s742">I remember, I think out of my personal sy-system, I remember so well a young man who was very close to his father, they were very religious, and he had seen his father jump into the fire with a Torah in his arm.</span> <span id="s743">You don’t hear that any more.</span> <span id="s744">But I must say, I almost cracked up on that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: How were you able to communicate with people from so many different countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: With my broken Yiddish, and German, and to other member, we talk English.</span> <span id="s747">English was taught in the school in Germany, and so when you had people from Germany, who went to a high school, you sometimes could.</span> <span id="s748">I do not remember communications difficulties.</span> <span id="s749">In what we said, yes, but not language-wise.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Did you start learning other languages yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: No.</span> <span id="s752">I can make myself understood in -- in -- in Italian, or in Dutch.</span> <span id="s753">In Europe you pick up languages from traveling, but I don’t speak that.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: So I just want to establish the setting of this experience, not necessarily at camp, but more like a rehabilitation center, as you call it.</span> <span id="s755">Was it wintertime?</span> <span id="s756">And exactly when did you arrive there, or as best as you can recall, month and year?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: I think in the mer -- no, that I can -- I think in Merrano, I arrived in the spring of ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: You talked about the individuals there having tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s759">Did you see many deaths?</span> <span id="s760">Were many of them very ill?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: I -- in Merrano, I saw quite a few.</span> <span id="s762">They are -- were all ready for rehabilitation, so you didn’t see too many -- they were not -- it’s not true, they were not already for rehab.</span> <span id="s763">We see -- so I saw several deaths in -- in Merrano.</span> <span id="s764">I cannot remember in Passau.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Now, were you paid for doing this kind of work, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s767">I was paid by the Joint Distribution Committee, and I was paid, actually in America, because of all the difficulties.</span> <span id="s768">We got a certain amount of script, I believe, in the country where we worked.</span> <span id="s769">But we came back to America, and found quite a bit of money after three years.</span> <span id="s770">We weren’t rich, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Did you sign up for a certain time period to work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Not on a certain place, a contract was usually for 18 months, but you could break it any time, if you had to, and people did.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Did you have any other friends, or acquaintances in the United States, going to do this same kind of work in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: I had two friends who did -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: This is tape number two, side B, of an interview with Gabriele D. Schiff.</span> <span id="s776">On the other side, we were talking about people you knew, who also went to do relief work, and work with refugees in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yeah, I know these two, and I met other people in Europe with whom I still am friends, colleagues of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: What was the journey like to get to Europe?</span> <span id="s779">Any specific recollections of that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: No.</span> <span id="s781">I don’t even remember if I came -- probably by boat, I don’t remember anythi -- yes, yeah, I came by boat, but I really don’t remember anything whatsoever about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: I think you already made some kind of reference to the kinds of discussions that you had with refugees, and whether or not they wanted to talk about their past.</span> <span id="s783">Did they more often want to talk about the war time experiences in comparison to their past before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: That is difficult to say, because is a highly individual -- some people had a great need to talk about their homes, and to show that they had little a farm, or a good business, or -- and I think people react in accordance with their personality.</span> <span id="s785">You can’t really make generalizations.</span> <span id="s786">Some people had a great need to show how clever they had been in surviving, while today we recognize that survivor, was luck.</span> <span id="s787">There are some things that have been shown, which made survivor, for instance, in a camp, somewhat more likely, if you had a close relative somewhere who needed you.</span> <span id="s788">If you had a reason to survive.</span> <span id="s789">There are such things that one can perhaps a little, generalize.</span> <span id="s790">Some people who had a somewhat guilty conscience, had to justify the way.</span> <span id="s791">There was much more things that had to be hidden at that time.</span> <span id="s792">I remember one man was so upset because he had stolen potatoes.</span> <span id="s793">And well, there were much more serious crimes that had been done.</span> <span id="s794">And yes, after the people trusted you, you would have the conflict that you could have saved somebody, but you ran, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s795">I always have difficulty with some of the things, because you cannot document them, you have to trust my memory, and some of these stories, I don’t even mention, because I have no way of showing they really happened.</span> <span id="s796">I know it, but that’s my quarrel I have very often, with people I discuss this whole -- memories are memories, but they are not documentation.</span> <span id="s797">They change.</span> <span id="s798">Human mind is stra -- is really doing strange things.</span> <span id="s799">And people who’ve changed their story don’t even know that they have changed it.</span> <span id="s800">I’ve had people tell me another person’s story, and thought it was theirs.</span> <span id="s801">So, what I always say, but that’s now a personal opinion.</span> <span id="s802">Your facts are the skele -- skeleton, and the stories [indecipherable] are really the flesh you put on the skeleton.</span> <span id="s803">Cause it’s amazing what happens.</span> <span id="s804">And then there are, of course, people who do it with a purpose.</span> <span id="s805">One experience is that when we were very eager to get people to America, and they were -- the doctors felt they were really ready to go, but their x-rays didn’t show it, we thought of [indecipherable] that the right x-rays were taken.</span> <span id="s806">And the same people, when it came to restitution in this country, wanted me to testify that they had tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s807">That’s very difficult to decide what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Were there any instances where you knew that it was wrong to do something, but you knew that it -- in the end it would help someone, so you did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: I think I’m not going to answer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Do you feel that your own memories have changed much over these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: It has changed by getting old.</span> <span id="s812">I ha -- the facts are not changed, but many things I could remember even two years ago, as you see me groping for words sometimes, that’s the process of aging.</span> <span id="s813">I don’t think that the facts of any of the things I say, aren’t true.</span> <span id="s814">I can’t guarantee, but I don’t think it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: In the conversations you had with refugees, did they talk much about their goals for the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: If they had them, yes, but in the early days I’m thinking of right now, they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s817">They didn’t know what country, and what would be expected there.</span> <span id="s818">And then we had the alt, which is a trade school there, and they learned some trades, which they really couldn’t use in the country they were going to.</span> <span id="s819">A shoemaker.</span> <span id="s820">Now we got many from Russia, but I mean, it’s not a very desirable trade here.</span> <span id="s821">Bookbinding.</span> <span id="s822">Now, you would teach computer.</span> <span id="s823">But that wa -- was a good idea, to get people who had never experienced the working process, having to be up at a certain hour, having a lunchtime, etcetera.</span> <span id="s824">But these school -- trade school, they had at least an idea how a normal person works.</span> <span id="s825">It was a good idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Did any of the refugees with whom you had contact, speak of any desire to take out revenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s828">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s829">They still do, today.</span> <span id="s830">And when they hear something -- I heard somebody say when all this business happened with the French Concorde, it should happen to German.</span> <span id="s831">I said, “It did happen to German, and shouldn’t happen to anybody.”</span> <span id="s832">I mean, there you can see the raw feeling, yes.</span> <span id="s833">And then, the question, will they ever go back for a visit to Germany, and Poland, and so on.</span> <span id="s834">And there’s some who do, and some who don’t.</span> <span id="s835">I am surprised that so many non-German Jews settled in Germany.</span> <span id="s836">I never quite understand that.</span> <span id="s837">It happened, I saw it myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Have you returned to your hometown in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s840">I -- I wanted to g -- to see the graves of my parents, because I’m one of the few who knows where her parents are buried, and I thought [indecipherable] me, and I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: When were you there, and how was the experience, visiting Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: I have been there for two days or three days before, wanting to show my husband, who was from Poland, my hometown.</span> <span id="s843">I tell you, a experience -- I always have up -- a city in which I don’t know a single name in the phone book, is not my hometown.</span> <span id="s844">I’ve heard it’s a beautiful city, and they were very surprised the taxi drivers, that I speak German without an accent.</span> <span id="s845">I could relate to the young people, who really had nothing to do with all this.</span> <span id="s846">But when I saw somebody over 55, or so, I curled up.</span> <span id="s847">I didn’t know what you did during the war.</span> <span id="s848">I looked at our old house.</span> <span id="s849">It was a funny feeling.</span> <span id="s850">But something nice.</span> <span id="s851">When I was born, my father planted a pine tree in our garden, and by God, it survived.</span> <span id="s852">It was nice.</span> <span id="s853">I always said I am a survivor, so -- and people have gone back in g -- much greater numbers to Poland.</span> <span id="s854">They hate Poland much more than I hate Germany.</span> <span id="s855">I mean, [indecipherable] is in my own ca -- but I’m not a person who hates.</span> <span id="s856">That my Polish friends -- not my husband, he never hated Germany.</span> <span id="s857">You find in there, some of my husband’s stories, which you will find interesting.</span> <span id="s858">It -- certainly you had people who never stopped talking about what they did to escape, or to get out.</span> <span id="s859">And it was good for the ego, I think, it -- then, in this country, nobody wanted to hear about these stories.</span> <span id="s860">And now, it has become very fashionable.</span> <span id="s861">If I have to read another book about the Holocaust, I jump.</span> <span id="s862">And they get farther and farther away from the truth.</span> <span id="s863">I mean, that’s natural.</span> <span id="s864">Life marches on, we hope.</span> <span id="s865">Anything else I should te-tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: When was your visit to Germany, the one you were just referring to with your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: 1953. ’</span> <span id="s868">54.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: And just to go back momentarily, to the conversations you had with refugees in Italy, and any talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: -- of revenge.</span> <span id="s872">What, at that time, was any of the specifics of -- of revenge that -- that people would have liked to have taken if they could have?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: You know, they really didn’t have the strength to do more than throw a -- a few words around, all the Germans should be killed.</span> <span id="s874">These strong words.</span> <span id="s875">Yes, they should be taken off this earth, I’ve heard that.</span> <span id="s876">I never heard other children should be killed.</span> <span id="s877">I mean, you would think that comes in from the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s878">I never heard it.</span> <span id="s879">I -- they wanted to kill individual commanders of a camp, kapos, you know, the -- yes.</span> <span id="s880">But it was a -- obviously only talk was too much, yet the hostility was there.</span> <span id="s881">Was -- overriding it all was anxiety.</span> <span id="s882">What will become of us, what has happened to our families?</span> <span id="s883">Yes, there was a hatred against landlords taking over farms, or -- and then there were the differences in how the people had survived, which influenced their attitude toward everything.</span> <span id="s884">The people who had lo -- fought in the motho ghetto, they are much more warrior-like than the ones who had hidden in the forest.</span> <span id="s885">And you see that also, in the second generation.</span> <span id="s886">Now, in my last year, I been working with the 50 and 60 year old children of my original clients who have died.</span> <span id="s887">I mean, on, and on, and on.</span> <span id="s888">But now it’s come [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: What kind of assistance were you offering to the second generation?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: I had them organized into groups.</span> <span id="s891">Now, we have so many groups, you can take your pick.</span> <span id="s892">I even had to have somebody in Los Angeles, but I don’t know her, it went by letter.</span> <span id="s893">I have a -- my main work, when it really was work, was helping them to come to terms with the generation conflict.</span> <span id="s894">Want to hear anything about it?</span> <span id="s895">In so many cases, the parents expect that the younger generation should make up to them some of the things they never had.</span> <span id="s896">They overstress the value of education.</span> <span id="s897">They put so much pressure on, that the young people can’t live up to it.</span> <span id="s898">But they haven’t had it, and here they had the chance, they have to take it.</span> <span id="s899">All right, when the time comes that a 18 year old wants to move out of the house.</span> <span id="s900">You can’t go -- leave us.</span> <span id="s901">Everybody has -- else has left us.</span> <span id="s902">Then the young person feels guilty.</span> <span id="s903">She wants to live her own life, or he, and on the other hand -- I’ve had many, many interviews around that.</span> <span id="s904">Around differences in religious activities.</span> <span id="s905">And it works both ways, I have -- I had parents who were practically agnostics, and children were fanatic [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s906">Then the adjustment difficulties.</span> <span id="s907">Young people here certainly live different type of lives than parents have in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s908">And that depends on which community they live in, but now -- when I first came here, I preached about the necessity that we should know more about DP camps, because they were the catch all.</span> <span id="s909">And I was very mad when I heard of the big conference, that some of my former colleagues are, who were very nice, and I couldn’t go, which annoyed me.</span> <span id="s910">But -- not really.</span> <span id="s911">And then I started to think, the second generation is in their 50’s and 60’s and 70’s now.</span> <span id="s912">They must have something in common, and usual a social agency isn’t really geared to this type of problem.</span> <span id="s913">They could probably best help themselves.</span> <span id="s914">And I helped them to come together in groups.</span> <span id="s915">Now, we have the English transport children is one group.</span> <span id="s916">Then we have the hidden children is another one.</span> <span id="s917">There’s a [indecipherable] which name I’m -- I really don’t know which.</span> <span id="s918">Federation of Children [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s919">Now, unfortunately, they all compete with each other.</span> <span id="s920">But they do good work, they all bring out the monthly newsletter.</span> <span id="s921">And that was very nice.</span> <span id="s922">I always get them from all of them, and I give them to students I share the contact with, et-etcetera.</span> <span id="s923">And the English transport children were having a question where you can ask for relatives of friends.</span> <span id="s924">And I remembered that my mother, in England, as a volunteer, was connected with a hostel where children from Germany and Austria, who went over with the English transports, stayed during the war years.</span> <span id="s925">And in a small place in Yorkshire, which I had almost forgotten, I was up there a few times.</span> <span id="s926">And really for the fun of it, I wrote to the editor, and said, “I wonder if any of your subscribers will remember an old lady in Italy, who ladled out the soup for lunch every day in the hostel.”</span> <span id="s927">And lo and behold, I got three answers, after 60 years.</span> <span id="s928">From somebody in Canada, somebody in South Africa, and somebody in Maine, and they remembered my mother, etcetera, my brother.</span> <span id="s929">So it still goes on, you know?</span> <span id="s930">It’s a personal experience, but it’s an indication that it still is this reaching out for the past.</span> <span id="s931">Well, [indecipherable] of my personal memories.</span> <span id="s932">Cause the experiences were very different than somebody who was in England, or hidden in the Ukrainian forest.</span> <span id="s933">A whole group has gone back to Poland this year, but I don’t know what they had, I’m -- had [indecipherable] to find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: In the rehabilitation center in Italy, where you were, in Merrano --</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Correct?</span> <span id="s937">You mentioned there was a German chef, someone who was not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: And was that unusual, for there to be someone German?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: It was not in Merrano.</span> <span id="s941">It was in Barishkamine.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s943">Were there other Germans working then at the camp, or at the center in -- in Germany where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: I don’t think there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Or is that chef the only one?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: -- very much working, anyhow.</span> <span id="s947">There was a DP director, who then cheated, and had to leave.</span> <span id="s948">I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s949">I just remember that cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Were there any tensions with the chef and refugees who might not have felt comfortable with a -- a German there?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: There may have been, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s952">I really don’t remember any German personnel, I just remember this one guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: So let’s go back a little bit, to Italy again.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: And could you tell me if there was much in the way of Zionism in the realbit -- rehabilitation center where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Well, I lived through the day in Merrano, when Palestine became Israel, and that was one of the most exciting days for the people.</span> <span id="s957">And we had an ardent group of Zionists.</span> <span id="s958">They were not in numbers so many, as they were young, intelligent, aggressive, and I was pretty close to -- with them, because Merrano is geographically near a pass, called the Brederal, and we got really [indecipherable] the people who went to Israel, later Palestine, and we hid them in the sanitorium, and the Zionist group, of course, was mac -- most active in that.</span> <span id="s959">That we had all sorts of dealings with the -- the Bricha, and with the Haganah, and -- and that was good, because the people felt alive, you know?</span> <span id="s960">And then we brought people to this house of Italy, the people who wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s961">Again, yes, people did die.</span> <span id="s962">I remember the leader of the Zionist group, a young man, just before going to Israel, died.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Did many of the individuals, the refugees you were with, leave for either Israel, or other countries while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Practically nobody left.</span> <span id="s965">It’s -- you’ll see, i -- the Truman act had just started.</span> <span id="s966">There was a trickling of people.</span> <span id="s967">Many, many people were afraid to ler -- leave, I forgot to tell you.</span> <span id="s968">They were afraid of life outside.</span> <span id="s969">They had been under discipline for so long.</span> <span id="s970">They wouldn’t tell it that way, but it would come out of the conversation.</span> <span id="s971">You asked me something I didn’t catch all.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: During the time you were at Merrano, were many refugees leaving, and emigrating to other countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Some.</span> <span id="s974">A trickle.</span> <span id="s975">One or two to Australia, and one or two to South America.</span> <span id="s976">There were no visas to be gotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: How long did you stay then, in total, at that center?</span> <span id="s978">What -- when, approximately, did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: I am not -- really not sure.</span> <span id="s980">In ’47, I had a car accident, I didn’t [inaudible].</span> <span id="s981">I would think toward the end of ’48.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Did conditions change much from the time when you first came to Merrano, to when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Some people had left for Palestine.</span> <span id="s984">Some had gotten better.</span> <span id="s985">Oh yeah, we had this one incident [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s986">We had one grim incident, which could have been avoided.</span> <span id="s987">People did not want to leave the sanitorium, because yes, while ma -- word of mouth, they wanted to get out, it’s awful, no food, but, it was actually a very good place.</span> <span id="s988">They had good food, and they had good care.</span> <span id="s989">So, when they were going to be discharged to a regular camp, or to wherever they could go, they didn’t want it, they didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s990">And a group of them got together, and said, “We won’t go.”</span> <span id="s991">And there was an awful fight with the administration, and I know I was sent to look at another sort of camp, that was empty, and they were supposed to go there, near Milano.</span> <span id="s992">And when we got there, I was with them.</span> <span id="s993">There was no water, and actually not much either.</span> <span id="s994">And they hated even the [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s995">And, the whole group decided to go back to Merrano.</span> <span id="s996">And the administrator there had no food for them, you cou -- you got food -- rations for the persons you have.</span> <span id="s997">And he didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s998">And, as he couldn’t -- he did not take them back into the sanitorium, they had no damanna, no talmedge in Italy to stay, they were all sent to prison.</span> <span id="s999">Now, this should not have happened, but it did.</span> <span id="s1000">And were all sorts of law students, they didn’t stay in prison very long, I think there is a -- but it became a big issue.</span> <span id="s1001">And eventually, I think, they went back to the sanitorium, and eventually to different countries.</span> <span id="s1002">But it created so much ill will, Merrano never quite lived that incident down, and it’s written up in drawings, and [indecipherable] everywhere I heard this story.</span> <span id="s1003">Nobody knew much about how to handle survivors, and how to -- there was no government, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s1004">We all had to do as best as we could, and sometimes it wasn’t right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Did you often leave the center and s -- for whatever reason, go into the near town, or to the local area, and meet other people in the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Me, or the DP’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: You.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1009">First of all, I was partly stationed in Munich.</span> <span id="s1010">I could, on my free days, go to Munich, which was a big city in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1011">I also was very interested in seeing what was going on in the country.</span> <span id="s1012">The country was really Austrian, and then became Italy after the second World War.</span> <span id="s1013">And again, i -- everybody hated everybody else.</span> <span id="s1014">And the Germans came out during the day, and the Italians at night.</span> <span id="s1015">It was really very strange.</span> <span id="s1016">Merrano is a beautiful little city, and oh yes, we had time for a private life.</span> <span id="s1017">I was also, somewhere around that time, living in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1018">I don’t know why, but I did.</span> <span id="s1019">I worked in Merrano, in the real center, but I worked -- I lived across the street in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1020">I don’t know why, but I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: That’s where you stayed the whole 18 months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: In Merrano, yeah.</span> <span id="s1023">But in the hotel, no.</span> <span id="s1024">I really couldn’t tell you anything.</span> <span id="s1025">I can picture the room in which I lived, it -- I know during the whole time, I had a room in Munich, a tiny room, in which I had a peasant bath wi -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff, conducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27, 2000, in Forest Hills, New York.</span> <span id="s1027">This is tape number three, side A. I wanted to ask you where you were living during your time helping refugees in Merrano?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: I was living partly in the Hotel Flora, across the river.</span> <span id="s1029">I was also traveling quite often to Merrano, where there was a camp.</span> <span id="s1030">I don’t know where else I lived, I remember Flora.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: So in Merrano you were not living amongst the refugees, is that -- is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1033">I just can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Were you successful in helping to find family members for the refugees in Merrano?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Once or twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: And I know we spoke earlier about some of the religious holidays that were observed.</span> <span id="s1037">Any particular cultural events in Merrano, in the center?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Wedding.</span> <span id="s1039">I think two weddings I remember.</span> <span id="s1040">A bris I remember.</span> <span id="s1041">But, of course, when Israel was declared Israel, we had a big celebration.</span> <span id="s1042">I’m sure we had Pesach, but I don’t remember a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Were there any commemorative events, for events that had taken place during the war, such as the Warsaw ghetto uprising, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Not that I remember.</span> <span id="s1045">We had the evening for Jewish folk songs, and I remember very well that our youngest patient at that time was about 14.</span> <span id="s1046">She came to us from Bergen-Belsen, a concentration camp up north, I think on a British.</span> <span id="s1047">And she never had any formal education, or anything.</span> <span id="s1048">Her father was a journalist in Warsaw, and she had a beautiful voice, and she sang a song, “Aus straita librend,” our city is burning, and she had her own tears.</span> <span id="s1049">That’s about the only get together of that sort I remember.</span> <span id="s1050">But again, don’t forget, 60 years ago, or whatever it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Were refugees asked to do some work in this rehabilitation center?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Yeah, they had the school, trade school, and the arch, one of the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: And in addition to that, were they asked to take care of any of the administration of the center, or help in any of the duties?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Yes, but I -- I remember somebody helping with the clothing room, giving out clothing.</span> <span id="s1055">Probably yes, but I wouldn’t really ever known that, but everything so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: How did that situation differ from what you saw in Oswego?</span> <span id="s1057">Were there more refugees there working to help the camp stay afloat in Oswego, compared to Merrano?</span> <span id="s1058">A: Merrano were sick people, and so it was very limited what they could do.</span> <span id="s1059">Yes, I know, one of our porters was also a refugee.</span> <span id="s1060">I don’t know, don’t remember that it ever became a problem in Merrano.</span> <span id="s1061">They liked to do it, I think they were paid for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: So now would you tell me about you departure from Merrano, and what you did after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: You know, some things are really a little difficult, because one’s own life gets so mixed up with it.</span> <span id="s1064">I went for a prolonged -- do the e -- no, I ended with the Joint, somewhere during the summer, in I believe ’48, I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s1065">And I went to Brazil, for personal reasons.</span> <span id="s1066">But I needed a job, and so I went to the Joint office in Rio.</span> <span id="s1067">And they, of course, didn’t know what to do with me, because I don’t speak Portuguese.</span> <span id="s1068">Women doing that sort of thing in Brazil is not customary at this time.</span> <span id="s1069">PS, I had one of the first flights from Rome to Rio de Janeiro, which took about 37 hours.</span> <span id="s1070">And I had never been in a plane before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: How was that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Overwhelming.</span> <span id="s1073">We went down in Dakar, were so many big flies.</span> <span id="s1074">Was all very, very strange, but [indecipherable] as the only Jew with me, that was a displaced person.</span> <span id="s1075">But the Joint thought, what can we do with her?</span> <span id="s1076">Well, the only thing we could think of, because they really had no displaced persons around, was sending me around to get money, to -- as a fundraiser.</span> <span id="s1077">A, I am the worst fundraiser under the sun in any language.</span> <span id="s1078">B, I was a women -- woman, Thirdly, I don’t speak the language.</span> <span id="s1079">So, it was an absolute failure, but on friendly terms.</span> <span id="s1080">We just decided we weren’t for each other.</span> <span id="s1081">And I took the next plane back to Paris, where I had a sister.</span> <span id="s1082">And I went to the Joint, and said -- I said I’m back in Europe, I might just as well work, and they assigned me to Germany.</span> <span id="s1083">They sort of were quite glad to have me back at the time.</span> <span id="s1084">So, that’s how I started in Bashkimine.</span> <span id="s1085">Passau came a little later, but I had them both together, and then I was stationed in Munich.</span> <span id="s1086">But I really wasn’t supposed to be there too often, they thought I had to go to time in Munich, I better stay in my village often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Did you see a great deal of devastation from the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: In Italy, I did.</span> <span id="s1089">In Munich, I only saw the main streets, really.</span> <span id="s1090">In Frankfort, I saw a lot.</span> <span id="s1091">But it obviously didn’t impress me very much, or I would be able to remember details, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Did you feel very different about being in Germany, than when you had been in Italy, right before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1094">To be in your own country, in an American uniform, and not belong anywhere is very difficult.</span> <span id="s1095">And I didn’t like the Germans very much, and I never liked the people from Bavaria, the city was prejudiced, but there it was.</span> <span id="s1096">I never felt at home in Munich.</span> <span id="s1097">I got along well in Bashkimine and Passau.</span> <span id="s1098">Now, in Passau, I spent month in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1099">You can have it as a story, I mean, I -- in a way, connected.</span> <span id="s1100">We all had the command of Jeeps in Germany, because they were always meeting in another place, or yet to another camp.</span> <span id="s1101">That’s how I saw so many camps, because you were sent to see if a patient’s ready for discharge, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1102">And we had a person in charge of our own district, from England.</span> <span id="s1103">And there was -- there were meetings forever, and this was in November, this I remember.</span> <span id="s1104">And it was a very foggy night, and I had a young Czech driver, who meant very well, but didn’t know too much about driving.</span> <span id="s1105">And we couldn’t find the house of this English commander.</span> <span id="s1106">And we drove down a mountain, and where he thought was a street, it was a mountain going down, and the Jeep rolled over, and over, and over.</span> <span id="s1107">Have a happy ending.</span> <span id="s1108">And I don’t know much what happened after, I was first taken, I’m told, to the house of the commander.</span> <span id="s1109">I was unconscious, and then eventually taken to the Passau hospital.</span> <span id="s1110">There I woke up, in a German hospital, which was all I needed, and with a big, s-swollen head, and it turns out that I had a fracture of the skull.</span> <span id="s1111">Luckily, my driver came the next day.</span> <span id="s1112">Nothing had happened to him, and he wanted to apologize.</span> <span id="s1113">It’s very often the person who sits next to the driver.</span> <span id="s1114">And I was in that hospital for months.</span> <span id="s1115">I think it was March that I got out.</span> <span id="s1116">I was very lucky, I had no le -- nothing left over.</span> <span id="s1117">My eye is a little affected, but for weeks I couldn’t see, I thought I would never see again.</span> <span id="s1118">And it was not Christmas, was some holiday, I know people were very nice to me, and a Catholic priest always came and gave me the Last Rites, and I could really take my choice.</span> <span id="s1119">And eventually I was asked, where would -- did I want to go for a convalescent leave.</span> <span id="s1120">And I chose Merrano, because I knew doctors there, and I knew the place, and I didn’t want to go to a German German place.</span> <span id="s1121">And in Merrano, I met my future husband, who was a doctor there.</span> <span id="s1122">So I said to the end of his life, “I had to fall on my head to meet you.”</span> <span id="s1123">So you see, it has been a rather eventful life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: When did you meet him, when was that that you returned to Merrano?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: I met him in ’48, we got married in ’52, cause we had different quotas from different countries.</span> <span id="s1126">I was an American citizen, he was Polish, and so they had a long to-do, but we made it eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: How long did you stay in Merrano at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: I guess about four weeks, and then I went back to work.</span> <span id="s1129">I went to the end of that contract, then they established another year [indecipherable], I don’t know the name, I went there a few times, to help the worker there to get organized, but something ashabat, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1130">And then came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: After you recovered from the car accident, were you still enthusiastic about returning to do the ru -- refugee work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1133">Everybody was surprised, and told me I could get a pension if I stopped working.</span> <span id="s1134">[indecipherable] me all sorts of things, but didn’t really occur to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: While you were working in Germany, and perhaps even in the hospital you stayed at for so long, did you ever experience anti-Semitism, post-war anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: I experienced doctors who were not nice, but they never said it was because I was Jewish, they said I was an American, and we had everything.</span> <span id="s1137">And I -I’m quite sure it was of religion, but I’m not one who always finds anti-Semitism anywhere.</span> <span id="s1138">It was unpleasant, and I was very glad when I got out of there.</span> <span id="s1139">There I have the documentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: And at the same time, did you sometimes enjoy your excursions to Munich?</span> <span id="s1141">Were you able to enjoy anything in the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Well, when I was in Passau in the hospital, I couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s1143">When I came back, yes, I enjoyed Munich.</span> <span id="s1144">Had nice friends, we went out a bit.</span> <span id="s1145">But, as I say, in Munich it’s not -- it’s a beautiful city, it’s not my territory.</span> <span id="s1146">I would never go for a vacation there.</span> <span id="s1147">The countryside is beautiful.</span> <span id="s1148">And many, many people stayed there.</span> <span id="s1149">Munich was the center of the DP camps, and also had the big TB sanitorium, where I visited, never worked, Goljing.</span> <span id="s1150">And we got often, people discharged from there, mostly from other camps, but also from Goljing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: So, would you describe to me the conditions that you found each of the camps in, the ones that you worked in, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Well, I worked only in the DP camp -- in the TB centers.</span> <span id="s1153">I visited many of the other camps, and they were different.</span> <span id="s1154">I mean, some were more luxurious than others.</span> <span id="s1155">I remember a barracks -- the camps had a very good self government, which I admired, and they didn’t have barbed wire around.</span> <span id="s1156">If the people could leave, I don’t know, I rather doubt it, because it might not [indecipherable] I don’t really recall the -- I don’t know -- remember any details.</span> <span id="s1157">I remember camps as a -- probably because I never stayed there over a day, I just went in, took my history, and went out again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: So in Birishgamines, and in Passau --</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: -- those were the two places where you spent more significant time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: And those were both rehabilitation centers for TB patients?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: And not displaced persons camps, per se?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: They were centers for displaced persons -- Jewish displaced persons who had tuberculosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: How many patients, approximately, were in each?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: I really don’t know, anybody who wants to know, the Joint has all these figures.</span> <span id="s1168">I really don’t know -- 80?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: And what was your routine, did you go to one per day, did you go to one and stay for the week?</span> <span id="s1170">How did you go between?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Usually for the -- usually for the week.</span> <span id="s1172">One week, work days in one, and the weekend, at least twice a month in Munich, and then of -- to Passau.</span> <span id="s1173">That was a very pleasant routine.</span> <span id="s1174">I felt quite at home in both centers, and Munich was always full of gossip, who was going with whom.</span> <span id="s1175">And once in awhile, I could go to a museum, or do something nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Your friends in Munich, were they Jewish?</span> <span id="s1177">Were they also doing this similar kind of work, as you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Yeah, they were mostly Joint people, or any of the other agencies.</span> <span id="s1179">I do not remember picking up anybody from Munich, or Merrano -- yeah, Merrano -- one, it was not a friend, but a person I was in contact with about -- for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Was -- would you say it was unusual for you, as a young, now American, to come and do this kind of work in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: No.</span> <span id="s1182">There are, of course, plenty of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Or as a women, in particular, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Wa -- again, a great many.</span> <span id="s1185">Very often the nurses were also American.</span> <span id="s1186">Oh, I trained nurse’s aides sometimes to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1187">I only remember we had a very nice nurse from New York, a Jewish nurse.</span> <span id="s1188">No, a -- UNRRA had many, many social workers, and so had the Joint.</span> <span id="s1189">I wouldn’t know how many, but I would guess over a hundred.</span> <span id="s1190">They worked in every country, Poland, Hungary, and -- I don’t know if anybody was attached directly to the army, but we worked very closely with the army, and we were very helpful.</span> <span id="s1191">And the American army was really very helpful to the displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1192">The children loved the soldiers, they got chocolates.</span> <span id="s1193">And when we called on them because there might be trouble, not very often, they were always helpful.</span> <span id="s1194">I have good experiences, as far as human beings are concerned.</span> <span id="s1195">And I got very fond of the displaced persons, because they were so courageous.</span> <span id="s1196">They had such a will to live.</span> <span id="s1197">You would think you gonna [indecipherable] suicide or anything other -- I didn’t, I saw -- we get -- we must get married, we must have children, otherwise Hitler has won the war.</span> <span id="s1198">That, over and over again.</span> <span id="s1199">It really could be exasperating with this forever complaining about food.</span> <span id="s1200">I know I once lost my temper when somebody complained he hadn’t gotten enough sausage, and after all, six millions had been killed.</span> <span id="s1201">And I says, “They weren’t killed for you to get sausage.”</span> <span id="s1202">They were always these fights.</span> <span id="s1203">The Russian engineer, you had all sorts of people.</span> <span id="s1204">A Russian Jewish engineer.</span> <span id="s1205">And we had sort of hostess, who was Italian Jewish.</span> <span id="s1206">There quite a mix there in Italy.</span> <span id="s1207">They all got, somehow, along with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: How would you compare the differences between the groups of refugees in these three different rehab centers, in Italy first, and then of course, the two in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: That was a different time.</span> <span id="s1210">The ones in Italy were still much more under the influence of the war, had many more concrete needs.</span> <span id="s1211">We had no money, we had invented pocket money.</span> <span id="s1212">I remember I would -- think it was Monday, I set a little [indecipherable] and gave out pocket money.</span> <span id="s1213">And in Bashmine, and Passau, the war had been away a little longer, they knew a little better what would happen next.</span> <span id="s1214">They were less aggressive, also less interested.</span> <span id="s1215">You had much more, as I remember, much more ablusionaries in Italy than in Germany.</span> <span id="s1216">But I fow -- because it was my first, I always felt much closer to Merrano than to Passau, in particular, I -- I never really got warm with Passau, but that was my -- I didn’t like to be lectured, and many things play into it.</span> <span id="s1217">And I had a friend in Gola, who was above anybody, but somebody else was the director [indecipherable] get into question of competence, and . . . it was the only one -- I saw cotaferata in Italy --it was -- I only saw -- it was very pleasant.</span> <span id="s1218">And one day, I was very courageous, I wanted to see Dachau, which was, of course, not in vention any more.</span> <span id="s1219">But I overestimated my nerves, I simply fainted.</span> <span id="s1220">I didn’t see a thing of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: You entered the -- the area --</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: -- and then fainted right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Yeah, right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Did someone come to your assistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Did you see any other concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: No, I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1229">And it wasn’t as fashionable as now.</span> <span id="s1230">Now you have tourists arrangements to see Auschwitz, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1231">There wasn’t my job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Have you returned to see concentration camps in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: No, I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1234">I wouldn’t see any reason why.</span> <span id="s1235">I know enough about it, I wouldn’t make anything better by seeing it.</span> <span id="s1236">I haven’t even been to our museum here, at the [indecipherable] Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1237">I would have gone to the Holocaust Museum, if I could.</span> <span id="s1238">I would go e-eventually to the museum here, too.</span> <span id="s1239">They got my first forgers by that time, I didn’t really have any contact with Washington.</span> <span id="s1240">So they wrote, and I sent them, and I was sorry later, but [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: The refugees who were in Germany, the ones you worked with, were they primarily from certain countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: You mean in Bashkimine?</span> <span id="s1243">Yes, the majority was from east Europe.</span> <span id="s1244">Poland, Romania.</span> <span id="s1245">I can remember -- oh, Hungary, there’s quite a few from Hungary.</span> <span id="s1246">Not from Germany, interesting enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: How did these refugees feel about being in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Well, they wanted to get out of it, but again, and you can’t underestimate the self-centeredness people had to have to survive.</span> <span id="s1249">And Germany -- one hated Germany, and you hope [indecipherable] what happen, and so on, but your main interest was to get out, and to make money, and to get well.</span> <span id="s1250">There were -- in the three places, there were some political fanatics.</span> <span id="s1251">Some against Roosevelt, others were against England, others were -- hated Germany.</span> <span id="s1252">But they made a lot of [indecipherable] noise, no other action that I can remember.</span> <span id="s1253">But of course, there may have been things they wouldn’t have shared with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: What sort of advice did you offer to refugees in any of the counseling sessions that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Let me pin it very much on the problem they wanted.</span> <span id="s1256">If it was a family problem, which it often was, you did the usual counseling.</span> <span id="s1257">I -- a thing I advised all of them to get into some working process, be it in someplace it could help in the village [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1258">And in other, we had schools, in some are -- in other, Bashkimine, there was a big wi -- camp, very close, where they had very good causes, so we encouraged them to go down there.</span> <span id="s1259">And otherwise it was the usual counseling, where do you -- how do you come to der -- terms with things you don’t come to terms with?</span> <span id="s1260">What ways of adjustment?</span> <span id="s1261">Give them opportunity to talk about their childhood, about their escape, trying to set their mind at ease about whatever they had done.</span> <span id="s1262">Listen to the good things they had done.</span> <span id="s1263">Trying to build up the personality as much as I could.</span> <span id="s1264">And also trying to get some sort of community council getting started [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1265">Really, pretty much what a social worker is supposed to do, but I did it as a sideline, the main things were always what the day brought.</span> <span id="s1266">Not enough sheets on the beds, or not enough peninsilino, streptomycins.</span> <span id="s1267">Could they get coffee, or decaf, or -- at remember that I organized any trips.</span> <span id="s1268">Also, trying to get the doctors, to -- who were medically trained, but not psychologically, to understand the patient better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Do you feel that your own training as a social worker prepared you for these roles that you had to fulfill?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Prepare?</span> <span id="s1271">Not.</span> <span id="s1272">My training helped me to find my personality, and to use it constructively, and that helped.</span> <span id="s1273">But the actual causes, it didn’t do me any harm.</span> <span id="s1274">Know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1275">It’s -- it’s hard to say what you bring to the training, and what the training gives to you.</span> <span id="s1276">It gives you discipline, which I had before.</span> <span id="s1277">It made me understand American life better, and the social system, which is very, very different from Europe.</span> <span id="s1278">I certainly knew more about welfare and all these things.</span> <span id="s1279">And the mixture of being European and having American training helped me, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Were the living conditions pretty similar in the two centers in Germany where you worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: From the DP’s, or from me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Well, mostly for the DP’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Yes, they were very similar.</span> <span id="s1284">I think Merrano, because it was beautifully located, and had more appealing rooms, was I think, the more cheerful setting, if a TB sanitorium can be cheerful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: This is tape number three, side B, of an interview with Gabriele D. Schiff.</span> <span id="s1287">Would you continue to tell me about differences, and similarities between the different centers.</span> <span id="s1288">The two in Germany you got to know, and if you’d like to compare with the one in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Comparisons are always difficult, no matter what you compare.</span> <span id="s1290">The thing that stands out in my mind is that the people in Italy were closer to their real survivor experiences, and were more revolutionary, and also had more of a feeling of quote, that’s coming to me.</span> <span id="s1291">And they really felt that the world owed them a living.</span> <span id="s1292">Certainly America, because it was so rich, and Germany because it had handled them so badly.</span> <span id="s1293">As far as the camps, they were both located in pleasant surroundings.</span> <span id="s1294">I think the kooven ital -- Italy had more contact with the population of Merrano, than the group in Passau had with the inhabitants of Passau.</span> <span id="s1295">The problems were pretty much the same, health, where to go to, how to handle one’s past, and what the future will bring.</span> <span id="s1296">This is an oversimplification, but by now, some of the details have slipped my mind.</span> <span id="s1297">What is very much on my mind is the fact that many of the people who are still alive, of my rehab center population, are in their late 50’s, I think up the end of 60, and I wonder how they will handle the process of aging, which is something that affects all people, but I have a suspicion that it affects them differently.</span> <span id="s1298">From my work with survivors in this country, I have seen that they pretty much go to a second -- through a second immigration when they get older.</span> <span id="s1299">Certainly the language that they have handled rather well, through ha -- the middle years, gets to be slightly problematic again.</span> <span id="s1300">I find that older people, including me, are apt to count money in their mother tongue, which they haven’t done for years.</span> <span id="s1301">Also, of course, living in a city, a big city like New York, where you haven’t gone to school, or know anybody from the olden days, makes you doubly lonely.</span> <span id="s1302">Loneliness, of course, comes with aging, but as a survivor, you sometimes ask yourself, what do you survive for?</span> <span id="s1303">I have often heard complaints by survivors that there is nobody they went to school with, no neighbors that know the streets they have walked in.</span> <span id="s1304">And if it comes to memories, most older people can escape into pleasant memories, and do, but what can the survivor escape to?</span> <span id="s1305">Slaughter, and burning, and anxiety, and death.</span> <span id="s1306">So, I think -- and I know that at the moment, studies being made about it, that there is actually a difference.</span> <span id="s1307">Yes, the experience of aging, we all have, but in a way, the survivor has it more so.</span> <span id="s1308">Everything gets overly intensified.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Have you focused on these issues of aging among the survivor population in your work, after returning from Europe, in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: I have.</span> <span id="s1311">And I have had an -- when I still had cases -- later I became an administrator, I have had cases of people who were older, and my agency had a coffee house once a week, for older survivors, and that always gave me a chance to talk to different people, and as I’m, in a way, one of them, they share it with me quite frankly, their pleasures, and their worries.</span> <span id="s1312">And, of course, sickness is another one, where people born and raised in this country, may have a relative come in, or a long time friend when they need help.</span> <span id="s1313">It’s always very different -- difficult for the survivor who lives alone, to find a person who helps take care of their bookkeeping, whom they can have on their living will, and all these documents that run all our lives, become problems, and make it suddenly clear again, yes you thought you were an American, you thought you were at home here, and suddenly you feel like a foreigner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: I’d like to return to your time in Germany, and to your own living conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Okay, which --</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: So when you were in either Birishgamine, or Passau, what were the living conditions that you had on a weekly basis, a daily basis, how can you give some picture of what your own conditions were like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: We were so much daily living that they almost are not conditions.</span> <span id="s1318">I had a room.</span> <span id="s1319">I had office hours from about 10 to about four.</span> <span id="s1320">People came to me when they had question about their pocket money, when their laundry wasn’t intact, or the cook was angry, somebody had sent the food back.</span> <span id="s1321">So I think part of the time, I was made of all purposes, and then people had sometimes gotten letters from consulates in a different language, which I tried to translate.</span> <span id="s1322">They had to make official phone calls, which I made for them.</span> <span id="s1323">And almost always, they took this opportunity to talk about what just worried them that particular day.</span> <span id="s1324">They hadn’t heard from an uncle in America who was supposed to give an affidavit.</span> <span id="s1325">The consulate hasn’t let them know somebody had treated them badly.</span> <span id="s1326">There was a rumor that Australia had -- took only people in agriculture.</span> <span id="s1327">Whatever came up during the day, and then in the evening sometimes, we really talked about olden times, how it was at home, how they had sat around the open fire, how the grandfather had lived with them, how different it all was when the Russians came, who came riding into the kitchen, and had very different ideas of civilization.</span> <span id="s1328">Also, on the other hand, had been very helpful.</span> <span id="s1329">Many had been liberated by the Russians, who had liberated Auschwitz, and had really only good things to say.</span> <span id="s1330">Other had stories that they simply had to tell, because they’ve had such an injustice had to be done to him.</span> <span id="s1331">I remember a little story which is indicative.</span> <span id="s1332">In a camp, there were a husband and wife, and as most camps, as -- especially concentration camps, there was absolutely nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1333">And one day, the husband had managed to gather two potatoes to bring to his wife, who was in the barrack.</span> <span id="s1334">And it was a very wet, damp day.</span> <span id="s1335">He tried to balance his way on bar -- bare feet through the ward with his two potatoes, and he was very close to home when an SS man came and just threw the potatoes out of his hand, down to the floor, into the mud, so that they couldn’t be eaten any more.</span> <span id="s1336">And he said, “That was one time where I cried.”</span> <span id="s1337">And I must confess, I cried when I heard the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: How do you look back on the emotional reaction in you, during your time working with refugees, and how -- you say you cried from this story.</span> <span id="s1339">What other incidents really got to your center, and bothered you, disturbed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: The interesting thing is, the big stories don’t upset you as much as the small ones, and the reason is, I cannot identify with thousand people being killed, but I can identify with a husband being proud to relieve the starving of his wife, and have it spoiled.</span> <span id="s1341">And I’ve always felt, when I’m honest, it is these small things, the things that could have happened to me, in my experience, because the other things I haven’t experienced.</span> <span id="s1342">I have not lost somebody in a fire.</span> <span id="s1343">I haven’t lost anybody through Hitler, really, but I’ve lost a much -- many other things, and I know the loss were innocent.</span> <span id="s1344">Things I have experienced are easier to ad -- identify with.</span> <span id="s1345">There are some stories of escapes through snow nights.</span> <span id="s1346">Now, I have some there from my husband, but as you will read them, why should I tell them?</span> <span id="s1347">That -- his life was full of these small stories that get you.</span> <span id="s1348">And not only me, but everybody we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Did you feel that there was an emotional toll, or price that you had to pay to do this kind of work with refugees?</span> <span id="s1350">At the end of a day, did you reflect to yourself, and try to -- try to come up with ways to look at each day with perspective?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Yes, I try to review each day, and to see if there’s something I could have done better.</span> <span id="s1352">And when I found something, I welcome it.</span> <span id="s1353">An emotional toll, perhaps it didn’t take, because I felt guilty to begin with.</span> <span id="s1354">And everything that I could do, would relieve my personal feeling of guilt.</span> <span id="s1355">I came out of it, I think a better social worker, or to b -- say it better, a better listener, because so much of the help one could give, was simply by listening with a sensitive ear.</span> <span id="s1356">You may say a trained ear, because people were so unhappy when they came to this country, that nobody wanted to listen to them.</span> <span id="s1357">And they were bitter about it.</span> <span id="s1358">And even today, the first thing one’s being told, oh well, when we came to America, nobody wanted to hear us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Did you keep a journal, or in any other way record your reflections?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: I didn’t keep a journal, but when something really moved me, I made either a story out of it, because I liked to write, or put it down verbatim.</span> <span id="s1361">I kept those notes for a long time, but I don’t have them any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Again, with respect to the centers, or the DP camps where you were working in Germany, were there similar types of religious activities and observances, as what you saw in Merrano, and also, what could you say about any of the cultural activities taking place in the camps, or centers in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1364">I don’t remember that we celebrated a Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s1365">I may not have been there during holidays.</span> <span id="s1366">I don’t remember the split between Orthodox, and the assimilated that we definitely had in Merrano.</span> <span id="s1367">You may have had several [indecipherable] in Barishkamine, not in Passau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Do you have more distinct memories of Merrano, in comparison to the two in -- places in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1370">I think because it was the first, and I came back from my own recuperation, and I stayed in touch with some instructors who went later to Israel.</span> <span id="s1371">And the young girl I mentioned to you as the youngest, was later adopted by one of the doctors, and they went to Israel together, and then married a doctor, and came here, and stayed with me for some time, and I helped her find a job here.</span> <span id="s1372">Yes, Merrano has many more memories.</span> <span id="s1373">The others, I never feeled at home, and it was somehow -- it was more of a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: And what time period were you, more or less, in Germany working with refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: From ’49.</span> <span id="s1376">I think part of ’48, the end of ’48.</span> <span id="s1377">In ’50, I came back to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: In any of these situations, whether in Italy, or in Germany, did you encounter any families that were intact, any family members that had already found each other again, or was it all single individuals, even if there were marriages within the camps, or the centers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: I think there were families in [indecipherable] in the first camp, where I was a few days.</span> <span id="s1380">I cannot remember -- I think husband and wife, I may have met one or two couples.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: And in Germany, were there marriages in those camps, or centers, just as there were in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: Made a mistake, in Italy there weren’t, in Germany there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Maybe I made the mistake, but . . .I may have also gotten the wrong impression about something else.</span> <span id="s1384">I think I was told that in one of the places you were in Germany, you were the only relief worker living in the camp itself, is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: These were rehab centers, and they were -- they were listed as DP camps, so I use it sometimes.</span> <span id="s1386">I think everywhere I was -- no, not in Italy, but in Passau, and Barishkamine, I think I was the only one living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: And was that a choice on your part, something that you asked for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: I think I was the only worker, and it was [indecipherable] it was the thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: So, in other words, when you were working with refugees, you were living amongst them, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: And then you would go on the weekends, or at some other point to Munich, is that how your routine went?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: There was never a set routine, but very often I would do that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: And again, just like I was asking with respect to the refugees in Italy you worked with, in Germany, did many of them wind up leaving the centers while you were there, and how did the conditions change from the point when you started, to the point when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Basically they didn’t change.</span> <span id="s1395">Some people left, their visa came through, sometimes they found a relative unexpectedly, in Argentine or somewhere.</span> <span id="s1396">The big change was, there was a Palestine one could go to, by -- or rather Israel one could go to.</span> <span id="s1397">Palestine you needed the English permit, and didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s1398">So that opened up new hope, and the spirit was a little more hopeful toward the end of my work, than in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: When you would take down the histories of refugees experiences, on a daily basis, were you surprised and shocked from -- with what you heard, or did you go through a sort of transformation during your time with this work, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: No.</span> <span id="s1401">Even today, and I have taken hundreds here too, I think every history is different, and it will get me, I sometimes get mad at the client in my mind, and sometimes I admire them, but I’ve never gotten to the point where they don’t touch me.</span> <span id="s1402">They may not -- I’m sure they don’t touch me as much as they did in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1403">But I was very prepared for my husband’s stories.</span> <span id="s1404">But that came out a little later.</span> <span id="s1405">No, I -- I never really got tired or blasé about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: And yet, weren’t you often surprised?</span> <span id="s1407">Was every day bringing something new to your awareness that you had not heard before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Not every day, but once in awhile, I did hear about a criminal act I’d never heard of before, or some event I had never heard of.</span> <span id="s1409">And that overwhelmed me.</span> <span id="s1410">There was one mention, at one point, which I can’t document, of somebody who claimed to have eaten human flesh.</span> <span id="s1411">That was something I could neither understand, nor digest.</span> <span id="s1412">I’ve never heard it again, other people said it was never [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1413">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Did refugees talk much about war crimes trials taking place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s1416">I don’t know which ca -- which year the war crimes took place.</span> <span id="s1417">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: In Germany, did the refugees often talk about specific perpetrators, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1420">They talked a great deal about the kapos, the people who were the supervisors in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1421">And they had grim stories to tell, and they would repeat the stories over and over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: But you also heard about people who had done good things, and they remembered that too.</span> <span id="s1423">Polish peasants who had survi -- had helped survive a couple.</span> <span id="s1424">Some had survived, a couple -- had saved a couple’s child, and some person said, “None of us would have survived, if it wouldn’t have been for people who were helpful.”</span> <span id="s1425">I heard that from both Italian -- more Italians than Poles.</span> <span id="s1426">But also Germany, but less so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Did you meet individuals from your own hometown of Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Once or twice, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: People you had known?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: So will you tell me now how it came to pass that you left Germany, and eventually returned to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: Well, I guess my contract was up, and three years was long enough, and I had met my future husband at that time.</span> <span id="s1433">And the eventually hope was to go to America.</span> <span id="s1434">And I -- I just had had -- I -- I felt it was time to go home.</span> <span id="s1435">I had an apartment I wasn’t -- didn’t know what was going on there.</span> <span id="s1436">So I came home.</span> <span id="s1437">And [indecipherable] immigration agencies, for HIAS -- for New York Association for New Americans.</span> <span id="s1438">Then, for a short time, I went back to the juvenile court.</span> <span id="s1439">And then I heard that my latest agency, 1959 -- in the meantime I got married -- Self Help, was looking for somebody to take over for vacation.</span> <span id="s1440">And I said I’ll do it.</span> <span id="s1441">I came for three months, and stayed 40 years.</span> <span id="s1442">And I worked as a caseworker first, psychiatric social worker, and eventually ended up as deputy director.</span> <span id="s1443">That was an agency that worked exclusively for survivors.</span> <span id="s1444">It started with survivors from Germany, but soon became survivors from central Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: So you want to continue telling me about this organization you worked for, Self Help?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1447">It was founded in 1935 by German refugees.</span> <span id="s1448">And they founded it, and worked together with the Quakers.</span> <span id="s1449">So, in name, it is always a non-sectarian agency, but today it works only for Jewish survivors -- that is not true, either.</span> <span id="s1450">Anyh -- it works.</span> <span id="s1451">It still has a section only for survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Did you get involved with restitution issues?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: As an agency, yes.</span> <span id="s1454">We worked closely with claims conference, and the president of the claims conference was a board member of our agency, w-we worked very closely with all agencies, as another German Jewish agency, the blue card --</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: You’ve made references to the fact that you later met many of the survivors and refugees you had helped.</span> <span id="s1456">And how did those meetings usually come about?</span> <span id="s1457">Did you take initiative to try to contact them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: -- or did they come to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: No, neither nor.</span> <span id="s1461">Just by chance.</span> <span id="s1462">Self Help has a great home health aide service, and people ask for our home health aides, and they were often survivors.</span> <span id="s1463">And Self Help, together with other agencies, runs quite a few apartment houses, which were originally for survivors, so I met survivors there.</span> <span id="s1464">Then United Helpers, this the agency has a scholarship program.</span> <span id="s1465">I met them for that.</span> <span id="s1466">And yet, there’s also a German Jewish based nursing home.</span> <span id="s1467">By now I meet quite a few there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: What can you say about the similarities, and differences between the different organizations you’ve worked for through the years, that have helped refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: HIAS is an immigration agency founded by Jewish people from eastern Europe, and has many of it’s connections in eastern Europe, and Poland, and Hungary, and so on.</span> <span id="s1470">The American Joint was founded by German Jews, and it’s connections are more in western Europe.</span> <span id="s1471">Both agencies are immigration agencies, both work in many countries in Europe, have many similarities.</span> <span id="s1472">There’s room for both of them.</span> <span id="s1473">Basically, they have the same goal, I think -- it’s hard to say.</span> <span id="s1474">I really w-would have to read the formulation of their missions to be able -- I know what the working differences is, but what’s in their mission, I couldn’t say.</span> <span id="s1475">And then we have the Jewish Federation, which funnels all these agencies.</span> <span id="s1476">You have a small, but very effective German Jewish agency called the Blue card, which is a relief giving agency.</span> <span id="s1477">The other agencies, basically, are not giving relief.</span> <span id="s1478">They help with everything else.</span> <span id="s1479">And the Council of Jewish Women, I think doesn’t do anything, they used to help with immigration.</span> <span id="s1480">And Self Help has become rowt -- right now, an all around agency, that has a -- a very large homemaker service, with almost 3,000 homemaker.</span> <span id="s1481">No, not 3,000, over a thousand homemakers, and it has five apartment houses that it runs.</span> <span id="s1482">It does five senior citizen centers, for the city.</span> <span id="s1483">And in our housing, too, there weren’t enough immigrants any more, so it’s open now to Chinese, and everywhere, who is living in that particular community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: I know that you mentioned this briefly earlier, but I was wondering if you could elaborate on something you mentioned in the way of survivors who you met first in DP situations in Europe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: -- showing a certain perspective about their experiences, and that over the years, in meeting them again, were meeting other refugees again, or for the first time even, that you’ve seen a different kind of perspective shared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: That applies mostly to the way things are remembered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff, conducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27th, 2000, in Forest Hills, New York.</span> <span id="s1490">This is tape number four, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: In comparison, the more sheltered time in the DP camps is, in their memories, more positive than it was when they lived there.</span> <span id="s1492">There, the old insecurity and fear was overwhelming.</span> <span id="s1493">Now that the struggle in the outside world has been not easy, to say the least, the time in the DP camp is seen in rosier and rosier light.</span> <span id="s1494">I have a friend who is writing a book, who I sometimes talk to, and he asked me to give him some names of people who would give him their -- their history.</span> <span id="s1495">And I suggested them.</span> <span id="s1496">And he said it was very difficult to get anything negative for them, they were only ready to paint it in the most positive pictures.</span> <span id="s1497">That, of course, is rather interesting, and my only explanation is that life on the outside was strenuous, and makes the camp experience, sheltered life, not to worry about job, not to raise children, in rosier light than it really was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: What do you say is the long term impact on your own perspective, of having spent so many years of your life working with refugees and survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: I think for me it was a natural thing to do.</span> <span id="s1500">I have never had any doubt about going into it, and I must say, coming out of it, I find in a way this history is a logical ending to about 40 years of service, which I have given with pleasure, also with heartache, but that’s part of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: I believe that recently you donated a few items to the museum.</span> <span id="s1502">Could you briefly tell me about those items?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: Yeah, the one, and I think the most interesting one was a passport issued by Raoul Wallenberg, in Hungary, to Jews.</span> <span id="s1504">It was given to my husband, and I happen to have the original, and I sent it to the museum.</span> <span id="s1505">I also sent them a picture of the sanitorium in Merrano, and one has the director on it, the other our first group of graduating nurse’s aides.</span> <span id="s1506">I also sent them most recently, a large snapshot of Goering, which was taken by my brother, who was asked to interrogate Goering in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1507">That picture came into my hand, and I thought it has a better place with the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: And today you just showed me an item that I’ll be sending on the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: You could explain that, perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: I really don’t quite know how it came into my hands.</span> <span id="s1512">I think it was really given to me by a friend who had found it at a book fair.</span> <span id="s1513">It’s certainly not a historically reliable document, because it’s strongly politically influenced, but it is interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Would you just explain it?</span> <span id="s1515">What is the actual item, just so we have on tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1517">This is a paper booklet listing all concentration camps in greater Germany.</span> <span id="s1518">They have ever listed some camps which I am not even sure that they were concentration camps, and they broke it down to great camps, and small camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Is there anything else you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: I
