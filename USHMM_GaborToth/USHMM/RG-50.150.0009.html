And did you grow up in Worms?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q.</span> <span id="s7">Did you go to school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q. Can you tell me a little bit about your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A.</span> <span id="s11">In Worms?</span> <span id="s12">I started in public school until 1933 and then for another two years when I was supposed to go to the schuler you were not allowed anymore so at that time they stared an aufbauschuler which was attached to the public school and offered the higher subjects, languages, mathematics and so forth, so we were allowed to attend that and there were four Jewish kids in my class, four girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: You weren’t allowed to go to the . . .?</span> <span id="s14">. . . , but you were still allowed to go to this aufbauschuler which was not under Jewish auspices specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: No it was public.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: That’s what I meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: There was a Nazi teacher who was one of the very bad ones in our class.</span> <span id="s18">She really made our life miserable.</span> <span id="s19">Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: How did she do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: When we were sitting together she left no occasion to make all kinds of remarks against Jews.</span> <span id="s22">She made remarks whenever she could, and she instigated the other kids against us.</span> <span id="s23">Those that were sitting behind us would hit us and kick us from the back of the class and she knew that and she didn’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s24">She would reprimand us for not sitting still and being quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: At that time you must have been about twelve years old, something like that.</span> <span id="s26">It must have been very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Do you remember going home and telling your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yes and because of that my father when they took the initiative of starting a Jewish school and he was one of the initiators of starting the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: That was before it was actually mandated.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s32">And it came in very handy because it kind of coincided with the time that we had to get out of the public school anyways.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: When you say that your father started to initiate the Jewish school, how did he go about doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I think he got together with the . . . ?</span> <span id="s35">. . . gemeind and he helped in organizing it.</span> <span id="s36">And he was very much involved in getting the teachers together and trying to get the building and rooms furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Up to this time when you had this incident with this Nazi teacher, did you have many non-Jewish friends as well as Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: I had one very close best friend which every girl had and she was not Jewish, and then she went into the . . . ?</span> <span id="s39">. . . schuler which was the schuler and at this point she didn’t say hello to me anymore in the street and that affected me so badly that I didn’t get over it for many, many months.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Did you ever have a conversation with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: No never.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: She just completely. . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yes that was it and it was terrible for me to meet her in the street and it was terrible emotionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Children especially at that age, maybe girls more than boys want to be accepted, want to be one of the crowd, did you notice many of these girls beginning to belong to the bedaem or the boys the Hitler youth at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yes, everybody did.</span> <span id="s46">I remember sorting them out, who was going to join and who wasn’t.</span> <span id="s47">I think there were a few from my class who did not join.</span> <span id="s48">I guess because their parents were not thus inclined.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: How did you cope with this, I guess isolation is the only word I can think of?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Well I think I was lucky because I had these Jewish friends who were with me in the same class, very good friends over the years, and then when the Jewish school started all our lives centered around this whole area, and aside from the outside we had really a nice time together, and those times we felt very good about each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: What kind of business was your father in?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: My father was in the . . . ?</span></p> <p><span

that affect your father’s business?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: I guess it affected it, but not to the extent that he felt that he wanted to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Do you remember any discussions at home about . . . ?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: That’s about how long Hitler would or wouldn’t last.</span> <span id="s59">In the beginning I think yes.</span> <span id="s60">I know what we were always . . . . ?</span> <span id="s61">. . . , especially during dinner time and we always had arguments about it because we didn’t . . . ?</span> <span id="s62">.</span> <span id="s63">.</span> <span id="s64">and my father always insisted on this.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: As time progresses, ’33, ’34, ’35, how did things change for you as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: I don’t know when our matron wasn’t allowed to come anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: ’35.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Among other things, so we had to help more in the house.</span> <span id="s69">I had a younger sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: You were already at this time in the Jewish school, 1935?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Did you ever see signs Juden . . . or Juden Vorboden?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s74">And it always made me furious.</span> <span id="s75">I couldn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s76">I always thought why am I any different than other people.</span> <span id="s77">Why should I be different than other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Did you ever have those conversations with other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Do you remember you parents trying to explain the situation to you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: They always had political conversations, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: In terms of you being Jewish or don’t worry.</span> <span id="s83">How did they try and protect you ro did they try and protect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Emotionally?</span> <span id="s85">I don’t think they really did.</span> <span id="s86">I think whatever protection must have come from my own resources.</span> <span id="s87">I have thought about that and my memory isn’t that clear.</span> <span id="s88">Give me an example.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: What type of protection do you think you had from your own resources?</span> <span id="s90">Or you developed I should say.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: My pride in being Jewish.</span> <span id="s92">I think that is mostly it.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Did that increase over these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: I became much more aware of it sure.</span> <span id="s95">And the schools we went to too.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Did you belong, you mentioned the gemeinde, did you belong to a congregation in Worms?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: There was only one really, the orthodox one, but that was very small and everybody didn’t belong to it; to the main congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Which was I take it liberal or something

conversations by the rabbi or among the Jewish people within Worms about emigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: People were talking about emigration all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: How did you fell about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: It was sad to see all the friends go.</span> <span id="s105">We wanted to get away too.</span> <span id="s106">We didn’t know, we felt kind of lost about it, because in the beginning my father didn’t want to leave and then when he did make an effort it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: When did you begin seriously considering trying to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: We got a number.</span> <span id="s109">An American visa number.</span> <span id="s110">I don’t remember what year that was.</span> <span id="s111">Maybe ’37.</span> <span id="s112">At one time my parents had applied for me to go on one of the English transports, kindertransport, and I had a relative who had moved to England and was going to help and had a family picked who was going to take me, and I remember that my mother and I went shopping for me to fit me out, and I was trying to get emotionally set to go to England and the worst thing which is kind of funny now, was to buy an evening gown, which we both enjoyed doing, and I loved that dress that we bought.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: How did you feel about going to England on the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I had very mixed emotions about it and I was terribly scared too.</span> <span id="s115">I don’t know exactly which . . . ?</span> <span id="s116">. . .but it never came to pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: It never came to pass because other events transpired?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: At what point in your father’s business life did he being to feel that he may have to leave?</span> <span id="s120">His business kept on quite awhile in your memory?</span></p>

came back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: You finished this Jewish school you were in and went to Frankfurt then?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes for three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: That’ what I meant.</span> <span id="s130">What purpose did you have in mind when you went to Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: It was one of the few things that was open in further education.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Had you planned on doing that, when you said that was one of the few things available, had you looked into other possibilities of what you might do?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: In the area yes, but there was really nothing.</span> <span id="s134">When I went to I didn’t want to go and that was about the extent of it.</span> <span id="s135">I didn’t want to be a seamstress,that was not my thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: When you said hashera, hashera had a definite emphasis on emigrating to Israel and you as a family did not consider going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Did you consider going any place other than the Unites States?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: No my father, he was writing to Uruguay and South America, all kinds of places but there was nothing tangible.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Did anybody help him in terms of organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s142">I think he was trying his own resources.</span> <span id="s143">Family and friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: That’s what I meant.</span> <span id="s145">Did you have friends in those places.</span> <span id="s146">What happened to you in Frankfurt on Crystal Night?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: All I remember was that we were all sitting in the basement huddled together.</span> <span id="s148">Nobody came into the home or the school.</span> <span id="s149">And we were scared and we didn’t know exactly what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: When you came to Frankfurt did you notice any differences in the situation in Frankfurt and in Worms?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No because I was very much closed in the school and it was only for a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: But out on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: I didn’t go out very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: On Crystal Night when the evening was over and you went out were you aware of what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: I don’t know if we were aware of the full extent of it, and I don’t remember if my parents picked me up.</span> <span id="s156">No it couldn’t have been because my father was hiding somewhere and I must have come home by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: How did you come home, by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I imagine so.</span> <span id="s159">There was no other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: When you say that your father was hiding, your father was not taken on Crystal Night?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: How did he manage to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Because he was hiding.</span> <span id="s164">I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s165">I think in his office they had a safe or something that was like an old room in the back.</span> <span id="s166">He was hiding in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Did you notice a difference in your father between before you left for Frankfurt which was before Crystal Night and when you came home?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: What I’m really asking was there a sense of urgency?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: You mean about emigration?</span> <span id="s171">There might have been.</span> <span id="s172">We were trying to get out of Worms at least, and get to Heidelberg, but between Worms and Heidelberg I went back to Frankfurt to Noresenberg to and they had classes</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: But what did the Home for Difficult Children have to do with baby nursing, it just happened to be together?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: No.</span> <span id="s175">They took girls in who had illegitimate children, who at that time were of course outcasts in society, especially who had children from gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: So in other words that was an opportunity . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: So when these babies were born they were taken care of there and the mothers stayed there for awhile and that gave us the chance to learn baby nursing with these children.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Why did you want to earn baby nursing at that particular time?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Well at that time it seemed like some kind of a professional direction.</span> <span id="s180">I enjoyed it too.</span> <span id="s181">I thought I would enjoy working with babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: The reason I’m asking is with emigration in mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Let me backtrack just a moment.</span> <span id="s185">You mentioned that there was near Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s186">Your family had decided to leave Worms.</span> <span id="s187">Why did they decide to leave Worms for Heidelberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: My father had a sister married in Heidelberg and she and her family left to go to England and the apartment became available and we were able to move into that apartment and life in Heidelberg was much easier than Worms.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: That’s what I was wondering.</span> <span id="s190">In what way was life in Heidelberg much easier than Worms?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Well the population was much more . . .?</span> <span id="s192">. . . and there was much less hatred than Worms.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: How did you feel the hatred in Worms?</span> <span id="s194">How were you feeling it directed at you?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Well there was hardly and communication any more between Jews and non-Jews except for the essentials of living, like buying food, and shopping.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Were you still able to go shopping?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: We had to.</span> <span id="s198">We had to buy food and we had to buy clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: How were you received in those stores?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: It depends.</span> <span id="s201">Some stores you dreaded to go in and you made yourself as small as possible and hoped that you wouldn’t be recognized as a Jew and others were know to me more, you can’t say friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Had your father fought in the First World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Could he ever imagine, what I’m asking is it was particularly difficult to take for men who had either fought in the First World War or were particularly German nationals, to understand that this was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: This was difficult for him anyways.</span> <span id="s206">His brother had and his family was very German.</span> <span id="s207">He was born in a little village on the other side of the Rhine in Gerstadt and there were seven children I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: In his trying to cope with the situation was it difficult for him, eventually, I guess after Crystal Night he had to get rid of the business.</span> <span id="s209">Was that a difficult time for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: It was so difficult for everybody.</span> <span id="s211">You didn’t look at it this way at who had a more difficult time.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: How did he get rid of the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s214">I guess they just closed down.</span> <span id="s215">He couldn’t sell it.</span> <span id="s216">They just closed down.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: After he went to Heidelberg, this is after Crystal Night, 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Maybe it was in ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: And you were still in baby nursing school near Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: I don’t remember the exact timing if I went from Worms to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s221">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: How long did you stay at the baby nursing?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: I think about nine months or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: And they lived in Heidelberg during those nine months?</span> <span id="s225">I’m just trying to get the timing.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: I don’t remember the exact timing.</span> <span id="s227">We were deported from Heidelberg in October of 1940.</span> <span id="s228">So it was between ’39 and ’40, maybe a year.</span> <span id="s229">I’m not quite sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: After you went back to Heidelberg after this time in the baby nursing school did things get worse in Heidelberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: My recollection about life in Heidelberg is very vague.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Where you afraid of any physical harm?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: At the end?</span> <span id="s234">I guess not because I took walks all over and I enjoyed the city itself very much.</span> <span id="s235">I mean the landscape.</span> <span id="s236">I took walks, everybody did, but there was no more Jewish life there really, just some kind of a makeshift shul which was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: When you say Jewish life, other than school, what else are you referring to?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Services or any kind of cultural activities which had been very much so in Worms before the Crystal Night.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Cultural activities, was that at the Culturbund or were you still allowed to go to the .</span> <span id="s240">.</span> <span id="s241">.</span> <span id="s242">?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s244">Only at the Culturbund.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: But they were still active until 19 .</span> <span id="s246">.</span> <span id="s247">until Crystal Night, that you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: How did you get notice in October 1940 that you were to go anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Very easy.</span> <span id="s251">They just came and said pack, and you’ve got to be ready in two hours.</span> <span id="s252">Any they stayed right in the apartment with you, maybe in front of the apartment.</span> <span id="s253">I don’t know if it was police or Gestapo.</span> <span id="s254">I think this was document, but I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: But they stayed with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Or in front of the door to make sure that you didn’t get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Was there any forewarning of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: No.</span> <span id="s259">You didn’t know what’s what.</span> <span id="s260">My father’s brother who was living in Worms at the time was married, was visiting us and he pleaded with them he wanted to go back to his wife and they did let him go, unfortunately because then he was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: From Worms?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: When you were in Heidelberg receiving this news did they tell you where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: No.</span> <span id="s265">Nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: That must have been a terrible frightening situation not to know where you were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s268">We were just hoping that we would go west instead of east.</span> <span id="s269">When we were on the train that was what we were always watching out for are we going east or are we going west.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: What difference?</span> <span id="s271">What did you prefer west to east?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Well there were rumors already of terrible situations of people going to Poland or some kind of camps in Poland.</span> <span id="s273">People having to go to forced labor.</span> <span id="s274">Nobody really knew but there was a frightening idea of east, going to Poland, and west nobody knew but they figured if it is going to France of somewhere there it could not be as terrible as Poland.</span> <span id="s275">That was really all we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What were you able to take along?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Well they told us what ever we could carry.</span> <span id="s278">I think one suitcase per person.</span> <span id="s279">Only as much as we could carry ourselves, and they told us to take warm things.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: As it turned out this was a concerned effort of the Nazis to take all the Jews from Baden, but where did you meet, or how did you know it wasn’t you alone or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Well first of all we were living in a building with other Jews and everybody got the same notices and I think there were more people in the street too.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Was that an accident that you were living in a building with many Jews or in any way had that been proscribed.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: No this is where my father’s sister had lived too, so we wound up there.</span> <span id="s284">Maybe the building was originally Jewish

<p><span id="s322">A: It was just empty barracks.</span> <span id="s323">And the first impression that we got, I don’t remember if it had rained before, but I think it had rained a little bit which had made for the famous situation of mud, so I guess people fell all over the place and got dirty carrying their luggage to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: How were you assigned to whatever barracks you were assigned to?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: I guess somebody must have been there at the entrance and told us as we came in that now this number goes to this barracks.</span></p>

and many different places, especially with the lack of latrines.</span> <span id="s363">In terms, I think the biggest problem there from what I read was the humiliation for the people who couldn’t make it or you know, couldn’t make it on line and so on.</span> <span id="s364">What were the good things?</span> <span id="s365">You mentioned before there were some nice things.</span></p> <p><span

emigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: We were really lucky for our American relatives.</span> <span id="s407">They made the effort and because my family had a connection to the . . .?</span> <span id="s408">. . . settlement that was really our personal luck.</span> <span id="s409">Everybody who did get out a lot of people had . . .it was just my family’s luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: What kind of settlement did you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: The Sasua settlement in the Dominican Republic.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: What kind of connection was there between your family in the United States and this settlement?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: My father’s brother who lived here for many years was very friendly with the director of Joint who was on that settlement as a director, and my cousin my father’s nephew was working with him in the Dominican Republic and he managed for us to be able to join this group.</span> <span id="s414">They were at the time going around Europe and trying to get young people who would be farmers in the Dominican Republic.</span> <span id="s415">We didn’t exactly fit that description.</span> <span id="s416">My parents, my father was born in a small village and they had land, familiar with farming, but he had never worked as a farmer and he was beyond that age, but he still got the visa to go.</span> <span id="s417">They accepted us.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Was that visa for all six of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: No my grandparents were not.</span> <span id="s420">My grandparents were taken to one of the transports to another camp.</span> <span id="s421">They took older people.</span> <span id="s422">Old people.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: You mean like Thereienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: No, in France.</span> <span id="s425">They said they would have a little better accommodations and would be cared for better.</span> <span id="s426">My parents thought since they cannot come with us, it must have been a terrible decision to make.</span> <span id="s427">I didn’t realize so much then, but looking back I shudder when I think of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: I take it then when you got notice that you could go to Santa Domingo, these two things coincided that your grandparents could go this . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yes, they left before us.</span> <span id="s430">And they went to one camp and the people from that camp, well anyway my grandparents ended up in a cloister and they were taken care of by nuns.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Through the whole war?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s433">And my grandfather died there and my grandmother at 78 came all alone to the United States.</span> <span id="s434">She lived till she was 83.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: When you say that it was a very hard decision, it must have been very difficult for you too.</span> <span id="s436">I lived with my grandparents and I know how close you can become.</span> <span id="s437">Were you able to say good-bye to them in terms of going to a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: No they were taken to the commune or whatever it was and we saw them being taken, and I think that’s all.</span> <span id="s439">We could wave good-bye to them from the barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: On the day that you were able to leave Gers what were the logistics of leaving?</span> <span id="s441">Who took you to the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: My father and mother and sister we did not go together.</span> <span id="s443">My father had to go in one transport, men in one transport and women in another transport.</span> <span id="s444">They collected a few people who were able to go to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s445">That was the intermittent, what do you call it, the intermittent something, and the men were kept in Lamilles that was the auslander unslagger.</span> <span id="s446">And we were in the city of Marseilles in the hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Who paid for you in that hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: I guess the French government must have paid for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: And then you were able to reunite on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: No.</span> <span id="s451">No.</span> <span id="s452">In Marseilles everybody had to take care of their emigration and go from one consulate to the other in order to get their visas and transit visas and arrange for how you were going to travel and we all got, I think the Dominican visa we could only get in this part and the American visa, I am not quite sure of all the logistics, but we had to get the transit visa through Spain and the transit visa through Portugal, the train tickets.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: You had only left with . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Maybe we got the Dominican visa in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s455">We must have had some kind of proof that we were going to get it.</span> <span id="s456">Definitely or otherwise they wouldn’t have let us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: When you left originally I take it you left with your suitcase and ten reichmarks that you were allowed to leave with.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: I think 100 reichmarks.</span> <span id="s459">And in Marseilles my father was able to make some black market dealings and he made money with exchanging back and forth so that this way he was able to manage.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: When you came to Santa Domingo you were on this settlement.</span> <span id="s461">Wait a minute we’re getting ahead of ourselves.</span> <span id="s462">When you came to Marseilles you went over Spain and through Portugal to Lisbon?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: All by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: How long did you stay in Lisbon?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Again how were you able to support yourselves without money?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: We had money.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: The same money?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: The same money.</span> <span id="s472">Since we were four people, two children really, it kinda worked out.</span> <span id="s473">I don’t know, maybe my father had tucked away some extra money that he didn’t . . . It never occurred to me before.</span> <span id="s474">Maybe he did.</span> <span id="s475">If he did it he was very courageous because they had threatened with death on the train if we had anything extra.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: You mean on the train going from Heidelberg to Gers?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Did they in fact search you?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Not the suitcases either?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: When you were in Lisbon what kind of ship did you go to Santa Domingo on?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: We didn’t go to Santa Domingo, we went to the United States.</span> <span id="s484">There were no direct ships to Santa Domingo, we had to go via the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: via New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: via New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Where you able to see your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: They were able to see us because when we arrived in New York, I think it was in June 1941, we came to Ellis Island and Germany had just invaded Russia and we were declared German citizens and we were not allowed in the country.</span> <span id="s489">So our family came to visit us on Ellis Island and the only was we saw New York was with the F.B.I.: on the way from Ellis Island to the boat, which was in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: When you say F.B.I. you mean the F.B.I. escorted you?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s492">To make sure that we wouldn’t escape and illegally enter the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Your intention was to emigrate to the United States and Santa Domingo would just be an interim stay until your number, until you were able to enter the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Well then a number didn’t do much good any more.</span> <span id="s495">Nobody knew what was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: When you went to Santa Domingo from New York and you found yourself on this settlement, what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Well I and describe it in one word.</span> <span id="s498">It was a unique experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Well it was a little bit like a kibbutz, but not with the sprit of a kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: You mentioned that it was an agricultural settlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: It was meant to be an agricultural settlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Meant to be?</span> <span id="s504">Meaning that it didn’t work out that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: No, there were a lot of difficulties and people were trying in all different kinds of ways to build up the settlement.</span> <span id="s506">I think they mostly succeeded with cattle raising and dairy.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: You mentioned that you were not ideally suited, that they were looking for young men essentially to populate the settlement.</span> <span id="s508">When you got there what kind of work did you have to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Well I didn’t have to do any kind of work.</span> <span id="s510">I tried to find something.</span> <span id="s511">Everybody tried to find something that they would fit in it.</span> <span id="s512">Some people tried not to find something.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Who was in charge of the settlement?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: It was an organization founded especially for that purpose called DRSA or Dominican Republic Settlement Association which was actually part of JDC.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: . . . . . . .Dominican Republic?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Well in Susua itself it was no problem because everybody spoke German.</span> <span id="s517">They still do.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: It’s still in existence?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: On a very, very small scale.</span> <span id="s520">Lets say there are still people living there.</span> <span id="s521">They have become financially very, very successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: What was the morale like on the settlement?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: It’s hard to describe in a few words.</span> <span id="s524">In a very brief way.</span> <span id="s525">A lot of the people were also considering it an interim stay, while the organization itself wanted them to regard it as a permanent stay, and that made for a lot of conflict.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: In what way did those conflicts arise, you know show themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: There were a lot of conflicts, but some people after a number of years did go to settlements.</span> <span id="s528">Not for a number of years, they started right from the beginning to just put people on settlements and none of them were farmers to start out with, there were only very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Did you have a training program?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Yes they had a training program, and they gave them a certain amount of land and a house and cattle, and they experimented with various products and it took awhile before they found out what would be successful and what wouldn’t, and that made for problems between the administration and the settlers, and sometimes there was a rift between the people who stayed in the main village or whatever you want to call it and the people who actually went out to the settlements.</span> <span id="s531">There were all different kinds of problems which were quite unique for that situation.</span> <span id="s532">I’ll show you a book if you are interested.</span> <span id="s533">I’ll show you a sociological study.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: When you say you were in a house, they provided you with . . . ?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: The setters got a house, yes.</span> <span id="s536">They build it themselves or it was built for them.</span> <span id="s537">Originally the land was bought from Trijillo who had responded as the only country in the world to the Avion conference.</span> <span id="s538">You probably know that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: But specifically for farming, specifically for agriculture?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: How it was going to be used I think was left open, but he wanted really a mad of people to come there.</span> <span id="s541">He would have opened the country to 100,000 people.</span> <span id="s542">That is one of the big things that are always against the JD and all the big Jewish organizations, that they didn’t go on an all out effort just to get people out in order to save them, which would have been an opportunity.</span> <span id="s543">Instead they selected people who they thought would be suitable for farming and they got a few hundred people out.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: But that was one of the few places that did at least say they would take them.</span> <span id="s545">Did you know that you would not be able to emigrate from Santa Domingo to the United states until the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yes, we knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: When the war ended you did come to the United Sates I take it, immediately thereafter?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Pretty much.</span> <span id="s549">In 1946, yes.</span> <span id="s550">My sister and I came first, and them my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: You and your sister came first?</span> <span id="s552">Why did you work it that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Well we thought it would be easier if we tried to establish ourselves first and then our parents come after.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Were your parents paid at all in the Dominican Republic for the work?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Yes, my father was working in the warehouse, what they call commardo which is the general store of the settlement.</span> <span id="s556">He was the manager, during most of the time during our stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Did he do anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yes, before he did that he was trying to organize .</span> <span id="s559">.</span> <span id="s560">.</span> <span id="s561">.</span> <span id="s562">?</span> <span id="s563">. . . He had some ideas about that.</span> <span id="s564">It didn’t work out too well.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Some ideas in terms of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Industrial ideas that

his apartment, and I remember what a fantastic feeling it was when somebody gave him a 100 dollar retainer.</span> <span id="s634">I had never seen that much money together at one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: That must have been a fantastic feeling for him especially.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: For all of us.</span> <span id="s637">I just couldn’t believe it at the time and he

diploma, but she, because she wasn’t eighteen yet she had to show a certain amount of school time, I believe, and then she was working as, I forget now, she was painting a piece work, ties and all

id="s720">That was the only way you could survive.</span> <span id="s721">They were trying to figure out things ahead.</span> <span id="s722">There was no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: It was

favor.</span> <span id="s760">She had written me about it.</span> <span id="s761">She had told me, yes she would love to see you, and when the time came she had other things to do, apparently out of town.</span> <span id="s762">So I did not have to . . . ?</span> <span id="s763">. . . , and I do not know if I would have done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: If you would have seen

<span id="s773">But Henry Hutenback was forever writing about.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: When you say the Auslanderbock, you mean of people who had emigrated?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Yes, she kept a list personally that nobody that I spoke to knew about of people who had left and went to all different kinds of places and she did that until she was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: She was deported with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: No she was to I think Theresienstadt, I forget.</span> <span id="s778">From Worms in 1944.</span> <span id="s779">One of the

coincidences.</span> <span id="s783">It turned up in Yad Voshem.</span> <span id="s784">There Henry Hutenback, you know him, by coincidence came across it and he wrote and published the record.</span> <span id="s785">I can show it to you.</span> <span id="s786">I have it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: There are several such lists at Leo Beck Institute for various towns I think, that they

id="s790">She did that personally on a personal basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: And with this commemorative . . . ?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: This is not the only reason.</span> <span id="s793">The other is that in 1938 in the Crystal Night when the hoodlums tried to destroy the synagogue and burn it down, she stood in the door and tried to prevent them physically from coming in.</span> <span id="s794">One of the few people who tried to show some resistance, and she had no relatives and there is nobody to keep that in, for history, so I thought and now all these people with me, that this should be held for future generations and we want to do something about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: When you were in Worms in 1972, how receptive were, did you meet in any restaurants or stores, you must have met German people of an older generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: We didn’t meet anybody, and we didn’t really tell them who we were, except in the synagogue in the visitors book, I entered myself and I said that I lived here and that I was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Was the synagogue still standing and in good condition?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: The city rebuilt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: For whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: That’s a good question but they didn’t want to leave it as a sham . . . ?</span> <span id="s801">. . . for themselves and they rebuilt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Is there a Jewish population in Worms at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A:

You also mentioned this uncle who asked to go back to Worms from Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s807">Was he deported from Worms?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: I think to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: But he didn’t survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: No.</span> <span id="s811">The synagogue in Worms is over 900 years old.</span> <span id="s812">It is just as old as the door, and the Jewish community in Worms has a tremendously long history.</span> <span id="s813">Rashi was teaching there even before Rashi back to 1036 it was built and it had its 900 anniversary while we were there.</span> <span id="s814">There was a big celebration, so the city considers it now as one of its treasures so they reconstructed.</span> <span id="s815">As a matter of fact they are now thinking of reconstructing the whole area the Judenstrasse, a historical reconstruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Did they in fact burn the temple on Crystal Night?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Do you remember that celebration of that 900th anniversary?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: No.</span> <span id="s820">Very little, but I know that they tried to make as big a festivity as possible under the circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: That’s what I . . .that was 1936 and the circumstances were only in their beginning stages, but was there an effort . . . ?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Well the Jewish community of Germany made it I think, bringing speakers from Berlin at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: The reason I’m asking, I don’t know if you remember this, but in terms of their speeches about the 900 year anniversary and the possibility of emigrating, or the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: What was the phrase you used?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: . . . ?</span> <span id="s827">. . . .</span></p></body></html>
