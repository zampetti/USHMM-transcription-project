id="s10">Q: Would you tell me your whole name and when and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My name is Sonja Gottlieb Ludsin and I was born in Riga, Latvia in 1923, the twentieth of October, 1923.</span> <span id="s12">I lived in Latvia, with my family.</span> <span id="s13">And the War broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Tell me a little bit about what your life was like, before the War.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s16">There were six children, four brothers, two sisters, my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s17">The Russians came in the year before the Germans.</span> <span id="s18">They took two of my brothers to fight against the Germans.</span> <span id="s19">We did not know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s20">And then Germany came into Latvia.</span> <span id="s21">They separated our family by taking the young ones and putting them to work in big apartment buildings, that they made in factories, for the SS men.</span> <span id="s22">Whoever was able to make shoes, worked so, or make clothes for them, of any kind.</span> <span id="s23">We used to work from the home, at first.</span> <span id="s24">And then they put us in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s25">In Latvia itself, they had two ghettos.</span> <span id="s26">One was , and one was .</span> <span id="s27">Not , -- .</span> <span id="s28">I landed in .</span> <span id="s29">Then they transferred me to .</span> <span id="s30">And it was -- I did not know where the rest of my family was.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Let's go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s32">Tell me before, how old you were.</span> <span id="s33">And tell me a little bit about your family life.</span> <span id="s34">Were you happy?</span> <span id="s35">Tell me about your school, and tell me about the things -- the dreams that you and your siblings had.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: We were a very, very happy family.</span> <span id="s37">Because each one of us did something of musical (sic.)</span> <span id="s38">.</span> <span id="s39">My sister was an opera singer at the age of 17.</span> <span id="s40">She was the first Jewish girl accepted to the Latvian Opera.</span> <span id="s41">It was just the most thrilling, the most wonderful thing anybody -- parents can imagine.</span> <span id="s42">My brother sang.</span> <span id="s43">I sang.</span> <span id="s44">We all played the piano.</span> <span id="s45">One played the guitar.</span> <span id="s46">One played another guitar, or like a -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s47">I can't think of the word, the instrument at the moment.</span> <span id="s48">But we were a very, very happy family.</span> <span id="s49">There was never just us alone in the house.</span> <span id="s50">There was always a friend of mine, or a friend of my brother, or maybe both.</span> <span id="s51">And we all ate together.</span> <span id="s52">And we all had a very beautiful life.</span> <span id="s53">These are my memories of my family.</span> <span id="s54">My parents were young.</span> <span id="s55">At this stage, I realize just how young they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Because my mother was only 49 years old and she was killed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s57">And my father was 50.</span> <span id="s58">I didn't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s59">I was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s60">So, when I was concentrated in the Latvia ghetto, they still -- my hopes were still that I was going to see my family.</span> <span id="s61">I was sure that my family is going to be saved, like I thought I was, not knowing what was happening to them.</span> <span id="s62">Now, my two older brothers, they were chosen to go in the woods, to fight against the Germans, because they were already with the Russian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Because Russia came in a year before Germany.</span> <span id="s64">And then we were only left a few.</span> <span id="s65">But I thought they were alive.</span> <span id="s66">In that Latvian concentration camp we had a lot of Christian prisoners.</span> <span id="s67">What they did, to be prisoners, I did not know.</span> <span id="s68">But they were above us.</span> <span id="s69">They were like capos, they called them.</span> <span id="s70">And they were very cruel.</span> <span id="s71">But we still walked from the ghetto to these different places, to be useful.</span> <span id="s72">I told them I could sew, which I learned -- I taught myself.</span> <span id="s73">And I sitting on sewing on machine, part of the German, the Nazis' clothing.</span> <span id="s74">And we actually only lived on hopes.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: The ghetto, the ghetto was formed after some big action, where a lot of people were killed; is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s77">The ghetto was -- the ghetto was formed -- it was separated.</span> <span id="s78">You see, everybody that they shipped from Germany they shipped to the Latvian ghetto.</span> <span id="s79">Families came from Germany, from Poland, from different places.</span> <span id="s80">They were separated from us.</span> <span id="s81">They split the ghetto.</span> <span id="s82">And there was a small ghetto, because Latvia was not a big city.</span> <span id="s83">They took the very worst neighborhood, like, and they made it into a ghetto by wiring around it.</span> <span id="s84">Now, we were happy as long as we were together.</span> <span id="s85">But, we lived now in two rooms, three families.</span> <span id="s86">At that time, we were four children and my mother and father.</span> <span id="s87">Then when we went to work, in that place, for the SS men, one day I heard that when we go back, there is going to be massive killing of all the ghetto people.</span> <span id="s88">Because they were bringing in more and more trains from other countries.</span> <span id="s89">So, naturally, we wanted to be with our loved ones, but we also wanted to save ourselves.</span> <span id="s90">Now, by the end of the day, get picked out the oldest people, the weakest people.</span> <span id="s91">My youth helped me.</span> <span id="s92">And I knew somebody who was like a foreman.</span> <span id="s93">He was Jewish, too.</span> <span id="s94">But he was the one who relayed the messages from the SS men to us.</span> <span id="s95">They didn't speak to us.</span> <span id="s96">He spoke to us.</span> <span id="s97">And he was influential enough to put me aside, with another few people.</span> <span id="s98">And not turn me back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s99">Because that meant death.</span> <span id="s100">Now, the emotion that I had, to go back to the ghetto, was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s101">At this point I couldn't make up my mind.</span> <span id="s102">And it wasn't a question of my mind.</span> <span id="s103">He saved me.</span> <span id="s104">He was alive until recently.</span> <span id="s105">I saw him, and I thanked him, again, and again, and again.</span> <span id="s106">So we knew that that ghetto was liquidated.</span> <span id="s107">And new people were brought in, from other countries.</span> <span id="s108">What they did, they left us in that place and I worked there.</span> <span id="s109">And I lived there.</span> <span id="s110">But we were very few lucky ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Tell me in that incident, who was the man, and how old were you, and where were your brothers, or did you know where your brothers were, and who kept you from going back?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Now, what happened was, I was still the same age, because it didn't take that long in Latvia.</span> <span id="s113">Maybe I had reached the age of 15, at the time.</span> <span id="s114">They heard that all the people who were in the ghetto, the Latvian Jews and whoever lived in that ghetto were brought to a mass -- in the woods.</span> <span id="s115">And they had big, tremendous grave dug out, where they shot them, threw them into the grave, with shovels.</span> <span id="s116">And some of them were not killed by the bullet, were still alive.</span> <span id="s117">And they were thrown into that same grave.</span> <span id="s118">And then they put the dirt over them.</span> <span id="s119">And even the ones that were alive was killed.</span> <span id="s120">And I found out -- I found that out afterwards.</span> <span id="s121">There was railroad man, the man that used to control the railroad closing and opening -- he witnessed this thing.</span> <span id="s122">And he said -- he was not Jewish, he just lived there.</span> <span id="s123">And he said, "I will never, ever be able to shut out the scenes and the horrors that the people that were trying to save themselves, and couldn't.</span> <span id="s124">I cannot sleep.</span> <span id="s125">I cannot get it out of my mind.</span> <span id="s126">It is very difficult for me, which is very much -- to understand how it really affected a man who was totally removed from it.</span> <span id="s127">After that, when they killed everybody in that massive grave, they liquidated the place where I was working.</span> <span id="s128">And they said they were going to send us to Germany, to a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s129">We were very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: The man who saved you, what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: His name was Aaronson (ph.).</span> <span id="s132">He was actually, in normal times, he was a cellist, a very well-known cellist.</span> <span id="s133">And he was in charge, like I said, to relay the messages, between the SS men and us.</span> <span id="s134">And his name was , which was his stage name.</span> <span id="s135">But it was Aaronson.</span> <span id="s136">I didn't know whether he was alive or not, afterwards.</span> <span id="s137">But I just -- I was in touch with him, not too long ago.</span> <span id="s138">He lived in Texas.</span> <span id="s139">I spoke to him over the phone, and I thanked him.</span> <span id="s140">And I told him I will never forget him, as long as I live.</span> <span id="s141">And I didn't, because he saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Where were your brothers, at the time of the action?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: My two brothers that were sent in the woods when the Germans fought the Russians, I don't know what -- I didn't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s144">My other two brothers, on the other hand, I didn't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s145">And my sisters, and my parents, I didn't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s146">So, there I was, maybe 14 and a half, 15 years old, and I had no idea of where my family was.</span> <span id="s147">They -- when they told us they were going to ship us to Germany, they piled us up in a big, huge fishing boat, which was totally empty inside.</span> <span id="s148">It had -- we were hundreds of us, from both the ghettos.</span> <span id="s149">And they put us in a standing position.</span> <span id="s150">There was no room to sit down.</span> <span id="s151">There were no toilets.</span> <span id="s152">There was no food.</span> <span id="s153">And they shipped us to Germany.</span> <span id="s154">When we arrived there, in order to get where we had to go, they got us out of the boat, the ship, whatever you call it, and they put us in the trains, where they ship animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Those trains -- what a horror.</span> <span id="s156">I can smell it now.</span> <span id="s157">And I remember so vividly, that it follows me.</span> <span id="s158">I just saw the Holocaust Museum and I saw that train.</span> <span id="s159">And I felt such emotions, that I couldn't even cry, because when you live anything in life, like that, for five years, you cannot cry at sadness.</span> <span id="s160">I cry at gladness, because if I go to a birthday party, or any surprise party, it touches me and I cry.</span> <span id="s161">When it comes to sadness, I don't whether it made me the more -- not stronger, but maybe I have more control over myself.</span> <span id="s162">Now, we arrived with the trains, at night, in the rain, and these SS women wore capes with hoods.</span> <span id="s163">And we looked out of the train, and we saw the capes with hoods.</span> <span id="s164">And these women -- because we did not have SS women in Latvia.</span> <span id="s165">They only came into the picture in Germany.</span> <span id="s166">We looked out, and we saw the camps.</span> <span id="s167">Then there was beautiful green grass and barracks.</span> <span id="s168">So we thought maybe we will find our loved ones there.</span> <span id="s169">Maybe they were shipped on a different shipment.</span> <span id="s170">But it wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">They weren't there.</span> <span id="s172">And they chased us into those barracks.</span> <span id="s173">And the barracks were the most horrible thing.</span> <span id="s174">The -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s175">The bunks were not as wide and the one that is at the Museum.</span> <span id="s176">They were narrower.</span> <span id="s177">At the other camp, later on, they were as wide as the one at the Museum.</span> <span id="s178">And we had to sit, four of us, in one -- in one -- what is it called again?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Bunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Bunk.</span> <span id="s181">It was three levels.</span> <span id="s182">The lights were dim, and we had one girl from Poland who was pregnant, because she came into the picture later on.</span> <span id="s183">And she was pregnant, and the SS women knew that she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s184">And she gave birth.</span> <span id="s185">And we all listened.</span> <span id="s186">And we heard how she cried, and how the baby was delivered.</span> <span id="s187">And she delivered it herself.</span> <span id="s188">And one of the SS women actually helped her.</span> <span id="s189">Then they made a little partition, and they put that baby where we could hear it.</span> <span id="s190">It was a little girl.</span> <span id="s191">And they allowed her to breast feed the baby.</span> <span id="s192">And then, when the baby was two weeks old, they told her, she can't breast feed the baby anymore.</span> <span id="s193">She had to let the baby die.</span> <span id="s194">And we all died with it.</span> <span id="s195">I mean, that was so horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">We listened, the baby was crying, and crying, and crying.</span> <span id="s197">And no food was given to her, and she died.</span> <span id="s198">And we had to comfort the mother.</span> <span id="s199">We were a lot of women in that bunk.</span> <span id="s200">But were all like one, all like one.</span> <span id="s201">Now comes the picture, where I -- we were starved.</span> <span id="s202">We were under-nourished, with rashes on our bodies.</span> <span id="s203">We were shaved.</span> <span id="s204">I had a rash that covered my entire body.</span> <span id="s205">And I was in agony.</span> <span id="s206">But you can take a lot of pain, when you are young.</span> <span id="s207">Now, the SS women were very cruel.</span> <span id="s208">They were crueler than the SS men.</span> <span id="s209">We had no toilets.</span> <span id="s210">We had -- we did not have a period, because they gave us something in the so-called soup.</span> <span id="s211">It was given to us once a day.</span> <span id="s212">Even the circumstances that we lived in, we had no periods.</span> <span id="s213">So that eliminated about how can we protect ourselves, if we don't have a period?</span> <span id="s214">And they dug a long narrow strip outside, with a board across.</span> <span id="s215">That was our toilet, outside.</span> <span id="s216">And there were days when it was like 30 below zero.</span> <span id="s217">We had to go and pull our clothing off.</span> <span id="s218">It freezing, just freezing.</span> <span id="s219">But things were so sad that -- we were young, and we sat in those bunks, and I sang.</span> <span id="s220">I sang all kinds of songs.</span> <span id="s221">And then this SS woman came in, and she says -- she took the black -- I don't know what you call it, but the policemen wear it.</span> <span id="s222">The black stick, the black --</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Nightstick?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yeah, and she beat.</span> <span id="s225">And she said, "You have it so good that you sing?"</span> <span id="s226">Because you never answered an SS woman.</span> <span id="s227">Then she remembered that I sang.</span> <span id="s228">And every time they took us out to be counted, which was four in the morning, twelve at night, any time they desired.</span> <span id="s229">And it was beastly cold, in the winter.</span> <span id="s230">They counted us.</span> <span id="s231">They chased us in, back to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">And anything that we could get to be busy with -- I personally always lifted my arm, no matter what they asked.</span> <span id="s233">Can you sew?</span> <span id="s234">Yes.</span> <span id="s235">Can you clean?</span> <span id="s236">Yes.</span> <span id="s237">Can you go there?</span> <span id="s238">Yes.</span> <span id="s239">Can you go pick up the soup for the barracks?</span> <span id="s240">Yes.</span> <span id="s241">I always went.</span> <span id="s242">Then you be better.</span> <span id="s243">Then you be better than any other prisoner.</span> <span id="s244">Maybe there were three or four more.</span> <span id="s245">And then they made the Jewish men into capos.</span> <span id="s246">They called them capos.</span> <span id="s247">And they put a band around their arms.</span> <span id="s248">And they had to hit us, chase us, hit us, get us out of the barracks as fast as possible, to be counted.</span> <span id="s249">That was their pleasure.</span> <span id="s250">The Jewish boy that was concentrated there, like Hitler said, "We don't have to kill the Jews.</span> <span id="s251">The Jews will kill each other."</span> <span id="s252">And in circumstances like that, that is exactly what was happening.</span> <span id="s253">Those few guys who were the capos, they took a bigger piece of bread.</span> <span id="s254">They took another dish of soup, which deprived us of having us what we were entitled to, because we were so starved.</span> <span id="s255">We were swollen from hunger.</span> <span id="s256">My legs were twice, three times the size.</span> <span id="s257">And one day, there was a men's camp further out.</span> <span id="s258">And in order for them to get their rations of food, which was a big kettle, like, where the soup was in, they had to go to the women's camp to reach the kitchen.</span> <span id="s259">And somebody hollered out to me, "Sonja, I just saw one of your brothers."</span> <span id="s260">And I ran out and I screamed at him, and it was, one of my brothers, in the same place.</span> <span id="s261">It was the most unbelievable happening.</span> <span id="s262">And there was this one SS woman, she was over six feet tall.</span> <span id="s263">And she was the meanest, meanest, most horrible human being anybody can imagine -- even Napoleon.</span> <span id="s264">She took me and she said again, you have it too good.</span> <span id="s265">You just made contact with the men.</span> <span id="s266">And I said to her, "This was my brother."</span> <span id="s267">And it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s268">They never hit us in the middle of the room.</span> <span id="s269">They always put us against the wall.</span> <span id="s270">And then she slammed my face.</span> <span id="s271">She knocked my teeth out.</span> <span id="s272">And also you got like a back knock, at the wall.</span> <span id="s273">That was the purpose of the wall.</span> <span id="s274">So you get a double pain.</span> <span id="s275">And she beat me until I just fell down and I just couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s276">I just laid there.</span> <span id="s277">And it didn't bother her.</span> <span id="s278">And she just walked away.</span> <span id="s279">And she says, " Now you're going to know you will never, ever make any motions to anybody."</span> <span id="s280">And we stayed there.</span> <span id="s281">And that actually was not a death camp.</span> <span id="s282">That actually was a camp that they took us out and brought us to an ammunition factory, where we used to -- it was a huge place.</span> <span id="s283">They made the bombs for -- the large bombs.</span> <span id="s284">And we were making them.</span> <span id="s285">I was upstairs with the women.</span> <span id="s286">And downstairs were the men.</span> <span id="s287">And there again, I knew, my God, I was downstairs.</span> <span id="s288">And I was lucky enough -- and that is why I feel that my life had many miracles.</span> <span id="s289">I was lucky enough that they asked, in that factory, "Who can speak German fluently?"</span> <span id="s290">And I said, "I can."</span> <span id="s291">And I was the interpreter between him and the Jewish girls that came from Poland.</span> <span id="s292">The Hungarian girls came in later on in the War, because Hungary was not jet included.</span> <span id="s293">And I relayed the message, what they had to do next, whether he had complaints about anybody.</span> <span id="s294">We were so undernourished, we didn't have the strength.</span> <span id="s295">We couldn't work on those machines.</span> <span id="s296">They were big, huge machines.</span> <span id="s297">So, they put a white band on my arm, and they always used me as an interpreter, between the Polish girls who did not speak German, between the Hungarian girls who did not speak German, between all the other ones who did not speak German.</span> <span id="s298">And he was actually nice to me.</span> <span id="s299">And he threw slices of bread under the machine, as he passed by, because he had to be careful.</span> <span id="s300">Once I got those extra few slices of bread, I was able to give my brother the bread that I got, legally.</span> <span id="s301">But how do I get to my brother?</span> <span id="s302">I cannot go downstairs.</span> <span id="s303">So, this SS man, when he spoke to me, and he gave me the orders, and he told me what to do, and who to tell what they have to do, he spoke to me very nicely.</span> <span id="s304">And I said to him, "You know what you did was wonderful.</span> <span id="s305">And being as you are so wonderful, can you help me to get my slice of bread to my brother?"</span> <span id="s306">And he says, "Yes, I will.</span> <span id="s307">"He made me take a bomb.</span> <span id="s308">He put it in my arms, and says follow me.</span> <span id="s309">And he got me down to the lower level, where my brother was working.</span> <span id="s310">And that was called the , which meant that when the bomb was made upstairs, they had to use very hot ovens, to finish it off.</span> <span id="s311">I don't know the technical way, how they finished it off, but it was like 120 degrees in there.</span> <span id="s312">And my brother was there, undernourished, just as swollen as I was.</span> <span id="s313">And he stood there, and he watched, the other SS men wouldn't see him.</span> <span id="s314">And I threw that bread under that machine.</span> <span id="s315">And my brother got the bread.</span> <span id="s316">And I did it as often as I could.</span> <span id="s317">But that was still while we were working.</span> <span id="s318">Now, we were shipped to another camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: What was that camp called?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: We didn't know, at that time.</span> <span id="s321">But we landed in and they were putting numbers on the prisoners.</span> <span id="s322">And they just sent us to there, through another camp, which was called .</span></p> <p><span id="s323">And that was a death camp.</span> <span id="s324">There was no work.</span> <span id="s325">There was no nothing.</span> <span id="s326">There was just -- every day was elimination.</span> <span id="s327">They counted us.</span> <span id="s328">One, two, three, out.</span> <span id="s329">One, two, out.</span> <span id="s330">One, four, out, which meant they were going to be burned in the ovens.</span> <span id="s331">So, knowing that at any time they were about to pick me, they knew me, the SS women.</span> <span id="s332">And they said to each other, " ," which means later.</span> <span id="s333">They are not going to take you now.</span> <span id="s334">But they didn't say it in that many words.</span> <span id="s335">So I was happy.</span> <span id="s336">I figured this was wonderful.</span> <span id="s337">How long is this going to last?</span> <span id="s338">Because we were getting less, and less every day.</span> <span id="s339">They were eliminating, they were killing.</span> <span id="s340">They were awaiting for new shipments.</span> <span id="s341">And also in this shipments (sic.)</span> <span id="s342">came with the trains.</span> <span id="s343">They were all told they could take their personal belongings.</span> <span id="s344">Everybody thought they were going live, so their personal belongings consisted of shoes, and a little clothing, and maybe even a little bit of jewelry, thinking that they were going to buy themselves out of the hardest.</span> <span id="s345">Now, we had to go to those trains, and we had to -- they had to throw out their belongings, their valise.</span> <span id="s346">And we had to open them, and sort them out, where the Nazis helped themselves to it.</span> <span id="s347">And it was just people who were coming -- coming to be killed.</span> <span id="s348">But they didn't know that.</span> <span id="s349">So, that was the second most horrible thing in my life, or the third.</span> <span id="s350">I also was very happy that I was with the Polish girls, the Jewish Polish girls.</span> <span id="s351">They had a lot of vigor.</span> <span id="s352">They were never afraid.</span> <span id="s353">Before that death camp, when we were sent out to work, they made contact, somehow.</span> <span id="s354">And they used to bring in, either between their legs, or someplace, a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s355">And they got -- they heard of it, the SS men, and they stopped the entire -- all of us, coming in from work, to the camp, and they looked all over and they said, "You will tell us who is bringing in what.</span> <span id="s356">And if you don't, we're going to put you outside, and we are going to pour water over you.</span> <span id="s357">You are going to be on your knees.</span> <span id="s358">And you will freeze to the ground."</span> <span id="s359">Which we did.</span> <span id="s360">We all went out, the way they chased us out.</span> <span id="s361">He had us on our knees.</span> <span id="s362">It was late at night.</span> <span id="s363">It was bitter cold.</span> <span id="s364">It was way below zero.</span> <span id="s365">And they poured pails of water over our bodies.</span> <span id="s366">And we froze to the ground.</span> <span id="s367">We could not lift our legs up.</span> <span id="s368">But none of us told them who brought that piece of bread in.</span> <span id="s369">None of us.</span> <span id="s370">And they saw, the following morning, they got us up, somehow, and they left us alone.</span> <span id="s371">Because they saw they were dealing with something that they feel it isn't important enough yet, to kill them, because we were still going into work.</span> <span id="s372">I jumped my report to you, because that was still when we were going into, every day, to work.</span> <span id="s373">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Was that at the first camp?</span> <span id="s375">A: It wasn't the first.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: It was the one you came to with the boat and the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Right, that was -- that was .</span> <span id="s378">No, it wasn't Latvia.</span> <span id="s379">That was .</span> <span id="s380">And we had -- now one day, I came back from work, and I was picked out to be hung.</span> <span id="s381">And myself, two more girls, and three guys.</span> <span id="s382">Because they thought I brought something into the camp, like food, or something.</span> <span id="s383">And they said, they are going to fool around with us anymore.</span> <span id="s384">You are going to be killed.</span> <span id="s385">You are going to be killed by -- we are going to hang you, right here, and when all the prisoners come in, they are going to see the example, what can happen to you, to any one of you, if you date brig anything into the camp, like a slice of bread, or a raw potato, or a raw beet, that we found in the ground.</span> <span id="s386">So, it was another miracle.</span> <span id="s387">As it happened, my brother walked by, and he saw.</span> <span id="s388">I was standing there.</span> <span id="s389">And he knew I was going to be killed.</span> <span id="s390">But, as luck wanted it, there was an SS man, from Latvia, who came to oversee how they can torture more and take a lesson, the way Germany had their camp.</span> <span id="s391">That Latvian SS man knew who I was, that I was in his camp in Latvia.</span> <span id="s392">And as he walked by, in the Latvian language I asked him to save me, and somehow it worked.</span> <span id="s393">He saved me.</span> <span id="s394">The others were hung.</span> <span id="s395">And he saved me.</span> <span id="s396">He told the other SS men not to kill me.</span> <span id="s397">And it was like God sent somebody to take this person, to live, which was another miracle.</span> <span id="s398">And we were in the death camp.</span> <span id="s399">And they were going to -- they were going to give us a well-known shower, which was -- we didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">They told us they were going to give us a regular shower.</span> <span id="s401">We have not had showers or baths or anything, or toilet paper, or anything.</span> <span id="s402">So, they chased us into a room.</span> <span id="s403">We were totally naked.</span> <span id="s404">They put up a table.</span> <span id="s405">It was like a fashion show table, like a runway.</span> <span id="s406">And we had to walk naked on that table.</span> <span id="s407">And the SS men -- they sat on both sides, and they looked at our bodies, whether we were worthwhile saving, or being gassed.</span> <span id="s408">I had this horrible rash, that I knew I was going to be gassed, because the gas was for -- the rash was from malnutrition and dirt.</span> <span id="s409">Naturally, we were shaved, so therefore, we couldn't have anything in the hair.</span> <span id="s410">And I hid behind my girlfriend, and walked in step into step, so the front of my body wouldn't show how bad it was.</span> <span id="s411">Then came the other miracle.</span> <span id="s412">I was young.</span> <span id="s413">And to the right was the showers.</span> <span id="s414">To the left was to go -- we didn't know where it was going.</span> <span id="s415">But as they -- as we stood there, to put our clothes on again, we heard the screaming of the women, because we didn't know what way they were being killed.</span> <span id="s416">We knew they were screaming because they were being killed.</span> <span id="s417">And that was with the gas.</span> <span id="s418">It came out of shower heads.</span> <span id="s419">Later we saw, when the doors opened, there were ten shower heads, many of them over the ceiling.</span> <span id="s420">And turned on the gas, and by the time they opened the door, and I peeked in, we all peeked in, all of them were dead on the ground.</span> <span id="s421">That was a sight.</span> <span id="s422">That was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s423">That was worse than the ovens, because once those women went in there, they didn't know what was going to hit them, until -- just screaming.</span> <span id="s424">They inhaled the gas.</span> <span id="s425">And I was saved again.</span> <span id="s426">I was alive, still.</span> <span id="s427">When we were shipped to that death camp, like I told you before, we did not know when the end was going to come.</span> <span id="s428">But, we did not lose our hopes.</span> <span id="s429">Because we thought, why isn't President Roosevelt doing something for us?</span> <span id="s430">We thought that President Roosevelt was our savior.</span> <span id="s431">We thought -- we heard that he was going to save us.</span> <span id="s432">Nobody saved us.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">There was no way for anybody to be saved.</span> <span id="s434">And we knew we were going to die, which, at that time, was actually a relief, because we were starved to death.</span> <span id="s435">We had no -- nobody, I didn't know, except for the one brother.</span> <span id="s436">We didn't know if they would come out dead or alive.</span> <span id="s437">But every morning at ten o'clock, planes were coming down, very low.</span> <span id="s438">And always circling around the concentration camp, which I later found out, that was the American Army, taking pictures, exactly.</span> <span id="s439">They knew that was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s440">And they were trying to bomb the city, but to avoid bombing the concentration camps, which actually was the case.</span> <span id="s441">They did not bomb the camp.</span> <span id="s442">One day they chased us out, and they said that we had to go and pick something up.</span> <span id="s443">I think they said it was for food, because we had assigned women who did the food -- picking up the food.</span> <span id="s444">And as we went to pick up the food, we saw on the other side of the gate, that there were some, a pile full of rotten beans, laying there.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">They absolutely devoured it.</span> <span id="s446">We grabbed it.</span> <span id="s447">We ate it.</span> <span id="s448">It was pink.</span> <span id="s449">It tasted like the most wonderful thing in the world, because we were -- we just couldn't exist any longer, from the hunger alone.</span> <span id="s450">It was -- we stayed there for a while, and then we heard that the war is towards the end.</span> <span id="s451">How we got that information, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s452">I don't know how it happened.</span> <span id="s453">Now, the SS women who knew me, they used to entertain the SS men.</span> <span id="s454">And there was no radio.</span> <span id="s455">The city was totally bombed out.</span> <span id="s456">There were no lights, no radio.</span> <span id="s457">They did not have radios like today, with batteries.</span> <span id="s458">So, I entertained the SS men.</span> <span id="s459">They wanted somebody to give them music.</span> <span id="s460">So, they used to get me out of my bunk.</span> <span id="s461">And they used to take me in, and put me behind a curtain, or behind a piece of furniture.</span> <span id="s462">And I used to stand for them, and sing for them, German songs, which was wonderful.</span> <span id="s463">I thought it was the greatest thing, because that would give me more life, which it did.</span> <span id="s464">It actually did.</span> <span id="s465">It actually -- every, like I said -- every time they counted for the others, they always put me aside.</span> <span id="s466">It was very good.</span> <span id="s467">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s468">But they had no mercy.</span> <span id="s469">They knew that in the very end, that regardless of what happens, that we are all going to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: I am going to go back and ask you some questions from the very beginning.</span> <span id="s473">You were very young, but do you remember specifically when the first fight -- when you first knew there was fighting going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Tell me what it was like, or what you remember, specifically.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: I didn't remember it at first.</span> <span id="s477">What was devastating for my parents was that the Russians came in the year before the Germans, to Latvia.</span> <span id="s478">And they immediately took young, strong men, boys, and drafted them, and pushed them into the fighting in the woods, against the Germans.</span> <span id="s479">Because the Germans were already coming, towards Latvia.</span> <span id="s480">They used to Lativia, Lithuania, Poland, for all the killings, because Hitler was under the impression that he was going to end the War.</span> <span id="s481">And when he wins the War he will say, "I never killed any Jews.</span> <span id="s482">The Polacks did, the Latvians did, the Lithuanians did, all the other countries.</span> <span id="s483">I never killed anybody."</span> <span id="s484">That was the first thing that was so horrible for my parents, and my sisters, and my other two brothers, to know that we may ever see them again.</span> <span id="s485">And we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Before the ghetto was formed, you were already taken to go to work; is that right?</span> <span id="s487">A: The first thing was, they took us from our homes, and they put us into a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: That was the first thing.</span> <span id="s489">A: That was the first thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Do you remember when that was, what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: The very beginning of the War.</span> <span id="s492">The War broke out in 1940.</span> <span id="s493">I was liberated in 1945.</span> <span id="s494">1940, '41 or '40.</span> <span id="s495">I don't remember exactly, because when the Germans came in, they made the ghetto right away.</span> <span id="s496">They chased us out of our homes.</span> <span id="s497">We had no belongings.</span> <span id="s498">And that is when I remember we all lived in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: And in the ghetto, horrible things happened, or tell me -- did you know about those things yourself, or were you insulated from knowing, because you were so young, or what did you know, and what did your parents know?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: We didn't know much.</span> <span id="s501">We didn't know what was going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s502">We were just hoping that a miracle was going to happen.</span> <span id="s503">We did not know that they were actually going to kill us.</span> <span id="s504">They are actually going to tear us all apart.</span> <span id="s505">My two brothers were already gone, with the Russians, at the time.</span> <span id="s506">And we were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s507">We did not know anything.</span> <span id="s508">All I know is, when we walked, we walked in the middle of the street, even in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s509">You were not allowed to walk on the sidewalks, because that was too smooth and too good for the Jews.</span> <span id="s510">So we walked in the middle of the street which was many years ago, naturally.</span> <span id="s511">It was paved.</span> <span id="s512">It was big rocks, uneven rocks, that were cemented to the ground.</span> <span id="s513">And one day I didn't see it, but I heard that a German SS man named Mengele came into the ghetto to oversee the ghetto.</span> <span id="s514">And if he didn't like what you looked like, he took out his gun, and killed everyone that walked.</span> <span id="s515">So the walking of the ghetto, from our apartment to a friend, was really eliminated, because we were afraid that they were going to kill us.</span> <span id="s516">So, we stayed in, all the time.</span> <span id="s517">But, morally, I mean we felt, we're together, whatever happens.</span> <span id="s518">We prayed it would happen to all of us, at the same time, at the same place.</span> <span id="s519">But we still didn't believe that it would.</span> <span id="s520">We still didn't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: You didn't believe that you would die.</span> <span id="s522">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: And your parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Did not, did not believe that.</span> <span id="s525">Why would we die?</span> <span id="s526">I mean there was a German Jew that came in 1939 to Latvia.</span> <span id="s527">He met my father and he said, "Do you have any money?"</span> <span id="s528">And my father said, "For what?"</span> <span id="s529">And he said, "Do you have enough money for your family to go to Israel, go to the United States, go anywhere you can, just run away from Latvia, because Hitler is going to come and he is going to kill you.</span> <span id="s530">I came from Germany to Latvia to escape him.</span> <span id="s531">But he is going to come here too."</span> <span id="s532">And my father says, "Don't be ridiculous."</span> <span id="s533">It was just like somebody today would say to me that I live in this country, in the United States, take your family and run.</span> <span id="s534">Run to a country that is not going to kill you.</span> <span id="s535">Why would I do that, if I know that that cannot happen?</span> <span id="s536">We didn't think that it was going to happen.</span> <span id="s537">We did not think that Hitler was going to come to Latvia.</span> <span id="s538">Latvia was an independent country.</span> <span id="s539">Why would they want us?</span> <span id="s540">But he did.</span> <span id="s541">And that is when it all happened.</span> <span id="s542">But there were very few Latvian Jews that made it to Germany, to the camps.</span> <span id="s543">Like I told you, they eliminated them.</span> <span id="s544">They killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Specifically the Latvian Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yeah, and also -- it's a matter of fact -- two of my brothers were married in the Latvian ghetto.</span> <span id="s547">Both of their wives were expecting a baby.</span> <span id="s548">And both of their wives gave birth almost within a week apart.</span> <span id="s549">But when the Germans came into the ghetto, the first thing they did, they went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s550">And what they did there, they made the grownups, the mothers that gave birth, the father was imprisoned, they threw the babies out the window, onto a pile on the ground, and then they threw the mother who gave birth to the child, and whoever was there, into that pile.</span> <span id="s551">And the ones that were still alive, they gave us to shovel them up, they were dead, and threw them into -- like a big dug out grave.</span> <span id="s552">And my brother had to -- saw his wife and his baby in that pile.</span> <span id="s553">And he had to help bury them.</span> <span id="s554">And that was something that was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s555">You cannot believe this.</span> <span id="s556">So, it makes personally I feel in my life, at this moment, and all the way from my day of liberation, I cannot forget it.</span> <span id="s557">I still have nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">And I have had depression ever since.</span> <span id="s559">I live on medication, in order to be happy.</span> <span id="s560">And I am happy.</span> <span id="s561">I am a happy person.</span> <span id="s562">But it is something that you cannot erase.</span> <span id="s563">You just cannot erase.</span> <span id="s564">Like I listen to the television, and I went to see Shindler's List, and Oprah Winfrey was on television, and she said she saw Shindler's List.</span> <span id="s565">And she absolutely swears she has become a different person, from what she saw.</span> <span id="s566">And that was only -- as authentic as he did the story, as beautifully as it was directed and done, it was only about maybe ten percent as painful and the real thing was.</span> <span id="s567">And he noted later in the magazine, and even in the newspaper that it took him ten years to create this movie, so people would accept it, and want to go to it and see it, but not be -- see the real, real horrors.</span> <span id="s568">Because you cannot show the real horrors.</span> <span id="s569">It is impossible.</span> <span id="s570">It is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s571">Why would anybody do things, kill us?</span> <span id="s572">But to torture, the torture that you go through, that repeats on you over.</span> <span id="s573">But I must say -- I will compliment myself.</span> <span id="s574">I did not ever show it to my husband or show it to my children, what my inside was really like, because I wanted my children to be happy, and they are.</span> <span id="s575">And I wanted my husband to be happy, and he is.</span> <span id="s576">As far as I am concerned, I am happy.</span> <span id="s577">But I cannot wipe it out.</span> <span id="s578">And it's already 47, 48 years, I think, 50, right?</span> <span id="s579">You can't wipe it out.</span> <span id="s580">It is impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">It's not something you can just close the door and say, "Well, so what?"</span> <span id="s582">I never talk about it.</span> <span id="s583">I never talk about it.</span> <span id="s584">I don't like to talk about it.</span> <span id="s585">I don't need anybody's sympathy.</span> <span id="s586">And in the beginning, when I told some Americans, a little bit of it, because they questioned me.</span> <span id="s587">"Yes," they said.</span> <span id="s588">"The War was horrible.</span> <span id="s589">We also couldn't get any nylon stockings in this country."</span> <span id="s590">So I figured I never talk about it.</span> <span id="s591">My friends know very little.</span> <span id="s592">And my children don't know that much either.</span> <span id="s593">But my son got very interested in it.</span> <span id="s594">And when he heard that President Carter was going to make it possible to have a Museum, even before that, they were building a committee who would help the Holocaust -- explain to the world the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s595">He wrote a letter and he -- they actually wrote back to him and said you filled every deed of your knowledge, but unfortunately we need more influential people.</span> <span id="s596">Which meant, they need people with money, to build the Holocaust Museum, and to support it.</span> <span id="s597">then one day he got a -- on his machine, Mr. Steven Ludsin (ph.), this is the White House calling.</span> <span id="s598">We want you to appear at so and so time.</span> <span id="s599">We want to speak to you.</span> <span id="s600">Because they had already chosen all the people.</span> <span id="s601">But he was the child of a survivor.</span> <span id="s602">And he got very, very, very interested in it.</span> <span id="s603">And I still didn't tell him all.</span> <span id="s604">If they ever heard this interview there are a lot of things that would be very strange to them.</span> <span id="s605">Because I do not -- I don't want them to have nightmares about it.</span> <span id="s606">I only hope and pray -- I only hope and pray that the only reason I wanted to do this, was for my grandchildren, of which I have three of them, by my daughter, and for their children, and for their children's children.</span> <span id="s607">For the world to know, and people that say the Holocaust never existed -- for these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Let me ask you a couple of other questions.</span> <span id="s609">The trip from the ghetto -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: The deportation from the ghetto -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: First by boat, and then by train --</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Tell me how long the trip was.</span> <span id="s613">And tell me about the deportation itself, what you remember, and what season was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: It must have been fall, because it was raining.</span> <span id="s615">The trip on that big shipping boat, which must have held at least 1,000 prisoners was a very long time.</span> <span id="s616">I can't remember whether it was a day and a night, or two days and one night.</span> <span id="s617">I can't.</span> <span id="s618">I really can't, because a lot of things I like to choke out.</span> <span id="s619">From that boat, when they put us in the train, I think we left the day before.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">And we arrived in a very rainy, late night.</span> <span id="s621">That is why the SS women wore those capes and the hoods, because it was raining.</span> <span id="s622">And they were chasing us off that train, and bringing us to that real big concentration camp, which was , .</span> <span id="s623">It was .</span> <span id="s624">was in Latvia.</span> <span id="s625">And like I said before, when we arrived there, the outside was so immaculate, the grass and the barracks.</span> <span id="s626">It looked like -- gee, maybe it is going to be better.</span> <span id="s627">But once we got in there, it was a nightmare.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: In the ghetto, were you already starting to starve; tell me what the ghetto life was like.</span> <span id="s629">Were you hungry all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: The ghetto life was not too bad, because it was the very, very beginning, when the German's came in.</span> <span id="s631">Now Latvia itself was a very beautiful city, very beautiful country.</span> <span id="s632">We had beautiful vegetables.</span> <span id="s633">We had beautiful food.</span> <span id="s634">Everybody was employed.</span> <span id="s635">Everybody lived nicely.</span> <span id="s636">And when we were in the ghetto, we did not have much, because we were taken away our homes.</span> <span id="s637">And we had no clothes to change.</span> <span id="s638">Whatever we could grab in a little bag, that's what was ours.</span> <span id="s639">And once we got into the ghetto, we didn't know what was happening.</span> <span id="s640">We only said, please God, let us only be left together.</span> <span id="s641">We did not care what we left behind.</span> <span id="s642">Material things don't mean anything anymore.</span> <span id="s643">If you fight for life, and the ghetto life was not -- it horrible, but it wasn't -- because we didn't believe it was going to get any worse.</span> <span id="s644">We felt, oh, this is going to be our punishment.</span> <span id="s645">And after that, the War will be over, and we will be saved.</span> <span id="s646">And once we are saved, like -- we are young enough to build a life again.</span> <span id="s647">And my parents were too, because my mother, like I said, was 49, and my father was 50.</span> <span id="s648">They worked -- my father worked, he took care of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: About how long before -- were you in the ghetto before you were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: I think the whole ghetto thing was very short, well, maybe six months.</span> <span id="s651">Because they needed the ghetto to bring the other trains from the other countries, to eliminate the Jews from Germany.</span> <span id="s652">And they didn't want to do their killing in Germany.</span> <span id="s653">So, then we walked from the ghetto to these concentrated places, to serve them jobs like I told you where we lived, all day long there, they took a big apartment building and from the bottom to the very top, which was the six or seven stories high, was --one was the place where they made the boots for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s654">One was a place where they made fur jackets for the Nazis' girlfriends.</span> <span id="s655">One was a place where they made dresses for the Nazis' wives and girlfriends.</span> <span id="s656">And on top was one where they were making shoes, ladies' shoes.</span> <span id="s657">And anyone who had a trade was lucky, because they were used.</span> <span id="s658">But luckily, like I told you, when you are young enough, and you have a lot of guts, which I did, I told them I could sew.</span> <span id="s659">And I did.</span> <span id="s660">I did know how to sew, because when I was in school, they taught us how to sew, like they do here, too, I understand, in the United States.</span> <span id="s661">But you are under pressure, of the necessity.</span> <span id="s662">You are the best -- it is the best teacher.</span> <span id="s663">You learn an awful lot, even things you don't know how to do, you learn how to do it.</span> <span id="s664">You have to.</span> <span id="s665">And it was a big help.</span> <span id="s666">And then they couldn't keep us in Latvia anymore.</span> <span id="s667">We had to go to Germany, to the camps, which was not really Germany, because if it was or , , or .</span> <span id="s668">And there's Dachau.</span> <span id="s669">They were all on the outskirts of Germany, because, like I said, when the War would have been over, and Hitler would have won, he would have said he did not kill the Jews.</span> <span id="s670">So, that's what it's all about.</span> <span id="s671">That's why when I went yesterday to the Museum, it was very, very emotional.</span> <span id="s672">But by the same token, I was very, very thrilled to see young kids, because school is out.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: When you were still in the ghetto, and there were actions -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: That were outside the ghetto, did you hear those; did you know they were going on?</span> <span id="s675">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Tell me what you saw, or what you heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: What it was, it was actually -- they used to take a gaggle of people, in the middle of the street, and they just were shooting them, and making the ghetto more available for the next shipments.</span> <span id="s678">So, I saw it.</span> <span id="s679">And I heard it.</span> <span id="s680">What I didn't see, I heard about it.</span> <span id="s681">And if I listened, I heard the screams.</span> <span id="s682">So, you are always -- and you still didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s683">You still didn't think -- you were very fearful.</span> <span id="s684">You were very careful, not to expose yourself.</span> <span id="s685">But, how can you not hear?</span> <span id="s686">How can you not see?</span> <span id="s687">If one was saved, if one person was -- they didn't shoot, and he survived, he told it to us, what they did.</span> <span id="s688">And there was not people who were any different than you and I.</span> <span id="s689">It was just that they happened to be picked out, taken in the middle of the street, and just shooting them.</span> <span id="s690">And that was their biggest pleasure.</span> <span id="s691">They did it with so much, with so much -- they were actually happy about it.</span> <span id="s692">They were -- when I saw Sophie's choice, I realized how great the movie was made, because they did it with a lot of love, although they tell you today that they were assigned to do the job, and they followed instructions.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">They enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s694">They loved it.</span> <span id="s695">They Latvians loved it.</span> <span id="s696">And the Germans loved it.</span> <span id="s697">They did it with a lot of pleasure.</span> <span id="s698">And they were not, as far as I'm concerned, I could not believe the German people could do such a thing, because they were very cultured people, very intelligent people, very clean people, to become such murderers.</span> <span id="s699">And the Hitler Youth, little boys, 13 years old, 14 years old, they were just as poisoned as a 40 year old.</span> <span id="s700">They took their guns and they were shooting.</span> <span id="s701">So, as long as you were Jewish -- they got any kind of a Jew, even if you were a quarter of a Jew, and eighth of a Jew, they killed you.</span> <span id="s702">It was something that is indescribable.</span> <span id="s703">You can't really -- to this day, I can't believe it.</span> <span id="s704">It's unbelievable, that people can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: When you were in the camps, later on, did you end up forming any close friendships with other prisoners, that are -- where you sort of were like sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Tell me about some of those, or tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: I had one girlfriend in particular.</span> <span id="s709">She was from -- she was from Germany.</span> <span id="s710">And luckily we were always -- we became friends.</span> <span id="s711">Luckily we were always shipped to the same place at the same time.</span> <span id="s712">And we were even choosing our -- in the barracks when we came in, we chose the upper level of the bunks, because it had a little light there.</span> <span id="s713">And we also had no control over our bodies.</span> <span id="s714">We were so weak, that some of the elderly people, the elderly women used to urinate and it just came down onto us, so we made up, we were going up to the top.</span> <span id="s715">So nobody would do anything on top of us.</span> <span id="s716">But we befriended each other.</span> <span id="s717">And we still keep in touch, and she did not know that I survived.</span> <span id="s718">And I did not know that she survived.</span> <span id="s719">And the overall, the woman all were very civil to each other.</span> <span id="s720">The only time we became animals was when our piece of bread was given to us.</span> <span id="s721">Then we became animals.</span> <span id="s722">But otherwise, we had actually -- did not approach each other by name, as much, because there were lots of them that were from different countries.</span> <span id="s723">And you have to shift for yourself.</span> <span id="s724">Whatever you did, you had to shift for yourself.</span> <span id="s725">But I made friends.</span> <span id="s726">I made friends.</span> <span id="s727">And I have some of them, to this day.</span> <span id="s728">That I speak to my girlfriend, who landed in Mexico City.</span> <span id="s729">And I speak to her.</span> <span id="s730">We keep in touch with each other.</span> <span id="s731">And we even arranged to go away together, on vacation, so we would be without husbands, and be by ourselves.</span> <span id="s732">That was very important, to have somebody left, who has been through the same as you did.</span> <span id="s733">Because that person is the most compassionate person to you, and me to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: And when you were there, was that friendship -- did that friendship help you get through, from one day to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s736">In a way, yes.</span> <span id="s737">We always hung on together for the coping, because they watched us constantly, as though we could go someplace.</span> <span id="s738">And they also -- the day we walked in the showers, she was not as badly infected as I was, with the body rash, and she was walking step into step, and covering my -- the front of my body, so the SS men would not put me in the shower.</span> <span id="s739">For whatever, we knew it was for death.</span> <span id="s740">We knew it wasn't for anything but death.</span> <span id="s741">By her covering me, I think it saved me.</span> <span id="s742">So, we went to the left, she went to the left, and the others went to the right, which was to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: There was some sort of an incident when you were selected, and you escaped by hiding, by crawling into a gutter.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Well, that was very interesting.</span> <span id="s747">We had heard that the American Army -- they are at the border.</span> <span id="s748">And we had all the time planes flying.</span> <span id="s749">They were flying.</span> <span id="s750">And if they were giving one or two it meant that everybody had to turn their lights off in that city, the people who lived there, because they did not want to be killed by the bombs of the Americans, or whoever came across.</span> <span id="s751">I personally feel that if the War would have lasted another 10 days, we all would have been dead, because it was the end of the line, as far as the hunger, and the sickness.</span> <span id="s752">So, now we hear a five alarm.</span> <span id="s753">And with that five alarm the gates opened up, and the SS women and the SS men ran away from the camp.</span> <span id="s754">So, we ran.</span> <span id="s755">But immediately after that -- a little while after that, and the gates are open, and we went into the city.</span> <span id="s756">And that city was very bombed out.</span> <span id="s757">And we knew that the Americans were not there yet.</span> <span id="s758">So we found a place where it was flat to the ground, the building was bombed out, the apartment buildings were bombed out.</span> <span id="s759">And we opened up a little opening there, a little rock or two rocks, and we crawled into the basement of that bombed out building and we were about nine or twelve of us.</span> <span id="s760">Once we got in there, now there was a question.</span> <span id="s761">What are we going to do about eating, if it lasts another few days, before the Americans come in?</span> <span id="s762">The first thing I did -- we did, is as we were crawling in there we saw about -- I don't know how many feet away it was, one building -- a little building remained, and it was not bombed out.</span> <span id="s763">And it was a cleaning store.</span> <span id="s764">So, my brothers broke the window down, and the other guys, and got the clothing from the cleaning store, and we eliminated our striped clothes, and put on the clothes that didn't fit.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">But it did not matter.</span> <span id="s766">And we waited.</span> <span id="s767">And while we were in that basement, we had heard that the Americans were already in that city, so we took up the guys to walk out, and walk in the street.</span> <span id="s768">And as we walked in the street, American soldiers came to us.</span> <span id="s769">And they saw that we were shaved, and the men wore -- they called it , which was skinny bodies, skinny arms, and fat legs from hunger.</span> <span id="s770">And one was a German Jew, who was an officer in the American Army, and he said to us, what language do you speak, in German?</span> <span id="s771">Naturally, we all jumped on him, because we all spoke German.</span> <span id="s772">And he immediately organized for the soldiers to go back to their place, where they were staying.</span> <span id="s773">And within half and hour or so, they brought us all their rations, of their food, a toothbrush, I asked for.</span> <span id="s774">I hadn't brushed my teeth for years.</span> <span id="s775">And he brought us a bar of chocolate, to us was -- it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s776">I mean he did not eat -- now I know it was a big Hershey bar.</span> <span id="s777">And you know how it is cut?</span> <span id="s778">We ate little crumbs of it, so it would last longer.</span> <span id="s779">And -- before we walked out, the German found out that there were Jews hiding in that basement.</span> <span id="s780">Now we hear them.</span> <span id="s781">And how can we hide from them?</span> <span id="s782">So, it was like a little cubby, with steps originally going up, and underneath is always a little cubby.</span> <span id="s783">And we all crawled into that cubby.</span> <span id="s784">And we did not breathe.</span> <span id="s785">So the did not hear us.</span> <span id="s786">And they said in German, "We knew there are Jews here, but where are they?"</span> <span id="s787">And they walked out, luckily.</span> <span id="s788">And when we walked out, we met the American soldiers.</span> <span id="s789">Now, the rest of our group found out that the camp is empty, but there is some food, some food.</span> <span id="s790">So they went back there to get the food.</span> <span id="s791">And they were caught, because the Nazis came back.</span> <span id="s792">It was not quite over.</span> <span id="s793">And I told my brothers, we are not going back.</span> <span id="s794">We are staying right here.</span> <span id="s795">And we did.</span> <span id="s796">And I think in the last minute they killed a few people who we were with, because they thought the war was still not over.</span> <span id="s797">That particular city was not liberated for them, yet.</span> <span id="s798">So, we decided to stay there, and we'll wait.</span> <span id="s799">And we'll be walked out.</span> <span id="s800">And then one -- I don't know where I got my brains, but I decided that we cannot eat a lot, because that would kill us.</span> <span id="s801">It killed quite a few of my friends, that I was with, because we were so undernourished, our stomach was so -- could not conceive or accept that much food.</span> <span id="s802">And I did it for my brothers, as well.</span> <span id="s803">And thank God that he did it, because a lot of them overate.</span> <span id="s804">They ate too much.</span> <span id="s805">There was nothing much to be had, but people ate potatoes, which was like cake.</span> <span id="s806">And from then on in, they stayed there, when we were liberated and we tried to find the place where to live.</span> <span id="s807">And start to work for papers, to go someplace.</span> <span id="s808">Because we didn't want to remain in Germany.</span> <span id="s809">The memories were horrible.</span> <span id="s810">The streets were bloody.</span> <span id="s811">There was no need to stay there.</span> <span id="s812">So, we arranged it.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Do you -- did you know of any incidents with Partisens; did you ever hear any rumors of -- A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: What about an underground in the camps; was there ever any talk about trying to make -- A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: In Poland they did a Resistance.</span> <span id="s817">But they did not succeed.</span> <span id="s818">You cannot resist, when you are naked.</span> <span id="s819">Do you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s820">It's like taking a person, and undressing the person and saying, "Fight for your life."</span> <span id="s821">With what?</span> <span id="s822">There was nothing, never.</span> <span id="s823">We never had anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: In the camps, do you think it was easier for women, than men?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: That's a good question.</span> <span id="s826">No.</span> <span id="s827">It was only easier if you were young enough.</span> <span id="s828">Because they eliminated anything under 13, and over 30 were killed.</span> <span id="s829">Okay?</span> <span id="s830">I shall also never forget, in Latvia, at the Latvian concentration camp, a few of the mothers had their children.</span> <span id="s831">They were like ten years old, nine years old, five years old.</span> <span id="s832">And then they came one day and said, "We are going to take your children.</span> <span id="s833">We are going to take them to a beautiful place where they are going to be given more things than you have.</span> <span id="s834">So we are going to put them on a truck.</span> <span id="s835">And we are going to ship them over to that place."</span> <span id="s836">And the mothers, and we all knew it was for death.</span> <span id="s837">Now, these mothers -- I had a friend that I knew through the camps, she had a child.</span> <span id="s838">They actually hung onto those trucks -- it was an open truck.</span> <span id="s839">They piled them up, standing up.</span> <span id="s840">They were hanging on, to whatever they could hang on.</span> <span id="s841">And they were dragged along, until they had no more strength, and their arms couldn't hold them up, and they fell on the ground, because they knew their children were going to death.</span> <span id="s842">And these children were crying, screaming for their parents, crying for their mothers.</span> <span id="s843">"Mama, mama, please, save me."</span> <span id="s844">You know, it was -- it was -- it was just horrible.</span> <span id="s845">And they were eliminated.</span> <span id="s846">And they eliminated.</span> <span id="s847">They kept on eliminating, over 30 of them.</span> <span id="s848">They had one young boy who went through the whole thing with us, and we all saved him.</span> <span id="s849">When they counted us, we shoved him -- he was little, we shoved him between us, we covered him with our upper parts of our jackets.</span> <span id="s850">And then, when we had to go anywhere, the mother of this child somehow or other, she sewed up -- you know our bunks -- we had a straw covered with burlap.</span> <span id="s851">That was our mattress.</span> <span id="s852">And we helped her take that burlap and sew it up, and she covered him, and pretended it was like sugar, or flour, or whatever.</span> <span id="s853">And it was her child.</span> <span id="s854">He was the only child that we saved.</span> <span id="s855">He is still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: How long was he hidden there, with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: He was hidden with us.</span> <span id="s858">He was like a big, big thing.</span> <span id="s859">Because they escaped taking him, plain as day.</span> <span id="s860">When they took the children away, somehow or other, they didn't get him.</span> <span id="s861">When all these kids were shipped away, and they were all killed, and he was the only child, we found later on, was living.</span> <span id="s862">And we weren't going to let him die.</span> <span id="s863">So, we all fought for his life, and he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Did you hide him during the day, when you guys went off to work; or was this when you weren't going to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: We were going to work.</span> <span id="s866">We were hiding him.</span> <span id="s867">Somehow or other, he was hiding under the last -- the -- in the bunk, you know.</span> <span id="s868">So we were hiding him there, and wherever -- wherever we could.</span> <span id="s869">There's a lot to say about people who go through horrors, how your mind works, how you really can do -- like the day when they were sending all -- there was another incident when they were sending everybody somewhere.</span> <span id="s870">And they were counting everybody.</span> <span id="s871">And there was a drain, where the water runs down?</span> <span id="s872">And I left myself -- I put myself into that.</span> <span id="s873">I lifted that.</span> <span id="s874">I don't even know how I was able to lift up that iron drain.</span> <span id="s875">And I put myself, my body, into it.</span> <span id="s876">And I held on to the -- to those iron things, and I saved myself.</span> <span id="s877">Because, your mind is -- it's the animal instinct, I think.</span> <span id="s878">If you want to live, that you can use so much imagination, to really save yourself.</span> <span id="s879">There are so many things -- I mean there were so many things happening.</span> <span id="s880">There was a man -- the oldest one in the camp, of the men's camp.</span> <span id="s881">And he was -- also he played, he was a musician.</span> <span id="s882">I think he was a cellist, too.</span> <span id="s883">And they beat the hell out of him, the Jewish guy, the one that wore the thing on his arm.</span> <span id="s884">He couldn't get off his bunk, to go to be counted, because he was so sick.</span> <span id="s885">He was only 50 years old, and he was the oldest.</span> <span id="s886">So, he Absolutely -- they beat him, with that black police stick.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">And he crawled out to be counted, because if you wouldn't -- because if the number would be off, then we would be killed, at least 10 of us, for one person.</span> <span id="s888">How -- you couldn't escape, but they would say, where is he?</span> <span id="s889">You know.</span> <span id="s890">So, the men dragged him out.</span> <span id="s891">We weren't counted together.</span> <span id="s892">The men's camp were counted.</span> <span id="s893">To say it was easier for a woman than for a man, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s894">I don't really know.</span> <span id="s895">I think it was equally as hard, because -- very, very -- it is actually up to the individual.</span> <span id="s896">In the first place, where we were working in Latvia, before the camps were made, there was a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s897">He was my age.</span> <span id="s898">And he turned out -- he is still alive.</span> <span id="s899">He is a violinist.</span> <span id="s900">He plays every instrument.</span> <span id="s901">And he was little enough, and I was little enough and they used to give us great food there.</span> <span id="s902">It was farina.</span> <span id="s903">And farina was cooked for 250 people, in one big kettle.</span> <span id="s904">It was about seven feet tall.</span> <span id="s905">So in order to clean that, you have to get inside.</span> <span id="s906">So, my main friend, at that time we were not being together, but we still had a little contact in this place where we worked.</span> <span id="s907">So, he used to clean the inside of the pot, and I used to clean the outside of the pot, okay?</span> <span id="s908">And it was in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s909">And we had an , what they called .</span> <span id="s910">He was the main -- the manager of the entire thing, the SS man.</span> <span id="s911">He was more than an ordinary SS man.</span> <span id="s912">He had a higher rank.</span> <span id="s913">He was the main man.</span> <span id="s914">And all of a sudden, we hear screams.</span> <span id="s915">And he brings in this guy, puts him in the middle of the kitchen, and shoots him, kills him.</span> <span id="s916">That was so strange to us, because that was the first place that we were working at, and going back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s917">And we couldn't ask him, why did you kill him?</span> <span id="s918">He felt like it.</span> <span id="s919">He found him and he wasn't working at that moment, so he took him to the kitchen and he killed him.</span> <span id="s920">And that was for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s921">And he was nice.</span> <span id="s922">He was a nice SS man.</span> <span id="s923">He wasn't so bad, because he had -- and you want to hear the best?</span> <span id="s924">When the War was over, he said, when the Americans liberated us, he said he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s925">And you know what?</span> <span id="s926">He lived for a while.</span> <span id="s927">He lived.</span> <span id="s928">And when they asked him how could you be Jewish?</span> <span id="s929">He didn't look like a German, he had dark hair.</span> <span id="s930">He put on the striped clothes, and he said, "I'm Jewish."</span> <span id="s931">He says.</span> <span id="s932">So the American says, "What was going on in the camps?"</span> <span id="s933">So, naturally he could describe everything that was going on, because he was part of it.</span> <span id="s934">And the American Army was lenient.</span> <span id="s935">We knocked our brains to find the Nazis, after we were liberated, and when the fellows brought them -- they found them and brought them to the American Embassy, and expected for them to be killed, they wouldn't kill them.</span> <span id="s936">The Americans didn't kill them.</span> <span id="s937">Because now I know why.</span> <span id="s938">They have to have enough proof, to know whether or not he was really a capo or an SS man.</span> <span id="s939">So, that's -- there are so many episodes, that we would -- if we sat now, for another eight hours, I could tell you, but I do try to choke it out.</span> <span id="s940">I try very hard.</span> <span id="s941">And I hope I will be able, but as I get older, I find it more difficult, to be very honest.</span> <span id="s942">And the biggest pleasure, for me, is to speak to you right now, and to be able to come to Washington, and to see the Holocaust Memorial.</span> <span id="s943">Because that is absolutely the greatest thing I have seen.</span> <span id="s944">The man who designed it, the architect, the people who had the pictures, who saved it, who found it, or what they did, is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s945">The shoes, the original things that are in that museum.</span> <span id="s946">I am so angry at myself, that to save myself, that I took off my striped clothes, and I threw it away.</span> <span id="s947">And I put something on, so I wouldn't be recognized as a prisoner.</span> <span id="s948">And I put the kerchief on my head.</span> <span id="s949">I am sorry I don't have that jacket.</span> <span id="s950">But my brother saved it.</span> <span id="s951">And he gave it to the museum in Florida.</span> <span id="s952">That is where he lives.</span> <span id="s953">And he has his number on it.</span> <span id="s954">And it is his jacket.</span> <span id="s955">And it is written in that museum, that that belonged to the prisoner so and so, and so and so.</span> <span id="s956">I think that is very gratifying.</span> <span id="s957">I think that is -- that trip that I just took will definitely be very well remembered.</span> <span id="s958">But I hope that for many, many years that everybody should know about it.</span> <span id="s959">That is my input, to do that.</span> <span id="s960">Because I am not -- I am hurting myself.</span> <span id="s961">But I am not that selfish.</span> <span id="s962">Somebody said to me, "Did you go to see Shindler's List?"</span> <span id="s963">I said, "Of course.</span> <span id="s964">Why not?"</span> <span id="s965">"How could you do that?</span> <span id="s966">How can you go and see it?"</span> <span id="s967">I said, "Did you?"</span> <span id="s968">She says, "Not yet, because I don't like to see sad things."</span> <span id="s969">I said, "How can you be so selfish.</span> <span id="s970">It isn't that sad, to begin with.</span> <span id="s971">And how can you ignore something of history?</span> <span id="s972">The world should know and you don't want to see it?"</span> <span id="s973">And they went.</span> <span id="s974">And they all went.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Sonja, tell me about some of the songs that you sang.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: We had several songs that - first of all, these songs were made up by some talented that we were with, at the camps.</span> <span id="s977">So, the one in particular that I remember, and I often sing it, is , which means do not say, ever, that you walked the last walk, which gave us courage, gave us hopes.</span> <span id="s978">And singing together many times, as bad as things were, we were happy.</span> <span id="s979">We were happy to be able to make each other happy, by singing.</span> <span id="s980">And those songs were very good for us, because we went, like I told you to the UJA meetings, that they had people who, for an evening, for dinner, and then our songs.</span> <span id="s981">After we were finished singing those songs, they were very willing to give money to the United Jewish Appeal, because they knew and they saw the proof, what was -- how it happened, how we came to this country, since they paid for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: When you were in the camps, did both you and your brother sing, did your brothers also sing?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Did you sing together?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: No.</span> <span id="s986">We were never together, never.</span> <span id="s987">We were only together by liberation.</span> <span id="s988">Q: When you sang behind the curtain, for the Germans --</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: What kind of songs did you sing then?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: I sang modern German songs, cheerful songs that they wanted to hear.</span> <span id="s992">And that was part of their pleasure.</span> <span id="s993">What was going on behind the curtain from -- I mean that was hiding me, I never looked, because I wasn't interested.</span> <span id="s994">I wasn't supposed to.</span> <span id="s995">And I never did.</span> <span id="s996">But I know that is the way they entertained the SS men.</span> <span id="s997">And I want you to know one more thing, how sick these women were, these SS women were.</span> <span id="s998">That when we were running out to run away, we had to pass their quarters, where they were situated.</span> <span id="s999">And quickly, very quickly we ran through it.</span> <span id="s1000">There were some photographs and we grabbed it and we ran with it.</span> <span id="s1001">And they always had dogs.</span> <span id="s1002">They always -- every SS man had a dog.</span> <span id="s1003">Every SS woman had a dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">When they walked through the camps, into the barracks, they always had a dog, because -- I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1005">They did.</span> <span id="s1006">Then we saw pictures that they actually photographed their sexual satisfaction with a dog.</span> <span id="s1007">That is how sick they were, which was not too clear to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">But later on it was explained to me.</span> <span id="s1009">And I also remember one more thing.</span> <span id="s1010">My husband and I went to Europe.</span> <span id="s1011">And we went to visit friends, relatives, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1012">And our trip was scheduled with a stop in .</span> <span id="s1013">But somehow or other we had to land in , either to refuel or I don't know what.</span> <span id="s1014">But they didn't want to keep us on the plane.</span> <span id="s1015">And they wanted us to get off the plane, and then come back.</span> <span id="s1016">And then they will fly us where were supposed to fly.</span> <span id="s1017">And I looked out of the little window of the plane and I saw a black raincoat, belted, black, long, with a big German Shephard.</span> <span id="s1018">And it was a policeman, a German policeman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">And I actually lost my -- I felt like I was going through an emotional horror, because they looked exactly, exactly like the Nazis did, during the War.</span> <span id="s1020">And I said to my husband, "I am not getting off."</span> <span id="s1021">And he said, "Why not?"</span> <span id="s1022">And I said, "I am afraid."</span> <span id="s1023">He said, "What are you afraid of?"</span> <span id="s1024">I said, "Take a look at them.</span> <span id="s1025">They look the same, just like the murderers."</span> <span id="s1026">And they did.</span> <span id="s1027">So, the fact remains that it is not easy to go through life, to have experienced what we experienced.</span> <span id="s1028">And I am grateful, for myself, as well as for all the other survivors, that some of us survived to tell the story.</span> <span id="s1029">To me, this is the biggest, the best thing that could have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: We have just a couple of minutes.</span> <span id="s1031">Now, did you also sing in the barracks, you and the other prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1033">That is what happened.</span> <span id="s1034">That's how the SS woman knew that I did, because I sang, we sang together, we sang apart.</span> <span id="s1035">We taught each other songs.</span> <span id="s1036">We put songs together.</span> <span id="s1037">We had to do that.</span> <span id="s1038">We did it and that is how the SS woman knew that I could sing.</span> <span id="s1039">She had no other knowledge.</span> <span id="s1040">And that is when she started to send for me, to come to that place where she was living, that part of the camp, to entertain her gentlemen, the SS men.</span> <span id="s1041">They were sick.</span> <span id="s1042">They were very sick.</span> <span id="s1043">But unfortunately I heard that some of the SS women pulled the same thing.</span> <span id="s1044">They said that they were Jews.</span> <span id="s1045">And they came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1046">Because they know everything that went on, in the camps.</span> <span id="s1047">And they had no -- there was no proof.</span> <span id="s1048">How can you prove you are not?</span> <span id="s1049">I mean a German girl -- the SS women looked like we did.</span> <span id="s1050">They were dark.</span> <span id="s1051">They were light.</span> <span id="s1052">They were blonde.</span> <span id="s1053">There was no stamp on them, I am German.</span> <span id="s1054">And you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1055">They looked the same.</span> <span id="s1056">As far as I'm concerned.</span> <span id="s1057">And as far as anyone is concerned.</span> <span id="s1058">They look the same.</span> <span id="s1059">That is why I can never tell apart, to this day, whether this person is Jewish or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1060">It really doesn't matter to me.</span> <span id="s1061">It has no meaning to me.</span> <span id="s1062">I have very, very good friends who are not Jewish, and I cherish them, and I respect them, and I love them.</span> <span id="s1063">So, during the War, before the War broke out, we had very dear friends who were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1064">And they used to see us walking in the middle of the street, like horses.</span> <span id="s1065">And they couldn't even look at us.</span> <span id="s1066">They were afraid to look at us.</span> <span id="s1067">They didn't want to let on that they knew us, because it could have been hard too, you know.</span> <span id="s1068">Knowing a Jew was a criminal thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1071">I appreciate it.</span> <span id="s1072">Q: I appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of
