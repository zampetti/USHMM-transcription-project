I’m sorry, I just wanted to clarify a few points.</span> <span id="s52">How you said that you were with your mother.</span> <span id="s53">At this point you said that you and your mother decided to go to a small town inn Austria?</span> <span id="s54">Where was your father at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: O.K. My father, when I was 13 years old he divorced.</span> <span id="s56">I was with my mother then in _______, Austria.</span> <span id="s57">In _________, Austria.</span> <span id="s58">I opened me a little shop in linoleum, and every Wednesday they had a market there in the city, so anytime, if the business wasn’t good I took the linoleum and put it on the market for sale.</span> <span id="s59">Which was very good because.</span> <span id="s60">So anyhow that went on.</span> <span id="s61">Actually until Hitler came, let’s have it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: The town was a town of 6,000 people and there was one Jewish lady there who had a business of ski equipment and I was the second Jew.</span> <span id="s64">There were no Jews in that town.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: You were the only Jews, you, your mother and that woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s67">Actually, I had a lot of friends there, which I still have.</span> <span id="s68">So that went on, like I said, when Hitler came into power.</span> <span id="s69">I had to give up the business, I had a car, I couldn’t drive anymore.</span> <span id="s70">I had to put my license back.</span> <span id="s71">So that was the end in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: That was in 1938 when the Germans annexed Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: How was the business, was it a good business for you, the linoleum, in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: It was very good.</span> <span id="s76">The business was very good but so what actually happened in 1938 when Hitler came one day in April, a gendarme came to my house and said ---I was actually been a landlady.</span> <span id="s77">I rented the place and she came there and they asked for me and she said, John, I know him.</span> <span id="s78">He was not a friend.</span> <span id="s79">I know that gentile.</span> <span id="s80">In a town like that you know everybody.</span> <span id="s81">So he asked me first, he said; my name was Hans actually, you know.</span> <span id="s82">So he said I come for you I have to arrest you.</span> <span id="s83">I said why?</span> <span id="s84">He said are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s85">I said yes.</span> <span id="s86">Can you tell me that you are not Jewish?</span> <span id="s87">I cannot tell you that I said.</span> <span id="s88">So he said, O.K. I have to arrest you, we’re going to go to the railroad station and I am not going to put a handcuff on you.</span> <span id="s89">I have to take you to Linz, in Austria.</span> <span id="s90">So, that’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s91">We went to the railroad station, came to Linz and in Linz he put on the handcuffs and he had actually the order from the Gestapo, So we went to the jail there, this was a normal procedure at that time they put all the Jews in that place and we just waited for several days.</span> <span id="s92">Then they told us it would be better if you Jews would get ready in the morning, he said, we’re going to go to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s93">O.K. so all the Jewish people that were there, we’re lining up, we went outside, we went to the station, we waited a long time until the train came in, then when the train came in, all the SS came out from the train there to the station.</span> <span id="s94">They put a line so we cannot escape, we had to go through that line to the cars.</span> <span id="s95">What happened then, we had to, the first time I see somebody was going there, the SS trooper the rifles upside down tried to hit anybody who was walking there .</span> <span id="s96">so that was already a little punishment.</span> <span id="s97">Well, when I saw that I run right through that thing, they couldn’t hit me at all.</span> <span id="s98">So anyhow, we went in the cars, the trash, and all the windows were blocked, you couldn’t see where you were going, it was dark outside.</span> <span id="s99">They put the lights in the compartments.</span> <span id="s100">About 10 people in each compartment and they put on the light and they put the light extra strong on.</span> <span id="s101">I don’t know how they did it.</span> <span id="s102">Anyhow, they said everybody has to look up in the light.</span> <span id="s103">Don’t put your hat on.</span> <span id="s104">If you put your hat on you get something coming.</span> <span id="s105">So everybody was looking, some people just couldn’t keep their head up in the light.</span> <span id="s106">You almost get blind when you were looking.</span> <span id="s107">You had to keep the eyes open.</span> <span id="s108">If you close the eyes they hit you, you know.</span> <span id="s109">So you couldn’t do that so you have to look up there.</span> <span id="s110">Anyhow, after about two hours they quit that business, but we couldn’t go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s111">Some people had, we were driving the next day in the morning, some people had to go to the restroom, but there was no restroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: So you were on the train overnight and then into the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s114">So we were staying in that car and some people had to make their business right where they were sitting, they just couldn’t hold it up.</span> <span id="s115">So then in the morning after about nine, ten o’clock, it was in the morning we find out we came to ________ and that time, I never was there before, and so they took us out there and put us in cattle cars.</span> <span id="s116">They put us in cattle cars and made it real crowded in there so there was no place to move around.</span> <span id="s117">Either they want to save the cars, not have too many cars.</span> <span id="s118">Whatever it was, it was a cruelty thing.</span> <span id="s119">We still couldn’t go to the bathroom, some people had to clear out one corner in the cattle cars and we let them all go in that one corner and after then we stopped at a station.</span> <span id="s120">The station which we didn’t know the station, I don’t think so, somebody knows ,we didn’t know at that time where we was.</span> <span id="s121">We went out of the station, we were allowed in the restrooms at that time and we find out this was Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Right outside Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s124">So in Dachau we just took all our clothes off, we had to get the clothes which they use in the concentration camp, the striped clothes.</span> <span id="s125">It was not built up completely.</span> <span id="s126">It didn’t have nothing to do for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: So it was still in the process of being built?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: In the build up, yes.</span> <span id="s129">So what actually happened, they took, they give us some bags you know where you fill it with straw so you can sleep on it, make a mattress on it.</span> <span id="s130">Everybody has to fill it themselves.</span> <span id="s131">And they had a bathroom there.</span> <span id="s132">It was everything new.</span> <span id="s133">It was for us, it doesn’t look too bad, it didn’t look at that time like, we didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s134">We saw something it was built.</span> <span id="s135">So they took us a whole bunch of the old Jews together there.</span> <span id="s136">There was not too many at that time there and they brought up to a place where they have in the street some rocks.</span> <span id="s137">A pile of rocks lay.</span> <span id="s138">So the SS man said everybody take one rock and march that way.</span> <span id="s139">O.K. so everybody took one rock, some were small, some were big and we took the rock, it was not very heavy, we went to the bathroom about a mile and then they said O.K., now put the rocks on that place and make a pile.</span> <span id="s140">So we put the rocks on that, we go to another pile, pick up another rock and put it on the pile.</span> <span id="s141">They had nothing to do for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: This job was just to keep you busy?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Just to keep us busy.</span> <span id="s144">O.K. so anyhow that was the beginning there.</span> <span id="s145">After we built up more blocks there and I was in one of them.</span> <span id="s146">I think it was 26.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Were more and more people coming in after you arrived?</span> <span id="s148">Were you one of the first people to arrive there, were there people there already?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: This camp was a camp, at that time, everybody came.</span> <span id="s150">Communists, homosexuals, religious people, big owners from big factories and things like that.</span> <span id="s151">Everybody came in there.</span> <span id="s152">We had our yellow star, the criminals had their green star, the homosexuals had an orange star, you know, and so on.</span> <span id="s153">Everybody had a different star.</span> <span id="s154">That was the way they were identified.</span> <span id="s155">Anyhow, there wasn’t very much to do to us.</span> <span id="s156">We had an SS man and the SS man said, O.K.</span> <span id="s157">The SS man took us behind the barracks, he make us some kind of contest of running.</span> <span id="s158">He built two columns, one of the columns was A one of the columns was B and we had to see which column can run faster the distance which he is giving us.</span> <span id="s159">That was actually the business at the end.</span> <span id="s160">Then we were all finished, then he teached us some songs, we had to run around.</span> <span id="s161">It was all no punishment there, it was just a concentration camp in the build-up.</span> <span id="s162">And all night we all had stars on the jacket.</span> <span id="s163">There was a canteen, in this canteen we still could buy something if somebody had money.</span> <span id="s164">So some of the people, we went down, we buy something then they discontinued that, we couldn’t do anymore and I had a bright new jacket, I didn’t have my star on it yet, so the people said, well you have a brand new jacket you can go in the canteen for us to buy something.</span> <span id="s165">So I went for them.</span> <span id="s166">I took the chance and bought something for them.</span> <span id="s167">That went up to July 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: So you were there for about three months?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A; From April to July.</span> <span id="s170">Then we get the order one day in the morning you all get up take your good jackets and everything out we give you some other things to wear.</span> <span id="s171">You are going to be going away from here.</span> <span id="s172">We came again on the transport.</span> <span id="s173">This time it was not a cattle car, this time it was a regular car.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: A regular train car with seats and everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes, a regular train car, but it was very strict in there, the SS were hitting us.</span> <span id="s176">You were not allowed to speak, you were not allowed to move your head.</span> <span id="s177">One of the SS men when I just look at somebody else and turned my head, he hit me with the upside down pistol right on my head.</span> <span id="s178">That came certainly after three hours’ train ride.</span> <span id="s179">The commandos came and said, don’t hit anybody anymore.</span> <span id="s180">Hitting I not allowed.</span> <span id="s181">So, O.K. that went all the way until we came to Reimar, the city of Reimar.</span> <span id="s182">So after we came on the station, everybody had to run out there, we were not allowed to walk out and outside after the railroad station there was already trucks waiting for us.</span> <span id="s183">In these trucks we were all stuffed in there, they had no backing on these trucks, you know, no gates.</span> <span id="s184">So we were standing in there, there was not very much to hold, one was holding onto the other.</span> <span id="s185">So, we went to another camp, which we discovered was _________.</span> <span id="s186">That was in July.</span> <span id="s187">So we came to Buchenwald which was a very bad situation.</span> <span id="s188">When we came we were hot we were hungry, they gave us a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s189">We thought, oh, this is good so we find out in the evening that the loaf of bread has to last until the next morning.</span> <span id="s190">And in the evening, in the morning you get the bread, in the evening you get a soup, whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s191">And so that was the procedure.</span> <span id="s192">So in the morning always you got the bread, in the evening you get the soup.</span> <span id="s193">In the evening you had no bread.</span> <span id="s194">So it was a very bad situation.</span> <span id="s195">You had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s196">It was not a big loaf of bread, it was a small bread.</span> <span id="s197">So, I was a good feeder that time, not too bad.</span> <span id="s198">Most of the people which came from Dachau was not too bad a shape.</span> <span id="s199">But over there we got in a bad shape because it was a lousy situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Can you explain to me a little bit about Buchenwald, what it was like there and how it was situated?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: I’m coming to it.</span> <span id="s202">We had a couple, what you call it, who was looking for the people in the barracks, you know, and he was a communist.</span> <span id="s203">So he was not very much for the Nazis anyhow but he said he gave us some warnings, and in the morning he said you people going out and right in front of the barracks he had a latrine build, which was just trenches in a big hole and that was the latrine.</span> <span id="s204">Further on we went to work so he gave me a pick and somebody got a shovel and we had to dig the ground there.</span> <span id="s205">.</span> <span id="s206">We didn’t know what’s going on anyhow.</span> <span id="s207">Anyway that’s the way they kept us busy there.</span> <span id="s208">So, one day, a guy said to me, he said, why you’re working too hard, why don’t you take the shovel and give that other one the pick?</span> <span id="s209">It didn’t work out either because these people were not trained to have some, what you call it, equipment in the hand.</span> <span id="s210">I was coming from the country so I was a little tougher than they were.</span> <span id="s211">You get some blisters.</span> <span id="s212">So the next day, one day in the morning, a guy said to me, hey, come over to our command, we have a good commander.</span> <span id="s213">O.K. so I was shifting over, which was not allowed but I did it, I went to the other commander, the commander was a criminal.</span> <span id="s214">He had a green star.</span> <span id="s215">And he said hurry up, he had about 375 people there in his command.</span> <span id="s216">Every two people get a platform of wood, about 3x4, you know, and has two handles in the back, two handles in the front, and one man in the back and one man in the front carry the platform.</span> <span id="s217">The platform we had to put sand on it at that time and with that we marched a mile or two miles, whatever it was in the time, and when we came there with the sand we dropped the sand there, we took some stones, we took it back to the other place.</span> <span id="s218">On the way over there we were passing on the places there were some trees there.</span> <span id="s219">One day we came there was three people hanging there.</span> <span id="s220">There was three hanging there.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: This is near the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Near the entrance to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s225">On the trees where we passing through was three people hanging.</span> <span id="s226">They were dead already.</span> <span id="s227">They were hanging with their head back up on a rope.</span> <span id="s228">So actually it broke their neck.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: This is in the town where you were working?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: That is in Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s231">It was outside or inside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: In Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: There is no inside, outside, there is only inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: So you worked all the time inside Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: In Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s236">Buchenwald is the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s237">It is not a town.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: O.K. I understand.</span> <span id="s239">I wasn’t sure if they were taking you out of town to work or if it was all in.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: It was all in.</span> <span id="s241">That’s the way they keep the people busy.</span> <span id="s242">Some people are hanging there, our kapo said to us, don’t look at them.</span> <span id="s243">If I see you looking at them, you gonna get punishment.</span> <span id="s244">So we went straight through, we didn’t move our heads.</span> <span id="s245">We saw them, we come straight, you know.</span> <span id="s246">Oh, that was awful.</span> <span id="s247">So that people changed and maybe when we come back another two or three weeks again there was another bunch hanging there.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did anyone know why they had been hung?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: In a concentration camp is no why’s.</span> <span id="s250">In the concentration camp is only you do, don’t why.</span> <span id="s251">There are no questions.</span> <span id="s252">This is something strict like a, I don’t know, I cannot explain it to you.</span> <span id="s253">People, who are murderers or something like that, only this kind of people can do things like that.</span> <span id="s254">Who would hang people with the hand in the back on a tree.</span> <span id="s255">This is a specialty.</span> <span id="s256">O.K.</span> <span id="s257">That was over there.</span> <span id="s258">So I was there till the 15 of October.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: In Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s261">But between this time my mother was worried about me.</span> <span id="s262">She was in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: She was still in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s265">She wrote to the commander of Buchenwald that she said my son is in your concentration camp, his number is 9158 and I would like to know what actually happened to him.</span> <span id="s266">That was a special thing.</span> <span id="s267">It was a card with an answering, you know.</span> <span id="s268">At that time they had postcards where you can make them hang together on the other side was the answering.</span> <span id="s269">She mailed that card, she get an answer.</span> <span id="s270">The answer was that I was transferred to the criminal police in Linz in Austria.</span> <span id="s271">I was transferred.</span> <span id="s272">But she didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s273">That was on 8/11/1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: So she wrote to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: And then you were transferred?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: No, it didn’t go to Dachau.</span> <span id="s278">She wrote a card.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: She wrote a card to Dachau to find out about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: She wrote a card to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Wait a minute you said you went to Buchenwald in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: No.</span> <span id="s283">I went in July that is correct.</span> <span id="s284">But she thought I was in Dachau, but she didn’t know I was transferred to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: So when she wrote, she still thought you were in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: When did she write the card?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: She wrote the card on4/10/38.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Which is October 4th?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s291">October 4th.</span> <span id="s292">She wrote the card there.</span> <span id="s293">They mailed it back that I was not there anymore and was transferred on 4/10/38 to Linz, and that is in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s294">She knew I was in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s295">She took a chance because I sent her some cards, but she didn’t receive any cards anymore.</span> <span id="s296">So she was asking.</span> <span id="s297">So I have these two cards here which is evidence, which was signed by the commander of that name, it was Koch (?)</span> <span id="s298">He was SS ________.</span> <span id="s299">So I have this card here to document, you know.</span> <span id="s300">And, so anyhow she knows already I was going to leave Austria.</span> <span id="s301">I was going on a train.</span> <span id="s302">What actually happened, on the 13th of October in the night was the Apell, you know, they put everybody on a big place.</span> <span id="s303">All the blocks together, and certainly they called my name.</span> <span id="s304">When they called my name they said tomorrow morning you have to go for a medical.</span> <span id="s305">So I heard it, I didn’t know what’s going to happen, I had nothing wrong with me.</span> <span id="s306">So I came to my block and they said.</span> <span id="s307">Oh, you’re going out, you’re going out.</span> <span id="s308">You’re going for a medical, you’re going out he said.</span> <span id="s309">But do not tell him that you heard something.</span> <span id="s310">Don’t tell him nothing.</span> <span id="s311">Tell him you feel fine, tell him you’re O.K. you feel wonderful.</span> <span id="s312">Tell him whatever you want but don’t tell you got something wrong with you.</span> <span id="s313">So the next day in the morning I went to the medical I did like the block, like the guy told me to do it and he said O.K. you go in the next room over there we going to supply you with some clothes.</span> <span id="s314">We haven’t got your clothes from Dachau but we have to give you some other clothes there are.</span> <span id="s315">So, they supplied me and the next day in the morning, on the 15th I was going on a transport, I was going on transport, on the way to Linz, Austria.</span> <span id="s316">That transport took about 14 days, 15 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: It took you 15 days to go from Buchenwald to Linz?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: From Buchenwald on transport.</span> <span id="s319">From Buchenwald it took that long.</span> <span id="s320">It was on a cattle, what you call it, not passenger car.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: A box car?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: What do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: A box car?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: On freight cars, it was hooked up on freight cars.</span> <span id="s325">And we go from one town, next town we went out, they put us in the jail, they gave us a breakfast, they put us back there, we continued.</span> <span id="s326">Then there was the next town.</span> <span id="s327">So we went about at least twelve, or ten or twelve towns before I came to Linz, Austria.</span> <span id="s328">I came to Linz, Austria on the evening of November 5, 1938.</span> <span id="s329">I arrived there.</span> <span id="s330">When I arrived there it was, like I said, criminal police came to me and said John Friedmann, are you hungry?</span> <span id="s331">I said sure.</span> <span id="s332">So he said today we have a special day, we have a herring and I give you a double issue because you went that long way.</span> <span id="s333">So he give me that was it.</span> <span id="s334">So he said to me, what are you going to do if I going to let you out of here?</span> <span id="s335">I said, what am I going to do, I’m going to see if I can get out of Austria as fast as I can.</span> <span id="s336">So the man said, that’s all I want to do here.</span> <span id="s337">The next day in the next morning, at 7 o’clock in the morning, he said, O.K. John, go ahead get out of Austria he said.</span> <span id="s338">So he released me.</span> <span id="s339">I didn’t have any money to go back to my town, so I went to the Jewish organization in Linz and I said I need some money to get on the train.</span> <span id="s340">He said we don’t have very much money, but for the train he said, we give you that.</span> <span id="s341">So they give me the money, two gildas to go from Linz to _______, where I meet my landlady, where she had my money, some of my money there, so I was all right.</span> <span id="s342">So after about on the 7th, I went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s343">When I went to Vienna in 1938, so here comes actually the story of the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s344">Every time I have to report to the police department, and to go up there.</span> <span id="s345">.</span> <span id="s346">So the first time I go up to the police, the man said to me, where are you, where have you been?</span> <span id="s347">We waiting for you such a long time, we get the report you’re going to come, but we didn’t receive you.</span> <span id="s348">We going to keep you here.</span> <span id="s349">We cannot let you go.</span> <span id="s350">We going to check out what you have to tell us and we cannot let you go.</span> <span id="s351">My mother went with me.</span> <span id="s352">She went right away to get some food out there, to buy some food.</span> <span id="s353">The man was going on the phone and it took about two hours my mother came back after and after about two hours they called me in the room and said well, we find out that everything you said is correct, you can go home.</span> <span id="s354">So my mother said, O.K. now we have to eat the food at home.</span> <span id="s355">That was about on the 8th, on the 8th of November they told me every second day I have to come there.</span> <span id="s356">I don’t have to come every day.</span> <span id="s357">So on the next day, the morning, I went out, I said to my mother well, I better go back to my town, get all my things over there what I have left, come back to you then.</span> <span id="s358">So, that was on the 9th of November.</span> <span id="s359">I didn’t see very much of the Kristallnacht actually, but I was there.</span> <span id="s360">So I was there, coincidentally, I took a train, it was 9:30 in the evening, went down to my town.</span> <span id="s361">It was an overnight train, you see, when you took the train there in the morning at 6 o’clock, it arrived in _______.</span> <span id="s362">So it went all the night.</span> <span id="s363">So I came to my landlady in the morning then and she said, oh, I’m glad to see you.</span> <span id="s364">I said, what’s wrong?</span> <span id="s365">She said yesterday, it was the 9th, a gendarme came and asked for you.</span> <span id="s366">I told him you are not here, you are in Vienna by your mother.</span> <span id="s367">So, that’s the way I get out of the Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: You happened to be back in your other town?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s370">So that was the point from that.</span> <span id="s371">But the main thing is not coming up about how do I get actually out of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s372">That would be interesting for you too.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: So my mother had some friends before.</span> <span id="s375">Under them was a criminal inspector, and she told him, to the criminal inspector, she said my son is in the concentration camp in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s376">You have to do something to get him out.</span> <span id="s377">So he said, I don’t know what I can do, but I will try.</span> <span id="s378">So what he actually did actually, he was asking the Gestapo that to release me from Buchenwald which I didn’t know before that, that the criminal police had a case against me, so they need me there.</span> <span id="s379">He made an application to the Gestapo, they released me from Buchenwald on the 15th of October and I come from Linz and the Gestapo inspector was informed already from that guy and that’s how I get out from there.</span> <span id="s380">Because the friend of my mother, he did the job, a good job.</span> <span id="s381">So now we are now on a _______ again and in April, when Hitler came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: April of 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: That was in 1938.</span> <span id="s384">So that was when they arrested me actually.</span> <span id="s385">All right.</span> <span id="s386">So now, where was I?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Let’s see, you had gone back to ________ __ to get your things and that’s when Kristallnacht happened that evening.</span> <span id="s388">Did you return to Vienna after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: After that, yes, O.K., after that I returned to Vienna and I tried to get out of Austria.</span> <span id="s390">I had about until December.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: You had until December to get out of the country, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes, that’s correct.</span> <span id="s393">So what I went, I went to the Jewish organization in Austria, Vienna, and I asked what I can do?</span> <span id="s394">Well, he said we have something working on here, which goes to Palestine.</span> <span id="s395">You want to go there?</span> <span id="s396">I said, well I want to go there, it’s fine, I’ll go there, I’ll go anyplace I can go out.</span> <span id="s397">So I said, what about my mother?</span> <span id="s398">Well, your mother, you cannot take, only young people.</span> <span id="s399">We only can take young people.</span> <span id="s400">So I said, what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s401">There was a little letter in the hall and it says on that letter, the only way out is through the free port of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s402">That’s the only way you can go.</span> <span id="s403">So, O.K., so there was no other way left.</span> <span id="s404">So we tried, I tried to get a passport, when I applied for the passport.</span> <span id="s405">.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Who did you apply to for the passport?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Through the German Gestapo, You applied for the passport there and when I came there a guy tells me, don’t tell him you’re a salesman.</span> <span id="s408">Tell him you’re a mechanic.</span> <span id="s409">He says, you know something about cars he knows I was driving around cars.</span> <span id="s410">I was fooling around with them.</span> <span id="s411">Don’t tell him you’re a salesman.</span> <span id="s412">So after about three days, standing night and days sometimes, I don’t want to get involved in that business, so after that we get the passport.</span> <span id="s413">I had mechanic in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: And your mother also got a passport at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: My mother did not get a passport.</span> <span id="s416">No she didn’t.</span> <span id="s417">She couldn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: She couldn’t go?</span> <span id="s419">Was there a reason she couldn’t go to Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: What actually happened, we went to the travel bureau, there was no tickets available for Shanghai.</span> <span id="s421">The only chance I had to Shanghai, there was one ticket left, which was going from Naples, Italy and the boat was going from Genoa, Italy.</span> <span id="s422">So I had to catch that boat in April.</span> <span id="s423">To catch that boat in April, I had to go by train over Italy to Rome, Naples and when I came to Naples, a day later came the boat.</span> <span id="s424">So on that boat I had that one ticket.</span> <span id="s425">But my mother couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s426">I went to Shanghai on December the 27th, I came to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Let me ask you, when did you leave Vienna for Naples?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: I leave Vienna to Naples on December the 10th.</span> <span id="s429">Something like that.</span> <span id="s430">December the 9th or 10th.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Then the boat left?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: The boat left when we came to _________, 14 days’ ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: And you arrived in Shanghai December 27?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: I arrived in Shanghai, like they said to us, oh, that Shanghai is bad, they had people sleeping on the streets.</span> <span id="s435">Jewish people said before don’t go there.</span> <span id="s436">So we came there, we come with the boat, we saw all the skyscrapers there, everything was there.</span> <span id="s437">We said, how bad can it be?</span> <span id="s438">It cannot be that bad.</span> <span id="s439">So, anyhow, but my mother couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s440">So what happened, we went there, they took us in a building from Victor Sassoon, Victor Sassoon Building, they give us a whole level of the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: You had one whole floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes, one story.</span> <span id="s443">It was a high building.</span> <span id="s444">So they placed us there, they gave us cots to sleep there, then later on they opened up a kitchen and I was working in the kitchen there already, but my mother still couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s445">So what did my mother actually make to come to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s446">There was the time when Hitler said that all the Jewish people have to put the gold and silver, put it on the certain place, you cannot keep gold and silver for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: When did this happen, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: January 1939.</span> <span id="s449">So my mother just couldn’t get a ticket.</span> <span id="s450">She didn’t have that much money left to buy the ticket.</span> <span id="s451">So what actually happened, she had a lot of jewelry left, but you couldn’t sell it that time because everybody took advantage of the Jews.</span> <span id="s452">So she went to a travel bureau in a very popular place, a big one, he had a porter standing out there.</span> <span id="s453">So she went to the porter and said, listen, I have here a bag of gold jewelry, I have to deliver it to the SS anyhow, but I would need a ticket to Shanghai, my son is there.</span> <span id="s454">If you get me that ticket I will give you the gold.</span> <span id="s455">The man looked in the bag to see the jewelry, he took the jewelry, he said O.K, come tomorrow, 9 o’clock.</span> <span id="s456">Next day, in the morning, my mother came there and he said, here is your ticket for Shanghai.</span> <span id="s457">So, actually I was happy she came to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: So she did follow you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: She took the chance to give the man that gold.</span> <span id="s460">At that time she said, I have nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s461">If I gave it to them, I have nothing.</span> <span id="s462">If I give it to him, if he helps me, which he did, that was the only way to do it.</span> <span id="s463">So she came to Shanghai with the _______.</span> <span id="s464">I was already working for the organization, I came on board, there was a Red Cross man already and she came there, it was a happy reunion naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Was there a group or organization that helped you settle in Shanghai when you got there?</span> <span id="s466">`</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: There was no settling in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s468">Everybody was his own.</span> <span id="s469">Either you stayed in the organization, it was like a camp, and there was several made up.</span> <span id="s470">There was about three of them made up there.</span> <span id="s471">Or, if you find a job, then you can get a job.</span> <span id="s472">O.K., so when I came to Shanghai, they asked me, oh, you’re a mechanic?</span> <span id="s473">O.K., so one of these rich Jewish people was there, he said, I have a Fiat, I need a clutch, can you put her in?</span> <span id="s474">I was the first day in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s475">He said if I can put it in.</span> <span id="s476">Naturally I can put it in.</span> <span id="s477">That was a simple job for me, I did that for my car.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: So you were able to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s480">I came to him, I did not have tools, so he supplied me with tools, whatever they could get, and I proved I could put the clutch in for him.</span> <span id="s481">O.K., if you can do that we see that you can get a job.</span> <span id="s482">So, which I did.</span> <span id="s483">I was learning, it took me about three months to learn Chinese.</span> <span id="s484">To get a job you have to speak Chinese in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s485">There’s no other way out.</span> <span id="s486">So I spoke the language fairly.</span> <span id="s487">Then I get a job from the city government, the British government of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s488">I was a supervisor for the trash dumps.</span> <span id="s489">Trash collection.</span> <span id="s490">So they had about eight ____________ at that time and so I worked with them as a supervisor, I used my Chinese as good as I could, and after about three, four months they came to me and said, John, we have to release you.</span> <span id="s491">We get a guy coming in from England and this is our man, we cannot hold you anymore.</span> <span id="s492">So, O.K., so I went, I had connections already.</span> <span id="s493">I went to the bus company where a Jewish fellow was in charge.</span> <span id="s494">I said I need a job, he said there was no question, right away he hired me.</span> <span id="s495">I was working for the Shanghai Bus Company.</span> <span id="s496">I was in charge of a German fellow, but he was not so political.</span> <span id="s497">He was just a German.</span> <span id="s498">So I got the job there at the Bus company, I was working as a mechanic at night, night shift, started at 11 0’clock in the evening, 7 o’clock in the morning I was off.</span> <span id="s499">So I worked with the Bus Company, changed to motors, changed to generators, everything what I had to do over there.</span> <span id="s500">Later on there was an opening on the test bench, where you tested the motors.</span> <span id="s501">If they are good overhauls, you know.</span> <span id="s502">So there was an engineer, his name was _______, he was a Jewish fellow, so he got me there as his assistant.</span> <span id="s503">So I worked over there in the Bus Company for three years, until the Japanese told us that we have to go to a ghetto.</span> <span id="s504">O.K.</span> <span id="s505">What is the ghetto?</span> <span id="s506">The ghetto was a district across the bridge of the Yangtze River, called ________.</span> <span id="s507">And that ghetto there, there was really about maybe 100,000, 200,000 Chinese.</span> <span id="s508">All living there.</span> <span id="s509">So they put us in there.</span> <span id="s510">We had to mix with them, we had to live with them, we had to stay there, there was no out.</span> <span id="s511">we get the passes if you work outside, which I did.</span> <span id="s512">I worked outside in the ______, I get the job for the Toyota Company.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: The British at this point had left and the Japanese had come in, or were the British still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: No, the Japanese came in they went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: When did the Japanese come do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Let me see, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: As soon as the Japanese came, did they set up a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: The Japanese came, they set up a ghetto.</span> <span id="s519">We only could get out with a pass.</span> <span id="s520">At first I was working for a French company, I was working for Citroen Motors, and working then and we were building.</span> <span id="s521">They had an order from the Japanese to build hundreds of motors which they put in suicide boats.</span> <span id="s522">Boats that go against enemies, naturally.</span> <span id="s523">And these boats were built without a clutch.</span> <span id="s524">It was straight hooked up to the propeller.</span> <span id="s525">So when you start the motor, the boat was shooting already.</span> <span id="s526">Only have to get the direction that it supposed to run in the boat.</span> <span id="s527">That was in France, then, like I said, I got the job in the Toyota Company, which helped me get a pass out of _____, out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s528">So I was going out of the ghetto at the time when, because as a mechanic, there were not very many mechanics.</span> <span id="s529">There was only six, seven mechanics.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">SIDE TWO</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: (Something is missing).</span> <span id="s532">Jewish Young fellows, I hired them as apprentices, I have the authority from them, which are still in America here.</span> <span id="s533">So after Toyota closed up in downtown L.A., of Los Angeles, it was in the French section, Dickie said we have to go with the bus the next day and the Nissan Company takes over.</span> <span id="s534">That was the Datsun Company.</span> <span id="s535">Nisson/Datsun Company they call it in Japanese.</span> <span id="s536">So they hired us, O.K., so what was the hiring, every half month they give us a bag of rice and they give a little bit of pocket money.</span> <span id="s537">So it was better than nothing.</span> <span id="s538">My mother was still there.</span> <span id="s539">It worked out all right.</span> <span id="s540">It was not great, but when you are able to work in your profession, it was good.</span> <span id="s541">So, anyhow that was going on until the American came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Which was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: At the end of the war.</span> <span id="s544">When the Americans came in I applied for a job.</span> <span id="s545">They hired me as a foreman in the ATC, the Air Transport Command and I was a foreman for the trucks, after six months I was there I didn’t like it because I couldn’t get further, so I went with the Air Force, I was a _______.</span> <span id="s546">That did not last too long and finally I get a job in Nanking.</span> <span id="s547">In Nanking for the American to build a radio station.</span> <span id="s548">XMHA Radio Station in Nanking.</span> <span id="s549">At that time the headquarters of General Marshall.</span> <span id="s550">I went over there and my mother stayed in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s551">I was employed as a power man, I had to make the power for the radio station that they can run the transmitters.</span> <span id="s552">They didn’t have enough people so I was running the power and then I was helping the radio stations to build, before the radio station was open, I helped put the towers up, about 45 foot towers over top of General Marshall’s building there, and General Marshall was on the first floor and the second floor.</span> <span id="s553">I was on the third floor over there.</span> <span id="s554">They gave us the lodging in the Headquarters and it was working all right for that part.</span> <span id="s555">Then I always had a job, I never was without a job.</span> <span id="s556">Always had a job.</span> <span id="s557">That went to 1949.</span> <span id="s558">1949 we heard that the communists are coming across the Yangtze already, we had to get out of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s559">So the Jewish organizations told us, it was a very short notice from one day to the other, tomorrow, at 10 o’clock assemble all the organizations and we are going to Canada.</span> <span id="s560">So we I just took an army bag and I put everything what I could.</span> <span id="s561">Money

river they were shooting already at the airlines, at the transportation here, then we came to Fairbanks, Alaska.</span> <span id="s563">Fairbanks, Alaska and there we get a transfer plane after we waited a day over.</span> <span id="s564">We went on a transfer plane to Seattle.</span> <span id="s565">We came to Seattle, it was not allowed that we can get off the bus because we didn’t have any documents, so they took us in the bus then, they were running the buses to Vancouver, from Seattle to Vancouver.</span> <span id="s566">In Vancouver, already some of the Jewish people there who were working for the organization, they were waiting for us already.</span> <span id="s567">I found a lady there, she was Mrs. Gould and she said, oh, you are a mechanic.</span> <span id="s568">I said yes.</span> <span id="s569">She said why don’t you drive, I don’t like to drive that car.</span> <span id="s570">So, she was sitting next to me, we went all around Vancouver.</span> <span id="s571">I was driving the car.</span> <span id="s572">The next day she said, you just can drive, if you want a car, drive through the ton you can have the car.</span> <span id="s573">Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s574">I said what about the license.</span> <span id="s575">She said don’t worry, they aren’t so strict here, you are a good driver.</span> <span id="s576">So we stayed three days in Vancouver after the three days, we were going on a train, we went to Toronto, Canada.</span> <span id="s577">Now we came to Toronto, Canada the 29th of May 1949, and right away they gave us some quarters, we didn’t have any money, they paid for the first two weeks until we get some money made there, until we get some employment.</span> <span id="s578">I got right away employed for the Austin of England.</span> <span id="s579">So right away I got Austin of England employed and well, that was the beginning Canada, then when I was working there I met my wife, we got married in Canada and in 1950.</span> <span id="s580">We just had our 43rd anniversary.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Just this year?</span> <span id="s582">That’s great!</span> <span id="s583">When did you move to
