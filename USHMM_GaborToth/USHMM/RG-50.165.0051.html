with my father so ill, I believe that there is some kind of turmoil, not all of these tears are being provoked by the medication.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: And Dr. Charles Lee Holm is a friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: And is he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Does he identify as such?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: They just stayed away.</span> <span id="s17">His parents are much more talkative and Charles felt confident enough that we took a meal and it was “kosher” but that was about the end of it.</span> <span id="s18">There was animated discussion about the State of Israel and how, of all people, how there could be such brutality addressed to Palestinian children, when, of all people, this was a nation that should be sensitive.</span> <span id="s19">And then I raised the issue that this was also a nation that is attuned to survival.</span> <span id="s20">And then there was a nice intellectual discussion suggesting that there is a perpetual motion machine and that he who suffers most will persecute most.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Would your own parents have discussed the issue of Israel in that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: No.</span> <span id="s23">However with the advent of the VCR, I have chosen to very quietly select programming that was retrospective, but was not graphic.</span> <span id="s24">And so since, Kitty Returns to Auschwitz is reasonably sterile, we watched it.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: And so it becomes a way of identifying with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Holocaust.</span> <span id="s27">My father left the room saying that he had things to do.</span> <span id="s28">But my mother watched with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: how old are your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: They are 74 and 76.</span> <span id="s31">They were married outside of Munich October 23, 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Is your mother in good health?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well, we had always thought that she would be the one to leave us first.</span> <span id="s34">And I left the Christian Brothers in Minnesota (St. Mary’s College, where Robert taught history) to take care of her in Racine.</span> <span id="s35">During that time I found myself slowly becoming obsessed with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s36">The Order, by the way, is committed to the education of underprivileged children.</span> <span id="s37">It has somehow lost that focus along the way.</span> <span id="s38">They’re far more successful in the affluent suburbs.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: How about your sister.</span> <span id="s40">Where does she stand in all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: She really doesn’t want to talk about it, I guess.</span> <span id="s42">She also lives in Walworth County, Wisconsin.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Could you tell me what “this” is?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Have you ever known what it’s like to be the only one in the neighborhood without grandparents?</span> <span id="s45">The story must be told and I will tell it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: My father came from Vilna, Lithuania, the “Jerusalem of Lithuania” (said with a touch of irony).</span> <span id="s48">My mother is from Berlin.</span> <span id="s49">She’s the daughter of a railroad employee.</span> <span id="s50">After the war, they decided: ‘After the Holocaust, there is no place in the world for us as Jews,’ and converted to Christianity.</span> <span id="s51">They settled in Racine.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: How did you find out you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Well of course, I was brought up as a Catholic, as a Christian.</span> <span id="s54">But one day, I was 24, I came across my mother rummaging through some photos.</span> <span id="s55">They had dates next to them.</span> <span id="s56">I asked my mother what they were, and she said: ‘Oh, some pictures of relatives before they were deported.’</span> <span id="s57">‘Deported?’</span> <span id="s58">I asked.</span> <span id="s59">‘Where to?</span> <span id="s60">Why?’</span> <span id="s61">‘Because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s62">The Nazis deported them.’</span> <span id="s63">‘But how could they be our relatives if they were Jewish?</span> <span id="s64">We’re Catholic.’</span> <span id="s65">‘Well, we once were Jewish,’ she said matter-of-factly.</span> <span id="s66">And that’s how I found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: It must have profoundly changed your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yes it did.</span> <span id="s69">I began to delve into the history of what happened during the war, of what the Nazis did.</span> <span id="s70">Strangely enough, my parents neither impeded nor helped me in my efforts.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: What have you looked into with respect to the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Well, I have read up on the Nuremberg trials and I’ve volunteered to do research for the division inn the Justice Department that is concerned with tracking down Nazi war criminals.</span> <span id="s73">But, to tell you the truth, numbers don’t begin to tell the story.</span> <span id="s74">I remember once there was an altercation in the neighborhood and it was necessary to cal the police.</span> <span id="s75">So I did.</span> <span id="s76">‘How could you have one that?’</span> <span id="s77">my parents asked.</span> <span id="s78">‘You never call the police.’</span> <span id="s79">‘Why?’</span> <span id="s80">I asked, not understanding.</span> <span id="s81">That’s the way we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Continuation of Interview, November 23, 1989</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: How is your father now?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: His health is rapidly deteriorating.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: I’m sorry to hear that.</span> <span id="s86">Can we talk for a few minutes?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: You grew up in Racine.</span> <span id="s89">Did you have any Jewish friends there?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: No.</span> <span id="s91">Curiously, we lived in an immigrant neighborhood, surrounded by the railway.</span> <span id="s92">Some of my most cherished childhood memories, this is going to be a bit paradoxical, were with the neighbors, who spoke very little English, and were Armenian, and were quite verbal about the genocide that had occurred there.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: When did your parents convert?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s95">I know that from grade school on, I attended Catholic school.</span> <span id="s96">I can recall that one Christmas, we gave my mother and father a bible.</span> <span id="s97">They happened to have been offered by our church, and it seemed like a good idea at the time in that it had a place for genealogy in the front and a place for photographs.</span> <span id="s98">And the Christmas gift, from what I could glean even then, had to have been provocative.</span> <span id="s99">It wasn’t rejected though.</span> <span id="s100">But to this moment that we speak, the genealogy, dates of baptism, Holy Communion, etc. remains unwritten.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: When your mother told you about your history, she seemed to say it so casually.</span> <span id="s102">She must have known the impact this would have on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Well, I sustained an anemic disease but I found out I was ill because I collapsed after playing the two masses at our church, St. Kasimir’s, a national Catholic church.</span> <span id="s104">It us staffed by priests who are 100% Lithuanian, which would be consistent with our origin.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: When your mother said what she said about the photographs----was it her nature to state something like this so casually?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: She was very disturbed that day.</span> <span id="s107">It was an anniversary day, of what, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s108">I walked in on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: What did you do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I had at this age received a remarkable amount of encouragement.</span> <span id="s111">I had discovered the Spanish Civil War.</span> <span id="s112">At the time I fell deeply in love with it because it seemed to be such a “good and evil” sort of thing.</span> <span id="s113">It was romantic.</span> <span id="s114">As I matured I began writing survivors and the survivors would write me.</span> <span id="s115">Very little of the mail came from Spain.</span> <span id="s116">And I would share the stories of what happens when you struggle against a series of dictatorships, certainly against a church I couldn’t understand, even though it was my church.</span> <span id="s117">Two of the survivors said that Spain had, despite its strong Catholicism, culturally accepted the Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: 1941.</span> <span id="s120">And this happened about 1965.</span> <span id="s121">And two of the survivors indicated: ‘Our sufferings were like nothing compared to what happened to the Jews during the Holocaust.’</span> <span id="s122">I studied the Spanish Civil War from high school.</span> <span id="s123">I only went to high school for two years in Racine.</span> <span id="s124">The rest of the time I spent in bed because I was sick, and was visited by my national church, and got more and more involved.</span> <span id="s125">I took correspondence courses to finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: How does this connect to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s128">I struck up a correspondence with La Passionara who was living in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s129">She indicated that what Franco did on a small scale, Hitler did on a large scale, in terms of eradication of the unwanted.</span> <span id="s130">When I asked my Mom about that, she got very upset and said that woman was crazy.</span> <span id="s131">At Marquette I wanted to do a project on this.</span> <span id="s132">I was somehow attracted to emigres.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: And you too, immigrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I had gotten in touch since we spoke with a member of our family who knew our family name before it was Americanized.</span> <span id="s135">I’m about a week away from finding out.</span> <span id="s136">I told my Mom about your previous call and she at first was angry as to what could I ever say and then I said ‘It’s time that we say something.’</span> <span id="s137">And then she said: ‘Well, you can say it for the family.’</span> <span id="s138">She won’t.</span> <span id="s139">I was kinda hoping she would.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: How did you come to Wisconsin?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: From Kansas because the sponsor was from there and was Catholic.</span> <span id="s142">I think my parents might therefore have decided to become Catholic in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s143">My family was intensely grateful to the folks in Kansas who sponsored them.</span> <span id="s144">We received a call recently, one night, quite late from Texas from a man who was doing family trees.</span> <span id="s145">He called us to figure out some connections.</span> <span id="s146">So I told my Mom and asked her: ‘What really was my grandfather’s name?’</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: She knew her name didn’t she?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: I’m sure she does.</span> <span id="s149">It just that she was ‘going to help this man from Texas.</span> <span id="s150">She’s going to help, in a sense, me.’</span> <span id="s151">With respect to the war, I remember once, asking my mother for baby pictures of me and my sister and she said there weren’t any because there was no film, because there was a war.</span> <span id="s152">So I asked: ‘Mom, how come other people have pictures?’</span> <span id="s153">‘Well, they were very wealthy or they had a roll or two of film that they had put aside.’</span> <span id="s154">On one of the photographs, there are X’s drawn through the chest portions, a photo of whom I don’t know.</span> <span id="s155">I asked what the X’s were.</span> <span id="s156">She said: ‘These are people who are dead.</span> <span id="s157">We’ll talk about this sometime.’</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: I wonder how she saved these photos during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I am certain she was not in a camp.</span> <span id="s160">She was in a production area, a factory but she had been identified as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Where was your father during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: I don’t know other than that I’d been told that they were barrier guards for the railway.</span> <span id="s163">And my sister is a year older than I.</span> <span id="s164">She stayed with friends during the war, we were told.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: After you began calling, slowly but surely...I think it might just be the finality of what’s going on.</span> <span id="s166">We haven’t talked about it a lot but I have probably learned more in the last month or so from my mother.</span> <span id="s167">My sister is just kind of surprised in that I never much discussed it.</span> <span id="s168">I said to her: “Did you know we had this experience?”</span> <span id="s169">And she looked at me and said: “We were?”</span> <span id="s170">She’d never seen the photographs.</span> <span id="s171">So I told her what I knew.</span> <span id="s172">When my Dad got ill, Mom didn’t want to go to Catholic Social Services.</span> <span id="s173">So I said: “Maybe it’s because of our problem.”</span> <span id="s174">So then the question was: What problem?</span> <span id="s175">So I suggested to my sister that since a lot of things are coming to the surface now because a lot’s happening that, as one woman to another, she might ask Mom about it, maybe over coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And then it turned out she didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: How did she react when you told her?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Not surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Why do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: There weren’t any shrieks, or ‘Oh you’re kidding’, or, ‘Oh, you made this all up’.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Is this her normal way of responding to something like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: No.</span> <span id="s184">No.</span> <span id="s185">And in fact we are going to spend some time this holiday talking.</span> <span id="s186">We’re coming to a kind of conclusion of Dad’s suffering.</span> <span id="s187">To talk about what my parents would want to do as far as a funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: What is going thru your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: I’m real scared.</span> <span id="s190">Not about funerals but about what kind of a funeral are we going to have?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Was he a practicing Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Is your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Was when we were in school, then wasn’t, and now feels some comfort in the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Did you see any evidence of conflict in your father in later years?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: No.</span> <span id="s197">Other than the fact that my father always has been, as far as I’ve known him, very non-verbal.</span> <span id="s198">When he was between jobs in electrical engineering, he just didn’t talk about it, on the grounds that we, his children, were not to be upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: For you, is there a question about being Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: I eventually entered a Catholic Order.</span> <span id="s201">Or I attempted to enter.</span> <span id="s202">They required a history and a dowry, as in classic Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s203">I stayed with the brothers.</span> <span id="s204">And I had personal problems with faith and, I suppose feeling a sense of less than joyous support from home.</span> <span id="s205">No one ever said no, but no one ever said yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: This was after you’d found out about your family history?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s208">I would have had to tell them this, go into the Baptismal history, to make sure you’re not a bastard and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: But if you have a formal conversion is that acceptable?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: But you couldn’t easily produce it because it was a very sensitive subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: I never pursued it.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Did your parents ever say anything about Jews in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s215">Other than my father used a couple of times a Yiddish term which I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Did your parents ever say or do anything culturally around the Jewish holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s218">We had a secular Easter and a kind of expanded Christmas (Hannukah).</span> <span id="s219">It was kind of atypical.</span> <span id="s220">It was a human holiday.</span> <span id="s221">And it helped that we were in a national church as opposed to a mainstream one because the priest comes with Christmas bread and he eats with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: How does that help?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: I think, for some reason, that was a common thread in my parents’ experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: You mean as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Well, my Mom cleaned for days because the priest was coming.</span> <span id="s226">I perceived there was in the Lithuanian Church a very clear Judeo-Christian continuum and the family seemed to enjoy that.</span> <span id="s227">The priest spoke Lithuanian and my father very much enjoyed this.</span> <span id="s228">And in our church, the service begins with the Lithuanian national anthem.</span> <span id="s229">(Substituted Lithuanian, as well as Catholic identity for Jewish).</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Did you get a feel for how your parents viewed persecution in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Well we didn’t watch much news on TV.</span> <span id="s232">My father always believed that the media lies.</span> <span id="s233">Still takes the position that the newspapers do a lot of editing.</span> <span id="s234">And my Mom chides him for that view.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Did your parents have a lot of friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: None.</span> <span id="s237">My mother worked in the Catholic hospital in Racine and had friends from there, but I could count them on one hand.</span> <span id="s238">And that’s the worst thing right now.</span> <span id="s239">There are no contemporaries who could get her thru this thing right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Did it seem strange not to have aunts and uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Well my father’s friends from the railroad who came over were Uncle This and Uncle That.</span> <span id="s242">And we would take trips with them on holidays to Milwaukee.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: When matters relating to the 1962 Eichmann trial or other things relating to the Nazis were in the news, do you remember your parents reacting?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: The most devastating thing in our family was Kennedy’s death.</span> <span id="s245">Our house just stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: What did your Dad do in his spare time?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Dried apples, canning food, to put in the basement.</span> <span id="s248">He had no hobbies.</span> <span id="s249">And we had a very hard time getting him anything for Christmas.</span> <span id="s250">He’d always say not to get him anything.</span> <span id="s251">We used to say if he had a hobby he’d be happier, but he just worked.</span> <span id="s252">He had no fun (A European thing and to survivors especially).</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Throwing yourself into what you’re doing can be a way of avoiding dealing with the past.</span> <span id="s254">(Bob is interested in learning this).</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Did anything change as a result of the fact that your father knew you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: In 1974 I put on an exhibit at St. Mary’s College on what my students had learned interviewing Minnesota survivors.</span> <span id="s257">We collected photographs of the Holocaust and Zionism.</span> <span id="s258">My mother wanted me to marry the girl who coordinated the exhibit.</span> <span id="s259">To this day she wants me to.</span> <span id="s260">My father wouldn’t go to see the exhibit.</span> <span id="s261">It was in Winona.</span> <span id="s262">I asked him: ‘Do you want to see the work of my students?’</span> <span id="s263">‘Oh yes,’ he said.</span> <span id="s264">‘What kind of work is it?’</span> <span id="s265">‘Well, it’s a museum that they put together with slides and photos.’</span> <span id="s266">My parents came out and he said that he would wait in the lounge.</span> <span id="s267">A man took my Mom thru the exhibit and my Mom was crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Does your Mom have any regrets that she didn’t stay within the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s270">Looking back, after reading a great deal it just seems as though my Dad is so repressed.</span> <span id="s271">I mean, by now I don’t know if he could ever get out of his cocoon and my Mom just seems very unhappy.</span> <span id="s272">Their friends have slowly but surely died and they haven’t chosen others.</span> <span id="s273">And now he’s incapable of freeing himself from the shell of this cocoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: What happened when you took out these videos?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: I can tell you which ones were successful.</span> <span id="s276">Judgement at Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s277">The Man in the Glass Booth made him walk out.</span> <span id="s278">My mother also walked out of that saying it was nice but kinda boring.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Did you ever sit down and talk to her about this?</span> <span id="s280">She apparently is the person that you could talk to more easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: She’ll talk about her childhood and particularly about a doctor she worked for, helping to keep his house.</span> <span id="s282">My Mom was from South Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Do you have any idea of how traditional an upbringing your parents had?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: No.</span> <span id="s285">But she promised me that she’s going to do this family tree with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: How could she do a family tree if the name wasn’t originally Karras?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Well, he had another name.</span> <span id="s288">He said his name was James Kairis (spelling unclear) He knew about my parents coming to Kansas City.</span> <span id="s289">I said I’d call him.</span> <span id="s290">You know, you’re probably helping me more than I’m helping you.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Well let’s say it’s at least mutual.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: We’re not a very touching family.</span> <span id="s293">The Armenians we were friendly with in our neighborhood were.</span> <span id="s294">They hugged and danced and did all kinds of things...</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: That Jews also do.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s297">Very much and they always have coffee, something a little sweet.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Do you ever feel a temptation to be like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s300">I went over to Auntie’s (his Armenian friend) almost every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Do you feel Jewish in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Well, when I started the Holocaust research on my own, I never felt ill at ease with people that I met.</span> <span id="s303">I very much treasured the opportunities to say prayers at temple.</span> <span id="s304">I was asked to, when I was doing my interviews in Illinois.</span> <span id="s305">But I guess it was just the openness, you are instantaneously welcome.</span> <span id="s306">You can stay as long as you want.</span> <span id="s307">I never felt pressured.</span> <span id="s308">I never felt in any way....different.</span> <span id="s309">It was in Skokie.</span> <span id="s310">I went with a Mr. Leo Seifman who organized my interviews.</span> <span id="s311">For some reason the two of us were naturals.</span> <span id="s312">I had written to a number of rabbis for my research.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Did you ever tell them about your own background?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: No....I’m ashamed to say that, but....</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Well, this is a very major thing and it’s difficult to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: The first people I ever told were the Wolnerman’s (and to think they forgot who he was!</span> <span id="s317">I guess he didn’t say it that clearly.)</span> <span id="s318">only because the professor running the course was late.</span> <span id="s319">I was going to have Mr. Seifman come up but he didn’t want to and that’s how I got hold of the Wolnermans.</span> <span id="s320">Rabbi Feingold (of Kenosha) knew of the New Americans (Club) in Milwaukee where Mr. Wolnerman was.</span> <span id="s321">They were wonderful people and we just stayed and stayed and talked, and I said I had this problem and he said; ‘How about you and your family come up (to Milwaukee) and have dinner.’</span> <span id="s322">It was just a remarkable gift because I had a kind of European sense of what my company----that sounds very selfish because actually it was Professor Markison’s company and I was (illegible) a kind of agent trying to live down an embarrassment (because Seifman didn’t come).</span> <span id="s323">And the professor is a driven man and he said: ‘Are you sure that (illegible) these Jews are going to come?’</span> <span id="s324">And I said ‘Yes’.</span> <span id="s325">And I just grew up with flowers and little gifts, kind of a way of saying thank you...well the people have already done you a favor by just coming.</span> <span id="s326">I gave Mrs. Wolnerman flowers and a small gift to Mr. Wolnerman and, I don’t know; I cannot explain the evening other than to say that I had never gone thru such a wondrous experience in a long, long time.</span> <span id="s327">We sat and had coffee.</span> <span id="s328">In class I sat in the back and Mr. Wolnerman asked Professor Markison if I could be a little closer.</span> <span id="s329">So I just sat a little off to the side of them not in the spotlight but just---close.</span> <span id="s330">And he would look at me from time to time and I’d nod or smile.</span> <span id="s331">When it was over I found myself for no other reason than just the emotion of the moment, walking up to him and hugging him and, um, we both cried.</span> <span id="s332">And then everyone left and I said to them: ‘Would you like to see our chapel?</span> <span id="s333">So we just talked in the chapel.</span> <span id="s334">I told them about myself, a lot, and didn’t feel ashamed.</span> <span id="s335">And they were both so gracious.</span> <span id="s336">They invited me up to meet people from that area (Lithuania).</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: It may be that you’ll find, in pursuing the family tree that you have 40 relatives here</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yes, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Interviewer Notes Robert Karras is Director of Security at Cartage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s341">He came to my attention quite by accident.</span> <span id="s342">A Holocaust survivor from Milwaukee, named Israel Wolnerman, gave a talk at the college.</span> <span id="s343">Bob Karras drove him to the classroom and mentioned, in passing that he was a child of survivors, but was also a Christian Brother.</span> <span id="s344">When Wolnerman mentioned the incident to me, he no longer remembered the college or the person.</span> <span id="s345">He thought it was a professor who told him this.</span> <span id="s346">After numerous calls and some deductive reasoning, I tracked him down.</span> <span id="s347">Unfortunately, his father was, and is very ill and he could not talk.</span> <span id="s348">Nevertheless, we arranged an interview for later and what follows is that interview.</span> <span id="s349">I was especially intrigued because although I knew, intuitively, that survivors had sometimes converted, this was rare and vibrant.</span> <span id="s350">It was much more likely in certain European countries.</span> <span id="s351">Moreover, this was a case where the parents had not only converted, they had done so secretly, never telling their children, whom they raised as Catholics, that they were once Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0051 PAGE 10</span></p> <p><span id="s353">PAGE</span></p></body></html>
