one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2">NP: Good morning, Hanna.</span> <span id="s3">This is Natalie Packel, Tuesday, April the 25th, talking with Hanna Silver.</span> <span id="s4">Hanna has brought many pictures from Berlin, Germany, and she will be giving me an account; she will be giving the Archive a historic account of Old Berlin as well as personal experiences.</span> <span id="s5">And we begin.</span> <span id="s6">Good morning, Hanna.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">HS: Good morning, Natalie.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">NP: Hanna, could you tell me a little bit about your beginnings, where you were born, something about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">HS: Both of my parents were born in Sudeten, which at that time was a part of Austria bordering on Germany.</span> <span id="s10">They left there and they went to live in Berlin.</span> <span id="s11">After 1918 this area became part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s12">Then after Hitler came to power, it became part of Germany again.</span> <span id="s13">Then after World War II it became Czechoslovakia again.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Berlin in this apartment house in center city.1 It was a very solid building.</span> <span id="s15">Most of the people in there were government employees, teachers, and some were retired people.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">NP: Was there a name for the section?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">HS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s18">They called it Louisenstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">NP: How do you spell that, Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">HS: L-O-U-I-S-, Louis, Louisenstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">NP: E-N-, L-O-U-I-S-E-N-...</span></p> <p><span id="s22">HS: And it was very, very stable.</span> <span id="s23">Nobody ever moved out.</span> <span id="s24">Everybody knew the other tenants and a few girls went to school with me.</span> <span id="s25">So it was a very close knit neighborhood.</span> <span id="s26">Most of them, I would say all of them, were middle class, and there came a time when nobody had anything.</span> <span id="s27">This was right after the--nobody had any money after the inflation.</span> <span id="s28">Here are some photographs I brought you.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">HS: And they were taken about five months after the end of the war.</span> <span id="s31">But these pictures are exactly the way they looked at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s32">Number one, two, and three is a picture of Spittelmarkt, a center city important traffic point.</span> <span id="s33">There was a subway station, and it was the end of Leipziger Strasse, a main artery lined with major department stores like Wertheim, Herman Tietz.</span> <span id="s34">There were fine specialty shops, boutiques, and such.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">NP: Excuse me, Hanna.</span> <span id="s36">Spittelmarkt...</span></p> <p><span id="s37">HS: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">NP: Is that the name of the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">HS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">NP: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">HS: This is the name of one place.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">NP: The shopping...</span></p> <p><span id="s43">HS: Like you say Greenwood Place.</span> <span id="s44">The name, this was called, this is a subway station...</span></p> <p><span id="s45">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">HS: And there is a--this is here the place here.</span> <span id="s47">You can see this was...</span></p> <p><span id="s48">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">HS: Called Spittelmarkt.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">HS: So the trolley stopped there and it was called Spittelmarkt.</span> <span id="s52">The subway stopped there.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">NP: And this is photo number one.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">HS: Now in that area, between Spittelmarkt and Doenhofplatz were many, many offices.</span> <span id="s57">And the whole textile industry which was significant was located in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">NP: I see, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">HS: One, two, and three.</span> <span id="s60">One, two, and three.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">NP: The entire area it looked like was...</span></p> <p><span id="s62">HS: Was this, it’s one large place...</span></p> <p><span id="s63">NP: Was completely devastated.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">HS: That you changed trolley cars and subway and all that.</span> <span id="s65">But there were, it was a lot of traffic at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">NP: All right, and so you would say this is immediately after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">HS: Yah, this is what actually happened before the war ended.</span> <span id="s68">These pictures and the destruction of these buildings happened on February 3rd.</span> <span id="s69">On that day most of the center city was destroyed, in a few hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">NP: Did you know anybody who had businesses in this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">HS: Yes, of course, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">HS: So now we come to picture four, five, six, and seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">HS: This is, I call them historic Old Berlin.</span> <span id="s76">The city of Berlin is 500 years old, but many original buildings--churches mostly--are much older than that.</span> <span id="s77">So 700 years ago was already the city of Berlin.</span> <span id="s78">Now here is a picture of the burned-out castle.</span> <span id="s79">And this is located on the river Spree.</span> <span id="s80">And here you see the iron work on the bridge across the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">NP: Beautiful, beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">NP: Iron work and beautiful architecture.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">HS: Yeah, well, it’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s85">NP: I see it’s still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s87">And there were several buildings.</span> <span id="s88">One was a dome, one was a castle.</span> <span id="s89">They were all, in one day they were all destroyed.</span> <span id="s90">Number five--this is here an old neighborhood, along, that is the canal, along this canal.</span> <span id="s91">And here you can see what the last days of the war produced.</span> <span id="s92">In order to keep the Russian tanks from just rolling into the city there were so-called tank traps.</span> <span id="s93">So, in a ridiculous way with the most primitive sources, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s94">NP: They were barriers for the tanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">HS: Barriers.</span> <span id="s96">They took vans, moving vans, and filled them with a few rocks and put them in the middle of the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">HS: So what the tanks, the Russian tanks did, they by-passed them and razed the houses, the buildings to the left and to the right.</span> <span id="s99">So it didn’t deter them for more than five minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">NP: Were these private dwellings that I see on...</span></p> <p><span id="s101">HS: All, all of it is private dwellings.</span> <span id="s102">Now here...</span></p> <p><span id="s103">NP: That’s picture number five.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s105">Now here you have number six.</span> <span id="s106">You see the canal I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s107">On both sides the old buildings, and here again you see this very beautiful wrought iron work.</span> <span id="s108">And here is a historic bridge in the background which I don’t have a picture of.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">NP: Hanna, where did these pictures come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">HS: I took them.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">NP: You took them personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">HS: I took them, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">NP: I see.</span> <span id="s114">You went all through Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">HS: No, just my...</span></p> <p><span id="s116">NP: Just your immediate area.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">HS: My immediate, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">NP: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">HS: There were for the longest time there was no traffic whatsoever.</span> <span id="s120">There was no trolley car.</span> <span id="s121">The subway was, and people were bombed out.</span> <span id="s122">They didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s123">So they went down to the subway tracks and Goebbels opened the floodgates.</span> <span id="s124">And for months at a time, bodies were floating in the, on the tracks and the tunnels...</span></p> <p><span id="s125">NP: Of the subways.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">HS: Of the subways.</span> <span id="s127">Now here is number seven.</span> <span id="s128">You see one of the oldest churches, I think it’s Nikolai Church, with very tall, very slender steeple.</span> <span id="s129">It’s also com-...</span></p> <p><span id="s130">NP: Spires up, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">HS: Spire, yeah.</span> <span id="s132">And it’s also completely destroyed and all the houses around there.</span> <span id="s133">Now not far is our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s134">The apartment houses are much newer.</span> <span id="s135">Maybe they were 30 years old, 25 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">NP: Is that in Louisenstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">HS: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s138">NP: That’s your neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">HS: Right, yeah.</span> <span id="s140">This is not Louisenstadt, my neighborhood, but it’s adjoining.</span> <span id="s141">So our house was very, very solidly built and had tile floors in the hallway, stained glass in the upstairs stairways.</span> <span id="s142">Woodworks, banisters were all in carved woodwork.</span> <span id="s143">And it was, as I said before, very solid...</span></p> <p><span id="s144">NP: Truly a work...</span></p> <p><span id="s145">HS: With...</span></p> <p><span id="s146">NP: Oh, with such, a work of art, such emphasis on detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">HS: But it was not elegant in any way.</span> <span id="s148">It was just solid citizen, middle class citizen, everything.</span> <span id="s149">And as I said the, some people they lived there already since day one.</span> <span id="s150">And nobody moved.</span> <span id="s151">And then people, it wasn’t common to move around like people now move.</span> <span id="s152">So people usually lived there, I would be still living there.</span> <span id="s153">Nobody moved.</span> <span id="s154">Now we come to number eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">HS: Across the street from our apartment house was a church.</span> <span id="s157">It was called Louisenstadt Church.</span> <span id="s158">And that was about seven, I think it was 700 years old.</span> <span id="s159">And it had a very tall spire which disappeared.</span> <span id="s160">It was hit by a mine and by fire bombs and all that.</span> <span id="s161">And here you see in picture number nine, you look through the burned out church.</span> <span id="s162">And here in picture number ten you see our apartment--the windows of our apartment through the inside.</span> <span id="s163">This is the inside of the church.</span> <span id="s164">So this is the amazing thing.</span> <span id="s165">When you looked at the street it looked as if everything was O.K.</span> <span id="s166">But it was only the front of the building that was standing.</span> <span id="s167">The insides--I’ll show you in the next one--the inside, here is the bell that fell down.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">NP: From the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">HS: From the church, and was lying there on the steps.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">NP: I see.</span> <span id="s171">So we’re looking through archways actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">HS: No, these are...</span></p> <p><span id="s173">NP: Or are...</span></p> <p><span id="s174">HS: The windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">NP: The windows in the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">HS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">NP: Of course they...</span></p> <p><span id="s178">HS: And they’re blown out.</span> <span id="s179">Here, this is the inside of the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">NP: And the in-...</span></p> <p><span id="s181">HS: And the, all these windows were blown out so you look through the burnt out windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">NP: Where were you living at the time?</span> <span id="s183">Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">HS: Here, in this apartment we were living, right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">NP: O.K., O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">HS: Here is the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">NP: Actually I meant...</span></p> <p><span id="s188">HS: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s189">NP: After it was bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">HS: I’ll come to that a little later, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">NP: We’ll come to that, very good.</span> <span id="s192">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">HS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s194">Now, number eleven is our apartment house.</span> <span id="s195">It was what you called a double house.</span> <span id="s196">There were, the number was 37-38.</span> <span id="s197">And this here, that last mark, this is our apartment.</span> <span id="s198">And this here is the ground floor.</span> <span id="s199">I have here just the ground floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">NP: Oh I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">HS: And what you see here, this little pile is the ashes of five stories of building--all the floors, all the furniture, the beds, the tables, the chairs.</span> <span id="s202">Everything was just this little pile here.</span> <span id="s203">And here is a little marker.</span> <span id="s204">This is the place where I found my mother lying here.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">NP: It’s so sad.</span> <span id="s206">Mmm.</span> <span id="s207">Such devastation.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">NP: Hanna, what does this say here?</span> <span id="s210">Do you...</span></p> <p><span id="s211">HS: Well it said butter.</span> <span id="s212">There used to be, in the next building used to be a store, a little store, a Papa/Mama store.</span> <span id="s213">And they sold butter.</span> <span id="s214">And this is still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">NP: The sign.</span> <span id="s216">It said butter.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">HS: Now we have number thirteen, where you see part of our building.</span> <span id="s218">And adjoining is the neighboring apartment house.</span> <span id="s219">There was nothing left whatsoever.</span> <span id="s220">And here is number fourteen.</span> <span id="s221">This is our corner.</span> <span id="s222">This is called Alte Jacob Street.</span> <span id="s223">And this is here it’s Sebastian Street.</span> <span id="s224">It’s just our street here.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">NP: Alte Jacob.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">HS: Yeah, it’s marked there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">NP: Alte.</span> <span id="s228">It’s all marked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">HS: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s230">We come to number fifteen.</span> <span id="s231">And I mentioned to you before the primitive tank traps.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">HS: And here you can see, here is the danger in how the tanks bypass the trap.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">NP: They went around.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">HS: Yeah, they went around there.</span> <span id="s236">Yet it took them a long time to take Berlin.</span> <span id="s237">It took them weeks.</span> <span id="s238">We used to say the biggest city of the world is Berlin.</span> <span id="s239">It took the Russians six weeks to go just through the suburbs.</span> <span id="s240">And we have here number sixteen, the remnant of a neighboring street.</span> <span id="s241">And it shows you here the total destruction.</span> <span id="s242">So where there was a street there were holes and where there were houses they were just pieces of, chunks of houses.</span> <span id="s243">And the same is here, number seventeen, and number eighteen.</span> <span id="s244">So there is practically nothing left, neither houses nor street.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">NP: And there was, it was winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">NP: There was snow on the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">HS: Well it happened on February 3rd, on that one day.</span> <span id="s249">Now here, this is six months later.</span> <span id="s250">Here is a picture of a GI taking pictures of all this devastation.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">NP: I see.</span> <span id="s252">He’s here with his camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s254">Now here, this is number twenty.</span> <span id="s255">This picture was taken in November of ‘45 after we had already a quartripartite government, that is, Berlin was divided into four sectors--United States, Russia, France, and Great Britain.</span> <span id="s256">And each sector had a separate government but together they were united and had their monthly meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">HS: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s259">NP: Do I see the word Eisenhower?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">HS: Yes, Eisenhower was in charge of that, and I met all his GIs, his honor guard.</span> <span id="s261">And they, well, I’ll come to that later.</span> <span id="s262">They asked me to become the photographer for the American Red Cross.</span> <span id="s263">With...</span></p> <p><span id="s264">NP: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">HS: Yeah, and the 82nd Airborne was there, the first ones to come.</span> <span id="s266">And I worked there as long as they were there.</span> <span id="s267">Now I have...</span></p> <p><span id="s268">NP: That was quite a job you had.</span> <span id="s269">Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">HS: I was a very...</span></p> <p><span id="s271">NP: A good photographer.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">HS: No, but I spoke English so well everybody was so happy that they could talk to me.</span> <span id="s273">And I made friends with some of them.</span> <span id="s274">I still am in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">NP: Where did you learn English?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">HS: In school.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">NP: You were taught English?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">HS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s279">Now here is a picture of myself, which was taken in the darkest days, when it got really bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">NP: During the war, Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">HS: That was during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">NP: You were so stylish and...</span></p> <p><span id="s283">HS: No I was, this is a..</span> <span id="s284">.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">NP: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">HS: A beret and after the war--I have a picture here--after the war I wore a beret that I made from an old half-burned plush of a sofa.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">NP: You made the beret?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">HS: And it, beret, and everybody...</span></p> <p><span id="s289">NP: From the fabric on the sofa!</span></p> <p><span id="s290">HS: Yeah, and everybody in the building who wanted to have a red beret got the beret from the plush of the sofa.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">NP: You were wonderful with a needle and thread at that time, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">HS: I was born with a needle and thread.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">NP: Oh!</span> <span id="s294">Hanna, where were you living at the time that this was taken--summer of 1944--in the building?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">HS: Well, I, let me say here I want, I went to the Victoria Lyceum, which is the equivalent for girls what a Gymnasium is for boys.</span> <span id="s296">And I got a very fine education.</span> <span id="s297">I spoke German, English and French fluently, conversation, grammar and everything.</span> <span id="s298">However, my cousins, who all were younger than I were, went to school under Hitler and had to stop schooling at 14.</span> <span id="s299">They were not permitted to go any longer to any school...</span></p> <p><span id="s300">NP: As Jewi-...</span></p> <p><span id="s301">HS: Young?</span> <span id="s302">14, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">NP: As Jewish children...</span></p> <p><span id="s304">HS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">NP: Were prohibited.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">HS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s307">And then I wanted to mention, on February 3rd came the...</span></p> <p><span id="s308">NP: 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">HS: Then, right, 1945, the biggest air raid.</span> <span id="s310">I had left for work and this, because our office was burned out a few months earlier, completely destroyed, so we had to go to a suburb where our warehouse was.</span> <span id="s311">And so I wanted to take the day off and I wasn’t given permission so I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s312">And my mother stayed home.</span> <span id="s313">So here I have an eye-witness report.</span> <span id="s314">I’ll give you this.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">HS: This is from a book written by Nelson.</span> <span id="s317">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s318">NP: This is an account that was in a book...</span></p> <p><span id="s319">HS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">NP: By this, what is his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">HS: Nelson.</span> <span id="s322">I’ll give it to you here.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">HS: And the report said that they heard screams for help from a woman inside the burning window.</span> <span id="s325">She was aflame.</span> <span id="s326">They found her later on the pavement, naked with clothes burned, a shriveled, black corpse.</span> <span id="s327">The policemen later, this report says, wrote down, batch of seven.</span> <span id="s328">They said that about 40,000 people lost their lives on that one day but there is no exact number possible because so many old people, especially they sat in their basements and didn’t want to leave even when they were nudged by others.</span> <span id="s329">They said, “Where shall we go?”</span> <span id="s330">Because there was no place to go.</span> <span id="s331">And the Nazis were afraid of epidemics and they sealed entire blocks off.</span> <span id="s332">And only years and years later when they wanted to reconstruct or when they wanted to build there or dig up ground they found many, many basements with people still sitting intact on their chairs the way they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">NP: And this bombing was done by...</span></p> <p><span id="s334">HS: By the Allied.</span> <span id="s335">By day it was the Americans, by night the British.</span> <span id="s336">I think it was like that.</span> <span id="s337">Now between February 3rd, and the end of the war, which was May 8th, 1945, I was bombed out several more times and I had a collection of keys without doors to open.</span> <span id="s338">Now the reason that I took a place, a furnished room, because I didn’t want to give up the right to a place of my own.</span> <span id="s339">If you did not, then you never had, were entitled to rent anything.</span> <span id="s340">So I just maintained it.</span> <span id="s341">So when I come to the new house and look, I think, Gee, that was a house?</span> <span id="s342">I see it isn’t there anymore.</span> <span id="s343">So I ended up with a key and no more house.</span> <span id="s344">Of course there were from then on day and night raids.</span> <span id="s345">And every time a certain amount of houses were destroyed.</span> <span id="s346">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s347">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">HS: Then what we saw, the last, especially the last weeks, “traitors” (in quotation marks) were strung up on lamp posts and were dangling there.</span> <span id="s349">And when you walked you had to watch out that you didn’t run into a dangling corpse.</span> <span id="s350">Because this was a warning to everybody, “Do not open your mouth,” and they called it defeatism.</span> <span id="s351">“Do not say anything bad or you will hang up there too,” which shuts up people pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">NP: They were supposed to be an example.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">HS: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s354">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s355">NP: Yes, Hanna, we continue with picture number...</span></p> <p><span id="s356">HS: Twenty-two...</span></p> <p><span id="s357">NP: Twenty-two.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">HS: Which was taken in November, 1945...</span></p> <p><span id="s359">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">HS: At the American Red Cross in Berlin.</span> <span id="s361">And here I met hundreds and hundreds of GIs who were very happy to be able to talk English to me and...</span></p> <p><span id="s362">NP: I’ll bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">HS: I became good friends with many of them.</span> <span id="s364">And this picture was taken in the American Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">NP: Oh this is beautiful.</span> <span id="s366">This is the one where I say you look like Celeste Holmes.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">HS: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">NP: Blonde and lovely, and blue eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">HS: And then I..</span> <span id="s370">.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">NP: And lithe.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">HS: Have picture number twenty-three, which was taken at the British Red Cross, on top of the radio tower in Berlin where I, upon request I started another photo studio.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">NP: You had a studio?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">HS: Well I, they invited me to make a photo studio.</span> <span id="s375">And there was no room so they took a piece of hallway and overnight transformed it into a photo studio.</span> <span id="s376">And we took thousands of pictures of GIs and they sent them home to grandparents and parents and girlfriends and all.</span> <span id="s377">So we were very, very busy.</span> <span id="s378">I worked about...</span></p> <p><span id="s379">NP: And the “we” that you’re describing, you worked for...</span></p> <p><span id="s380">HS: I worked, we were individual...</span></p> <p><span id="s381">NP: Photographers?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">HS: No, I just was...</span></p> <p><span id="s383">NP: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">HS: The only one hired.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">NP: For the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">HS: The Red Cross.</span> <span id="s387">And I..</span> <span id="s388">.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">NP: For the American Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">HS: And we ran the business with taking pictures and ordering pictures and it was a whole production.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">NP: O.K., so the pictures that you took in the beginning were of the devastation of the war.</span> <span id="s392">You took...</span></p> <p><span id="s393">HS: Well this was one thing and then this was a bread and butter issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">NP: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">HS: Because there was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s396">And when you worked for the American [Red] Cross you were entitled to all the donuts you could eat.</span> <span id="s397">And after a while you couldn’t, didn’t like the sight of donuts anymore.</span> <span id="s398">But it was, and you were not permitted to take any out.</span> <span id="s399">Some people lost their job for taking out a couple of donuts--their own donuts--for their children.</span> <span id="s400">So I smuggled out every night two donuts which I gave to my cousin and my aunt and this helped them to survive.</span> <span id="s401">Because they were made in a factory in the building and they produced 150,000 donuts per day...</span></p> <p><span id="s402">NP: Oh my!</span></p> <p><span id="s403">HS: Which were delivered to all the Red Cross clubs all over.</span> <span id="s404">So we could eat all we wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">NP: Wow.</span> <span id="s406">In those times it meant a lot, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">HS: People stood in the street and sniffed the smell of Crisco.</span> <span id="s408">They were baked in Crisco.</span> <span id="s409">And they were good.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">NP: I’ll bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">NP: After doing without for so long.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s414">And the only food we got were beans, bean soup.</span> <span id="s415">I never did like beans so the only food was beans.</span> <span id="s416">Because the American MP who was to guard the building, in cahoots with some German kitchen workers, sold the food on the black market.</span> <span id="s417">And we got only the beans.</span> <span id="s418">But it was better than nothing.</span> <span id="s419">It helped us to survive.</span> <span id="s420">I still don’t like beans.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">NP: I don’t blame you.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">HS: So here is another...</span></p> <p><span id="s423">NP: Oh yes, here...</span></p> <p><span id="s424">HS: Twenty-three.</span> <span id="s425">This is also from that...</span></p> <p><span id="s426">NP: This is number twenty-three.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">NP: After the war in 1945 then.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">HS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">NP: You continued to be a photographer for the American Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">HS: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">NP: And the...</span></p> <p><span id="s433">HS: Then here is number twenty-four.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">NP: Beautiful, beautiful pictures.</span> <span id="s435">Did you have a dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s437">We had a dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">NP: Here’s a beautiful photo of yourself, number twenty-four, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">HS: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">NP: And this was your own dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s442">And I lived with my aunt who didn’t want dogs.</span> <span id="s443">This was my first problem.</span> <span id="s444">But I took him to work and the MP agreed to have the dog in.</span> <span id="s445">And here is a picture--I hope I get a copy for you--these are the survivors.</span> <span id="s446">These are an uncle and three, one, two uncles, and three aunts and two cousins who survived in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">NP: When did they leave Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">HS: ‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">NP: In 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">HS: Yes, and these three cousins joined the British Army.</span> <span id="s451">He was an officer.</span> <span id="s452">He was a sergeant.</span> <span id="s453">And the third cousin was killed in Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s454">He was, he volunteered to be a parachuter.</span> <span id="s455">He was killed in Dunkirk.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">NP: Did some, so some of the family stayed behind and some went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">HS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s458">And one aunt was taken to Theresienstadt and see, she survived, because I had promised her she will survive and her daughter will get married, and she will have grandchildren and great grandchildren.</span> <span id="s459">Believe it or not, she came back from Theresienstadt because she was in a hospital with a broken arm so she wasn’t shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">NP: Oh that saved her.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">HS: So she survived, and she came back.</span> <span id="s462">Her daughter got married, and has a son.</span> <span id="s463">And he got married to a British girl and they have two children.</span> <span id="s464">So she said, “Always believe Hanna.</span> <span id="s465">She knew it.</span> <span id="s466">She kept me going.</span> <span id="s467">Her words were in my ear.</span> <span id="s468">I held out because she had told me.</span> <span id="s469">And she was so right.”</span> <span id="s470">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s471">NP: You were an inspiration to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">HS: Well that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">NP: Hanna, at this time, when your aunt was in Theresienstadt, where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">HS: I was still in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">NP: Living in your same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">HS: In the same house, with the same neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">NP: All through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">HS: All through the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">NP: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">HS: And here is an old picture.</span> <span id="s481">This is I think from 1906.</span> <span id="s482">This is my mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s483">NP: Beautiful!</span></p> <p><span id="s484">HS: Here’s two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">NP: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s486">HS: She was killed in Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">NP: In...</span></p> <p><span id="s488">HS: And she...</span></p> <p><span id="s489">NP: Was she in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s491">She was deported from Berlin in ‘42.</span> <span id="s492">I went with her to the, to the place where they, it was a burned-out synagogue where they assembled.</span> <span id="s493">And she was there for a week.</span> <span id="s494">And somebody went back and forth with little notes and little whatever she asked for, and some food.</span> <span id="s495">He went back and forth from us to her.</span> <span id="s496">And then they took them away.</span> <span id="s497">They assembled them until they had enough.</span> <span id="s498">And then we learned from this person that she was on the transport to Riga.</span> <span id="s499">And she is also mentioned in our Gedenkbuch [Memorial Book].</span></p> <p><span id="s500">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">HS: So this one is this aunt who immigrated to England.</span> <span id="s502">And this one was killed.</span> <span id="s503">And my mother was killed in an air raid.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">NP: Beautiful women, just beautiful.</span> <span id="s505">And these...</span></p> <p><span id="s506">HS: So this is number twenty-five.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">NP: Number twenty-five.</span> <span id="s508">And these two gentlemen in number twen-...</span></p> <p><span id="s509">HS: Well this is her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">HS: And this is her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">NP: Did he survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">HS: He died of TB after World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">NP: Oh, oh, oh.</span> <span id="s515">Then you did not ha-, after this cousin...</span></p> <p><span id="s516">HS: This is my...</span></p> <p><span id="s517">NP: That’d be the...</span></p> <p><span id="s518">HS: Aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">NP: Aunt, your mother’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">HS: We were very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">NP: When your...</span></p> <p><span id="s522">HS: Very close, yeah.</span> <span id="s523">Because--oh, I didn’t bring the picture--she had a daughter exactly my age.</span> <span id="s524">And we grew up like twins.</span> <span id="s525">We were very, and she was killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s526">So I have in my papers the last note where she says, “Tonight I will go away.”</span> <span id="s527">They never said, “I will be deported.”</span> <span id="s528">“I will go away.”</span> <span id="s529">And she sent us a postal card with the last...</span></p> <p><span id="s530">NP: It’s so heartbreaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">HS: And she is also in the Gedenkbuch.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">NP: It’s heartbreaking.</span> <span id="s533">Hanna, did you feel, did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s534">HS: So in number twenty-five...</span></p> <p><span id="s535">NP: Number twenty-five.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">NP: When this aunt was deported and her daughter and so forth, did you feel that you had to go into hiding at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">HS: No, because- Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s539">NP: This is side B, Natalie Packel and Hanna Silver talking about her war time experiences with many pictures before us showing Hanna’s family and showing the devastation of the war--bombed out buildings and so forth.</span> <span id="s540">And I was just asking Hanna if after her dear aunt and cousin were deported to the camps did she feel that she had to go into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">HS: And the answer was no, because people who were hiding didn’t know where to hide.</span> <span id="s542">And I was in touch with three ladies who were in hiding.</span> <span id="s543">And one of them was the, I knew only one of them, the others I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s544">And I, that’s another story, she came from a very, very rich family, actually the family of my boss.</span> <span id="s545">And I urged her to take some money and put it aside because Jews were permitted only to take out 300 Mark from their accounts.</span> <span id="s546">And she says, “I don’t need money.</span> <span id="s547">I know what I’ll do.</span> <span id="s548">I have my Veronal,” which is the sleeping pills.</span> <span id="s549">And most...</span></p> <p><span id="s550">NP: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">HS: Veronal.</span> <span id="s552">Most people who intended to commit suicide had their Veronal.</span> <span id="s553">Ten, fifteen pills would do, and I had gone to our family doctor and had told him about the possibility of deportation.</span> <span id="s554">And people were deported separately, not together.</span> <span id="s555">And he gave me a prescription for ten Veronal, which cost about $1, to have it.</span> <span id="s556">And he, I remember when I told him, he sat for about five minutes, because his career, his life, his family, everything was on the line, and after that he said, “Yes.</span> <span id="s557">I will do it.</span> <span id="s558">Ten will do.”</span> <span id="s559">And he gave me the prescription.</span> <span id="s560">And I got for $1 them, and I made a little side pocket in my mother’s dresses to put the pills in in case ever it comes to a surprise pick-up, that she could take it.</span> <span id="s561">And I had promised her to give them to her mixed with raspberry syrup that they were not too bitter.</span> <span id="s562">Fortunately I didn’t have to do it.</span> <span id="s563">But I know somebody who did it with his father and he never can sleep since, because he said he might have survived in the camp.</span> <span id="s564">These were all problems you had to solve with just yourself.</span> <span id="s565">You couldn’t ask anybody.</span> <span id="s566">“Is it right to kill my mother?</span> <span id="s567">Is it not right?”</span> <span id="s568">What is better?</span> <span id="s569">So for my mother it was in a way the best that she did not have to be separated from me, did not have to be deported, didn’t have to live in misery and lose all her dignity.</span> <span id="s570">Of course she would have chosen what she had, but it is beyond description.</span> <span id="s571">So you can imagine I don’t like fire places.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">NP: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">HS: And the worst of it was that there is no place where I can go, because they just scooped up the dead people and threw them in mass graves.</span> <span id="s574">I don’t even know in which mass grave she is.</span> <span id="s575">Somewhere.</span> <span id="s576">So I mentioned to you about the people in our building, though I don’t think anybody was especially politically active.</span> <span id="s577">But most of them belonged politically, to the center.</span> <span id="s578">When they was to vote they would vote Social Democrat or maybe the Zentrum, which was Catholic.</span> <span id="s579">We had very few Catholics, hardly any.</span> <span id="s580">Most people were Lutheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">HS: And there were some Catholics, about the same few as Jews.</span> <span id="s583">It was in percentage almost--from what I know; it’s not an official figure.</span> <span id="s584">And in the back of our building, in the back wing, were the offices of the Social Democratic Party.</span> <span id="s585">And most of the people were either registered Social Democrats or leaned towards it.</span> <span id="s586">So there was not one Nazi.</span> <span id="s587">And when Hitler came to power you see the big front, we have.</span> <span id="s588">And there was not one Swastika flag out.</span> <span id="s589">So they rang the doorbells and said, “How is it you don’t have flags hanging out?”</span> <span id="s590">So we said, “Well, we don’t have one.”</span> <span id="s591">So they said, “We’ll bring you one.”</span> <span id="s592">And then they wanted to hang one from the roof and we said, “Oh, this would collapse,” and all.</span> <span id="s593">So we never had one, and to stand out, two big buildings without a single flag, why when you came to a young community with young people, from each window was a flag with a Swastika on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">NP: Swastika.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">HS: And this, in this building where we lived and in this whole neighborhood, people knew everybody and liked everybody.</span> <span id="s596">When I was a child they called me, “Our little sunshine.”</span> <span id="s597">So some knew; some didn’t.</span> <span id="s598">We didn’t ask people what they knew.</span> <span id="s599">But they told me after the war that they had regularly questionnaires, “Are there any Jews left?”</span> <span id="s600">And they said, “No, no, no.”</span> <span id="s601">So, whether it was ignorance or purpose, we never knew, and they didn’t tell us.</span> <span id="s602">And we thought nobody knows.</span> <span id="s603">And we didn’t feel safe.</span> <span id="s604">But we did not feel as insecure if you go into a neighborhood where you have no idea and also, where could you go?</span> <span id="s605">Nobody would have taken you.</span> <span id="s606">An old woman and a young girl?</span> <span id="s607">Who would take us?</span> <span id="s608">And I have now learned enough here with my work with the Archive the difficulty people had.</span> <span id="s609">It wasn’t only the shelter; you had to eat too.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">HS: And the danger from, and there was just no question.</span> <span id="s612">You didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s613">So you stayed.</span> <span id="s614">And as it proved it was not a good thing to do but it wasn’t the worst kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">NP: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">HS: Now, most people were, as I said, middle of the road people.</span> <span id="s617">There was no extreme.</span> <span id="s618">There were no Communists and there were no Nazis.</span> <span id="s619">So, I would say most people were apolitical.</span> <span id="s620">They were not antisemites.</span> <span id="s621">They were not pro and anti.</span> <span id="s622">They lived their quiet lives and...</span></p> <p><span id="s623">NP: Feel as comfortable with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">HS: And I felt comfortable and my mother did.</span> <span id="s625">The basic thing was that we felt loved by everybody.</span> <span id="s626">Rightly or wrongly, but it proved to be the true thing because they really did like us.</span> <span id="s627">And nobody ever opened his mouth to anybody or to the authorities.</span> <span id="s628">And we did.</span> <span id="s629">Number one is we had no idea what to do and where to go.</span> <span id="s630">At that point, in the beginning we thought, How long can he last?</span> <span id="s631">He can’t last so we’ll survive him.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">NP: Hitler, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s634">And by the time it was bad you had no way of going out.</span> <span id="s635">And we didn’t know where to go so you stay.</span> <span id="s636">So it was not a matter of choice.</span> <span id="s637">There was no way of choosing what to do.</span> <span id="s638">So the simple thing was to hang on.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">NP: And since you had a feeling of acceptance...</span></p> <p><span id="s640">HS: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">NP: Of...</span></p> <p><span id="s642">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">NP: From the people that you lived with all these years.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">HS: Well everybody, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">NP: Yes, this seemed a comfortable thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s647">And as they’re not dead yet I’m still in touch with everybody.</span> <span id="s648">So there was such an outpouring of, oh, I don’t want to go into the details...</span></p> <p><span id="s649">NP: No, that’s O.K., we...</span></p> <p><span id="s650">HS: But during...</span></p> <p><span id="s651">NP: Have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">HS: During an air raid the mothers with children went to bunkers.</span> <span id="s653">These were very, very heavily secured, with tons of cement.</span> <span id="s654">Well you know what bunkers look like.</span> <span id="s655">And that’s where all mothers with children went every night and slept there, and never heard a sound.</span> <span id="s656">Now we went into the regular basement, which was not even totally underground.</span> <span id="s657">So part of it was above ground, so you heard the bombs.</span> <span id="s658">And the worst noise was when the windows were broken and they fell down.</span> <span id="s659">This was a tremendous--so, sometimes you had problems and you cannot run upstairs.</span> <span id="s660">And you sat there.</span> <span id="s661">And the way people were nice and helped to cover you up that you could do what you couldn’t do upstairs.</span> <span id="s662">So there was really so much affection and all that.</span> <span id="s663">So we had no way of going anywhere and we felt not too secure but, best possible.</span> <span id="s664">So we stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">NP: To be surrounded by those that you knew and...</span></p> <p><span id="s666">HS: We knew and they knew us, we felt that they really cared for us, and wouldn’t, as they didn’t, give us away.</span> <span id="s667">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s668">NP: That is very fortunate...</span></p> <p><span id="s669">HS: They were...</span></p> <p><span id="s670">NP: To be loved.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">HS: One was a house warden.</span> <span id="s672">One was a block warden.</span> <span id="s673">And they told us about the questionnaires and that they always said, “No, no, no.”</span> <span id="s674">There was another Jewish family and of course nobody knew what happened.</span> <span id="s675">One day you said, “Gee, I haven’t seen them for so long.”</span> <span id="s676">You didn’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s677">So they protected them too.</span> <span id="s678">And yet one day they were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">NP: Hanna, one day we were talking and you had said, “You think the Nazis were bad, when the Russians came the hell began all over again.”</span></p> <p><span id="s680">HS: Well, entirely different, in different ways.</span> <span id="s681">With the Nazi, of course I’m not talking about myself.</span> <span id="s682">I talk about average people.</span> <span id="s683">If you kept your mouth shut, you never said anything, you never did anything, you didn’t have to worry.</span> <span id="s684">And the Russians had the attitude if you killed a thousand, one of them is for sure a guilty one.</span> <span id="s685">Well the “liberation” was something that nobody could have imagined.</span> <span id="s686">Looking at the other side you say, “Look what the Germans did to the Russians.”</span> <span id="s687">Also, the Russian soldier never got paid, and never got furloughs.</span> <span id="s688">They were told, “Wait until you get to Berlin.</span> <span id="s689">That’s your prize.</span> <span id="s690">And then Berlin is yours.”</span> <span id="s691">So they were entitled, and it was Goebbels who declared the total war.</span> <span id="s692">However, we didn’t declare the total war.</span> <span id="s693">And we, not I fortunately, but there were so many suicides you cannot imagine, immediately after the liberation, because, and the rapes.</span> <span id="s694">It wasn’t that one soldier raped one person.</span> <span id="s695">Twenty or thirty raped a girl until she was...</span></p> <p><span id="s696">NP: These were the Russians soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">HS: Dead.</span> <span id="s698">Yes.</span> <span id="s699">And there were excesses.</span> <span id="s700">And then when the Americans came they looked like, they smelled from soap and water and clean and their uniforms pressed and all that.</span> <span id="s701">And they never touched a girl.</span> <span id="s702">The girls were after them.</span> <span id="s703">They had to run from the girls.</span> <span id="s704">But the contrast was so--but after the, immediately after the liberation there came an order.</span> <span id="s705">The Russians ordered, “Remove the rubble or else you get shot.”</span> <span id="s706">So people formed lines and hungry and all did this hard work removing the rubble from the street by the, with their bare hands.</span> <span id="s707">They ordered us to hang out American flags.</span> <span id="s708">I was lucky to be in the American sector.</span> <span id="s709">And I had to make up a flag.</span> <span id="s710">And I didn’t know exactly what an American flag looked like.</span> <span id="s711">I knew the stars.</span> <span id="s712">I didn’t know how many.</span> <span id="s713">And I knew there were stripes.</span> <span id="s714">I didn’t know how many.</span> <span id="s715">And we didn’t have all the coloring.</span> <span id="s716">But with a torn sheet and something else I produced an American flag.</span> <span id="s717">And when they came in we waved and they accepted that.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">NP: Incredible, what one can do, with so little to do so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">HS: Well this was something they had, a lot of experience.</span> <span id="s720">Because when I was a little girl it started out where there was inflation.</span> <span id="s721">And our after school activity, was that mother gave us a little money and a shopping bag and we had to stand in line for potatoes and for bread.</span> <span id="s722">And many times just in front of us it was sold out, so you go home without potatoes and bread and money was only printed on one side.</span> <span id="s723">It didn’t pay to print them, so we used the clean side on the back for scratch paper in school.</span> <span id="s724">So we lived through inflation.</span> <span id="s725">And after the inflation nobody but nobody, at least in our circles, had any money.</span> <span id="s726">So you were not poor.</span> <span id="s727">Money just did not exist for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">NP: What year was this about?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">HS: Well the inflation was 1922 I think when it was over.</span> <span id="s730">So we were in school and we didn’t have, nobody had anything.</span> <span id="s731">Originally the school, this Lyceum, had to be paid for.</span> <span id="s732">But after the war nobody had money so we, they made it for free.</span> <span id="s733">So I got my beautiful education for free.</span> <span id="s734">In the beginning it was $10 a month.</span> <span id="s735">So then nobody had money.</span> <span id="s736">But when you all are in the same boat, nobody had money, there wasn’t one who was rich and one, nobody, we didn’t know money.</span> <span id="s737">We didn’t know pocket money.</span> <span id="s738">We didn’t know allowance.</span> <span id="s739">And you learned to do things, I learned, to do things from nothing, with a little paper, with a little aluminum foil and toys or whatever.</span> <span id="s740">So you learned to make something from nothing.</span> <span id="s741">And even today it comes in very handy.</span> <span id="s742">Now here is such an abundance of everything.</span> <span id="s743">People don’t dream to make a Halloween costume or to do anything.</span> <span id="s744">Or curtains, you buy.</span> <span id="s745">I make all my curtains.</span> <span id="s746">I make for dozens of children Halloween costumes and all that.</span> <span id="s747">I made so many things, because everything is here and you can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">NP: Where do you get all this motivation and strength and I guess...?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">HS: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s750">Either you have it or you don’t have it.</span> <span id="s751">I don’t think you can learn it.</span> <span id="s752">But some people envy me for all the rough times and say, “You wouldn’t be the person, if you wouldn’t have lived through that,” and I assure everybody I would be a very nice person if I would not have had to live through it.</span> <span id="s753">But the...</span></p> <p><span id="s754">NP: But necessity was the mother of invention I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">HS: Yeah, but the good part is that while you are in it, you don’t think.</span> <span id="s756">You just put one foot in front of the other.</span> <span id="s757">You don’t think of consequences or what; for instance the day with the fire with my mother I looked for her and couldn’t find her.</span> <span id="s758">I didn’t, I ran through the flames and all that and I still had no idea.</span> <span id="s759">And people, I saw ran away from me.</span> <span id="s760">Nobody wanted to tell me what really had happened.</span> <span id="s761">So I sat down on the stoop and people said, “Get going!</span> <span id="s762">Get going!</span> <span id="s763">You’re gonna die!”</span> <span id="s764">Because they were right, later on things collapsed and I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s765">I was not suicidal; I just didn’t care.</span> <span id="s766">I thought something is gonna get me, either Hitler or the bombs or something else.</span> <span id="s767">And then after that came a lot of hunger...</span></p> <p><span id="s768">NP: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s769">HS: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">NP: Could you connect at that point with any family?</span> <span id="s771">Did you know where anybody was?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">HS: No, there was no mail whatsoever.</span> <span id="s773">Until the war you could, here I want to tell you how things happened.</span> <span id="s774">The family was in England.</span> <span id="s775">And we had devised, my cousin and I, when we write, what things, certain things means.</span> <span id="s776">So when we said, “Very, we are doing very well,” that meant we are not doing well.</span> <span id="s777">When we said, “We are doing well,” we were doing well.</span> <span id="s778">And then of course everybody wrote about grandfather, which was Hitler.</span> <span id="s779">And we wished God would take him.</span> <span id="s780">He has lived long enough.</span> <span id="s781">So we said, and so then we had to go to the post office with the letter open.</span> <span id="s782">And you had to show your passport if you had one.</span> <span id="s783">And they noted the date in your passport.</span> <span id="s784">And they accepted your letter, stamped and opened.</span> <span id="s785">Then they gave it to a censor.</span> <span id="s786">They censored, and when you received a letter it was properly sealed and no sign that anybody had read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">NP: Incredible.</span> <span id="s788">Incredibly efficient.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">NP: This is...</span></p> <p><span id="s791">HS: I had a friend, she worked for the censor.</span> <span id="s792">She was as anti-Hitler as can be, and they let, they had to mark off everything.</span> <span id="s793">And they let go through a lot of it.</span> <span id="s794">So there was a little form of resistance which helped people by receiving the message that was meant...</span></p> <p><span id="s795">NP: You developed your own code...</span></p> <p><span id="s796">HS: Meant to, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">NP: Within the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">HS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">NP: Hanna did synagogue life play any part of your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">HS: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">NP: With the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">HS: And as I said, we were not members of a synagogue, which helped us, because my aunt, my two aunts were and the first thing they filled out the yellow questionnaires.</span> <span id="s803">And they just took the questionnaires and picked them out from that.</span> <span id="s804">We were not.</span> <span id="s805">And that helped a lot, because they used the membership lists for the deportations.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">NP: Sure, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">HS: Double checking with the police, so we had also good relations to the police.</span> <span id="s808">Now you have never in your life anything to do with the police.</span> <span id="s809">We had to write a; when you wanted to go away for more than three days you had to sign where you go and where you, how long you stay and then when you come back you sign in again.</span> <span id="s810">And there were forms.</span> <span id="s811">And so the guy in the police knew you for years when you come and go and how was your vacation?</span> <span id="s812">I, so then finally my mother nudged me, “We have to go and get finger printed.</span> <span id="s813">They said the Jews have to.”</span> <span id="s814">I said, “I have not registered.</span> <span id="s815">I don’t do it.”</span> <span id="s816">And, and the aunts, the two aunts, they nudged her so she forced me to go with her to the police.</span> <span id="s817">And the guy said, “What do you want?</span> <span id="s818">I know from nothing.</span> <span id="s819">Go back.”</span> <span id="s820">So, me being smart, I go back.</span> <span id="s821">And she kept on nudging so we go back.</span> <span id="s822">And then he said, “I told you to go home.</span> <span id="s823">What do you want?</span> <span id="s824">Don’t bother me!”</span> <span id="s825">And so I said, “Mother, [unclear]” He said, “O.K., she’s foolish enough.</span> <span id="s826">Here I give you a card.</span> <span id="s827">I make you, the young girl, the head of the household with a nice clean card.</span> <span id="s828">And on the back let her sign her name.</span> <span id="s829">Nobody looks at the back.”</span> <span id="s830">And she got that big J on there.</span> <span id="s831">So I was a clean card.</span> <span id="s832">And when they came to find J’s, my card wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s833">Nobody looked there.</span> <span id="s834">So this guy at the police, there were so many little things and I don’t even know all of them, that contributed.</span> <span id="s835">So I can not tell which one was the most significant and which one was not.</span> <span id="s836">The end is that I am sitting here...</span></p> <p><span id="s837">NP: Yes, thank goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">HS: And I..</span> <span id="s839">.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">NP: Thank goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">HS: I do not know why.</span> <span id="s842">That’s why I’m always very, very hesitant.</span> <span id="s843">I don’t want to say anything wrong and I do not know the whole truth.</span> <span id="s844">So somebody in the beginning when I was here, “Oh!”</span></p> <p><span id="s845">NP: What do you mean by truth?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">HS: No, I don’t know who did what and who didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">NP: Oh, that affected your safety.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">HS: And some people...</span></p> <p><span id="s849">NP: That, or removed the “J” or...</span></p> <p><span id="s850">HS: Well, all together...</span></p> <p><span id="s851">NP: The card...</span></p> <p><span id="s852">HS: Saved me.</span> <span id="s853">All together.</span> <span id="s854">But it wasn’t any one person doing any one thing.</span> <span id="s855">It was probably a combination.</span> <span id="s856">And that’s why I’m hesitant.</span> <span id="s857">I don’t want to make up a story and I do not know what really happened in so and so many places.</span> <span id="s858">The fact is that I am sitting here.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">NP: And we are very fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">HS: And so somebody said to me when, in the early days, “So nothing happened to you.</span> <span id="s861">How come?</span> <span id="s862">My relatives are all dead.</span> <span id="s863">How come you sit here?”</span> <span id="s864">I said, “Forgive me.</span> <span id="s865">I don’t know why.”</span> <span id="s866">And when you start, some people say they don’t believe it because, and have, some have very foolish reasons.</span> <span id="s867">They say how all Jews were deported in ‘33.</span> <span id="s868">I say, “Don’t you know?</span> <span id="s869">So tell about ‘37.”</span> <span id="s870">Things went gradually, very gradually.</span> <span id="s871">And you could somehow go on if you lived the way I--then another thing, I had a job working for a Jewish firm.</span> <span id="s872">And I was just the only employee in the office.</span> <span id="s873">And we had a warehouse with workers.</span> <span id="s874">And I was safe there.</span> <span id="s875">And the man lived till ‘38.</span> <span id="s876">So, he died in ‘38 but till ‘38 I was working for a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s877">And if you had under ten you didn’t have to belong to the Nazi Labor front.</span> <span id="s878">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s879">NP: Under ten?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">HS: Under ten employees.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">NP: Employees.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s883">So that was another thing.</span> <span id="s884">And then he died and this was taken over and I was hired by one of the biggest steel wholesale places.</span> <span id="s885">And the director was as anti-Nazi as you can imagine.</span> <span id="s886">So they wanted to hire me because I was an expert through my fifteen years working for this.</span> <span id="s887">And the men who knew about metal and sheet metal, they were all in the war.</span> <span id="s888">So they hired me.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">NP: That was the firm that you worked for.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">HS: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">NP: They manufactured sheet metal?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">HS: No they didn’t manufacture but they bought from, they had their own steel mills and they got big government orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">NP: Contracts.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">HS: And so I was able to sidetrack and put them in steel mills that they are overloaded and they had to give new numbers and all that.</span> <span id="s895">I wouldn’t call it sabotage but it delayed things.</span> <span id="s896">So, after the director hired me he said, “All right.</span> <span id="s897">Everything is settled.</span> <span id="s898">Fourteen salaries and every, this, and...” And I wanted to have Saturdays off.</span> <span id="s899">He said, “Well let’s agree, if we, whenever possible you’ll take the Saturday off.”</span> <span id="s900">So then he said, “Well there is just one,” I call the chief of personnel, you have to sign the Aryan proof or whatever.</span> <span id="s901">And I said, “I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s902">I cannot provide that.”</span> <span id="s903">He looked at me and I looked like you see, and he said, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s904">Very, well, I said, “I just don’t have Aryans in my background.”</span> <span id="s905">He says, “Oh I don’t believe in that anyhow.</span> <span id="s906">You’re hired.”</span> <span id="s907">And he calls the chief in.</span> <span id="s908">He says, “I hired her and she does not bring the proof of Aryan whatever.”</span> <span id="s909">And I was hired and it was more than two years which were the most important, the most dangerous years.</span> <span id="s910">But I had bet with myself, I put all on one card, if I tell him--and I knew he was not a Nazi--if I tell him the truth and he hires me, I am safe.</span> <span id="s911">Because a firm that had, and they had many employees, a firm that had fired all Jews in ‘33 already, if somebody in ‘42 hires you, you’re safe.</span> <span id="s912">And I thought, if I lose out, I’ll see.</span> <span id="s913">But if I am taken, I’m safe.</span> <span id="s914">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s915">But you have to with...</span></p> <p><span id="s916">NP: So all the while you were almost one step ahead...</span></p> <p><span id="s917">HS: So again...</span></p> <p><span id="s918">NP: Thinking and planning.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">HS: If you had a job, you didn’t have to go to the labor department and ask for a job and they would have sent you out on the roads to do or God knows where.</span> <span id="s920">So I was safe here.</span> <span id="s921">Again, it was a combination of things.</span> <span id="s922">So, and a director hires me in ‘42 after they fired all Jews in ‘33, who would believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">NP: Incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">HS: So this is why so many people say...</span></p> <p><span id="s925">NP: It’s incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">HS: “I don’t bel-,” I had a friend she says, “I trust you with everything, but I just don’t believe you.”</span> <span id="s927">So, people cannot because they have all their preconceived idea and this doesn’t fit in any mold.</span> <span id="s928">So that’s why I was always hesitant to talk.</span> <span id="s929">So one, our dear friend took a tape with me and she writes, “A postman saved her life,” which is absolutely wrong.</span> <span id="s930">It wasn’t a postman.</span> <span id="s931">It was a policeman.</span> <span id="s932">That was the number one most significant.</span> <span id="s933">But the neighbors were second significant.</span> <span id="s934">And the job was important because the moment you had a job you had a right for a living space and for food stamps and rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">NP: So all...</span></p> <p><span id="s936">HS: And you got your money.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">NP: All of these factors...</span></p> <p><span id="s938">HS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">NP: The in with the police and...</span></p> <p><span id="s940">HS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">NP: You know, living with these people who...</span></p> <p><span id="s942">HS: And these were all...</span></p> <p><span id="s943">NP: Were accepting.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">HS: Tiny little things.</span> <span id="s945">They didn’t take more than five minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">NP: But it all added up.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">HS: And you didn’t, yes, but you never knew what added with what.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">NP: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">HS: The, you just see the end result.</span> <span id="s950">And of course if I would have not gone to work I would have been where my mother is today, in some mass grave.</span> <span id="s951">And we all had a little suitcase, which you never left behind.</span> <span id="s952">You took it wherever you went, because many times all that somebody had left was that little suitcase.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">NP: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">HS: So when people went to the basement in air raids, they had the suitcase and the knapsack and whatever else.</span> <span id="s955">And many times they ended up with just that.</span> <span id="s956">So I had always; we had to go to work and the trolley cars were overfilled with people and all.</span> <span id="s957">So that day my mother said, “Oh today you work only half a day; leave it home.</span> <span id="s958">I’ll take it down.”</span> <span id="s959">She did take it down, and I didn’t even have this one towel, a cake of soap, and toothpaste, a toothbrush.</span> <span id="s960">I didn’t even have that.</span> <span id="s961">So I had nothing.</span> <span id="s962">So other people kept on lugging everything to the basement.</span> <span id="s963">And I was the perfect lady.</span> <span id="s964">I had nothing but a little clutch bag, with nothing but a comb and a handkerchief in there.</span> <span id="s965">That’s all I brought.</span> <span id="s966">And this went on for weeks and weeks.</span> <span id="s967">So I saved a lot of schlepping.</span> <span id="s968">And then, you know when, I never minded because I felt without burden.</span> <span id="s969">But then when the war was over and people, those who were saved, and they pulled out and had everything; so a friend shared her coat with me.</span> <span id="s970">And I had to give it back to her when she needed it.</span> <span id="s971">But she let me have it.</span> <span id="s972">And somebody gave me a gift, a plate with a set of fork and a spoon, and the knife and said, “Somebody has to have that.”</span> <span id="s973">And somebody gave me a feather bed, because I was very shaky.</span> <span id="s974">I shook for weeks, I was shaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">NP: The shock of...</span></p> <p><span id="s976">HS: It must have been shock, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">NP: The shock from your mother’s death.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">HS: Of course there was, the mother was gone and the home was gone.</span> <span id="s979">And every--everything you could; you don’t know what nothing means.</span> <span id="s980">Nothing means absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s981">What you had on you and nothing else.</span> <span id="s982">And I got coupons, a bunch of coupons.</span> <span id="s983">There was no store where you could get anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">NP: Hanna you mentioned when the GIs came in they smelled of soap and they had their nicely pressed uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">NP: Do I understand that you married one of these wonderful GIs?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">HS: Well he bought a, I didn’t meet him in the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s988">He was a First Lieutenant with Military Government in the manpower division.</span> <span id="s989">And he was of course, all of the GIs were nineteen, twenty.</span> <span id="s990">And he was thirty.</span> <span id="s991">And he had a, he was requested to come to Berlin as [tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s992">NP: This is the end of the conversation between Hanna Silver and Natalie Packel on Tuesday, April 25, 1995.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">SEQ CHAPTER \h \r 1Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s994">NP: Today, this is Natalie Packel, continuing the interview with Hanna Silver, on Tuesday May the 9th, 1995, at Gratz College.</span> <span id="s995">Hanna, where did we leave off?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">HS: Well, after I had shown you the photographs of the total destruction of my neighborhood, which happened to be the center of Berlin, you asked me, “Where did you live?</span> <span id="s997">How did you live?</span> <span id="s998">I don’t see any buildings standing.”</span> <span id="s999">So, I want to answer this question.</span> <span id="s1000">Immediately after the air raid people could not go back to their homes or basements.</span> <span id="s1001">It took days for the houses to burn out completely, and then many collapsed; at least all the floors and roofs collapsed.</span> <span id="s1002">The basements had been storage areas.</span> <span id="s1003">Many people had stored coal in there, so this caught fire.</span> <span id="s1004">And the basements were smoldering for weeks.</span> <span id="s1005">There was no water.</span> <span id="s1006">There was no electricity.</span> <span id="s1007">So, what people did, they went to a nearby subway station.</span> <span id="s1008">Being underground it provided at least a roof, if nothing else.</span> <span id="s1009">So many thousands were sitting on the platforms with their suitcase--the one I described before, the one they always...</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">NP: The one that you constantly had packed in case you had...</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">HS: You had with you wherever you went, because it might be that this was all you have.</span> <span id="s1012">And now it turned out that this suitcase had become the only possession that people had.</span> <span id="s1013">The subway didn’t run for months and months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">NP: Excuse me, Hanna, but you did not have a suitcase, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">HS: No, I..</span> <span id="s1016">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">NP: Because you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">HS: Had only a tiny little clutch pocketbook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">NP: As you returned home from work...</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">HS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">NP: You found the building...</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">HS: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">NP: Had been burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">HS: I had nothing and my mother had taken my little tote bag down to the basement and take it up.</span> <span id="s1025">And as you read in that one page I gave you from the Nelson book...</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">HS: It describes how she jumped from the window.</span> <span id="s1028">So she certainly didn’t take anything with her.</span> <span id="s1029">So people were sitting by the thousands on the platforms of the subways.</span> <span id="s1030">And I learned later that Goebbels had given orders to flood the subways.</span> <span id="s1031">I don’t know when it was done but there were people floating in the water.</span> <span id="s1032">Because next to the subway was a canal, or maybe it was a river.</span> <span id="s1033">And when they opened the flood gates, and people were floating--months later there were still people floating in there.</span> <span id="s1034">So I do not know exactly what happened because I was not there.</span> <span id="s1035">So I just kept on walking.</span> <span id="s1036">And so when I realized that there was no transportation possible--the streets were full of craters from the holes, tank obstacles and fallen debris--so you just kept on walking and walking.</span> <span id="s1037">And everything was so far away.</span> <span id="s1038">So I walked to my Aunt Resl, which was my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s1039">She had moved with her family years ago to a new section at the edge of Berlin, a young community, very young families.</span> <span id="s1040">And after 1933 as I mentioned to you before, it turned out that many of the young ones were at least Nazi sympathizers if not active Nazis.</span> <span id="s1041">From each window, whenever there was a celebration, hung a Nazi flag, in contrast to our building.</span> <span id="s1042">There was not a single one.</span> <span id="s1043">And one day, a huge Magen David...</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">NP: Magen David being the Jewish Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">HS: The Jewish Star, was painted on the sidewalk, with red paint, real big.</span> <span id="s1046">And my uncle got a letter which said that they could not expect Germans to live under one roof with the Jewish and would they please move out.</span> <span id="s1047">And so they found an apartment in the western part of the city, a not-so-new house, but very solid, and mostly middle-aged neighbors who were not active Nazis at all and where their sympathies were lying we don’t know.</span> <span id="s1048">You couldn’t look into people’s minds.</span> <span id="s1049">So in 1942 the husband died.</span> <span id="s1050">Oh, I forgot to mention that her husband had not been Jewish, and there were two children, my two cousins.</span> <span id="s1051">So her husband died which made her a full Jewess.</span> <span id="s1052">And they, actually it was not a bomb that hit the house.</span> <span id="s1053">It was a motor that fell from an airplane, an American plane...</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">NP: American...</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">HS: Was shot down and the engine went through the whole house and destroyed all the apartments there.</span> <span id="s1056">So my aunt with my cousins are standing in the street and didn’t know what to do, where to go.</span> <span id="s1057">So a middle-aged couple came over to her and then said, “Oh, Mrs. Wagner, you know we have our den; we really don’t need it so badly.</span> <span id="s1058">If you would want to stay with us until you find something else you would be welcome.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">NP: Wagner was the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">HS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">NP: W-A-G-N-E-R.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">HS: -N-E-R.</span> <span id="s1063">So, and a Mr. Seidel, S-E-I-D-E-L, he offered them to move in.</span> <span id="s1064">And they stayed just a couple of weeks or so.</span> <span id="s1065">But at the moment the difference between standing in the street--and it was November--and having one room, it was a big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">NP: It was a blessing, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1068">So then a woman, we thought of her as a Nazi woman, she was a warden who was in charge of distributing ration cards.</span> <span id="s1069">She had been bringing the ration cards to my aunt’s family--full, regular, normal ration cards, though she knew my aunt was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1070">She had them been bringing.</span> <span id="s1071">So now it was only my aunt and my cousins, and she came to her and said, “I have an apartment across the street which takes you out of my district.</span> <span id="s1072">I could get you that apartment.</span> <span id="s1073">It is damaged.</span> <span id="s1074">The woman who owns it is a teacher and is in Bavaria somewhere and she doesn’t come back.</span> <span id="s1075">It doesn’t have walls on the inside.</span> <span id="s1076">They’re blown out from the bombs.</span> <span id="s1077">But I could give it to you.”</span> <span id="s1078">And of course my aunt grabbed it.</span> <span id="s1079">It was shelter and it had a front door.</span> <span id="s1080">So she had an apartment and the living room and the bedroom and the kitchen was all one large room, but still it was a place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">NP: And when you went to look for her, Hanna, was she there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">NP: Well then you did find her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">HS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1085">Well that’s where I was heading.</span> <span id="s1086">It took an hour, an hour-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s1087">It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">NP: On foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">HS: Well there was nothing else.</span> <span id="s1090">Feet was all you had.</span> <span id="s1091">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">NP: And did you have shoes that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">HS: Well they were all one big hole because from walking in the hot ashes and embers.</span> <span id="s1094">They, the soles were eaten up and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">NP: It burnt them...</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">HS: Of course the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">NP: Bottom of your soles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">HS: Yeah, yeah, but they were uppers.</span> <span id="s1099">And there was little there.</span> <span id="s1100">So to finish the story of my aunt, this woman, whom everybody thought she was a good Nazi, kept on bringing my aunt and cousin full, regular ration cards, without the “J,” and that meant she could shop at all times, that she got vegetables and things that--some meat, that the Jews were denied.</span> <span id="s1101">So this woman of whom everyone thought she was such a good Nazi, kept on keeping my aunt and my cousin and gave them shelter and gave them food.</span> <span id="s1102">So I set out towards my aunt.</span> <span id="s1103">And after I got there she wouldn’t let me go.</span> <span id="s1104">She says, “You stay here.</span> <span id="s1105">I am now your mother and I’ll take care of you.”</span> <span id="s1106">So, together--this was now February--until May, we lived together and we held together and we gave each other strength and hope and all.</span> <span id="s1107">We did not know how close the end really was.</span> <span id="s1108">And when it was there we didn’t know what to make of it.</span> <span id="s1109">So, this was the story of the friendly Nazi woman who kept them alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">NP: Her name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">HS: Ludtke, L-U-D-T-K-E, Mrs. Ludtke.</span> <span id="s1112">So I moved in with my aunt and cousins.</span> <span id="s1113">So the nights we spent in the basement, in her basement, and the days I was at work.</span> <span id="s1114">And then came the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">NP: You were still able to go to work?</span> <span id="s1116">The work continued...</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">HS: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">NP: The manufacturing was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">HS: The moment you wouldn’t go to work you would not get paid and you would not get ration cards and you wouldn’t, so everybody tried.</span> <span id="s1120">We didn’t do much work because every little while there was an air raid.</span> <span id="s1121">But you had to show up and it was quite a distance so you came late and you left early, and you didn’t do much, but you could say you were working.</span> <span id="s1122">And I was glad that I had a job to go to.</span> <span id="s1123">So then came April 20, which happened to be the Führer’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">NP: 19-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">HS: The Führer’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">NP: ‘4-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">HS: ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">NP: Five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">HS: Which happened to be the Führer’s birthday.</span> <span id="s1130">And on that day there were always big parades and a lot to do.</span> <span id="s1131">And the flags were out.</span> <span id="s1132">And here, this was the day where all normal life the way we knew it, stopped.</span> <span id="s1133">Everybody stayed where he happened to be--mostly in their basements.</span> <span id="s1134">But mothers with children were entitled to go to a fortified bunker.</span> <span id="s1135">They went there every night and they went home in the morning.</span> <span id="s1136">So they didn’t even hear bombs or--so we go to the basement.</span> <span id="s1137">Nobody went anywhere.</span> <span id="s1138">You couldn’t go to work and there were no shops open.</span> <span id="s1139">It was just nothing.</span> <span id="s1140">This nothingness is impossible to describe to somebody who has no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">NP: Total devastation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">HS: So we sat, and we waited.</span> <span id="s1143">The light bombing that came from the Russians had stopped before we had the heavy bombing which was by the Allies, the American and the English, one by night and one by day.</span> <span id="s1144">And the Russians had small bombs and they didn’t do much damage.</span> <span id="s1145">But they were falling.</span> <span id="s1146">You heard it.</span> <span id="s1147">And so all of a sudden the bombing stopped and it was quiet, so quiet, not one sound, nothing.</span> <span id="s1148">It was eerie after all the noise that was before.</span> <span id="s1149">You heard in the distance a few shots, but just here and there.</span> <span id="s1150">And you sit and you wait, and you don’t know for what you wait.</span> <span id="s1151">Nobody had ever experienced to be a civilian in the middle of a war.</span> <span id="s1152">And waiting for liberation or revenge or for what?</span> <span id="s1153">So I was so numb.</span> <span id="s1154">I couldn’t think because I didn’t know what to think.</span> <span id="s1155">So you sit and wait and don’t know for what you wait.</span> <span id="s1156">And nobody knew what was going on a block or two or three away.</span> <span id="s1157">And you couldn’t contact anybody.</span> <span id="s1158">The people next door, they sent word of mouth but this was the only communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">NP: And your food supply?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">HS: Well so don’t call it a supply.</span> <span id="s1161">So a friend of mine, who worked around the corner where a school had been transformed into a hospital, and he was a salesman for Johnson and Johnson and made himself into a medic; he didn’t want to go into the war so he became a medic and worked there in that hospital.</span> <span id="s1162">He appointed himself.</span> <span id="s1163">And he came the day before and he had brought us a small bag about a pound of rice.</span> <span id="s1164">And this was very good.</span> <span id="s1165">So how do you transform rice into a meal?</span> <span id="s1166">So this friend of the family said to me, “Hanna, would you want to go with me upstairs?</span> <span id="s1167">We have a stove where you can put things in and burn.</span> <span id="s1168">All the other people had modern appliances, electric stove, gas stove, and this was one where you could put coal and whatever in.</span> <span id="s1169">And I did have courage, and we went up to the second floor to the neighbor’s apartment.</span> <span id="s1170">And this old style stove was our lifesaver.</span> <span id="s1171">So we looked for a chair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">NP: There was one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">HS: But, he said, “It is a beautiful chair, isn’t it?”</span> <span id="s1174">I said, “Yes, it is.</span> <span id="s1175">But a bowl of rice would be even more beautiful.”</span> <span id="s1176">So he broke up the chair into small pieces and then we looked for books.</span> <span id="s1177">And here I said, “Choose the one you like the least.”</span> <span id="s1178">So he took a couple of books and we burned the chair with the books.</span> <span id="s1179">And eventually the water came to a boil and we combined the boiling water with the rice and we had a meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">NP: There still was running water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">HS: No.</span> <span id="s1182">It wasn’t running but he happened to have a tea kettle full with water standing there.</span> <span id="s1183">And so we had, and we took it down to the basement and this neighbor and my aunt and cousin and I, we had a very nice meal.</span> <span id="s1184">So if you ask me, “How did we live?”</span> <span id="s1185">I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s1186">We survived.</span> <span id="s1187">That’s a fact.</span> <span id="s1188">But how, it’s hard to say.</span> <span id="s1189">Now, we had no water.</span> <span id="s1190">About a five minute walk away was this hospital I mentioned before and they had a very, very old-fashioned pump.</span> <span id="s1191">You know the ones where you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">NP: With the handle and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">HS: With the handle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">NP: You push down, mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">HS: The trouble was you had to prime it with a half a pail of water.</span> <span id="s1196">And then you could have water for hours.</span> <span id="s1197">So somebody had to bring a half a pail of water and then there was a long line formed and everybody got a pail of water or two.</span> <span id="s1198">Trouble was by the time you come home half of it you had spilled already.</span> <span id="s1199">Because to carry a heavy pail of water and walk on not-so-even surfaces... But we did have some water and that was our lifesaver.</span> <span id="s1200">And then, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">NP: Did you meet anybody else that you knew in the area, anybody from your neighborhood?</span> <span id="s1202">Anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">HS: Oh no.</span> <span id="s1204">This was [tape off then on] so far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">HS: Well, you have to imagine, Berlin was a city with four million inhabitants.</span> <span id="s1207">And the distances were enormous.</span> <span id="s1208">And there was no public transportation, and there was no other transportation, at least for a while.</span> <span id="s1209">And everything was on foot.</span> <span id="s1210">So I don’t, to this day, I don’t know what happened to all my neighbors.</span> <span id="s1211">And see, this was the situation.</span> <span id="s1212">You lost everything where you had lived all your life, your home and your things.</span> <span id="s1213">And then all the neighbors whom you knew all your life, they were not there.</span> <span id="s1214">They didn’t live there.</span> <span id="s1215">And so everything that was familiar to you wasn’t there any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">NP: No pictures, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">HS: This was the worst.</span> <span id="s1218">When my life started in ‘45, there was not one single picture, a baby picture or family picture, not one photograph.</span> <span id="s1219">So, later on I found a few from other family members.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">NP: Good, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">HS: But I do not have what everyone else has, an album with the first half of your life.</span> <span id="s1222">But you can do without everything, and this is one thing you learn.</span> <span id="s1223">With all the things you had, you don’t really need.</span> <span id="s1224">And this comes out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">NP: In order to survive and to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1227">So now came word from neighboring houses came through that the war was over, that Hitler was gone.</span> <span id="s1228">So you asked yourself, How is it when the war is over, from one moment to the next?</span> <span id="s1229">First there is war and there is Hitler and there are the Russians and there are the bombs.</span> <span id="s1230">And all of a sudden there is no more Hitler and no more war.</span> <span id="s1231">So what is?</span> <span id="s1232">So you sit on the chair and you wait.</span> <span id="s1233">And you don’t know for what you wait.</span> <span id="s1234">Your enemy Hitler is gone, but that was good.</span> <span id="s1235">And we were there, and that was good too.</span> <span id="s1236">So my cousin pinched me and said, “Hanna, it’s over and we live.”</span> <span id="s1237">And then I said to myself, “Well that in itself is good enough for me.”</span> <span id="s1238">And another thing is, we had no more air raids and our dream was to have one night of uninterrupted sleep.</span> <span id="s1239">You don’t know what a beautiful thing a night’s sleep is unless you never have it.</span> <span id="s1240">So for weeks we never had a night’s sleep.</span> <span id="s1241">So we had sleep.</span> <span id="s1242">We had no Hitler.</span> <span id="s1243">We were not happy yet because we didn’t quite know where, what was going to be next.</span> <span id="s1244">So keep on waiting and you don’t show, because the next news from neighboring houses came, “Don’t show.</span> <span id="s1245">Don’t go up.</span> <span id="s1246">There is terribly raping going on.”</span> <span id="s1247">So we felt that there is security in numbers, which it wasn’t, but we felt that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">NP: Raping by the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">HS: By the Russian soldiers, with guns, with a rifle, and with a knife.</span> <span id="s1250">Many had the knife in their mouth while they raped.</span> <span id="s1251">And so we didn’t show up.</span> <span id="s1252">We were sitting and kept on sitting.</span> <span id="s1253">And nobody dared to go up to apartments because they were afraid if it’s a one-on-one that we will lose out.</span> <span id="s1254">So we survived that, too.</span> <span id="s1255">And then is something that took away my fear.</span> <span id="s1256">Somehow, we don’t know why, was in front of the house a big red fire engine.</span> <span id="s1257">And they didn’t have sirens in those days.</span> <span id="s1258">They had big brass bells which while they were on the way were ringing.</span> <span id="s1259">So we heard the ringing of the bells and we didn’t know there was a fire engine.</span> <span id="s1260">So very carefully we peeked.</span> <span id="s1261">There we see this big fire engine full with Russian soldiers, crawling all over, playing with the bells and with all the other ladders and all that.</span> <span id="s1262">So I felt a little better and I thought, anybody who can play with a fire engine couldn’t be all bad.</span> <span id="s1263">So I don’t want to get in too many details but again, it was good luck that there was a family who owned a store on the ground floor and had a basement of their own.</span> <span id="s1264">And they invited me to come in and sit with them.</span> <span id="s1265">And the man had been a Russian PW during World War I and knew a little Russian.</span> <span id="s1266">And when two Russians came with the machine gun, walking through, he greeted them and said, “Zdravstvuyte!”</span> <span id="s1267">[Traditional greeting, hello] Slapped his shoulder, and he sat down.</span> <span id="s1268">So the man said, “Matka,” [Mother] and so we were all...</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">NP: What does that mean?</span> <span id="s1270">Their...</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">HS: Mother, father, sister.</span> <span id="s1272">We were all one...</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">NP: And Tovara?</span> <span id="s1274">Tovarish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">HS: Tovarish means "comrade".</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">NP: O.K.</span> <span id="s1277">You said a word before tovara.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">HS: Zdravstvuyte.</span> <span id="s1279">That means hello.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">NP: All right.</span> <span id="s1281">We’ll have to spell that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">HS: No I cannot spell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">HS: But I learned it from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">NP: Hello.</span> <span id="s1286">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">HS: So this man who owned the store, he introduced everybody as his blood relative: brother, father, mother, sister.</span> <span id="s1288">So he talked to them a little bit and then they went away and they took everybody’s watch.</span> <span id="s1289">In Berlin after the war nobody had a watch, so some people had these old fashioned alarm clocks, these real big ones and they put a piece of string and they walked around with...</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">NP: With the alarm clock!</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">HS: These alarm clocks.</span> <span id="s1292">Well, you had to know what time it is!</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">NP: Around their...</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">HS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">NP: Neck?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">HS: And they have a sense of humor too.</span> <span id="s1297">So you had an alarm clock and you knew what time it was.</span> <span id="s1298">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">NP: Hanna, excuse me, if I may.</span> <span id="s1300">Did you hear of Displaced Persons Camps at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">HS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">NP: Where people were regrouping...</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">HS: No, no.</span> <span id="s1304">A Displaced Person was not for residents of the civilian residents of the city.</span> <span id="s1305">Displaced Persons were started sometimes in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1306">My cousin was in the concentration camp Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">NP: And then went to a Displaced...</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">HS: And they were kind of collection points where there was food delivered and other things, and where they were preparing for emigration and waiting.</span> <span id="s1309">My cousin waited a whole year for emigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">NP: While in a Displaced Persons Camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">HS: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">NP: O.K., excuse me for interrupting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">HS: No, yeah, immediately, well first of all the Displaced Persons were people who had come from other countries and couldn’t go back...</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">HS: Or didn’t want to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">HS: And here we talk about the civilian population of Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">NP: Right, and their rehabilitation, once the Russians came.</span> <span id="s1319">What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">HS: Well, so to speak, nothing, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1321">The first thing that happened and it was the biggest event, the bakery opened.</span> <span id="s1322">And they made bread and people stood in line for a long time.</span> <span id="s1323">But everybody got four slices per day.</span> <span id="s1324">And the smell of that fresh bread, you can never forget how wonderful that was.</span> <span id="s1325">So we got our four slices.</span> <span id="s1326">So everybody developed a theory of his own.</span> <span id="s1327">So somebody sat down and ate all four slices at once and said, “At least once a day I have the feeling of being satisfied.”</span> <span id="s1328">And I was the other kind.</span> <span id="s1329">I, first of all I found out if you toasted it fills you much more than if it’s mushy.</span> <span id="s1330">And then I made little pieces.</span> <span id="s1331">And whenever I felt like eating, I ate just a tiny little piece, so I was eating all day a little from it at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">NP: Were you still with your aunt...</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">HS: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">NP: And your cousins at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">HS: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1336">So then the rumors came in about the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">NP: The rumors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">HS: Yes, about the raping.</span> <span id="s1339">And they didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s1340">They went to the bunkers.</span> <span id="s1341">And then there’s another story I’ll need to tell you later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">NP: Hanna, did you tell me that one of your cousins, was it your cousin that was raped?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">HS: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1344">So, I didn’t believe it because I thought this was still continued Nazi propaganda.</span> <span id="s1345">Because the Nazis said, “If the Russians come they will burn and they will rape and they will kill,” and all that.</span> <span id="s1346">Unfortunately it was not Nazi propaganda.</span> <span id="s1347">It turned out to be true.</span> <span id="s1348">So we had no contact with other people.</span> <span id="s1349">Next door maybe one came over, sneaked over.</span> <span id="s1350">But the advice given was, “Don’t show.”</span> <span id="s1351">So we kept on sitting in the basement because you felt not safe but you felt somewhat safer.</span> <span id="s1352">So you didn’t know what was around the corner or at the other end of the city, whether they are, it turned out that in our neighborhood there were still a handful of Nazis, and some Russians had arrived and they were throwing hand grenades at each other.</span> <span id="s1353">And we don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s1354">So who wants to confront the Russian Army?</span> <span id="s1355">So you keep sitting.</span> <span id="s1356">And I don’t know how long we sat because there was no communication from one house to the other.</span> <span id="s1357">And there was none with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1358">So when they saw anybody they said, “Uri uri.”</span> <span id="s1359">That means, Ur is a German word, so they said, “Uri.”</span> <span id="s1360">So that means, “Give me your watch.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">NP: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">HS: And most people did not put up a fight.</span> <span id="s1363">They gave them.</span> <span id="s1364">So when they came to our basement there was the only Nazi in the building he was sitting in a wheelchair.</span> <span id="s1365">And the people put him there, because he spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s1366">And he was not permitted to move from there.</span> <span id="s1367">So whenever some Russians came down the steps, he said, he greeted them and, “Zdravstvuyte tovarish,” and they talked to him.</span> <span id="s1368">And, “How are you?”</span> <span id="s1369">and all that.</span> <span id="s1370">So right away they were not enemies.</span> <span id="s1371">They were talking to somebody in their language.</span> <span id="s1372">And this was the reason why we were left alone.</span> <span id="s1373">So they gave him a wonderful big golden watch with a golden chain which they had taken from somebody else.</span> <span id="s1374">And we awarded him for talking to them.</span> <span id="s1375">So we were very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">NP: Yes, indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">HS: And also the house was destroyed and there was a big pile of rubble in front of the house.</span> <span id="s1378">So many thought that the house wasn’t inhabited, and they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1379">But some came.</span> <span id="s1380">But we were spared, thanks to the Russian interpreter!</span> <span id="s1381">Nobody had a radio.</span> <span id="s1382">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1383">And you cannot imagine that you sit completely isolated, don’t know, the only thing is you know you sit in a basement.</span> <span id="s1384">But nothing else you know.</span> <span id="s1385">You don’t know who’s up in the street, if it’s still the Nazis or other Russians already.</span> <span id="s1386">They are shooting if--it turned out that the Germans ran away.</span> <span id="s1387">But some were pockets, where just a couple of, sometimes even Hitler Youth, threw panther grenades, hand grenades, at tanks, which didn’t make a dent in the tank but the tank got angry and rolled over and put fire to more houses.</span> <span id="s1388">At the end where those few houses meant so much to everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">NP: And bathroom facilities?</span> <span id="s1390">What facilities?</span> <span id="s1391">There weren’t any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">HS: Well, you wouldn’t call it facilities.</span> <span id="s1393">Some- Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">NP: This is side B, continuing interviewing.</span> <span id="s1395">This is Natalie Packel continuing to interview Hanna Silver.</span> <span id="s1396">Hanna, you were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">HS: I wanted to say that little by little the semblance of normal life returned, but only semblances.</span> <span id="s1398">It took a long time--months--until it was half way normal.</span> <span id="s1399">And it took a long time until it got real normal.</span> <span id="s1400">So we got ration cards and you kept on getting four slices of bread.</span> <span id="s1401">And then you got one herring per week.</span> <span id="s1402">The herring was a meat ration.</span> <span id="s1403">So it was September, and I remember I had met George, my future husband, when we got our first ration of fat.</span> <span id="s1404">That was one tablespoon of oil per person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">NP: He was in the American Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">HS: Yes, he was.</span> <span id="s1407">He had come; he was with the fighting army and had come to Berlin upon the request of the Labor Department.</span> <span id="s1408">And he was stationed with the military government at the Labor Division.</span> <span id="s1409">And he stayed on for three years.</span> <span id="s1410">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">NP: He was part of the resettling forces?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">HS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">NP: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">HS: No, no.</span> <span id="s1415">It was occupation and government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">NP: O.K., occupying troops, yeah, [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">HS: So anyway we had a basic, but many people had hunger edema.</span> <span id="s1418">So when you saw somebody...</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">NP: Hunger what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">HS: Edema.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">NP: Oh edema.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">HS: So you said, “Oh!</span> <span id="s1425">You look...”</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">NP: Terribly swollen, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">HS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1428">“You look good!”</span> <span id="s1429">Then people used to take their finger and poke in their cheek and the hole that the finger made remained.</span> <span id="s1430">It didn’t go back.</span> <span id="s1431">That meant that they were not so good looking after all.</span> <span id="s1432">But we had a night’s sleep.</span> <span id="s1433">Every night was a night’s sleep and that was precious.</span> <span id="s1434">And we had four pieces, slices of bread.</span> <span id="s1435">That was precious.</span> <span id="s1436">And now came for me the time to realize what my situation really was, under normal circumstances--nothing!</span> <span id="s1437">The work wasn’t working any more.</span> <span id="s1438">The Russians had taken away everything everywhere.</span> <span id="s1439">There was no business going on.</span> <span id="s1440">There were no goods to be sold.</span> <span id="s1441">I had a handful of coupons which were given to me the first time I was bombed out, but there were no stores.</span> <span id="s1442">So then the swapping started.</span> <span id="s1443">If somebody had an apron he gave this to the baker and the baker’s wife gave you a half a bread for it.</span> <span id="s1444">And so people, everything went by swapping.</span> <span id="s1445">Of course you didn’t have stores, you know.</span> <span id="s1446">And I don’t really remember how long this went.</span> <span id="s1447">The money was without value.</span> <span id="s1448">I even saw some money swirling around in the wind in the streets.</span> <span id="s1449">People didn’t even bother picking it up.</span> <span id="s1450">A little later it turned out that a lot of valueless money is better than no money.</span> <span id="s1451">So if you had enough of it you still could buy something.</span> <span id="s1452">And then the black market started and the Russians, they didn’t have anything to sell on the black market.</span> <span id="s1453">It started actually after the Americans arrived.</span> <span id="s1454">They had cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1455">And that was a currency, we called it Old Gold currency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">NP: We continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">HS: So I had one coat, which wasn’t so good any more from the fire and the ashes and all that.</span> <span id="s1458">So my cousin, my aunt and I, we all had arrived at the same weight.</span> <span id="s1459">We all weighed 100 pounds each.</span> <span id="s1460">My aunt was short and very chubby.</span> <span id="s1461">She lost, my cousin was tall and slender.</span> <span id="s1462">She lost, and I was, we were all three hundred.</span> <span id="s1463">So we had a coat.</span> <span id="s1464">So whoever went out got the coat.</span> <span id="s1465">With shoes it was a little more difficult, but somehow, you know, you manage.</span> <span id="s1466">You walk with holes in your shoes.</span> <span id="s1467">So on May 8th, 1945 the war was over.</span> <span id="s1468">The Russians took over Berlin, and in August the Americans arrived in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1469">The Russians had occupied the whole city.</span> <span id="s1470">And when the Allies arrived they took half of the city, while the three Allies together had to divide the other half.</span> <span id="s1471">And so instead of having one city governed by all four occupation powers together, each one gradually developed a sector of his own.</span> <span id="s1472">There was a Russian sector, 50% of the city.</span> <span id="s1473">There was the other half of the city, divided into French sector, British sector, and American sector.</span> <span id="s1474">And I was lucky to be in the American sector.</span> <span id="s1475">And I knew my English and could communicate.</span> <span id="s1476">And I became the official photographer for the American Red Cross Club.</span> <span id="s1477">And I worked there and I met hundreds and hundreds of GIs and they were very happy to have somebody who could talk to them in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">NP: Yes I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">HS: And I worked very, very hard but it was the most wonderful time of my life.</span> <span id="s1480">So, after the four occupation powers had taken over the whole city, they met under Eisenhower; just around the corner they had their headquarters.</span> <span id="s1481">And so I had a photo shop and all the Americans came in and brought their films to develop.</span> <span id="s1482">At, in the Red Cross Club I had the photo studio and took pictures of hundreds and hundreds of American GIs.</span> <span id="s1483">So I had so many friends and with some, believe it or not, I still correspond and we visited.</span> <span id="s1484">Because it was such a crazy time.</span> <span id="s1485">Everything that was normal wasn’t valid any more.</span> <span id="s1486">The poor GI was all of a sudden so rich because he sold his cigarettes on the black market for...</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">NP: On the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">HS: Fifteen hundred Marks.</span> <span id="s1489">And they could buy anything they wanted that was available, you know.</span> <span id="s1490">It was, the Mayor of Berlin was Reuter, Ernst Reuter, and he said he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">NP: R-O-I-T-E-R?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">HS: R-E-U-, R-E-U...</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">NP: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">HS: T-E-R.</span> <span id="s1495">And he was elected but the Russians didn’t permit him to be acting Mayor.</span> <span id="s1496">And he said, he was a close friend of ours, and he said, “Years later when all this will be forgotten, you will say these days where we are now, they are worth being lived like no other time.”</span> <span id="s1497">That’s what he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">NP: Hanna, you went through so much and showed such bravery and such resourcefulness and always trying to be as upbeat as possible.</span> <span id="s1499">How has this dreadful experience changed your life, or had it changed your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">HS: Well, I wouldn’t say change.</span> <span id="s1501">You are a kind of a person.</span> <span id="s1502">But there are certain things that come to the surface more than others.</span> <span id="s1503">I was through circumstances brought up in a very, very modest lifestyle and I didn’t ask for anything much.</span> <span id="s1504">And money, it really--what happened to me happened to most of the people--the inflation had wiped out everybody’s money--so nobody had money.</span> <span id="s1505">So you didn’t need money for anything because you didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s1506">You didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s1507">So whenever there was something to be made I made it out of nothing, which today is recognized as something wonderful.</span> <span id="s1508">We had to do things ourselves because we couldn’t go and buy things.</span> <span id="s1509">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">NP: It was through necessity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">HS: Necessity.</span> <span id="s1512">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">NP: To instill this great...</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">HS: I was, I’m still...</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">NP: Inventiveness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">HS: I’m still very modest, and I was born with a wonderful sense of humor, which never left me.</span> <span id="s1517">And I think that saw me through the worst of situations.</span> <span id="s1518">Also I’m very optimistic and where there is life there is hope.</span> <span id="s1519">And the day the war was over we found out that we were alive.</span> <span id="s1520">So that was good news for us.</span> <span id="s1521">And a lot of self-control, which I developed.</span> <span id="s1522">So my cousin for instance, her mother was deported and she and I, we went to the ladies room and cried and cried.</span> <span id="s1523">And we went out, washed our face, and went in public and smiled at everybody.</span> <span id="s1524">And nobody had an idea that minutes ago we had cried bitterly.</span> <span id="s1525">And also I value friendship.</span> <span id="s1526">I had so many friends who stood by me and who helped.</span> <span id="s1527">And to this day I value friendship so much and I am a good friend.</span> <span id="s1528">And I have, I’m blessed, I have so many real dear friends.</span> <span id="s1529">And I am so easily content.</span> <span id="s1530">I don’t need much.</span> <span id="s1531">And I am happy.</span> <span id="s1532">And a nice talk, a nice phone call.</span> <span id="s1533">I don’t ask for too much and I get much more than I expect.</span> <span id="s1534">And that makes me a happy person.</span> <span id="s1535">Also we learned to help.</span> <span id="s1536">Because I’ll never forget, I have a very good memory, forget how many people helped me.</span> <span id="s1537">I don’t forget that.</span> <span id="s1538">And so wherever I can, little things that are important, because life is not all big things.</span> <span id="s1539">You have three big things or four maybe, but, every day are some little things and if you can help somebody across the street or carry a bundle or something.</span> <span id="s1540">And then when we came to Philadelphia in 1948, I had a chance, we moved into Strawberry Mansion which then was a hundred percent...</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">NP: Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">HS: Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1543">And within a very short time it turned into 99 percent black neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1544">And there were so many little children and I had no experience.</span> <span id="s1545">And, but somebody talked me into doing something with recreation and it ended up that I took 650 children twice a week to the Fairmount Park.</span> <span id="s1546">There was a Smith playground.</span> <span id="s1547">It cost nobody a penny and nobody got paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">NP: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">HS: And we got a yellow bus, a school bus, which was idle during the summer.</span> <span id="s1550">And each block had one mother and as many children as they wanted and the bus shuttled back and forth within fifteen minutes.</span> <span id="s1551">So I made up a schedule.</span> <span id="s1552">So I took for ten years 650 children twice a week to the park during the months of July and August.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">NP: Oh, that’s extraordinary!</span></p> <p><span

yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">HS: Until it got a little easier to go.</span> <span id="s1583">But then...</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">NP: Perhaps we’ll write down how to spell those two cemeteries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">HS: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1586">Well now they call it the Jewish Cemetery...</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">NP: The Jewish Cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">HS: Because there is only one.</span> <span id="s1589">And it’s a very big one in a beautiful location near the lake with some woods around it.</span> <span

Lutheran, and one or two Catholic.</span> <span id="s1605">But nobody would come and say, “Who are you?</span> <span id="s1606">What is your, what do you believe?”</span> <span id="s1607">It was so democratic that, there were a lot of atheists around.</span> <span id="s1608">Because after World War I a lot of people lost their faith and became non-religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">NP: So you were well-integrated into the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">NP: Accepted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1613">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1614">And also with neighbors.</span> <span id="s1615">Nobody ever made a fuss over religion or whatever.</span> <span id="s1616">And it was a, at the time of the Weimar

id="s1618">NP: Herta Beese...</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">HS: Yeah?</span> <span id="s1620">This is the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">NP: When did you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">HS: Well I met her immediately after the war.</span> <span id="s1623">She was an atheist and she was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1624">And she has done so much for so many and put them up while they were on the escape route to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1625">And she put them up in an apartment next to her which was vacant.</span> <span id="s1626">So at 10:00 at night people came knocked at the door, and she put them up overnight.</span> <span id="s1627">She even took a job in a grocery store so that she had access to goods that were sold without coupons that she could have something to eat for the people while they were on their escape route.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">NP: How wonderful.</span> <span id="s1629">But she, if I remember correctly, was a Social Democrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">HS: She was a leading Social Democrat in Berlin and she was a genuine Berliner and she did a lot of good for youth and for juvenile delinquents to help them to get back into normal life.</span> <span id="s1631">And she...</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">NP: Her--and how you spelled her name H-E-R-T-A?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">HS: That’s her first name, and her last name is

Yeah.</span> <span id="s1638">All the people who did so many good things, they all don’t live any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">NP: That’s sad in itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">HS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">NP: And you plug on.</span> <span id="s1642">I see that every...</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">HS: Plug on and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">NP: Every week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">HS: I had one cousin and she was exactly my age.</span> <span id="s1646">We were just four weeks apart.</span> <span id="s1647">And we were very, very close.</span> <span id="s1648">And I just looked at her.</span> <span id="s1649">She wrote a card and she said, “I am on my way for going away.”</span> <span id="s1650">Nobody ever said, “I am being deported.”</span> <span id="s1651">They said, “I am going away.”</span> <span id="s1652">And so she writes a postal card, “I’m going away in an hour.</span> <span id="s1653">And I wish you all good luck and I hope we see each other again,” which we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1654">So she is dead and I am...</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">NP: Where was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">HS: We were both in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1657">And [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">NP: And she was deported to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">HS: We don’t know but she is listed in the Gedenkbuch and it says, “Auschwitz.”</span> <span id="s1660">And so she is dead.</span> <span id="s1661">One aunt is dead and one uncle lives, and cousins, one is dead and one: So three cousins of mine managed to get to England immediately before the war.</span> <span id="s1662">And they enlisted in the British Army.</span> <span id="s1663">And one was a parachutist and died in Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s1664">And the two others were, one was an officer in Africa and in Italy.</span> <span id="s1665">And the other one, because he was of German descent, was an interpreter in, for the English, British Army.</span> <span id="s1666">They don’t live any more either.</span> <span id="s1667">So it’s all gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">NP: It’s all gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">HS: So now the conclusion is never ever give up hope, and always hope for the best.</span> <span id="s1670">And you’re sure the best will not happen but the worst will not happen either, so if you fall somewhere between the best and the worst, you are in good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">NP: Thank you, Hanna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">HS: Thank you, Natalie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">NP: Thank you, Hanna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">HS: I am so happy that I had a chance to talk to you, and of course when you start then you get the whole package.</span> <span id="s1675">There is so many more items that I didn’t mention but there is just not enough tape to tell it all.</span> <span id="s1676">But I hope that my remarks give you a picture...</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">NP: Indeed they do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">HS: Of the end...</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">NP: Invaluable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">HS: Of the war, and the beginning of new life.</span> <span id="s1681">As hard as it was, it was a new life.</span> <span id="s1682">And everybody was willing to take sacrifices because they were alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">NP: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">HS: For that you have to pay a price, and you don’t have a steak or anything; you have just bread.</span> <span id="s1685">But you had enough to just survive.</span> <span id="s1686">And that’s what matters.</span> <span id="s1687">Bread and water--it’s very good for survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">NP: Thanks, Hanna.</span> <span id="s1689">You’re beautiful, a beautiful lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">HS: Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
