LANTOS</span></p> <p><span id="s12">May 10, 1990</span></p> <p><span id="s13">WH: You came here on a Hillel Scholarship?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">TL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">WH: Did you come here by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">TL: Yes, on the SS Marine Falcon, which left Cherbourg and then stopped in Bremenhaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">WH: Were you seasick?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">TL: I was not seasick.</span> <span id="s19">My bunk was B20.</span> <span id="s20">My first meal was marvelous because we went into the chow line and I had never seen so much wonderful food.</span> <span id="s21">There was a big basket of oranges and one of bananas.</span> <span id="s22">And I wanted to do the right thing.</span> <span id="s23">So I walked up to this sailor and asked him: “Should I take an orange or a banana?”</span> <span id="s24">And he said: “Man, you eat all the goddamn oranges and all the goddamn bananas you want.”</span> <span id="s25">Then I knew I was in paradise.</span> <span id="s26">I was 19 at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">WH: What did you do on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">TL: I thought a great deal about my war experiences and I talked to some very intelligent people about what life was like in America.</span> <span id="s29">Then we played bridge.</span> <span id="s30">I knew English already from my mother.</span> <span id="s31">I already knew German and Italian from school.</span> <span id="s32">My mother’s side of the family was an academic family and my father was a banker.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">WH: Was your family very assimilated?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">TL: Very assimilated.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">WH: So didn’t it come as a real shock to be singled out for being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">TL: No, because our family was very sophisticated and we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s37">I had been bar-mitzvahed and received religious training.</span> <span id="s38">I was proud to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s39">On the other hand, the first religious word I learned was in the U.S..</span> <span id="s40">It was a bagel.</span> <span id="s41">I didn’t know what a bagel was.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">WH: Do you think a Holocaust is possible in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">TL: No.</span> <span id="s44">The Democratic and pluralistic traditions here are much too powerful.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">WH: Does the existence of many minorities here also make it unlikely that Jews would be singled out?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">TL: Perhaps, but Hungary also had many minorities – Rumanians, Gypsies, Yugoslavs, Czechs, and Germans, and Greeks, and Bulgarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">WH: When you came to N.Y. what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">TL: I was put on a train to Chicago and then to Seattle.</span> <span id="s49">It was a very memorable trip.</span> <span id="s50">I was literally glued to the window the entire time.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">WH: What did you do when you came to Seattle?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">TL: I stayed in a fraternity house of students from the University of Washington.</span> <span id="s53">It was part of the Hillel Scholarship Program.</span> <span id="s54">While there I made some very long-lasting friendships.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">WH: How were you able to get going again when you came here after all you’d been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">TL: I think horrible experiences do two things to people – they either crush them or they make them very strong and I fortunately fell into the latter category.</span> <span id="s57">It’s no virtue of my own, but people do have these reactions.</span> <span id="s58">It may have to do with a person’s makeup.</span> <span id="s59">I have a tremendously strong sense of social responsibility.</span> <span id="s60">I’m not a religious person but I do have that sense of responsibility for my community, immediate community and broader community.</span> <span id="s61">I feel very passionate about America.</span> <span id="s62">I’d lay down my life for this country at a moment’s notice without any hesitation.</span> <span id="s63">I love this country and feel very deeply about it.</span> <span id="s64">Therefore, the opportunity of concluding my life in public service is probably the ultimate high.</span> <span id="s65">I mean, you could offer me the presidency of IBM tomorrow and I’d laugh at you.</span> <span id="s66">I have zero interest in making money.</span> <span id="s67">My interest is in serving this country.</span> <span id="s68">And the fact that I can serve in Congress as Chairman of the Human Rights Committee and be involved in cleaning up a major mess in one of our cabinet agencies, HUD, means that I’m on a permanent high.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">WH: How has the Holocaust influenced this?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">TL: In every way, because being involved in human rights is in direct juxtaposition to the life I led during the war.</span> <span id="s71">The first time in my life when I was on the right side, openly and privately, was when I stepped on American soil.</span> <span id="s72">When the Allies dropped bombs on me I wanted them to win the war even though they were dropping bombs.</span> <span id="s73">When I see the Olympics on TV I want every game to be won by the Americans.</span> <span id="s74">And when they sing the national anthem, I start crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">WH: When you conduct the HUD hearings do you then feel angry that these people are cheating our government?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">TL: Yes.</span> <span id="s77">An outrage.</span> <span id="s78">I feel particularly outraged when political democracy throughout the world seems triumphant and we are so flawed.</span> <span id="s79">Not only the HUD investigation, but the homeless, crime in the streets, the presence of racial discrimination and anti-semitism; the vast numbers of elderly living in miserable conditions.</span> <span id="s80">I really want this country to shine.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: Why did you wait so long to get involved in this type of public service?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">TL: Well, I didn’t wait so long.</span> <span id="s83">I had done political advising for senators long before.</span> <span id="s84">I served as an administrative assistant in the U.S. Senate with several senators, Senators Gravel and Biden.</span> <span id="s85">I was heavily involved in several campaigns.</span> <span id="s86">I have a picture of my daughter greeting Adlai Stevenson in 1956.</span> <span id="s87">I was involved in the high command of the Frank Church senatorial campaign.</span> <span id="s88">I’ve been active politically for as long as I’ve been in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">WH: How do you feel about Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">TL: I’m passionately committed to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">WH: And now you’re on the Holocaust Commission.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">TL: Well that’s of course a very special thing and I plan to be very heavily involved in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">WH: What do you think was responsible for the recent upsurge of interest in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">TL: Elie Wiesel, as well as other individuals generated much interest.</span> <span id="s95">The proliferation of Holocaust museums.</span> <span id="s96">And I hope we’ll have one in every major city.</span> <span id="s97">There should be museums in places like Seattle, Portland, and elsewhere like the excellent one they have in Detroit.</span> <span id="s98">This is because not everyone will come to Washington D.C.’s museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">WH: Should these museums only focus on the Jewish tragedy?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">TL: I don’t think it matters because the lesson is ultimately so powerful that once a child is exposed to a Holocaust of any kind, it will then be understandable that it could easily happen to others.</span> <span id="s101">It wouldn’t be at all wrong if these museums showed different experiences.</span> <span id="s102">I would also love to see other groups involved in funding them.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">WH: Do you ever find that people in government are insensitive to these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">TL: There is tremendous insensitivity on the part of many people, enormous sensitivity on the part of some people, and a potential for great sensitivity on the part of large numbers of people.</span> <span id="s105">That is why I am so eager to use every minute of my time on these issues.</span> <span id="s106">You see, Congress is a club.</span> <span id="s107">We all try to accommodate one another across party lines.</span> <span id="s108">It’s the last small village in America.</span> <span id="s109">And if you’re the only Holocaust survivor in Congress and you sit down with them for dinner and they see you have children and grandchildren like them, and you’re like them, then the Holocaust becomes very real to them.</span> <span id="s110">To say six million Jews perished is like telling them how many fish there are in the ocean.</span> <span id="s111">It makes no sense to them on an individual level.</span> <span id="s112">But when I say: “You know my younger daughter and she looks exactly the way my mother looked . . . and she was gassed at Auschwitz,” then this colleague can understand what happened.</span> <span id="s113">I can’t think of a single colleague who denies the Holocaust occurred but it’s different when you read about it and when you know someone who has been through it.</span> <span id="s114">Moreover, I feel in many ways that in Congress I’m here, in a sense, for all of the survivors.</span> <span id="s115">And for this reason, I feel particularly responsible for all Jewish issues, whether it’s anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, Syrian or Ethiopian Jews, the failure of Spain to have diplomatic relations with Israel, or whatever.</span> <span id="s116">But I do it like breathing, not because it’s an obligation.</span> <span id="s117">After all, I lost immediate family during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">WH: Do you see yourself as a symbol of hope, of how people can overcome tragedy?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">TL: I always accept engagements to speak in front of school children.</span> <span id="s120">Many of them are underprivileged but most had an incredible head start over me.</span> <span id="s121">I was a penniless immigrant Jew.</span> <span id="s122">I got a Ph.D., built a family and a career and, at the end of my career, was elected to Congress.</span> <span id="s123">And I say to them: “Every single one of you can do more than I did.”</span> <span id="s124">And to see these kids’, many of whom come from “the wrong side of the tracks” eyes light up . . . it’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s125">I tell them that I didn’t know a single person in this country when I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">WH: Are there any personal habits left over from the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">TL: I don’t waste anything.</span> <span id="s128">I cannot put food on my plate that I don’t finish.</span> <span id="s129">In a restaurant I always have trouble ordering anything that is more than a reasonable portion because to send food back is a crime.</span> <span id="s130">I love fruits but fruits to me come in two categories: Fruits that you could have in Hungary and those that you couldn’t.</span> <span id="s131">For example, an orange or banana will be a delicacy to me for as long as I live because I couldn’t have them until I went to America.</span> <span id="s132">We lead a very modest life in terms of our apartment, the car I drive.</span> <span id="s133">When I get invitations to things I can’t go to, I parcel out all these invitations to people who I know could use the meal.</span> <span id="s134">And so, my elevator operator goes to the embassy party in my name.</span> <span id="s135">He represents me.</span> <span id="s136">He goes to the Brazilian Embassy or to the American Medical Association and he represents me.</span> <span id="s137">All of our young interns get these invitations.</span> <span id="s138">I get invited to ten events a week.</span> <span id="s139">Some of these people need the meal because of their limited income and, for others, it’s a social opportunity.</span> <span id="s140">And, you don’t waste things.</span> <span id="s141">I always saved money.</span> <span id="s142">I have spent more money probably than anybody on term life insurance.</span> <span id="s143">I was married forty years ago and ever since then I’ve carried astronomical amounts of term life insurance because I feel a very deep sense of commitment to my children.</span> <span id="s144">If I should die, my daughters have ten children.</span> <span id="s145">I’m very safety-oriented, very security-oriented.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">WH: How do other survivors see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">TL: I suspect that the most important thing is they all consider me one of them even if they’re all different.</span> <span id="s148">Many survivors live in the past.</span> <span id="s149">But they know I’m very deeply and emotionally involved with all of them, non-religious, non-Hungarian, it doesn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">WH: When you conduct the HUD hearings, is there any particular way you respond that is related to your wartime experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">TL: I am very strongly underdog-oriented and that’s why it’s very difficult in this case.</span> <span id="s152">All of my activities are “dangerous activities.”</span> <span id="s153">For example, I’m chairman of the Labor Oversight Committee.</span> <span id="s154">There we deal with OSHA violations in the factories.</span> <span id="s155">And we deal with child labor violations.</span> <span id="s156">Or I’ll have a hearing on petrochemical industry violations.</span> <span id="s157">We will have to impose penalties in many cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">WH: Doesn’t this make you a bit of an outsider since many come from more privileged circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">TL: I wouldn’t say so.</span> <span id="s160">I probably had as privileged an existence before the war as anybody.</span> <span id="s161">Here, my wife and I went to Europe every year with our children.</span> <span id="s162">I actually had a better life than most other members of Congress.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">WH: So then your feelings for the underdog do stem, in large measure, from the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">TL: I’ve always had a strong social conscience.</span> <span id="s165">For instance it pains me to no end that Pierce is black.</span> <span id="s166">And I think he made a horrendous mistake in how he handled this matter.</span> <span id="s167">I was the most sympathetic committee chairman he could have had.</span> <span id="s168">Taking the Fifth Amendment is a constitutional privilege but if you ask me what I did during my tenure in Congress, I’m proud to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">WH: You own a Mercedes.</span> <span id="s170">Is buying German products in any way an issue for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">TL: I understand it psychologically but it’s so irrelevant to the world we live in.</span> <span id="s172">People should understand that the people who make the Mercedes today are not better or worse than the people who make French or Italian cars or the cars in Detroit.</span> <span id="s173">It’s only a symbol.</span> <span id="s174">It doesn’t bother Israel.</span> <span id="s175">In many ways the Germans have done a good job of teaching about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">WH: Does German reunification make you nervous?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">TL: Well, first of all you need to understand that I’m a pragmatist and it’s a reality.</span> <span id="s178">So the question is how to respond to it.</span> <span id="s179">My answer is to push it into the Western orbit as much as possible.</span> <span id="s180">If Germany becomes part of the Western structure it will be better for everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">WH: How do you feel about the issue of freedom of choice for Russian Jews who want to come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">TL: I’m in favor of a sizeable number being permitted to come to the U.S. but not for every single Soviet Jew being allowed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">WH: If you had to give people advice on how to overcome adversity in life, what would you tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">TL: I am totally unpreoccupied with myself and I am passionately occupied with issues.</span> <span id="s185">Where I am and what necktie I wear is really of no interest to me.</span> <span id="s186">So many people are interested in shallow things.</span> <span id="s187">I’m not suggesting I’m a Mother Theresa.</span> <span id="s188">I enjoy good food, good wine, and I enjoy nature.</span> <span id="s189">I’m not an ascetic.</span> <span id="s190">I have, I feel tremendous joix de vivre.</span> <span id="s191">I’m just saying that I find people who are preoccupied with themselves unbearable.</span> <span id="s192">I’m interested in the light of the Bahai in Iran, the Albanians in Yugoslavia, and child labor law violations, and that makes you a human being.</span> <span id="s193">I love animals.</span> <span id="s194">I feel sorry for them because their understanding is so limited.</span> <span id="s195">So my advice to people is to look and go beyond themselves.</span> <span id="s196">The only reason I wouldn’t want to die tomorrow . . . after all, I’ve had a full life – is that I think I can still so some good.</span> <span id="s197">I’d like to die on the floor of the House.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">WH: What leaders have most impressed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">TL: I would have to say that numbers of my colleagues have impressed me greatly, Tom Foley and Al Gore, and I think very highly of others.</span> <span id="s200">But I cannot name a Churchill in today’s times.</span> <span id="s201">In the past there was Roosevelt, nothwithstanding his policies in World War Two, and there was Lincoln.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0121 PAGE 6</span></p> <p><span id="s203">PAGE</span></p></body></html>
