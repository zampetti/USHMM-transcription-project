you please tell me your name, your name during the war, your date of birth, your place of birth, and anything you possibly can about your childhood and your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: All right.</span> <span id="s6">I was born in Poland, October 16, 1923.</span> <span id="s7">My family name was Rosenblum, Eugene in Polish, it was Eugeniusz.</span> <span id="s8">And I grew up in the city of Lodz.</span> <span id="s9">Lodz was an industrial city.</span> <span id="s10">It was used to be called Polish Manchester, of about 600,000 inhabitants.</span> <span id="s11">Today is about 1,000,000 people.</span> <span id="s12">It was 2nd largest Jewish community in Poland.</span> <span id="s13">It was inhabited by about 200,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s14">It was a vibrant Jewish community.</span> <span id="s15">My parents came to Lodz after fleeing Russia.</span> <span id="s16">They were married in Russia.</span> <span id="s17">My mother was studying at the University in Russia.</span> <span id="s18">My father fled Russia with my mother in 1923 during the Gurinsky regime.</span> <span id="s19">____________ which was really the forerunner of KGB.</span> <span id="s20">They were arresting all the people who were by them the __________.</span> <span id="s21">So my mother went to Lithuania, to the border, 1923, she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s22">____________, she’s going to parents to wait for birth and my father crossed the Russian-Polish boundary and he was wounded by the way the Russians were shooting when they were crossing and arrived in the Polish city of Lodz.</span> <span id="s23">My mother joined him.</span> <span id="s24">There where I was born.</span> <span id="s25">I was born in middle class family.</span> <span id="s26">My father __________.</span> <span id="s27">We lived in a very nice section of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Do you know the name of that section of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Notobicuk 41.</span> <span id="s30">Well, at that point, I better tell you something about Jewish community in Lodz.</span> <span id="s31">It was divided largely three different segments.</span> <span id="s32">The Orthodox Jews which occupied section of town.</span> <span id="s33">They wore Hasidic garb.</span> <span id="s34">That was about 40% of Jewish people in Lodz.</span> <span id="s35">That was a large section of the working class people and that was _______substantial amount of the middle class or upper middle class Jews who were rather prosperous and they lived, for lack of other words, in the nicer part of town.</span> <span id="s36">Most of the people lived in apartments.</span> <span id="s37">In Poland, you didn’t have the __________, the land was too expensive so you have big apartment buildings.</span> <span id="s38">We had about five or six room apartment and like all of the people who live in this section of town, we have a maid, a live-in maid.</span> <span id="s39">We have a girl who came to cook and you always have somebody who came to the door, no washing machine, ever so often and done the wash.</span> <span id="s40">I was attending private schools.</span> <span id="s41">I was going to Hebrew gymnasium.</span> <span id="s42">It was one of the few gymnasiums in Poland from which one could go straight to Polish University with government rights.</span> <span id="s43">We didn’t have to pass any exams.</span> <span id="s44">At the same time, when they issued the anfamatura which was probably the closest to it in the United States is the regents exams that you get in New York.</span> <span id="s45">When they issue the certificate of completion.</span> <span id="s46">It was also recognized in the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and you could enter right away the University ____________ to pass a special examination.</span> <span id="s47">There were three schools, they called it 1st gymnasium and 2nd gymnasium.</span> <span id="s48">They were just across from each other and there was a girls gymnasium.</span> <span id="s49">As I grew up, we participate most, most of the children attended the school were members of Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s50">At that time, probably what organization you belonged, it wasn’t determined by your political views because we were just teached at that time but it was determined by the shahim the representative of the kibbutz movement, who was a better organizer was able to attract more children.</span> <span id="s51">I belonged to Hashoma Hatsayeer, although my parents were well off, it was left wing organization.</span> <span id="s52">Poland by itself, even before Hitler, was anti-Semitic state.</span> <span id="s53">When we were going to school, I remember very often we have to cross the so-called people university, and we went through a hail of stones thrown at us.</span> <span id="s54">I remember when I was growing up after the dictator of Poland _________died in 1935, who understood that Poland needed the middle class and Jews were the middle class.</span> <span id="s55">They were the profession, they were the merchants, they were the manufacturers.</span> <span id="s56">After he died, Poland became openly anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s57">When I went to school, oh it was about 15-20 minutes walk, I passed at least five or ten intersections and there was always scribble on the corner, “Jews to Palestine”.</span> <span id="s58">So, since Poland was verantly nationalistic and they were afraid of Russia, it bordered on hysteria how they were afraid of Communism.</span> <span id="s59">Jews, even from affluent home, just as a purpose of what they saw and the atmosphere in which they grew up, were drawn to left wing organization.</span> <span id="s60">And I find myself Hashoma Hatsayeer where we all realize although we were children and I was fifteen and a half when the war started, we all realize that there is no future in Poland.</span> <span id="s61">My parents wanted me to go to France, my father had a brother over there who was manufacturer, a silk manufacturer, he felt he wanted me to go and study in France.</span> <span id="s62">Polish Jews were not admitted, there were some Polish University but there were numerous clauses.</span> <span id="s63">Numerous clauses mean restricted quota for Jews.</span> <span id="s64">It was very hard to get, so most of the Jews went to a university town of Nance near Strasburg and they lost a year.</span> <span id="s65">They learned French and they got the degrees there.</span> <span id="s66">I was slated to go over there.</span> <span id="s67">My childhood was a happy one but we knew there was no future in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: What can you tell me, was your family observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Well, it was maybe in sense of American values.</span> <span id="s70">There was on big, great synagogue in Lodz.</span> <span id="s71">To Orthodox Jews, it was probably worse than going to a reformed synagogue here.</span> <span id="s72">But yet, the women were on the balcony, the men sit on the first floor and my parents attend the high holy days.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Did you keep kosher at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Quasi kosher.</span> <span id="s75">Because of my grandfather, was quasi kosher.</span> <span id="s76">We are not a very observant family in the usual standards of Polish Jewry but still I went to Hebrew gymnasium and culturally we were very much Jews but quote, unquote emancipated Jews and not religious Jews.</span> <span id="s77">My father belonged to Hartzerarde.</span> <span id="s78">In Hebrew this is ______________.</span> <span id="s79">That was the ___________________.</span> <span id="s80">My mother worked as a volunteer for ORT which organization supported the teaching of trades to the Jewish kids who didn’t have the financial means to go to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s81">Not that many in Poland, a very small percent of children went to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s82">Probably, no more than five or ten percent.</span> <span id="s83">By Jews, much larger percent.</span> <span id="s84">I cannot put the exact percentage but most of the children did not finish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s85">This kids were trained by ORT, they were in dire straits and so forth.</span> <span id="s86">Naturally, the religious Jews tried to educate their children in the religious schools, did not have government rights.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: My parents spoke Russian among themselves, that was the language they knew the best but they spoke fluently Polish.</span> <span id="s89">As a matter of fact, my father spoke fluently Polish, German and Russian.</span> <span id="s90">So did my mother.</span> <span id="s91">My mother also spoke French.</span> <span id="s92">But to me they spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s93">I didn’t know that much Yiddish.</span> <span id="s94">I don’t know for the purpose of a background maybe, the Zionist begged the parents not to teach the kids Jewish, to teach Hebrew.</span> <span id="s95">I went to Hebrew gymnasium.</span> <span id="s96">I learned Yiddish already from my father-in-law a little bit after I got married and in ghetto but no, no, we spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s97">We spoke probably Polish better than Poles because the way they were able to recognize that a girl which had Aryan look but was Jewish that she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s98">Jews spoke pure Polish without any regional inflection.</span> <span id="s99">Almost every Pole had a little bit regional inflection.</span> <span id="s100">Our Polish was colorless or classic.</span> <span id="s101">So we spoke very well Polish.</span> <span id="s102">I liked the language.</span> <span id="s103">I don’t like the people but I still like Polish literature, and so forth.</span> <span id="s104">But our orientation was very much Zionist, because in our mind there was no other solution to the Jewish problem in Poland but to immigrate; immigration to Israel, to Palestine was restricted so probably most of us knew we would have to go to _____________some countries but Poland was not in our future.</span> <span id="s105">When the war started, I was fifteen and a half years old.</span> <span id="s106">Polish radio started to broadcast the third or fourth day of war, urgent appeal all men should go in direction of center of Warsaw which is about 120 kilos, that’s from Lodz.</span> <span id="s107">Most of the men left.</span> <span id="s108">I went together with my father.</span> <span id="s109">We reached Warsaw before the Germans were able to lay siege around Warsaw.</span> <span id="s110">We lived through the battle of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s111">When I returned home, we were not allowed to have a maid.</span> <span id="s112">No gentile could work for Jew.</span> <span id="s113">But, we still had our apartment.</span> <span id="s114">I had a big dog, a Great Dane.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Rex.The dog was seven or eight years old at that time.</span> <span id="s117">I remember it was two or three weeks after we returned.</span> <span id="s118">It was still probably middle of October or end of October.</span> <span id="s119">My mother took all of her jewelry except one small ring off of her hands and somebody knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s120">My mother opened and a German, a German non-commissioned officer pushed the door open, grabbed my mother’s hand and tried to take the ring off.</span> <span id="s121">He didn’t see the dog.</span> <span id="s122">The dog jumped.</span> <span id="s123">The dog was 140-130 pounds Great Dane.</span> <span id="s124">He went to the floor and he went to his throat.</span> <span id="s125">He pointed the gun at my mother and he told to me you won’t take the dog away, I’ll shoot your mother.</span> <span id="s126">I said “put your gun away and I’ll try to take the dog but don’t move”.</span> <span id="s127">I took the dog away and he told my mother should take her coat, she is going to the criminal police and he will charge that we instigated the dog to attack a German soldier.</span> <span id="s128">Well, my mother spoke very well German.</span> <span id="s129">She told, “all right, I want also to ask if the German soldier is allowed to act as common robbers if all that we have belongs to the German government, you certain of the German government”.</span> <span id="s130">Well, after long negotiations, my mother gave him some valuables.</span> <span id="s131">He relented but I had to take the dog down and I had to tie him, that was a contraption that was used to beat the rocks, clean the rocks and I had to tie the dog.</span> <span id="s132">And he shot the dog.</span> <span id="s133">That was the first thing I lost.</span> <span id="s134">I was sick for three weeks.</span> <span id="s135">That was the first loss of somebody I love.</span> <span id="s136">I loved the dog because I grew up with him.</span> <span id="s137">Well, things got worse.</span> <span id="s138">We were ordered to put Stars of David, the yellow patches in the shape of the star.</span> <span id="s139">We wore one on the left breast and one on the back.</span> <span id="s140">I said I’m not going to put it on and I went out and I was caught and I was very badly beaten.</span> <span id="s141">When I came home, I told my father that I wanted to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s142">At that time, to Russia occupied zone.</span> <span id="s143">At that time, Russia allowed every few weeks, the people who come there divided demarcation line to cross Russia occupied part of Poland.</span> <span id="s144">My father told me he doesn’t have the strength or inclination to go.</span> <span id="s145">He said son, you might not realize but to go to Russia is one-way ticket.</span> <span id="s146">You will be able to get in but you will never be able to get out.</span> <span id="s147">I fled from there.</span> <span id="s148">I’ll take my chances with Germans.</span> <span id="s149">And that wasn’t just my father.</span> <span id="s150">To them the Russians were the occult Bolsheviks and this and they still felt the Hitler regime was aberration and whatever will happen, they’ll survive the war and things return to normal and they will live in free Europe.</span> <span id="s151">So they gave me some valuables and sent me off.</span> <span id="s152">My mother told me when I was leaving on my way to Russia, “Son, take a good look at your parents.</span> <span id="s153">You will never see them again.”</span> <span id="s154">And I went and I was an only child, 16 years old, never away from home except when I went to summer camp.</span> <span id="s155">And these words, I could hear the words in my ears to the entire way I reached the Russian boundary and they were supposed to open the day before.</span> <span id="s156">I waited for about three or four days.</span> <span id="s157">I decided, well whatever is going to happen is going to happen to me and my parents and when I returned, they were already in process of setting up ghetto.</span> <span id="s158">The ghetto, I think, was established in the first month, I don’t remember the exact month, sometimes around April of 1940.</span> <span id="s159">The ghetto boundaries were already established and the Jews were encouraged to move there.</span> <span id="s160">Nobody was moving.</span> <span id="s161">At that time, the Russians had deported or repatriated rather, the German population from Latvia, from Volhynia, from the parts of Poland, in particle, they were mostly by Germans, in the states which Russia occupied after 1939 and they were given the choice of Jewish apartments as we lived in the nice section of town where one of the parents were to go.</span> <span id="s162">Two German officials came and told us we had one hour and we could take whatever we could carry plus ______.</span> <span id="s163">(couldn’t hear) to go, so we went.</span> <span id="s164">We were able to get a room in one of the two or three homes which had modern conveniences like water, flush toilets and so forth.</span> <span id="s165">The ghetto to which they press around 150,000 -- 160,000 Jews, was occupied before probably by 10,000 -- 15,000 people and that was the worst slums __________ by looting.</span> <span id="s166">There were very few buildings which really resembled anything we know before we got the room in one of these buildings.</span> <span id="s167">They closed the ghetto and in the beginning it was already no more horrors by the Germans, there were no more beatings, there were no more shootings.</span> <span id="s168">The ghetto started to organize itself but almost from the beginning the rations of food became much smaller and we got progressively less and less to eat.</span> <span id="s169">I didn’t finish gymnasium before the war.</span> <span id="s170">I finish in ghetto.</span> <span id="s171">Polish didn’t have right.</span> <span id="s172">They forbid Polish to have any kind of schools.</span> <span id="s173">They close all Polish schools.</span> <span id="s174">Somehow, they probably knew they were going to liquidate the population sooner or later they pay no attention so schools open in ghetto so I finish in ghetto.</span> <span id="s175">What happen in ghetto in beginning years, it was a slow starvation.</span> <span id="s176">The ______, a man in his early 60’s, he was a minor official in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s177">He was active in Jewish orphanages.</span> <span id="s178">He never had children.</span> <span id="s179">He raise quite a bit of money for the orphans.</span> <span id="s180">He was one of the few people who didn’t flee when all the men left Lodz and went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s181">When the Germans came and he was there and they told him he is the alderman of the Jews.</span> <span id="s182">He started to organize Jewish life.</span> <span id="s183">The men were already had their blood which he bought by the grave of his wife which was buried there.</span> <span id="s184">He was really widening up his ears.</span> <span id="s185">Evidently, all the power of the Germans was vested in him.</span> <span id="s186">He became absolute ruler of the ghetto and to us he seemed like a man that was drugged with power On the other feeling of course was that if we are going to make useful our services to the Germans, good part of the Jews might survive.</span> <span id="s187">No bodies even worst fears believed that the Germans would try to physically annihilate every woman and child.</span> <span id="s188">Well, he establish schools.</span> <span id="s189">He started to establish so-called “arbisin”, they were shops which manufacture various things with the Germans farvartung with the Germans were the people who administer the ghetto brought to the ghetto and they have a large number of people working in the resorts and in exchange they were sending food to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s190">What I remember from now on, I was still young but was rather a shielded childhood and we grew up in a hurry.</span> <span id="s191">What I remember was hunger, terrible hunger.</span> <span id="s192">And it started very, very slowly by the people who were middle aged.</span> <span id="s193">And I say people after 40, 45.</span> <span id="s194">They had started to deprive.</span> <span id="s195">More and more you saw people who had swollen feet, swollen hands.</span> <span id="s196">The winters are very harsh in Poland and there was nothing to heat their apartments with or the rooms with.</span> <span id="s197">There was very little even wood or coal briquettes to be able to cook something.</span> <span id="s198">People were very hungry.</span> <span id="s199">A lot of them tried to crumble the bread and cook the bread and make a soup out of this so that physically they could pacify their hunger pangs.</span> <span id="s200">But, they consumed a lot of liquid and the heart was not able to pump and the water settled in the feet and people started to die out.</span> <span id="s201">And we had 60, 70 funerals a day.</span> <span id="s202">50 funerals a day will be 1,500 people a month.</span> <span id="s203">That was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s204">In the beginning, the funerals resembles more or less which were held before the war but sooner or later there was only mass grave.</span> <span id="s205">Well, like a mass grave, one mount under the other unmarked graves.</span> <span id="s206">My father was taken 1941 to Gestapo.</span> <span id="s207">They had the registers.</span> <span id="s208">_________ (can’t understand).</span> <span id="s209">He came very badly beaten and he died a few weeks later.</span> <span id="s210">I was left with my mother.</span> <span id="s211">Things got even worse as far as the food was concerned.</span> <span id="s212">But yet the younger people organize themselves, called Self-Help Organization.</span> <span id="s213">The morale was, well, we still felt that we had a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s214">This had changed in 1942.</span> <span id="s215">In 1942, the runcoston had a _________ assembly.</span> <span id="s216">It’s 92, 50 years before and I still remember.</span> <span id="s217">He said to us, he stand before us as broken man, that he devoted all of his later years to helping orphans, he organized orphanages even un ghetto and he tried to give him as much resources to survive as he could and yet he was ordered by the Germans that he was to deliver 24,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s218">Jews over 60 years old and children under 10.</span> <span id="s219">He told us, you have a choice.</span> <span id="s220">Our police would take them and it would be dark in semi-orderly fashion or the Germans would come and take them and it would be much worse.</span> <span id="s221">If we want to survive, the 100,000 Jews which at the point were locked up in the ghetto want to survive, they have to give up 20,000.</span> <span id="s222">Well, the chorus arise, no, no, we all go.</span> <span id="s223">And if the reaction was the people concerned to this, it was emphatically, no.</span> <span id="s224">Yet, they declare curfew and nobody was allowed out of their homes and the Jewish police went from house to house and there were some doctors among them and they make the selections.</span> <span id="s225">All the sickly people and the older people and the children were taken away.</span> <span id="s226">But what the Jewish police did was not good enough for Germans and they came.</span> <span id="s227">Some people were shot.</span> <span id="s228">They tore the children from the mothers’ arms.</span> <span id="s229">They beat the people.</span> <span id="s230">The mothers who resisted were shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s231">In most cases, the women remained frozen when the Germans took the children away.</span> <span id="s232">Only when the child was already on the horse drawn wagon, they realize what happen, they start to chase and cry.</span> <span id="s233">Well, they took the 20,000, 25,000 people.</span> <span id="s234">And from then on, almost every able -bodied man or woman or teenager or this, had to work.</span> <span id="s235">The food supply didn’t improve -- deteriorate, more and more.</span> <span id="s236">There was a lot of mismanagement, in ghetto.</span> <span id="s237">He tried Rumkoski tried to store some of the potatoes, you know, which were supposed to be rationed to the population.</span> <span id="s238">And the whole thing, the entire crop got spoiled.</span> <span id="s239">In 1942, I think, 1943, the Germans appointed Gertler, who was one of the collaborators in trying to extract as much valuables and this from the Jews, from the Germans, he appointed him head of the so called sondokommando.</span> <span id="s240">He tried to bring some order to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s241">In a way he did.</span> <span id="s242">He made the thing look a little more efficient.</span> <span id="s243">In the meanwhile, more and more, the demand for more __________ were given and people were left in apartments.</span> <span id="s244">3,000, 5,000, 10,000 and when you walk the streets of the ghetto 1943, 1944 you saw, they used to call mussermench,________ because the people pattern of working and bending looked like a praying Muslim.</span> <span id="s245">The people became living skeleton, some of them were swollen, some of them looked like skeletons and you could see a good part of the population was so emaciated that the war is not going to end soon, they are going to die.</span> <span id="s246">Well, the ghetto lived until 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: What were you doing this whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I was working.</span> <span id="s249">I was working in the office of a sort of a shop getting my rations.</span> <span id="s250">In 1943, my mother died of starvation.</span> <span id="s251">She lost weight progressively and finally she was not able to walk any more.</span> <span id="s252">She stayed in bed constantly.</span> <span id="s253">____________(very low -- can’t hear).</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Had she been working?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Well, she had been working until she got sick.</span> <span id="s256">She did ________ in a shop.</span> <span id="s257">Then she got sick.</span> <span id="s258">She got the typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s259">She got sick, she never recovered.</span> <span id="s260">She died.</span> <span id="s261">I was left alone.</span> <span id="s262">In 1944, the Germans started to evacuate the ghetto.</span> <span id="s263">They ordered that people will report, about 5,000 people a day, for deportation.</span> <span id="s264">Of course, they refused.</span> <span id="s265">So to give the order for deportation.</span> <span id="s266">So the Germans took the enslight the head of the ghetto administration, went from shop to shop promising that people will go into Germany, living conditions would be better, they will be better fed and so forth but nobody trusted him.</span> <span id="s267">People tried to avoid deportation as long as they could.</span> <span id="s268">I left Lodz in August 23rd 1944.</span> <span id="s269">We didn’t know where we go.</span> <span id="s270">Probably if we would know where we go and what Auschwitz is, we would get vicious to board the trains and probably shot, but that would be at least passive resistance but we really didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Had you heard about the camps at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Lodz ghetto was the most isolated ghetto in Poland.</span> <span id="s273">Every hundred feet you get a German guard.</span> <span id="s274">We didn’t get no papers, nothing.</span> <span id="s275">Supposedly, few survivors from Chedno were able to escape__________ but the population didn’t know.</span> <span id="s276">We knew that clothes came back to the ghetto from the people who were deported, the old and the sick people and people had foreboding that nothing good comes and they probably perish but they didn’t know that systematic extermination and this.</span> <span id="s277">Well, we boarded the train.</span> <span id="s278">There was hundred people in a cattle car in which we were transported.</span> <span id="s279">We went for about three or four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Can I stop you?</span> <span id="s281">I want to flip the tape over.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">(END OF SIDE A)</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: All right.</span> <span id="s284">So, when we boarded the train, there were 100 people in our, whatever you call this, and what they gave us, there was one bucket which was supposed to serve if people wanted to relieve themselves.</span> <span id="s285">There was no water.</span> <span id="s286">A little bit of food we took with.</span> <span id="s287">I think it took us about four days out to reach Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s288">We came at night.</span> <span id="s289">We were allowed to take hand baggage.</span> <span id="s290">When the doors opened, we saw people pointing to us looked like a fine striped pajamas uniforms.</span> <span id="s291">But they spoke to us Polish and told us, “please leave all the things inside the car.</span> <span id="s292">Just get out, get out, get out.”</span> <span id="s293">Before we could do anything else, we form a line, we saw a lot of SS running with the pistols and with guns, whipping people and we were marching top a well lighted platform and Mengele was standing there and conducted the selection.</span> <span id="s294">And with a flip of the hand, some went to the right, some went to the left.</span> <span id="s295">We had no idea what it means.</span> <span id="s296">I went to the right.</span> <span id="s297">They took us, they took all the clothes away, they shave us completely and they give us the striped uniforms and a number and we were led to a barracks.</span> <span id="s298">Barrack that were former quarters of Austrian cavalry from before WWI and when you slept over there you could lay down on one side but we were pressed so much that there was no place to turn around.</span> <span id="s299">I still have, 50 years, I have scars about size of half dollar because we were all bones at that time and laying and pressing, the bones were pressing against the wood and the things got infected.</span> <span id="s300">I was about two weeks -- I wasn’t in Auschwitz, I was in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s301">Birkenau was part of Auschwitz complex but there was, people didn’t work over there.</span> <span id="s302">People were either sent to the gas chamber, either sent out to other German concentration camps at that time.</span> <span id="s303">You could see when we went to the barrack, the flames shooting and the block leader told us what it is, that the people from the selections are having appointment with their forefathers.</span> <span id="s304">Well, anyway, I was there for two weeks and I was selected and put into a transport and I met one of my former classmates, Jerry Malikoff and we decided that we stick together.</span> <span id="s305">And we were, together, almost to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s306">We were deported to the _______ commander of Dachau.</span> <span id="s307">That was a separate ________ camps of Dachau.</span> <span id="s308">Dachau was much minor camp in comparison.</span> <span id="s309">___________.</span> <span id="s310">There were just camps in which the Jews worked until they dropped dead and they send us more and more and more people.</span> <span id="s311">.</span> <span id="s312">I was in the lager 4 which was _______ I was in lager 11 which was _______, and we work on Commander Morris.</span> <span id="s313">All day we had to carry 50 pounds cement sacks from early dawn till it got dark and we always carry number of people who died.</span> <span id="s314">If you couldn’t work, they beat you to death.</span> <span id="s315">And we had to carry the dead bodies back because they have to count every day.</span> <span id="s316">We stood on the appell platz, that was the place where they counted the prisoners and the number of the prisoners had to tally, even if we stood late in the night.</span> <span id="s317">I was lucky for a short while to get the job _________.</span> <span id="s318">Then they used us to take care of other prisoners.</span> <span id="s319">When you are sick, when you get your slice of bread you couldn’t eat everything and there was a lot of bread left.</span> <span id="s320">At that time, I gained some weight but after a while the Germans got tired of it and they took away with the transport all the sick people, the block was liquidated and we went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: You weren’t too sick to leave, you recovered?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s323">At that time, I got infected feet and I got blood poisoning and they took me and doctor _______, the physician was later -- he attended at our wedding.</span> <span id="s324">My wife went to nursing school and he was director of nursing school after the war.</span> <span id="s325">He attended our wedding He told me, you come son, I have to amputate or you die.</span> <span id="s326">And they didn’t have no anesthetics and he told me “but look, you’ll be in pain but you’ll faint’.</span> <span id="s327">And few people put me on the table, they help me and I just realize at that moment that they are going to take away the toes of my foot.</span> <span id="s328">They are going to amputate, I’ll be sent away to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s329">So with all the strength I have, I tore myself out and I run away.</span> <span id="s330">I run away and I went to the working detail.</span> <span id="s331">At that time, I had no feeling in my foot _________ and I must have stepped on a very sharp stone and it cut deeply but that saved me and the pus and everything started to drain.</span> <span id="s332">After the war I still had operation and I had pieces of bone taken out of my toes but I survived this.</span> <span id="s333">When the Allies started to come in and they started to come in direction of Dachau from Ausborg, which was miles away, they put us all on the trains.</span> <span id="s334">Then they started to gather all the prisoners into the main camp in Dachau, although we were probably no more than twenty, thirty miles to Dachau, everything wass bombed, and I was in transit for about four or five days.</span> <span id="s335">There was no water, there was no food.</span> <span id="s336">Some people went crazy and they drank their own urine.</span> <span id="s337">When my train came to Dachau, they unloaded ____________ boxcar.</span> <span id="s338">They unloaded my boxcar.</span> <span id="s339">That was the last boxcar they unloaded.</span> <span id="s340">There were more dead than alive and when the American army came two days later, they found the entire train, say the first five boxcars, boxcars full of dead prisoners.</span> <span id="s341">Well, and what the Americans done -- they put us.</span> <span id="s342">I was in the hospital for quite a few months and I decided to go back to Poland to see if anyone had survived.</span> <span id="s343">We had, during the war, when we knew that they are going to take our apartment away, that sooner or later we had to move to ghetto, we had neighbors.</span> <span id="s344">Their name was Mitchelene, they were Poles.</span> <span id="s345">He was, the father of the man was Italian and the mother was Polish but they lived in Poland and we knew them very, very well.</span> <span id="s346">As a matter of fact, the woman was carrying _________, my mother was carrying her _________.</span> <span id="s347">I knew the people for fourteen years, from the time I moved in the house to the time I was deported.</span> <span id="s348">My mother took all the crystals, all the china, all the silver up to them and said, “Look, I doubt if we will get alive from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s349">That’s all yours.”</span> <span id="s350">We survived.</span> <span id="s351">We didn’t expect.</span> <span id="s352">Well, I went over there when I came.</span> <span id="s353">I went with the transport to Poland, Polish transport of course, repatriated to Poland, it was very easy to get on the train.</span> <span id="s354">I came over there, I went on the tenth floor.</span> <span id="s355">I knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s356">A woman opened the door and she tried to slam in my face.</span> <span id="s357">“We have nothing, we have nothing.”</span> <span id="s358">I was just able to hold the door open and I said “look, I don’t want nothing from you.</span> <span id="s359">I came from Auschwitz and I saw the silver and the money and the crystals all mingled with blood.</span> <span id="s360">All I want to know, did somebody from my family, my cousins, did survive, look for me”.</span> <span id="s361">She said “nobody” and she slammed the door in my face.</span> <span id="s362">I was three days in Poland and didn’t find nobody and went back.</span> <span id="s363">In the beginning, the liberated prisoners who were __________ in Munich, which is twenty miles from Dachau but I _________ north to Frankfort on Meine and __________ opened and I enrolled ____________.</span> <span id="s364">(Couldn’t understand him).</span> <span id="s365">university and started to study pharmacy.</span> <span id="s366">I got married in 1948.</span> <span id="s367">My wife was in nursing school at that time.</span> <span id="s368">We came here.</span> <span id="s369">Well, my story is for all the people who came displaced persons, who came to this country.</span> <span id="s370">We worked for a couple of years and then I went back to school.</span> <span id="s371">I got my PhD from medical school from the University of Chicago and came to Washington, started with the government.</span> <span id="s372">For the last ten years before retirement, I directed the ______________ research department that was the only large animal ____________ where my medical research was conducted.</span> <span id="s373">I retired in 1989.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Are there any other things from any time in your life that you would like to add?</span> <span id="s375">Do you think maybe you have thought of anything from earlier back?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: You mean from before?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Before the war, during the war, episodes that stand out?</span> <span id="s378">I know you told me a number of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Episodes that stands in my mind was the deportation in 1942.</span> <span id="s380">It was a nightmare.</span> <span id="s381">The cries of the people; the children torn from the mother’s arms.</span> <span id="s382">The old people who went in such a resigned way, with the look in their eyes -- they know that that’s their last trip.</span> <span id="s383">They didn’t know what’s going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s384">But they knew that that’s the end.</span> <span id="s385">That was one.</span> <span id="s386">The second was the shock of coming to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s387">The selection.</span> <span id="s388">The realization.</span> <span id="s389">The flames that were shooting toward the sky when we were told that all the people who went to the left side were selected by Mengele.</span> <span id="s390">This probably I remember still most deeply.</span> <span id="s391">I saw Mengele for about ten minutes.</span> <span id="s392">Pass the line until I pass him by.</span> <span id="s393">I probably, if he would look like he looked then, I would recognize him immediately.</span> <span id="s394">The other thing which I remember was the will to live.</span> <span id="s395">People wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s396">People wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s397">They wanted to tell the story.</span> <span id="s398">We never believed at that time that the world really know what’s happening to us.</span> <span id="s399">People were clinging to their lives and they wanted to preserve something.</span> <span id="s400">The other thing, I never attended synagogue till my daughter was born and she was about six or seven years old, we lived in Chicago.</span> <span id="s401">One day, ________, she came “Daddy, Daddy, look, sisters are coming”.</span> <span id="s402">I said what are you mumbling, what sisters?</span> <span id="s403">I look and I saw two nuns.</span> <span id="s404">And I said, “Judy, tomorrow you go to Sunday School.”</span> <span id="s405">And I took her to Sunday school.</span> <span id="s406">But it took years for us to reconcile and regain some kind of emotional balance although we are outwardly very, very well balanced, but the whole coming to the United States, trying to work, trying to get ______ degree.</span> <span id="s407">Well, people were really subconsciously trying to do, they try to do that many things, that they went finally to sleep, they collapse .</span> <span id="s408">There was no time to think.</span> <span id="s409">It was, I don’t know, I know there was no neurotic drive, only that there was self- preservation.</span> <span id="s410">But people tried, not to forget, but people simply were haunted.</span> <span id="s411">It was almost in everybody’s mind, the question, people question “Why did I survive?</span> <span id="s412">Why didn’t the other one survive?”</span> <span id="s413">And you know what was probably the most painful question was when you talk to people and they didn’t meant nothing.</span> <span id="s414">We did hear, just very innocently asking, “Why and how did you survive?”</span> <span id="s415">We couldn’t -- it helped them.</span> <span id="s416">We couldn’t answer the question ourselves but people felt guilty without being able to explain to themselves that they are not guilty of nothing and it took number of years.</span> <span id="s417">It took quite a few years until, you know, the children came and life went on, and we’re young and the things which happened receded and ________ accepting from God then, life went on and we raised families and we became part of American society.</span> <span id="s418">And I hope we contributed.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: From what I can see, you certainly have.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: When I finished, I had around seventy or eighty papers and presentations on my city.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Amazing.</span> <span id="s422">Can I ask you one specific question that you made a reference earlier to that you went to summer camp as a child, was that a Zionist summer camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: That was school camp.</span> <span id="s424">Well, it was a Zionist, not be definition, it was Zionist by what permeated.</span> <span id="s425">I remember as children we made the campfires and we stood and we sang Hebrew Zionist songs, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s426">It was not a Zionist organized, but culturally it was a Zionist camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Thanks.</span> <span id="s428">Can we go on, would you mind talking a little bit about your mother now?</span> <span id="s429">Can we do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s431">My mother, like most of the women in the middle class, around a hundred middle class families, didn’t work.</span> <span id="s432">She was active, she was active in Jewish life.</span> <span id="s433">She traveled.</span> <span id="s434">As a matter of fact, my mother was in the United States attending the World Fair in 1939.</span> <span id="s435">She came to see her brothers.</span> <span id="s436">When she returned to Poland two weeks before the war started, her brother begged her to stay but you know, she said “look, I have a child and my husband over there.”</span> <span id="s437">When she crossed Germany, the train was seeing, nobody could get, you know, she just transited into Germany, into Poland.</span> <span id="s438">If the war had broken out two weeks earlier, I would still have probably my mother alive.</span> <span id="s439">I remember in 1938, Germans expelled the Jews who were once Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s440">We were not at that far from the border.</span> <span id="s441">Lodz, I don’t know, maybe two, three hundred miles from the border, from the western border in Germany.</span> <span id="s442">We kept a young boy and I shared the room for a while, I don’t remember, for half a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: He came and lived with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s445">The Jewish community took the children and then his parents came and took him away.</span> <span id="s446">They got situated.</span> <span id="s447">The brothers of my mother tried to talk us into leaving Poland and coming to the States but my father was a metal agent at that time.</span> <span id="s448">We had _________, we were very, very financially comfortable and he felt, his reasoning was, I don’t know the language, you can take no money out of Poland.</span> <span id="s449">You could just go as you were.</span> <span id="s450">What am I going to do over there?</span> <span id="s451">And he didn’t.</span> <span id="s452">He didn’t want to go and they paid with their lives, my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Can we go back, do you know your mother’s birth date by any chance?</span> <span id="s454">Anything, the town where she came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s456">My mother came -- just a second.</span> <span id="s457">Yes, my mother was about 23 when I was born so she was born probably around 1900.</span> <span id="s458">She lived in a small town in Lithuania, Batinia, Lithuania.</span> <span id="s459">My grandfather was very well to do.</span> <span id="s460">He owned quite a bit of land.</span> <span id="s461">He owned a sawmill.</span> <span id="s462">He owned a flourmill ad my grandparents sent us packages in 1941 to the ghetto from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s463">The packages reached the ghetto.</span> <span id="s464">They were killed -- the Lithuanians killed them even before the Germans.</span> <span id="s465">In the two to three days when the Russians pulled away and before the Germans occupied physically the town, the entire Jewish population was finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Do you know about your mother’s education?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: My mother attended the university, in Russia _____________.</span> <span id="s468">She was interned a year ______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: What was she studying?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: What about the Jewish life in her home?</span> <span id="s472">Were they observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Oh, yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s474">My mother’s family certain was more, they were not Hasidic, but they were more observant.</span> <span id="s475">Entire generation, my grandparents were much more observant.</span> <span id="s476">My dad’s father was much more observant than we were.</span> <span id="s477">But you have to understand one thing.</span> <span id="s478">My parents went through WW1.</span> <span id="s479">They lived already under the communist regime for a while, for a few years before they were able to extricate themselves from Russia.</span> <span id="s480">And probably just like today’s generation of the people veer from the strict religious practices of their parents, they veer from the strict religious practices of their parents.</span> <span id="s481">In other words, the meat was kosher still at home but when we ate dinner, we could have coffee or tea with milk, you know.</span> <span id="s482">It was kosher but not in the strictest sense of this.</span> <span id="s483">We had two sets of dishes and so forth.</span> <span id="s484">I remember, I went for Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur with my dad to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: For Shabbat, you would work on Shabbat?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Well, there were candles.</span> <span id="s487">There were candles at home but you took the streetcar.</span> <span id="s488">My father rode the car, he had a car which was in Poland, there were not too many cars but he had a car.</span> <span id="s489">Shabbat was much more a tradition than a religious observance.</span> <span id="s490">We never went for Sabbath day and Friday services.</span> <span id="s491">The synagogue was quite a distance from where we lived and it was the only one big synagogue in ________ Lodz.</span> <span id="s492">Our home was a Zionist home, much more than a religious home.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: I understand.</span> <span id="s494">I was just asking.</span> <span id="s495">Can you tell me something more about your mother’s personality?</span> <span id="s496">Anything you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: She was young and she was full of life.</span> <span id="s498">My mother played beautiful violin.</span> <span id="s499">She was not a concert violinist but I remember her playing for her friends and so forth.</span> <span id="s500">She got active with several of her friends.</span> <span id="s501">I’ve got a large family.</span> <span id="s502">All three sisters of my mother and they got children, they are my cousins.</span> <span id="s503">From the entire family, that’s what I went to look for, I’m the only survivor.</span> <span id="s504">She had two brothers in this country.</span> <span id="s505">One of them, we took the name of my uncle in L.A.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: He sponsored you to come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Yes, but when we came here, it is hard to explain.</span> <span id="s508">The only thing what we were able to salvage from the old country was the __________.</span> <span id="s509">I remember we came to Chicago and I already got my job.</span> <span id="s510">I started very low class, then I got into the lab.</span> <span id="s511">When I got in touch with my uncle, when he called, my wife’s on the phone.</span> <span id="s512">All he wanted to know, if she’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s513">After talking to her, my wife left Chicago, she was at NIH, at the time she worked as a nurse.</span> <span id="s514">My wife has _______ we have a large home in L.A.</span> <span id="s515">Why don’t you come out, you will live with us, I’ll put my nephew on the payroll ad he could go to school.</span> <span id="s516">When I came my wife was almost ready to pack.</span> <span id="s517">And I told her look.</span> <span id="s518">He has two children.</span> <span id="s519">In spite of what he said, the kids will say that a pair of refugees came and moved smack into our parent’s home.”</span> <span id="s520">I said you cannot have it both ways.</span> <span id="s521">If you want to be independent you have to stay independent.</span> <span id="s522">I went to visit my uncle.</span> <span id="s523">They were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s524">When I was going to school for every Jewish holiday and Christian holiday, he sent me $100 check and he tried to do it in a quiet sort of way.</span> <span id="s525">And it helped, at that time it helped.</span> <span id="s526">But what we did, we did on our own.</span> <span id="s527">We pulled ourselves up.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Have you tried to find out about family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: I wrote them a letter.</span> <span id="s530">I remember my father-in-law was a very, very bitter man.</span> <span id="s531">He never reconciled himself to what happened.</span> <span id="s532">He just could not reconcile that people have wives, family and this, you know, and his wife perish and his mother perish.</span> <span id="s533">I was younger, but we were also bitter at that time.</span> <span id="s534">We’re not bitter at nobody in particular.</span> <span id="s535">I wrote them a letter and I said “look, I’m at the university, I’m studying, I’m not asking for nothing, I don’t need nothing but you are entitled to know what happened to your family.”</span> <span id="s536">And I wrote it.</span> <span id="s537">And the answer was “Look you never asked us for nothing, we didn’t refuse you nothing.”</span> <span id="s538">They couldn’t understand probably __________, why the letters were so bitter.</span> <span id="s539">When I came here, you see this is the difference probably between the immigration, between the displaced persons who came here at that time.</span> <span id="s540">We spent very little, just wanted a chance.</span> <span id="s541">Russian Jews, and I quite active now with Russian Jews, they expect much
