League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: This is Rhoda Lewin interviewing Paulette Fink on June 9, 1987 for the Holocaust Oral History Project.</span> <span id="s5">Paulette, could we start by telling us your complete name, including your Jewish name if it’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I was born Paulette Way, which you would call Weil in this country.</span> <span id="s7">I think that my middle name is Sara but I really never until I got to this country really knew it because the French are not all that conscious of giving a Jewish name, especially not when you’re a reform Jew.</span> <span id="s8">So that’s all I can say about my middle name.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: And when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I was born October 22, 1911.</span> <span id="s11">In the eastern part of France, in a town called Millouse, where my father was from.</span> <span id="s12">My father married a Parisian who never got used to living anywhere outside of Paris, so my brother and I were born there, and I left at the age of two and a half, and my brother was two or three months old.</span> <span id="s13">Actually, we never lived there, because first of all the first World War caught us; my mother always took us to Switzerland during the summer and we were in Switzerland in August, 1914 when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s14">My father immediately got in touch with mother; I don’t know what the communication was at the time, but he said, “Don’t move.</span> <span id="s15">Don’t move.</span> <span id="s16">Stay put where you are and just wait for my instructions.”</span> <span id="s17">So this was it; we never left Switzerland all during the war.</span> <span id="s18">All my very first education, my first brush with school, was in Switzerland and that’s where I learned how to read and how to count and how to write and how to knit, everything that the Swiss children learned.</span> <span id="s19">And by the way, I was much more advanced than the children my age when I got back to Paris.</span> <span id="s20">It’s very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: You were in the French speaking part of Switzerland, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s23">In Geneva and in Lausanne.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Could you give me your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: My mother’s name was Blanche Salomon.</span> <span id="s26">My father’s name was Jean Weil.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What were their occupations?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: My father was a shoe manufacturer at the time the war broke out in 1914.</span> <span id="s29">In the east of France, in that town of Millouse.</span> <span id="s30">He had a very hard time escaping because he was known all over that part of France, which was Alsace, as a traitor to the Germans, because since he was born, German was the official language -- French was not allowed to be taught -- and my father did nothing else in his entire teenage and young man’s years than create schools and theatres and clubs in the basements of houses to maintain the French.</span> <span id="s31">And he was hunted, of course.</span> <span id="s32">He was constantly looked for and when the war broke out he was one of the first people who had to leave, absolutely, because he was one of the first people who would have been immediately taken by the Germans and condemned to death.</span> <span id="s33">He had already been condemned before but he escaped and came back and you couldn’t stop him, because he was a ferocious French chauvinist.</span> <span id="s34">He got out his furniture, everything, to Switzerland under a false name.</span> <span id="s35">And that’s the way he got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: And this was during World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: And he never went back there, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: And so you never went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: And so he was, for the whole length of the first World War, the head of the Second Bureau, which is the CIA, for France, and Switzerland was the ground for that.</span> <span id="s40">The Germans had an enormous spy net, the French had it, the Italians had it, the Belgians, the Dutch, everybody used neutral Switzerland as the spy activity for their country.</span> <span id="s41">So it was very, very risky.</span> <span id="s42">If they were picked up, if they were arrested, that was the end of it, because it was not allowed.</span> <span id="s43">They were neutral and didn’t want to have anything to do with either side.</span> <span id="s44">But so long as they could deal without being picked up, okay.</span> <span id="s45">But he still was picked up at the very end of it.</span> <span id="s46">The Armistice was November 11, 1918, and I think my father was picked up about nine days before.</span> <span id="s47">The Armistice definitely saved his neck.</span> <span id="s48">So the family never had been living a quiet and peaceful life.</span> <span id="s49">I think we got from him this definite push into doing things and being involved, and not just watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: So then after the Armistice, and he was released, you went back to live…</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Then we went back to Paris.</span> <span id="s52">We moved to Paris in 1919, so I was eight years old, and I have a sister who was born in 1920, who is 81/2 years difference with me, and who never knew anything else but Paris!</span> <span id="s53">My mother was back in Paris; you couldn’t live anywhere else!</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Could you talk a little about your religious orientation?</span> <span id="s55">Was you family observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: My father apparently must have been brought up in a pretty Orthodox way, but by parents who were very, very broad minded.</span> <span id="s57">Meaning that I think my grandmother was keeping kosher and I think their home was a kosher home.</span> <span id="s58">But my father was, as a young man, traveling an awful lot.</span> <span id="s59">He was actually, I think, a shoe salesman when he was a very young man and the only thing my grandmother was interested in when he was going outside of France -- he was going to Spain, he was going to Italy -- the only thing he had to do was send a card that he was in a Palace Hotel, to make sure that he was in the best hotel in town --which very often was not the best hotel!</span> <span id="s60">When my father was in his home, of course, he did what the parents wanted, but he himself never observed anything.</span> <span id="s61">And when he got married to mother, mother had absolutely no religious training, none whatsoever.</span> <span id="s62">She was brought up more or less by her grandparents.</span> <span id="s63">My grandmother (her mother) was the very first woman dentist in France.</span> <span id="s64">She was the only woman in dentistry school when she too her degree, and had very little time to bring up her daughter.</span> <span id="s65">I can’t say the grandparents were completely devoid of any religion, because I understand my great grandfather was a very famous man.</span> <span id="s66">I could write a book on him, because he was the first one who deciphered the Assyrian scripture, the cuneiform characters.</span> <span id="s67">He was sent on a mission by Napoleon and by all kinds of people to spend years in what was at that time Mesopotamia, which is Iraq today.</span> <span id="s68">That’s the only country where I’m really dying to go and that’s the only one I haven’t gone to.</span> <span id="s69">I was in Iran and saw a lot of the cuneiform characters that he deciphered.</span> <span id="s70">In any event, I understand that on Yom Kippur, he was going to go to the synagogue the night before, and for Kol Nidre, and never moved out of the synagogue the whole night and the whole day.</span> <span id="s71">That was absolutely the only thing he ever observed.</span> <span id="s72">So that was my mother’s grandfather, the one she was brought up by.</span> <span id="s73">So she really knew nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s74">And I remember one very funny story about mother being introduced to her future-in-laws, when my Dad took her from Paris to this little town of Millouse.</span> <span id="s75">My grandmother, of course, asked her all kinds of questions, and she said, “Well, my child, I hope you cook well, because you know, my son has always had good cooking at home.”</span> <span id="s76">And so she said, “Oh, yes, because I have a degree from the Cordon Bleu.’</span> <span id="s77">My grandmother was pretty astounded and then my mother went on saying, “As soon as I move here, and as soon as I’ll be settled, I’ll invite you to eat one of my most favorite dish, a Lobster a la Americaine.”</span> <span id="s78">So my grandmother looked at her very calmly and quiet and said.</span> <span id="s79">“Well, this, my child we don’t eat.”</span> <span id="s80">So mother didn’t catch up anything, she just said, “It’s a pretty heavy dish, it’s true.</span> <span id="s81">But I’ll find other dishes that I can cook for you.”</span> <span id="s82">She never understood why my grandmother said, “This we don’t eat.”</span> <span id="s83">Mother hated to tell that story.</span> <span id="s84">Whenever I was telling it she was furious.</span> <span id="s85">But the fact is that I thought it was so funny.</span> <span id="s86">So as far as our house was concerned, we had no tradition.</span> <span id="s87">We never had candles on Friday night.</span> <span id="s88">I was brought up in the only Reform temple in Paris, which is called “liberal,” and we lived in the street where the Temple was.</span> <span id="s89">I fell in love with it.</span> <span id="s90">I fell in love with the man who was my teacher, who was a former priest, a very famous man by the name of Aimee Pelier, who has had many books translated here by Stephen Wise, who knew him, and one of the best known books here is called The Unknown Sanctuary.</span> <span id="s91">He was a fabulous man, absolutely fabulous.</span> <span id="s92">I learned more from him than I ever would have learned from a Jewish scholar, because when a non-Jew possesses a subject, they go much more deeply into it than a Jew, who takes everything for granted.</span> <span id="s93">So he was marvelous.</span> <span id="s94">He died during the Occupation and he refused to be buried in a Jewish cemetery because he said he didn’t belong.</span> <span id="s95">He wasn’t born Jewish; he didn’t have the right to be buried in a Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s96">In any event, it is strange, because we are three -- I have a brother and sister -- and I’m the only one who went to Sunday School.</span> <span id="s97">I’m the only one who’s sung in the chorus of the Temple.</span> <span id="s98">I’m the only one who went on and on, staying with it because I was happy with it.</span> <span id="s99">My brother was Barmitzvah but I don’t think he’s ever been in a Temple since, and my sister had absolutely no Sunday School training at all.</span> <span id="s100">My parents were already older by then and they were much more lenient and they just didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Is your brother older than you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No, I’m the oldest.</span> <span id="s103">My brother is 27 months younger and my sister is eight and a half years younger.</span> <span id="s104">But the time my sister was born, my father could have almost been her grandfather.</span> <span id="s105">He was very much older.</span> <span id="s106">He married very late.</span> <span id="s107">He married when he was 36 years old.</span> <span id="s108">So it was late when he got my sister.</span> <span id="s109">But it’s a very interesting thing, this involvement with Judaism because for no reason, for no influence at home, for no influence on the part of anybody, beside maybe my preacher had a big influence on me, it’s been a very rewarding thing for me to belong to that first synagogue, that Temple.</span> <span id="s110">It was very interestingly backed up by Americans.</span> <span id="s111">The first president was an American living in France.</span> <span id="s112">It was interesting that the French never caught up with it.</span> <span id="s113">The French never could stand the idea of a Liberal Temple.</span> <span id="s114">The Jewish institutions in France, like in any country in western Europe, are under what us called the “Consistua,’ the overall umbrella that all the Temples, all the synagogues belong to.</span> <span id="s115">The rabbis are placed by the Consistua.</span> <span id="s116">You don’t go out and find your own rabbi.</span> <span id="s117">But it’s a little bit like here, too; when you want a rabbi for a synagogue, you call the Yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: At least you get a couple of choices.</span> <span id="s119">They send out a candidate or three.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: But there they have to be assigned.</span> <span id="s121">You can ask for a preference if you happen to know someone, but most of the time.</span> <span id="s122">You don’t know who is available.</span> <span id="s123">Anyway, the only one who never got a pension, the only one who never had anything to do with it, and they wanted nothing to do with him, was my rabbi.</span> <span id="s124">It was very pathetic.</span> <span id="s125">My husband was the grandson of the chief rabbi of Paris.</span> <span id="s126">He didn’t have much of a Jewish education (chuckling).</span> <span id="s127">Friday night they were going to their grandfather for dinner, and he lived with his grandfather for many, many years because his father was remarried and he didn’t want to live with his stepmother!</span> <span id="s128">His father was a widower when my husband was 17 years old, so he lived with his grandfather.</span> <span id="s129">He had a fantastic pride as a Jew and a fantastic desire to be respected as a Jew, and one of the reasons why we never left France -- and we could have gone everywhere else, we could have come to America -- but my husband said, “No.</span> <span id="s130">As a Jew my duty is to stay here.</span> <span id="s131">We’re not going to run like rats.</span> <span id="s132">We are just going to stay here and fight our way.</span> <span id="s133">We are not going to run away when the boat is sinking.”</span> <span id="s134">He had a very deep sense of being a Jew.</span> <span id="s135">And that had nothing to do with Jewish education but as a Jewish human being, highly proud of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: And also, I think, highly proud of being a Frenchman.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Very chauvinistic and very Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Can you tell me about your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: I went to the school to which all of us go, meaning that we don’t have what we have here, meaning that you switch from two to three different schools.</span> <span id="s140">We have one school.</span> <span id="s141">The only thing that we have outside of our one school is the kindergarten, which is not at all compulsory.</span> <span id="s142">You can or you can’t go; this is up to the parents.</span> <span id="s143">And then we go to a school, the opposite from here.</span> <span id="s144">Your last grade is twelve.</span> <span id="s145">Our first grade is twelve.</span> <span id="s146">After kindergarten the first grade is 12.</span> <span id="s147">And the grade of the Baccalaureate, the grade of matriculation is first -- “post-exam” is philosophy or science, depending what you choose --so we end up with “first”.</span> <span id="s148">You stay in the same school, from the twelve to the one, which is never true here.</span> <span id="s149">Here you go to kindergarten and to a grammar school and to a junior high; all these we don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: And of course this was a private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: In my time it was.</span> <span id="s152">It was a Lycee.</span> <span id="s153">At that time you paid a tuition and you of course bought your books and everything else.</span> <span id="s154">Today I understand that it’s practically free.</span> <span id="s155">I don’t think that you pay for it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Now, it was not a religious school?</span> <span id="s157">It was not church-connected?</span> <span id="s158">In France you didn’t have religious instruction in the schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Yes, we do.</span> <span id="s160">Catholic, of course.</span> <span id="s161">Don’t forget that France is 95% Catholic, 3 and 1/2% Protestant and 1 and 1/2% Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Well, what would happen in school when it was time for religion class?</span> <span id="s163">Would you go to the class and get the Catholic instruction?</span> <span id="s164">Or would you be excused?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s166">You could go to a religious school.</span> <span id="s167">There were a tremendous amount of Jesuit schools, a lot of convents and monasteries.</span> <span id="s168">The Catholic could choose to go into a Catholic college.</span> <span id="s169">But in the regular French education, we had a regular separation of church and state.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: I know in some countries like in Poland, every day in school there’d be a religion class.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Poland!</span> <span id="s172">You can never compare!</span> <span id="s173">That’s why people say to me.</span> <span id="s174">“You came from Europe,” I say, “I never came from Europe.</span> <span id="s175">What do you mean by Europe?</span> <span id="s176">There is no such thing as Europe.”</span> <span id="s177">Western Europe is a world, and eastern Europe is another world, and there is absolutely nothing in common.</span> <span id="s178">We have no practice in common, no philosophy in common, no values in common, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Can you tell me, now, you were already in your teens when the Nazis came to power.</span> <span id="s180">What do you remember?</span> <span id="s181">Was your family listening to the radio, reading newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: I was beyond my teens because this was in ’31; I was twenty years old.</span> <span id="s183">In my family and in many French families, the parents are very strict about language, and in school you have to take two languages, what we call a first and a second, plus Latin and plus Greek.</span> <span id="s184">And especially me, who was in Humanities, I had German as a first language and English as a second, because my parents always said German is much harder than English, so German should be the first language.</span> <span id="s185">So I went to Germany for a year in boarding school and I went to England a year and a half in boarding school.</span> <span id="s186">So at that time I was already in post-graduate work.</span> <span id="s187">I was in Germany the end of ’32 and the beginning of ’33.</span> <span id="s188">And I remember being taken to the pool and I saw a sign at the door of the swimming pool, “Keine Hunde, Keine Juden.”</span> <span id="s189">“No dogs, no Jews.”</span> <span id="s190">This I can see as if it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s191">I can see that in my eyes.</span> <span id="s192">My father telegraphed immediately to come home.</span> <span id="s193">So I left.</span> <span id="s194">So I never spent my whole year, really in Germany.</span> <span id="s195">So what!</span> <span id="s196">This was Germany.</span> <span id="s197">What in the world can happen to us in France?</span> <span id="s198">Come back quick.</span> <span id="s199">Leave them behind.</span> <span id="s200">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s201">Even when they came and told us stories that were not believable.</span> <span id="s202">We knew a couple in Vienna who finally arrived in Paris, maybe in ’37, ’38.</span> <span id="s203">And I remember her telling us that a beauty parlor happened to be across the street from the military barracks.</span> <span id="s204">They were waiting for the girls to come out of the beauty parlor having had a manicure, and so forth, and they were giving them the toothbrushes and making them clean the yard of the barracks.</span> <span id="s205">Well, we listened to that, and we believed or we didn’t believe.</span> <span id="s206">I’m not sure how much we believed.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: And that’s Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: But not us.</span> <span id="s209">How did anything like this happen?</span> <span id="s210">It’s not possible.</span> <span id="s211">Then we started to be loaded with refugees.</span> <span id="s212">They came from all over.</span> <span id="s213">They came from Romania, from Hungary, from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s214">They had moved already most of them to Germany because they thought, well, this is already leaving behind all the Eastern European countries.</span> <span id="s215">So they were moving to Germany and not thinking that in Germany it would be very bad.</span> <span id="s216">The last resort was France.</span> <span id="s217">That was freedom.</span> <span id="s218">If they were able to do it, they came to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Now, this was prior to 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: That was from the beginning of Nazism, ’34, ’35.</span> <span id="s221">In France at the beginning it got very tough because the French had a concentration camp in the south of France for all the Germans.</span> <span id="s222">After all, Germany was the enemy.</span> <span id="s223">And they didn’t care whether he was a Catholic, a Protestant or a Jew, he was a German.</span> <span id="s224">And a lot of people died in those camps.</span> <span id="s225">There was no torture, there was no gas chamber, or anything like this, but they were treated very bad and starved, they had very little food and if they, God forbid, got sick, there was no way to get treated.</span> <span id="s226">My father had one business connection in Frankfurt and they were able to escape as soon as they could.</span> <span id="s227">When I was in boarding school in Frankfurt they had been wonderful to me.</span> <span id="s228">She wasn’t Jewish, but he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s229">And he was put in this camp in Zurst and it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s230">He got a sinus infection and nobody would give him any pills or whatever it was that could have helped, and no doctor, and he died.</span> <span id="s231">He died there.</span> <span id="s232">So it was really rough.</span> <span id="s233">That was even before the Germans.</span> <span id="s234">This was during the ’39-’40 war, during what you Americans call the Phony War; after that, the people were of course no more secure there than they were anywhere else, because the first ones they went after were those people.</span> <span id="s235">They couldn’t speak French, they had an accent, they didn’t know anybody where they could hide, they didn’t know where to put their kids away.</span> <span id="s236">They were an easy prey.</span> <span id="s237">They (the Germans) didn’t go after the French for quite a long time.</span> <span id="s238">They just took all the refugees first.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: To backtrack a minute, when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: I got married the 31st of January, 1934.</span> <span id="s241">So that was a year and a half after Hitler came into power in Germany.</span> <span id="s242">And between 1934 and 1939, there wasn’t a peaceful year.</span> <span id="s243">Not one.</span> <span id="s244">In ’34, while we were on our honeymoon, there were terrible strikes in Paris.</span> <span id="s245">They had locked their bosses in the factories and all the workers were down below and preventing anybody from lifting food to them or anything.</span> <span id="s246">There were big riots.</span> <span id="s247">In ’35 Leon Blum came into power.</span> <span id="s248">In ’36 it was, absolutely, a year of the worst anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s249">The fact that we had a Jewish Prime Minister was very bad.</span> <span id="s250">He was very definitely elected by a great portion of the people but he wasn’t accepted.</span> <span id="s251">He made all kinds of reform.</span> <span id="s252">He wanted people to have Saturday, Sunday free when the French always worked on Saturday, and when this created a riot, then he said, “We will have Sunday and Monday.”</span> <span id="s253">And that was not good, either.</span> <span id="s254">The people decided that no country can live with five days a week.</span> <span id="s255">Things were very bad.</span> <span id="s256">In ’38, that was unique!</span> <span id="s257">My husband was an officer in the French army, and he was away five months in ’38; he was mobilized.</span> <span id="s258">All of the officers were taken for five months, because that was the time of Chamberlain.</span> <span id="s259">Remember this whole thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s261">“Peace in our time.”</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: And we thought we had finally avoided the war.</span> <span id="s263">Some of us definitely felt we had been betrayed and we had been sold out but we avoided the war, but it was avoided only until the middle of ’39.</span> <span id="s264">I was married 1934 and my husband was killed in June 1944.</span> <span id="s265">I was married ten years, and we had five years of unbelievable riots and turmoil, and five years of French Underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: And you also had two children during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Two daughters.</span> <span id="s268">One was born October ’35 and the other was born in March ’39, three months before the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So at this time you and your husband were living in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: And what kind of business was he in?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: My husband was proprietor of a big chain of five and ten stores and traveled a lot.</span> <span id="s273">We even lived in a few different towns before we finally got back to Paris in ’39.</span> <span id="s274">We were happy to have finally, at last, settled in Paris, because it allowed my daughter to be born in Paris.</span> <span id="s275">And four months later we were in the middle of the war!</span> <span id="s276">I had a wonderful nurse for my children, from the time I expected my first one, until actually the middle of the occupation; she never wanted to leave me.</span> <span id="s277">My parents had rented a house on the beach in Brittany.</span> <span id="s278">So we all went to that resort in Brittany and that’s where the war caught us.</span> <span id="s279">My father at the time was mayor of a town in the east part of France and he didn’t want to leave his City Hall.</span> <span id="s280">No matter how close the Germans came, he wasn’t leaving until there was no alternative.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">When we lost that so-called war, it took everybody by shock.</span> <span id="s282">They absolutely overran the Maginot Line, which we thought we were well protected by having.</span> <span id="s283">But it was nothing, after all.</span> <span id="s284">It was open on one side and closed on the other, so it was easy enough to come through the open side.</span> <span id="s285">The Germans went around it and came into Belgium, and between the time they entered Belgium and the time they came into Paris, it was six days.</span> <span id="s286">At that time we lived in Brittany in that house, and my parents continued to rent it for a year, and finally in the middle of ’40, between my sister and I, we finally convinced my father to leave his City Hall and come.</span> <span id="s287">The Germans were already advancing, and of my husband, I had no news.</span> <span id="s288">My husband was picked up, I think, June 10, when the Germans came from Belgium into France.</span> <span id="s289">My husband was only a lieutenant in the French army, but this was the time when the French army had a very dignified way of behaving.</span> <span id="s290">All the high officers -- generals, captains, colonels -- left with his own private car to go to pick up his family and run!</span> <span id="s291">My husband who was only a lieutenant, was in charge of the whole battalion, and they were told, “Leave your arms behind and flee.”</span> <span id="s292">My husband refused.</span> <span id="s293">He refused to flee, and he refused to leave his arms behind, so he was picked up and he was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s294">He was taken as prisoner on June 10, and it was the end.</span> <span id="s295">When De Gaulle made his appeal on June 17 from London, it was already all over.</span> <span id="s296">I was on the front line.</span> <span id="s297">I was a Red Cross nurse, so I had very easy access to the news, what the Red Cross was doing, even in the camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s298">But I could not get any news.</span> <span id="s299">I never got any news.</span> <span id="s300">I didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s301">I didn’t know where he was.</span> <span id="s302">Well, at that time -- it’s a long chain of events, I can’t go through it too much, it’s too many details -- my parents left with my sister, and they crossed Spain to North Africa, and to Morocco.</span> <span id="s303">After they had been there for quite a few weeks, my parents insisted so much that I decided, well, not knowing where my husband is, and what happened, I can’t stay alone in France with my two young kids, I have to go.</span> <span id="s304">I started to get a passport and everything else, and to join my parents.</span> <span id="s305">At that time we were completely disorganized because the Germans had traced a line between the two parts of France, the so-called free part and the so-called occupied part, and we were in the free part.</span> <span id="s306">I was mobilized, and I had a place where to join my group.</span> <span id="s307">So I went there with my nurse and the two kids.</span> <span id="s308">Everybody was invading the roads and nobody could pass by; the people had absolutely swarmed all the roads in France, trying to go south, to leave.</span> <span id="s309">The Germans were coming from the north and from the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: And they wanted to go south to Free France.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: I got to Jouin, where I was supposed to go.</span> <span id="s312">We had requisitioned a big high school that we transformed into a hospital.</span> <span id="s313">For nine days I was alone with a surgeon and a doctor.</span> <span id="s314">The road was blocked above the line, and nobody else was able to come.</span> <span id="s315">We received wounded soldiers by the thousands, because the only thing that the Italians ever contributed after they joined the Nazis, declared war on France, were tiny little arrows that were poisoned.</span> <span id="s316">These little arrows pierced the cars, and they pierced the army that was on foot, and the tanks, and everything else, they went through everything.</span> <span id="s317">The only thing that they couldn’t go through was a mattress, So immediately we got orders.</span> <span id="s318">If you go anywhere and you have a car and you use it, put one or two mattresses on top.</span> <span id="s319">That’s what saved our lives.</span> <span id="s320">We had two mattresses on top of the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Can we back up for just a minute?</span> <span id="s322">Had you taken nurse’s training?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yes, I was a Red Cross nurse.</span> <span id="s324">But that is an entirely different thing again.</span> <span id="s325">In France there are two organizations of Red Cross.</span> <span id="s326">One was called “Help to Military Wounded,” the other was called “French Federation of Red Cross.”</span> <span id="s327">The two of them had a three-year program.</span> <span id="s328">The first year you were a first aid nurse, the second year you were much more posted, at the end of three years you were registered.</span> <span id="s329">I was a registered nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: But you had never intended to become a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: You can’t.</span> <span id="s332">You can never make a living out of it.</span> <span id="s333">You can be the head of what we called a light ambulance.</span> <span id="s334">It’s a small military hospital like the one that the Americans, for instance, started.</span> <span id="s335">When they started to come in they put up some tents and made what we called a light ambulance.</span> <span id="s336">You could, if you wanted to, go into nursing school and take then a professional nursing degree; I never knew anybody who did that.</span> <span id="s337">At the beginning of the war in ’39, when we were at the beach resort there, a friend of mine and myself, we formed 49 girls to send to the front line.</span> <span id="s338">Trained them as Red Cross nurses.</span> <span id="s339">I was very involved in that.</span> <span id="s340">So at the beginning, when I was assigned to that high school, at that time, this was terribly hard because we were night and day, and it was just awful.</span> <span id="s341">The only thing we got were the boys who had been completely wounded by those arrows.</span> <span id="s342">But we had absolutely no infections, because they had done nothing for eight months.</span> <span id="s343">They ate very well, they were living outside, they were playing football across the line, with the Germans.</span> <span id="s344">They were playing football with them!</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Which is why we called it the “Phony War.”</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Nobody had any infection.</span> <span id="s347">We were very lucky.</span> <span id="s348">We really were, because everything that could happen happened.</span> <span id="s349">In a few days the Germans just pushed themselves in and then the Italians.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Now where in Brittany were you staying?</span> <span id="s351">And where was this hospital, the school that you took over?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: The resort?</span> <span id="s353">It’s called Le Balle.</span> <span id="s354">It’s a big, beach resort on the southern coast of Brittany.</span> <span id="s355">Where the hospital was is a place called Perigeaux; it’s about seventy miles from Bordeaux.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: You said you were in this hospital at first, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: I stayed there as long as I possibly could, from June until the beginning of September.</span> <span id="s358">I knew a lot of people by then and one of my friends was at the railroad station at night.</span> <span id="s359">She was also Red Cross but she was distributing coffee and cookies and stuff like this, and every time a train was coming in, it was bringing people from the east and from the north, people fleeing the Germans up there.</span> <span id="s360">Don’t forget, this was still the beginning of 1940, this was really at the beginning.</span> <span id="s361">They were not organized yet to stop people from going.</span> <span id="s362">I saw her one day and I explained to her that I intended to leave.</span> <span id="s363">I told her that I was getting my passport and that I was going to Morocco.</span> <span id="s364">I had secured transportation.</span> <span id="s365">There was not very much going but there was still a few ways to go.</span> <span id="s366">One night she was going from window to window, to distribute coffee and so forth, and all of a sudden my husband jumped out of one of the cars and she looked at him and she said, “Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s367">Do you know that your wife left?”</span> <span id="s368">Your wife was here with the children but she left and went to Morocco.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: But you hadn’t left yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: I was going two or three days later.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: So then, what…</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: He escaped four times, and finally made it the fourth time.</span> <span id="s373">Four times he escaped from a prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s374">It was possible to send one of those crazy cards from prisoner of war camp to the occupied zone -- not to the free zone -- so he wrote somebody in the occupied zone, and that somebody knew where I was!</span> <span id="s375">Knew that I was down there and that I was the head of that hospital.</span> <span id="s376">That’s the way he came down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: So there you were reunited.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: It was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: You had the two little girls with you then.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A; Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q; At the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: No.</span> <span id="s383">My nurse was with the children in a hotel, because I knew everybody there and in the hotel they gave them a room, almost two rooms, and there was an enormous bathroom and in that bathroom they put a little stove, to be able to cook for the kids.</span> <span id="s384">There was no way to go to a restaurant.</span> <span id="s385">If you wanted to go to a restaurant you sometimes had to queue up for three hours.</span> <span id="s386">There were only a few places open, there was no food, everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s387">The people who owned that hotel were very old friends of mine, and they were providing things to cook with.</span> <span id="s388">So she fed the children and never went down to a restaurant, and I was in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Now, at what point, then did the Germans really begin to take control?</span> <span id="s390">What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: They took control of the occupied zone.</span> <span id="s392">In Perigeaux, every day there was news, false news.</span> <span id="s393">They are putting the line through us.</span> <span id="s394">No, they’re going to put the line beyond us.</span> <span id="s395">No, they’re going to include us in the line, because this is France.</span> <span id="s396">Okay, the line was here.</span> <span id="s397">It was cutting France from east to west, putting Normandy, Brittany, the whole northern part of France, the eastern part of Alsace-Lorraine, beyond that, their line.</span> <span id="s398">This part here is free.</span> <span id="s399">But they didn’t cut like this, because they wanted an opening on the Mediterranean.</span> <span id="s400">So it cut like this, and so the whole part of Bordeaux, the whole southwest of France was in.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: You were close to the Mediterranean, but the Germans wanted to have a strip along the Mediterranean.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: No, we were parallel to the Atlantic.</span> <span id="s403">The Atlantic is here.</span> <span id="s404">But the Mediterranean is there.</span> <span id="s405">They wanted that line to go down to the Mediterranean.</span> <span id="s406">So we didn’t get in.</span> <span id="s407">But from that time on, it was finished.</span> <span id="s408">You could absolutely not cross; you couldn’t get your relatives from the other side.</span> <span id="s409">The number of people that were arrested trying to cross was pathetic.</span> <span id="s410">And we were under Petain, in Vichy, France.</span> <span id="s411">He absolutely, completely sold out to the Germans.</span> <span id="s412">There was a very good article in the Minneapolis Tribune about two, three weeks ago, with a picture of Petain.</span> <span id="s413">Did you see that?</span> <span id="s414">It’s a wonderful article, about how he betrayed France, how he betrayed the trust of his countrymen.</span> <span id="s415">We were completely under his rule and under what he allowed us to do.</span> <span id="s416">He made us declare ourselves to the police station, and his big lie was that if you were French for more than five generations, you’ve not nothing to risk; you’re protected.</span> <span id="s417">So we all went, and declared ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: But they did ask you whether you were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: (Sigh) Believe me, we were completely trapped.</span> <span id="s420">Many of us never worried.</span> <span id="s421">We were never compelled to wear the Star of David like they did in the occupied zone.</span> <span id="s422">Never.</span> <span id="s423">But we had to be declared at the police station.</span> <span id="s424">And they always maintained that when we could prove that we were French for at least five generations there would be no persecution.</span> <span id="s425">On the contrary, we would be protected.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: And you had to have identity cards, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s428">In the underground, we changed all the time.</span> <span id="s429">We changed identification cards, we changed ration cards.</span> <span id="s430">I don’t know how many names I carried.</span> <span id="s431">It was very tricky because it was not at all just pick up a name, you know.</span> <span id="s432">You can decide tomorrow your name is Smith, but it doesn’t go like that.</span> <span id="s433">You had to carry identity of a living person.</span> <span id="s434">Or one who just died.</span> <span id="s435">We had an entire net of people who were in charge of finding who was sick in a hospital, or in a mental hospital, or who had just died.</span> <span id="s436">Way far away from where we lived, of course.</span> <span id="s437">And get the entire pedigree of that person.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: You had just started to talk about being part of the underground.</span> <span id="s439">You were also saying while we were turning the tape that people used to tend to think that everybody who was caught in the Holocaust was in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s440">Can you tell me -- did you decide to enlist in the Resistance, or did it just happen?</span> <span id="s441">How did you become part of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: There was no enlisting.</span> <span id="s443">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s445">But tell me how you became a part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: There was absolutely no organization.</span> <span id="s447">There was absolutely nothing that had any rules, or rhyme or reason.</span> <span id="s448">This was something that was 100% volunteer action, prompted by De Gaulle when he started on June 17 to talk from London, saying that we lost a battle, but we didn’t lose the war, and that we just had to fight now to regain that battle.</span> <span id="s449">He started the very first group of French Resistance -- with nothing.</span> <span id="s450">People react!</span> <span id="s451">Sabotage everything you can, infiltrate anywhere you can, and do everything you can to stop their war machine, stop their manufacturing, stop their -- they had taken over all the factories, and all the fields, and all the farms, and absolutely everything -- so stop them wherever you can, sabotage everything they’re doing.</span> <span id="s452">But on your own, completely on your own.</span> <span id="s453">Of course you know, in a situation like this, the leaders discover themselves.</span> <span id="s454">So a leader shows up and another leader shows up.</span> <span id="s455">When my husband escaped, the very first thing he did was to immediately form a nucleus and what he did was, where we were at the time, there was one of his five and ten cent stores that was part of his supervision, and he took it over.</span> <span id="s456">He took it over because at that time, the people were mobilized, or the people didn’t come back, or the people were prisoner.</span> <span id="s457">He took that store over, and he found in the attic of that store tons of dried beans --what you call Boston Beans here -- lentils, green peas -- all that stuff in enormous sacks.</span> <span id="s458">That was September 1940.</span> <span id="s459">Already the ration cards had been started the end of June by the Germans, and then of course it was established even more strongly by Vichy.</span> <span id="s460">Nobody was getting any of that.</span> <span id="s461">No noodles, no rice, no peas, no nothing.</span> <span id="s462">Nothing of that was distributed.</span> <span id="s463">My husband put in an ad in the paper on Sunday.</span> <span id="s464">“Monday morning, 8:00 in the morning, tons of this, this, this and that will be distributed.</span> <span id="s465">Free.”</span> <span id="s466">People were queuing up by the thousands.</span> <span id="s467">He gave the whole thing out.</span> <span id="s468">Everything was given away.</span> <span id="s469">He gave the whole thing out.</span> <span id="s470">Everything was given away.</span> <span id="s471">Everything was gone by the time he was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: So then when they arrested him, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: They arrested him, he was put in a fortress and he -- I can’t go on because if I would tell you the details -- but I went to Vichy.</span> <span id="s474">I was terribly scared that he couldn’t withstand it.</span> <span id="s475">Whenever there was a clash, when anything happened, between the French Resistance and the German, immediately they were picking up the hostages.</span> <span id="s476">In the prisons, this is where they were making their revenge.</span> <span id="s477">For any German who had been shot -- very often, they’d been shot among themselves, because they were fighting over a girl in a bar or something like this -- immediately the Resistance was held responsible.</span> <span id="s478">So I went to Vichy.</span> <span id="s479">I knew Petain.</span> <span id="s480">I happened to know him because he knew my sister-in-law very well.</span> <span id="s481">He lived in the same apartment house as my sister-in-law and he was at my brother’s wedding.</span> <span id="s482">So I knew very well who he was and he knew who I was, and I was finally introduced, and he put his arm around me, and he said, “what can I do for you, my child?</span> <span id="s483">Anything I can do?</span> <span id="s484">So I told him point blank, I said, “You can give the order to the fortress so-and-so to release my husband.”</span> <span id="s485">So he looked at me and says, “My poor child.</span> <span id="s486">I am so sorry.</span> <span id="s487">If only you wouldn’t be Jewish.”</span> <span id="s488">That was Marshal Petain.</span> <span id="s489">So anyway, I was able to find somebody.</span> <span id="s490">The underground was very well informed at the time.</span> <span id="s491">We had a few very trustworthy people and in Vichy we had a few men who were working double game, but you had to find them.</span> <span id="s492">And one of them I was told, told that if I would succeed nowhere with Petain, I should go see so-and-so.</span> <span id="s493">So I went; I had the code word and I was introduced to him.</span> <span id="s494">I gave my code word and he was very cold and very remote at the time.</span> <span id="s495">They were very suspicious.</span> <span id="s496">I told him my story and said it was also very dangerous for me because if he wasn’t really the guy I thought he was, I was in trouble.</span> <span id="s497">But you had to trust when you were given a certain name.</span> <span id="s498">Finally he trusted me, and then he took me out for lunch and he said, “Now what?</span> <span id="s499">Now what is it?”</span> <span id="s500">So I told him the whole thing and told him who I was and what had happened, and he said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s501">So we went back to his office, he called the commandant who had command of that fortress, and he says, “ Here is Marshal Petain’s office.</span> <span id="s502">So-and-so ordered to release so-and-so.”</span> <span id="s503">That night he was out.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: They just opened the gate and let him out?</span> <span id="s505">Or did somebody go pick him up?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: He was very far from where I was and he had no transportation, nothing.</span> <span id="s507">We could absolutely not move.</span> <span id="s508">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s509">To go to Vichy I must have had five people picking me up.</span> <span id="s510">I went into a fruit truck at one time.</span> <span id="s511">I remember that it smelled of peaches.</span> <span id="s512">I remember I went into a kind of tractor that was passing on the road.</span> <span id="s513">They took me.</span> <span id="s514">Little by little like this I finally got to Vichy.</span> <span id="s515">But there was no train.</span> <span id="s516">There was no car, no gas, no nothing.</span> <span id="s517">At one time for a little while I had a car.</span> <span id="s518">They let us transform the gas tank into consuming wood, putting an enormous tank in the back of the car and then you were burning wood, and what the wood was producing could ignite the car.</span> <span id="s519">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s520">But then we couldn’t keep any car on the road.</span> <span id="s521">There was no way.</span> <span id="s522">We were bicycling everywhere we were going.</span> <span id="s523">I bicycled once over 200 km.</span> <span id="s524">Sometimes I wonder, how in the world did I ever do that?</span> <span id="s525">This kind of involvement into the work.</span> <span id="s526">But first of all, I didn’t do anything on my own.</span> <span id="s527">I was really my husband’s message carrier.</span> <span id="s528">We were getting all our messages from De Gaulle through the BBC in London, what to do and where to go.</span> <span id="s529">Each one of us had a Resistance name, like whenever they were calling on the radio for “Walnut Tree,” you knew it was you.</span> <span id="s530">You were told where the parachute would be and bring you down some arms.</span> <span id="s531">So I was very often taking the message but we had to be very careful, too, because the Germans were coming with a kind of electronic device on their car and pick up the people who were taking the message.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Now, the messages were in code.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: It was all in code.</span> <span id="s534">But they were listening, and they could pick up in the street who was listening to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Who had a radio?</span> <span id="s536">You weren’t supposed to have a radio.</span> <span id="s537">The Germans had confiscated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: First of all it jammed terribly.</span> <span id="s539">It was very hard sometimes to get the message.</span> <span id="s540">But some of us were in charge of getting them, and passing them on to the right people.</span> <span id="s541">It was not always possible.</span> <span id="s542">Sometimes you were getting a parachute case of things, and the Germans got the message before you did.</span> <span id="s543">So many times we were getting parts of machine guns, and the next parachute would have the end of the parts to mount the machine guns, and we never got the second one.</span> <span id="s544">So you were getting into things without knowing what you were doing.</span> <span id="s545">You were camping this, running there, carrying this, carrying that.</span> <span id="s546">And then I got involved with the children.</span> <span id="s547">This was a whole organization of people, a chain with many links, and we were passing them from one to another, a whole chain -- I can’t say anything else really --of priests and nuns and monasteries and convents and Catholic schools and all this business, where we were passing the children from one to the other, and at the end, they placed them in different farms and the people were very happy to take them because they became farm hands.</span> <span id="s548">They weren’t paid for the work they were doing, and all they had to do was to feed them.</span> <span id="s549">On the farms they had at least enough food.</span> <span id="s550">It wasn’t plenty, because the Germans assigned them a quota of wheat and a quota of corn and a quota of fruits and a quota of anything, so they were left just what they needed for their own sake.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Now, these were Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: They were Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s553">That was a big story in itself.</span> <span id="s554">When you read Phillip Hallie’s book and you read about Chambon, Chambon is a very well known place of mine, because my kids were hidden there at one time.</span> <span id="s555">What happened with Pastor Trocme, you see, he was one of those who was getting people to come to him and ask for asylum.</span> <span id="s556">He was one of those who had found places to hide them.</span> <span id="s557">They were hidden in the village, hidden away from the village.</span> <span id="s558">He was the rotating wheel of this whole thing.</span> <span id="s559">They were coming from Germany, and how they knew about him, I never knew.</span> <span id="s560">I never knew how they discovered that he was there and he was able to help.</span> <span id="s561">So they arrived in that village up in the mountain.</span> <span id="s562">But Pastor Trocme’s helpers paid dearly, too.</span> <span id="s563">Some of their families were deported.</span> <span id="s564">Nobody could do that, you know, and be safe.</span> <span id="s565">Nobody.</span> <span id="s566">Some of my friends who were not Jewish at all were taken to concentration camps for taking messages, for being discovered taking messages from the BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: You mean, when you were working in the underground, it wasn’t just Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s569">That was never sectarian.</span> <span id="s570">There was a Jewish Resistance.</span> <span id="s571">In France there were no Jewish country clubs and no Jewish sections of town, and no Jewish quotas in the university, but there was a Jewish scout movement.</span> <span id="s572">Baden-Powell was a Protestant and he started the movement.</span> <span id="s573">The Catholics were led by a priest, the Protestants were pretty strong in their faith, so the Jewish Scout movement developed because of that.</span> <span id="s574">The chief, the master of the Jewish Scout movement was a fabulous guy, and he created his own Resistance movement.</span> <span id="s575">I was never attached to them or never involved with them, but they did a fantastic job.</span> <span id="s576">They had camps for children in the middle of France, in the middle west, as far removed as possible from any possible persecution.</span> <span id="s577">They were moving, of course, those camps around.</span> <span id="s578">He finally emigrated to Israel very soon after the state was created, maybe even before, with Haganah, He died a stupid death.</span> <span id="s579">He was an electric engineer, a radio engineer, and he was swimming in the Mediterranean in Israel and he drowned.</span> <span id="s580">It’s unbelievable after all the years in Resistance.</span> <span id="s581">Anyway, they were wonderful and they did a fabulous job in hiding Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s582">My chief was not Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s583">She was a fabulous woman who had contacts in Switzerland and she was mainly passing them to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s584">Then we couldn’t, and then we could…it was very temperamental, the whole passing of children to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s585">Sometimes they were put in camps in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s586">But when we tried to pass them to Spain it was very bad.</span> <span id="s587">We were betrayed by the very people we paid to pass them.</span> <span id="s588">We found kids in Paris and in the occupied zone who had been left behind when the parents were taken.</span> <span id="s589">That was the big trick of the Germans.</span> <span id="s590">By leaving the children behind they knew they were lost because they didn’t have any contact; they knew nothing.</span> <span id="s591">Those people were from Poland, from Hungary, from Romania, all refugees who had come to France.</span> <span id="s592">They lived in a Jewish section of Paris, they lived among themselves, they spoke Yiddish among themselves.</span> <span id="s593">None of us understood them.</span> <span id="s594">All we knew is that we found children that had been left behind when the parents had been picked up that morning.</span> <span id="s595">That they did purposely because where would those kids go?</span> <span id="s596">What would they do, those kids?</span> <span id="s597">And children were taken from the railroad station when they were packing the railroad cars.</span> <span id="s598">Some children were dragged out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: And some parents, I would hope, left their children.</span> <span id="s600">Some parents also sent their children out?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Thousands of children were taken with the parents.</span> <span id="s602">What you saw at the Barbie trial just now, that was very close to where we lived.</span> <span id="s603">We lived in a place called Iszeu, between Grenoble and Lyon.</span> <span id="s604">In the meantime, you were constantly called upon to do something.</span> <span id="s605">For instance, we also had another chain with dozens of links to hide the paratroopers when they were coming down from Britain.</span> <span id="s606">There were a lot of Canadians and some Americans who were coming through Britain and they parachuted in France and they were carriers of messages and missions, and we had a chain where they were picked up at the point where they were dropped, and then (laughs) we had crazy stuff.</span> <span id="s607">We were immediately using the silk of the parachute to make shirts for them, because they had military shirts on and they would have been discovered, so we had people who specialized in making shirts with the parachute silk.</span> <span id="s608">They were going from here to there to there to there to there, and they were bringing the chief from this house to the next, and from that house to this, and you had no right to see them.</span> <span id="s609">One day I was in Denver speaking, and my chairman was the man who manufactures Samsonite; when I started to tell my story, he said, “Now wait a minute, you must be one of those who hid my son.”</span> <span id="s610">Samson is really the son --he called Samsonite from his name --and said this Samson was parachuted.</span> <span id="s611">He was in our chain.</span> <span id="s612">He was picked up, housed during the night, left the next morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: It’s a very small world.</span> <span id="s614">So it was this very large informal network.</span> <span id="s615">How did you get the messages that you were supposed to do something?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: You had to take your bicycle and you had to go, usually, up in the mountain where the camps were.</span> <span id="s617">For a long time you could keep camps in the mountain until the Germans decided that they had no way to know where they were unless they were coming with planes.</span> <span id="s618">So they found them by flying over.</span> <span id="s619">So then you had to change the whole thing again.</span> <span id="s620">But you had to pass on to whoever you were told to pass on.</span> <span id="s621">You knew of course where to go and what to do.</span> <span id="s622">All our transportation was done by bicycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: And somebody would come to your home, or you’d meet them in the market?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: No.</span> <span id="s625">We were very careful about that.</span> <span id="s626">My husband, when he started at the end of ’40, he started by being a quartermaster.</span> <span id="s627">He organized a quartermaster corps in the mountains of the southwest, with the five and ten cent stores that he had under his fingers.</span> <span id="s628">You see, the Germans with Petain wouldn’t let you pick up anything, because everything was under ration.</span> <span id="s629">You needed for instance a three-months ration to get a blanket, or something like that.</span> <span id="s630">So he organized that corps to bring blankets and shirts and pants and God-knows-what, and tents; all of this we were providing for the boys who were up in camps and wherever we organized.</span> <span id="s631">Then we had another job.</span> <span id="s632">At the end of ’42 we were getting money from Algiers and that money was used for helping the family of the breadwinner when the father or the brother or the husband was in the Resistance.</span> <span id="s633">We were helping the woman, and the children, but they were Algerian francs, and we got into all kinds of trouble to finally get them changed.</span> <span id="s634">We had a friend who got picked up and never returned because in parachuting arms, we were getting American cigarettes and Band-Aids and gauze and things like this, around the case, and inside.</span> <span id="s635">One friend was caught having a cup of coffee at the bistro; he left in the ashtray an American butt.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: That little thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: The things that you never expect, you never think about.</span> <span id="s638">This is the way my husband was caught.</span> <span id="s639">After D-Day, after the 6th of June, 1944, when De Gaulle was giving orders and Eisenhower was giving orders, and everyone was saying, “You go out now, and work in the open, and do as much harm as you can possibly do.”</span> <span id="s640">And he did!</span> <span id="s641">And he got caught.</span> <span id="s642">So this was rough.</span> <span id="s643">(Sighs) This was really rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: And so then when he was caught, you didn’t ever see him again.</span> <span id="s645">Did you know when he was killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s647">One friend of mine who was for a long time our provider of false cards and false papers, came by bicycle those famous 200 kms, from where he was to where I was.</span> <span id="s648">He came with bad news.</span> <span id="s649">He said that he had been badly “wounded,” and he never said a word the whole day.</span> <span id="s650">I was living at the time with my father-in-law-his father-and my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s651">My brother-in-law; we were fourteen in one house at that time, and believe me, if the Germans had circled that house, there would have been fourteen of us out!</span> <span id="s652">We were protected by the priest and protected by some fabulous people in that village.</span> <span id="s653">Without that we never could have resisted there.</span> <span id="s654">But our friend came, and never said anything, and never said anything, and finally at the end of the day he had to come out with the truth.</span> <span id="s655">And I immediately went into the garage to pick up my bicycle and said, “I’m going.”</span> <span id="s656">And he said.</span> <span id="s657">“You’re not going.</span> <span id="s658">You cannot go, it’s not possible.</span> <span id="s659">Where he is, you can’t go.</span> <span id="s660">There is absolutely no way.</span> <span id="s661">Every mile is the Resistance or the Germans and you cannot go.”</span> <span id="s662">So I didn’t go there.</span> <span id="s663">I didn’t serve any purpose by going then, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s664">As soon as the liberation day came -- he was killed June 24 and we were liberated August 14 -- I took the kids and we went up there and he had been buried under “unknown” because they didn’t know his name.</span> <span id="s665">He was carrying so many false names, they didn’t know his real name.</span> <span id="s666">They wanted me to recognize him, and I refused.</span> <span id="s667">He was tortured for over twelve hours and I refused to recognize him.</span> <span id="s668">I didn’t want to keep that in my mind.</span> <span id="s669">He was staying with a wonderful old Catholic woman who constantly had housed members of the Resistance.</span> <span id="s670">Whenever they were on a mission they would spend the night there and go from her house, and she would give them coffee and all before they went.</span> <span id="s671">She came with me and she said, “My child, you have to do it.</span> <span id="s672">The religion says that you have to recognize him.”</span> <span id="s673">I said, “Not my religion.</span> <span id="s674">In my religion nothing says that I have to recognize him.”</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s676">It says that you are not supposed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Is it not strange?</span> <span id="s678">The Catholics apparently have this as a…it’s a commandment.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: You said earlier that your husband always refused to leave when he could.</span> <span id="s680">When would you have had the opportunity to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: When we came back.</span> <span id="s682">When he escaped and when I was still in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: When you were about to leave for Morocco.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: There was no reason why we couldn’t have joined my parents.</span> <span id="s685">I was going with the children and it was easy enough for him to come too.</span> <span id="s686">We could have left very easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: And what did he say?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: He said he wouldn’t leave France.</span> <span id="s689">He just wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s690">There was absolutely no way that he could leave the task to other people.</span> <span id="s691">We were still at war and we were certainly far from being liberated and if we don’t all work for it we’ll never make it.</span> <span id="s692">We were terribly influenced by De Gaulle.</span> <span id="s693">For him he was a God.</span> <span id="s694">De Gaulle had said you fight and you sabotage and you do everything you can to prevent the war machine.</span> <span id="s695">You should know the number of boys we had in the factory team, among the workers, who were planted by us, and who were sabotaging the machine.</span> <span id="s696">The entire chain didn’t work anymore, and they couldn’t arrest 200 people; they couldn’t pick out who did it.</span> <span id="s697">And that was the main job of so many of them, to just stop them (the Germans) from taking everything away.</span> <span id="s698">At liberation we didn’t have one acre of vineyards left.</span> <span id="s699">We had no wheat left.</span> <span id="s700">We had no fields left with anything.</span> <span id="s701">They had absolutely taken everything.</span> <span id="s702">And then when I heard here the people tell me, “Those poor German children who starved during the war, after all you have to pity them, too.”</span> <span id="s703">I said, ‘The German children starved?</span> <span id="s704">How could they starve with all the things they stole from everybody around?</span> <span id="s705">They stole everything from every country they occupied!”</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Let’s back up a minute, and talk about the children.</span> <span id="s707">You had been staying with the children in this small town with the nurse.</span> <span id="s708">When did they leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: We had an entire network of what you would call today social workers, but we were all of us volunteers, and all of us were doing things by trying to guess what to do.</span> <span id="s710">But the thing we did was to keep a record of all the kids we had, if we had found them with the parents, if we knew the parents’ name, if we had found them alone.</span> <span id="s711">The very first thing we were always asking was their name, so we had records of their names.</span> <span id="s712">And we had records of where we put them, where they were hidden, in what farm they were working.</span> <span id="s713">The farmers had given them their own name and the farmers never knew their real name.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Now these were children in about what age bracket?</span> <span id="s715">Were there babies?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: I don’t remember having anything smaller than about two years old, at least not in my hands.</span> <span id="s717">Most babies, the mother had the baby in their arms, and they left with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: What would you do with a two year old or a three year old?</span> <span id="s719">They couldn’t really work.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: It wasn’t that hard.</span> <span id="s721">The Catholics really took care of them.</span> <span id="s722">They were fabulous.</span> <span id="s723">They stayed in convents, all over the place.</span> <span id="s724">We had one unbelievable man in Lyon, just where Klaus Barbie was, who was the instrument of all the people.</span> <span id="s725">I always suspected him as being Jewish.</span> <span id="s726">He had a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s727">His name was Father -- you see how you forget -- Father -- and he had a very Jewish name.</span> <span id="s728">Anyway, he was absolutely fabulous.</span> <span id="s729">He was the one who knew exactly what to do according to the age.</span> <span id="s730">You couldn’t put them in a family if they were too young.</span> <span id="s731">So they were kept in places and taken care of by nuns.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: You must have thought all this time that maybe you would get caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: That I would be caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s735">When you were with the Resistance.</span> <span id="s736">And so what about your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: All of us, we all had that fear.</span> <span id="s738">There was nothing that prevented me to be denounced.</span> <span id="s739">When we were in that village, the fourteen of us, all we needed was one guy from the French malice, the one that was trained by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s740">This was the way hundreds and thousands of Jews have been taken, by being denounced.</span> <span id="s741">And people have done crazy things.</span> <span id="s742">A couple of my friends, they are here today, but his brother, they took him a week or ten days before the end.</span> <span id="s743">They had everything planned.</span> <span id="s744">It was fantastic.</span> <span id="s745">They were in an apartment near Chambon, and they had two entrances.</span> <span id="s746">They had an obvious entrance with that number on the door, and they had a back entrance that nobody could find because it was going through another house into another apartment and not connected at all with this one.</span> <span id="s747">And somebody knocked at the door and impulsively he went to the door.</span> <span id="s748">He had planned for years this whole thing of running the other way, It’s like everything that you did was hanging by a thread.</span> <span id="s749">Everything you did.</span> <span id="s750">One day I went in that village where we were all hidden.</span> <span id="s751">My kids were in school and somebody came from the priests’ residence.</span> <span id="s752">I don’t remember whether it was his maid or who came and said to me, “Run to the school, because the Germans are going to encircle.”</span> <span id="s753">So I ran and took the kids.</span> <span id="s754">One of the biggest tricks of the Germans was to come into the classroom and say to the children with a big smile, “Go on, children, we’re very interested in what you learn and what your teacher is teaching you.</span> <span id="s755">Sit down and we’ll just listen.”</span> <span id="s756">Then they would ask, “Everybody here goes to Sunday School?”</span> <span id="s757">The kids would raise their hands.</span> <span id="s758">Where the kids were going to Sunday School but were not Christian, they knew it!</span> <span id="s759">Then they would say, “Not that one.”</span> <span id="s760">The number of kids that were taken like this was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s761">My kids went to Christian Sunday School.</span> <span id="s762">The priest took them there immediately.</span> <span id="s763">But I remember my daughter coming one day to the house on a Sunday and she said, “Mother, I’m willing to do anything you want.</span> <span id="s764">I’m willing to go to Sunday School, I’m willing to make the sign of the cross, but today was too much.”</span> <span id="s765">“What happened today?”</span> <span id="s766">“The Bishop came from Grenoble and we had to kiss the ring on his finger.</span> <span id="s767">That’s too much.”</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: (Laughter) How old was she then?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Was that Francie?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: No, that wasn’t Francelyne.</span> <span id="s772">It was Nadine, my oldest one.</span> <span id="s773">My little one was much less conscious of all that because they were three years apart.</span> <span id="s774">Francelyn was born in ‘39.</span> <span id="s775">We thought we were so well hidden.</span> <span id="s776">The mayor of the village had a daughter exactly her age and they were pretty good friends.</span> <span id="s777">One day they came back from school and the mother invited Nadine to stay for chocolate and cookies.</span> <span id="s778">She brought them the chocolate and cookies and they were sitting on the ground in the garden, and the little girl said to Nadine, “You know, this is really something, when you think that this soil here, this ground, that’s where David and Goliath used to walk 2,000 years ago when it was Gaul.</span> <span id="s779">They walked on that soil.”</span> <span id="s780">So Nadine, very pensive, said, “Yes, that’s true.”</span> <span id="s781">So she looks at her and says, “Not you.</span> <span id="s782">You come from the Wandering Jew.”</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: So even at that age they were very aware.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: You thought you were so well protected and so well hidden, because nobody knew who you were.</span> <span id="s785">So all this was enough, you know; all this had to be listened to by somebody or there had to be a gardener there who heard it and was willing to be an informer.</span> <span id="s786">So you were constantly fearing for your life.</span> <span id="s787">There was no such thing as being free, thinking that here you were well hidden and everything was okay.</span> <span id="s788">They were picking up people when they were queuing up in stores.</span> <span id="s789">You queue up at a store to get your bread or whatever it is and they come and make a check.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Now was your husband running the business, the five and dime, and selling things?</span> <span id="s791">What were you living on?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: After that, nothing.</span> <span id="s793">(Laughter) with my father-in-law.</span> <span id="s794">My father-in-law had rented this big place there, a castle.</span> <span id="s795">It was a castle near Grenoble that had been abandoned by people who apparently were collaborators and who had run away, because they were the prey of the Resistance, and so they ran away.</span> <span id="s796">So we rented it from an agency.</span> <span id="s797">He took care of all of us.</span> <span id="s798">We had absolutely nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: So he had enough money to continue to buy food?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: He did, but it was murder.</span> <span id="s801">It really was.</span> <span id="s802">If it had lasted any longer, first of all no one would have had means to live any more, and secondly we could no longer hide because we had been hiding for so long and changing names so many times.</span> <span id="s803">It just could no longer go.</span> <span id="s804">We were so full of false hope.</span> <span id="s805">Churchill at one time in 1943 had the planes flying very low and sending “fall leaves” in paper.</span> <span id="s806">And inside it says, “With the end of the fall season we’ll be there.”</span> <span id="s807">And that was about a year and a half before.</span> <span id="s808">You could no longer hope.</span> <span id="s809">It was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s810">You didn’t know where to go any more.</span> <span id="s811">The Parisians are different from the farmers and different from the village people --and when we were getting anywhere they were suspicious immediately.</span> <span id="s812">“Who are these people?</span> <span id="s813">Why are they here?</span> <span id="s814">Why don’t they stay where they belong?”</span> <span id="s815">Immediately they were suspicious.</span> <span id="s816">My father-in-law was a very, very well known doctor in Paris.</span> <span id="s817">The first thing he did everywhere we went was always to declare himself for what he was, that he was a doctor.</span> <span id="s818">Whatever they need, don’t hesitate, come to the house, and if you need help at night, I’ll go to your place.</span> <span id="s819">And he did.</span> <span id="s820">He did that for the length of the war.</span> <span id="s821">He was treating everybody around.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Whether he had medicines or not…</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Ha, ha.</span> <span id="s824">That was something else.</span> <span id="s825">To get medication.</span> <span id="s826">I know certain things that are so unbelievable.</span> <span id="s827">The first time my children saw a banana they start to eat it with the peel.</span> <span id="s828">They had never seen a banana before.</span> <span id="s829">When Nadine came here with me in January, 1946, we went to New York, and somebody asked her -- she couldn’t understand a word of English--“What do you find the difference here, between Paris and New York?”</span> <span id="s830">So she thinks for a while and she said, “Well, I’ll tell you, there are box of chocolate in the window in France, also and there are boxes of chocolate here in the windows, but here they are full and in France they are empty.”</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: You said the children were in Chambon.</span> <span id="s832">They were with Pastor Trocme?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: They were.</span> <span id="s834">We lived so many places.</span> <span id="s835">The town that is right under Chambon is called St. Etienne.</span> <span id="s836">When my husband came back to me after he escaped, this is where we went.</span> <span id="s837">We went to St. Etienne because another way he would have gone back to Paris, but I absolutely forbade it.</span> <span id="s838">There was absolutely no way to be an escaped prisoner of war and to be Jewish and to go and put yourself “in the mouth of the wolf,” as we say in French.</span> <span id="s839">We had to stay in St. Etienne because he could use that store.</span> <span id="s840">He was always looking where he could use the store to try to get things out of it.</span> <span id="s841">So we were in St. Etienne in 1941 and things started to get rough, to the point where I was constantly fearing for the children to go to school.</span> <span id="s842">My little one was staying at home but I was afraid that Nadine would be picked up on the way to kindergarten.</span> <span id="s843">Somebody had told me about Pastor Trocme and so I went up there.</span> <span id="s844">It was the resort of St. Etienne.</span> <span id="s845">We used to drive there on Sunday, and we lived in St. Etienne before the war, so I knew this whole area very well.</span> <span id="s846">It’s a shame I don’t have time now; I would show you pictures.</span> <span id="s847">In any event, I one day asked him what to do and he said, “Bring them up, bring them up here.”</span> <span id="s848">This was a place known for the children’s homes.</span> <span id="s849">It had many of them.</span> <span id="s850">My kids were in one of them.</span> <span id="s851">They were marvelous.</span> <span id="s852">They were very, very devout Protestant people and the Protestants in France were marvelous because they had been persecuted by the French and they knew what persecution meant -- the Catholics never did--so you could always be helped by them.</span> <span id="s853">So we did that many times.</span> <span id="s854">We left the area and came back, took them back there again.</span> <span id="s855">It was really their haven but I couldn’t always do it.</span> <span id="s856">One night I went up there because they had told me that the Germans would come.</span> <span id="s857">One of the peasants took us in a cart with hay, and we left, and we went nowhere.</span> <span id="s858">We went, and wait, and when the alert was gone, we came back.</span> <span id="s859">It was like this all the time.</span> <span id="s860">That day I went to school to pick them up, I put them both on my bicycle and we were up in the mountain.</span> <span id="s861">We stayed there with a farmer who was wonderful with me.</span> <span id="s862">The main thing with the farmers was the swapping.</span> <span id="s863">For instance, my husband had kept yards and yards of a kind of blue jean material -- it was mattress ticking actually -- and this was my biggest swapping.</span> <span id="s864">If I gave them enough to make a jumpsuit or whatever it was they wear, they would give me some butter and some eggs and some milk.</span> <span id="s865">The only thing was not to be arrested on the road going back, because if the Germans found you with half a pound of potato they put you in jail.</span> <span id="s866">With half a pound of potato!</span> <span id="s867">Nobody understands that, you know.</span> <span id="s868">When I came here, people in this country told me, “Oh, we also had rations.</span> <span id="s869">Very often we only had chicken!”</span> <span id="s870">So when we got up there in the mountain, the farmer immediately said.</span> <span id="s871">“You stay here until they’re gone.</span> <span id="s872">When they leave the village you go back.”</span> <span id="s873">Then he showed me, down in the valley, a big estate, and he said, “You know who that belonged to?”</span> <span id="s874">“No,” I said.</span> <span id="s875">And he said, “Well that belonged to Jews and the Germans just took it over.”</span> <span id="s876">I said, “That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s877">Why did they take it over?”</span> <span id="s878">“Those people deserve nothing else.”</span> <span id="s879">Just like that.</span> <span id="s880">So I looked at him and I said, “Do you know who you’re talking to?”</span> <span id="s881">I went all the way.</span> <span id="s882">I decided, what do I risk?</span> <span id="s883">What is he going to do, denounce me?</span> <span id="s884">When I said that to him, he said, “No, I don’t believe it.”</span> <span id="s885">I said, “what don’t you believe?</span> <span id="s886">Did you ever see any?</span> <span id="s887">Did you ever talk to any?”</span> <span id="s888">He said, “Of course not.”</span> <span id="s889">I said, “Now you know.”</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: And you were with your two little girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: He didn’t know.</span> <span id="s892">Their propaganda was so unbelievable; there was so much stuffing on a daily basis, there were at least three programs a day, against the Jews.</span> <span id="s893">The Jews were responsible for the war.</span> <span id="s894">The Jews were responsible for rationing.</span> <span id="s895">The Jews were responsible that the French suffered so much and have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s896">It was all the fault of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: And some people believed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: The farmers?</span> <span id="s899">What do they know?</span> <span id="s900">It was living really from day to day for at least four years.</span> <span id="s901">At the end of it, when the thing was over, there wasn’t one single person that could really say that they hadn’t been hit.</span> <span id="s902">Not one.</span> <span id="s903">Everyone had lost a parent or brother or sister or husband.</span> <span id="s904">Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: How did your family fare?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: My parents were here, in this country.</span> <span id="s907">I lost cousins.</span> <span id="s908">I lost one cousin I was very close to, who tried to pass the line with his wife and five children; and they were all picked up.</span> <span id="s909">I had lost my husband.</span> <span id="s910">If you had seen Paris the day of liberation and the day when General De Clerq went down the Champs Elysee with General De Gaulle, if you had seen the faces of the people, the very young people who were screaming at the Americans and sending flowers and candles.</span> <span id="s911">All the people my age, everybody was crying.</span> <span id="s912">It was unbelievable, because you were liberated.</span> <span id="s913">But you were liberated for what?</span> <span id="s914">With a country that was completely bare, that had nothing left?</span> <span id="s915">You had no food, you had nothing to back you up.</span> <span id="s916">And when they just now celebrated the forty years of the Marshall Plan, I’m telling you, nobody knows what the Marshall Plan did, nobody.</span> <span id="s917">Because when Marshall saw what had happened and when he saw how completely bare the countryside had been left, he realized that only if there was help to help themselves, and replant and rebuild, that Europe would be saved.</span> <span id="s918">Without that, there was no way.</span> <span id="s919">How were you going to restart all your vineyards, how were you going to restart all your fields?</span> <span id="s920">How were you going to start having again food to feed millions?</span> <span id="s921">There was no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: This was General George C. Marshall, after the war, just for the record.</span> <span id="s923">You were not in Paris for liberation day?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: No, I was in and out of Paris, but I never lived there during the occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: What was liberation like for you?</span> <span id="s926">How did you get the news?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: I was there.</span> <span id="s928">We liberated Grenoble the same day Paris was liberated.</span> <span id="s929">Where we had this house for fourteen of us, 20 km.</span> <span id="s930">from our house was another part of my family, an aunt and cousins.</span> <span id="s931">One of my cousins was picked up.</span> <span id="s932">He was on a mission in Bordeaux and the Germans picked him up and he was put in a freighter car and he had in his mouth a little tiny knife like this.</span> <span id="s933">For days and days he bored a tiny hole with this little knife and he was able to push the bar of the freight car and he jumped, and of course they immediately saw him -- because they were on the roof of the freight car -- and they shot at him, but he was able to run and run so quickly that the guys did not have time to jump out of the train and really follow him.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: This house where fourteen of you lived.</span> <span id="s935">How big was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: A castle.</span> <span id="s937">A gorgeous place.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: So you had plenty of room.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: It had at least six bedrooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: With fireplaces, furniture…</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Thank God for the fireplace.</span> <span id="s942">The fourteen of us used to stay there around that fire at night, that one and only room that had a fireplace.</span> <span id="s943">And when we were going out to get to bed, the sheets were absolutely wet from the cold and the humidity.</span> <span id="s944">There was no other way to warm up, to heat anything.</span> <span id="s945">No way.</span> <span id="s946">Some of them were doing correspondence schooling, some of them were going to school right there.</span> <span id="s947">Everybody was doing something.</span> <span id="s948">I had two cousins who were doctors who were there, and my father-in-law was a doctor, and all of them were running around in the country helping people.</span> <span id="s949">It was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And what was it like?</span> <span id="s951">The liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: What was it like?</span> <span id="s953">Well, it was to see the Germans sitting at the café that morning, and in the afternoon, the Americans.</span> <span id="s954">They chased them out.</span> <span id="s955">They were shooting at each other like crazy and it was the same thing in Paris.</span> <span id="s956">When they got into Paris they were shooting at the Americans and at the Free French and they were shooting back, of course, and there was a lot of wounded and a lot of killed that time.</span> <span id="s957">They were shooting from the roof top; they didn’t give up easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: But then they ran and there were the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: That was unbelievable, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s960">That we saw with our own eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: You could speak some English?</span> <span id="s962">Did you talk to any of the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s964">My father-in-law, being a doctor, they immediately contacted him and asked him if they could use a part of our property to set up tents and to have a hospital.</span> <span id="s965">So we had a hospital, really, on the property there where we were, and so we were immediately very close with all of them.</span> <span id="s966">They helped us, we helped them, and of course, the main thing was that we got some of those K-rations.</span> <span id="s967">Nobody knew what that was.</span> <span id="s968">I’m sure today I wouldn’t even open one of those cans, but this was something unbelievable!</span> <span id="s969">It had Hershey bars and it had…oh.</span> <span id="s970">.</span> <span id="s971">it was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: A can of Spam.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: (Laughter) It was awful, but it was so good.</span> <span id="s974">They wanted really to have meals.</span> <span id="s975">They wanted meals coming from a kitchen.</span> <span id="s976">They were able to get a lot of things that we couldn’t get.</span> <span id="s977">We were still on ration cards.</span> <span id="s978">When we left in January, 1946, I came with my oldest daughter and left my youngest one behind, because I just came for three months here…</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: How did that happen?</span> <span id="s980">How did you arrange to come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: That was very, very quick.</span> <span id="s982">We were liberated in August, ’44, and by December, ’44, maybe January, ’45, I got involved with one person who had big plans to organize a “children of liberation,” and started children’s homes.</span> <span id="s983">And the only way we could do that was by contacting something that I had never heard about before, called the “Joint.”</span> <span id="s984">I was the only one who spoke English fluently so I went to see the head of the “Joint.”</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Which was the Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: The Jewish Joint Distribution Committee -- JDC -- which everybody knew as the “Joint.”</span> <span id="s987">Dr. Schwartz was the head of it at the time and I introduced myself and told him that this was our plan.</span> <span id="s988">We knew of hundreds of children that our social worker can get back and once we get them back, we need money.</span> <span id="s989">We can requisition some homes, we knew the Germans had just vacated, but we need money.</span> <span id="s990">There was nobody in France who could give us anything.</span> <span id="s991">All the money was in America!</span> <span id="s992">Everybody who had money and who was anybody was here in America.</span> <span id="s993">So we had no sources of money, and Dr. Schwartz looked at me and he said, “Well, Madame, we will help, providing that you can prove what you can do.</span> <span id="s994">Prove what you can do and we’ll help.”</span> <span id="s995">And I said, “But how can I prove anything and start without the money?”</span> <span id="s996">“I’m sure you’ll find a way.”</span> <span id="s997">He didn’t give me anything!</span> <span id="s998">So we requisitioned one house that we knew had belonged to a Jewish woman, whose name was Guggenheim, and this used to be a house that she had on the premises of Napoleon’s summer home, and it was left for unwed mothers.</span> <span id="s999">That was her hobby.</span> <span id="s1000">Not Jewish unwed mothers.</span> <span id="s1001">We didn’t give a damn about Mrs. Guggenheim or anything; we just went into the place.</span> <span id="s1002">And by hook and crook we found cots and we found mattresses and springs, and we raided a furniture store, a furniture warehouse.</span> <span id="s1003">We did everything.</span> <span id="s1004">We had done much worse than that, so what we did then was nothing.</span> <span id="s1005">(Laughs) We finally got almost a hundred beds together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: And you didn’t buy these things, you “requisitioned” them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Buy?</span> <span id="s1008">With what” We didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s1009">So we raided a warehouse one night and then we also stole one of the JDC trucks to carry stuff!</span> <span id="s1010">During the night we went to get it.</span> <span id="s1011">Oh, we did much better than that.</span> <span id="s1012">In Worm one day we carried people under illegal boards on the JDC truck that we stole during the night.</span> <span id="s1013">In any event, we finally established enough to get those kids back.</span> <span id="s1014">Now when it came to send the social workers to get those kids, when they told them that their name was Goldberg and not Smith, and they were Jewish, they spat at their face.</span> <span id="s1015">Some of the social workers came back and said, “We’re not going to go on.</span> <span id="s1016">We cannot go on; they spit in our face, they don’t believe they are Jewish, they don’t want to be Jewish.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: These were the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: So we kidnapped them.</span> <span id="s1019">We really did, because the people that they were farm hands for never adopted them, of course, but they didn’t want to let them go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: And you had kept the records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: We had the records.</span> <span id="s1022">We knew who they were and we knew where to get them.</span> <span id="s1023">It was really a terrible problem.</span> <span id="s1024">We got one woman by the name of Mrs. Fink, I remember, a very nice old Jewish woman and she came and she taught the kids Yiddish songs.</span> <span id="s1025">It was really unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1026">She wanted them to feel some Yiddishkeit, and none of us could do that.</span> <span id="s1027">None of us spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1028">But those kids, little by little, gave up their reticence.</span> <span id="s1029">They were so vindictive.</span> <span id="s1030">They were constantly on the defensive.</span> <span id="s1031">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s1032">So anyway, the first month I had all those kids together, I had made debts everywhere.</span> <span id="s1033">Every grocery store, they let me charge.</span> <span id="s1034">I said to all of them, “I can’t pay anything now, but I’ll pay at the end of the month.”</span> <span id="s1035">They believed me.</span> <span id="s1036">After all, they were children, and they didn’t want to let those children starve.</span> <span id="s1037">At the end of the month I went to see Dr. Schwartz and I said, “Now I need money.</span> <span id="s1038">I have 107 kids.</span> <span id="s1039">What am I going to do?</span> <span id="s1040">I’ve no money.”</span> <span id="s1041">So he came to see the house and he said it’s okay.</span> <span id="s1042">So we got 60% of our budget.</span> <span id="s1043">Like everything that the JDC did, they gave 60% and you have to find the other 40%.</span> <span id="s1044">You have to go yourself on a campaign to find it, contact people, to help do whatever you can.</span> <span id="s1045">They never give 100%; they never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: You should ask for more to begin with.</span> <span id="s1047">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: So one day I went to Dr. Schwartz at the end of ’45 and I said to him, “I can’t go on.</span> <span id="s1049">The Americans are wonderful.</span> <span id="s1050">They send me shoes, so I get 60 pairs of shoes for a hundred kids.</span> <span id="s1051">Who am I going to give the shoes to?</span> <span id="s1052">Why this one and not that one?”</span> <span id="s1053">So he looked at me and he said, “Do you want to go there?</span> <span id="s1054">Do you want to get the money?</span> <span id="s1055">You go to America and see what you can do.</span> <span id="s1056">As far as I’m concerned there is nothing more I can do.</span> <span id="s1057">We have a policy, the policy is the same for every country we help.</span> <span id="s1058">Sixty percent of your budget we can provide for, but we can’t do anything more.”</span> <span id="s1059">And that’s the way I came, for three months.</span> <span id="s1060">I came with my older daughter because Francelyne was easier to leave behind.</span> <span id="s1061">She was more adaptable and I left her in that children’s home.</span> <span id="s1062">One of my counselors was a wonderful girl and she said to me, “Look, I’m telling you, I’ll take care of her, I’ll never leave her alone.</span> <span id="s1063">She’ll be under my guard all the time, my guidance.</span> <span id="s1064">You don’t have to worry.”</span> <span id="s1065">Then I was waiting for my father-in-law to come back, who was in the south of France; he was going to get back his apartment in Paris.</span> <span id="s1066">And I was waiting for my parents to come back from America; I knew they would come here.</span> <span id="s1067">We came on the Thomas Barry, which was a troop ship, and we loaded the ship in LeHavre -- LeHavre was completely destroyed -- and on the dock there was an enormous Red Cross tent with a big red cross on top and they were distributing coffee and hot chocolate to the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1068">There were 4,500 troops on that troop ship.</span> <span id="s1069">It was the beginning of January.</span> <span id="s1070">It was bitterly cold.</span> <span id="s1071">It was awful.</span> <span id="s1072">The wind was blowing; we were frozen.</span> <span id="s1073">Nadine was shaking, with her hands clapping like this, so I went into the tent and said to one of the Red Cross women there, “My child is frozen to death.</span> <span id="s1074">Will you please give her a cup of chocolate?”</span> <span id="s1075">And she looked at me and she said, “You are a civilian.</span> <span id="s1076">We take care of the army.”</span> <span id="s1077">I have to tell you that I never gave a cent to the Red Cross here.</span> <span id="s1078">I was absolutely beside myself.</span> <span id="s1079">So we finally got put in, but they must have loaded 4,000 troops before they took us in.</span> <span id="s1080">We were put in the officers’ quarters and we were given the prison, because the prison had ten cells and we were ten civilians, so each of us got a cell!</span> <span id="s1081">I learned something there that I never forget --every “soldier” was three soldiers, sharing the same bed.</span> <span id="s1082">One bed for three soldiers.</span> <span id="s1083">So we are immediately given the instructions, that we are in the officers’ mess, the officers’ dining room, and that dinner will be served at 6:30.</span> <span id="s1084">It was maybe 5:00 So we are told where the dining room is, and we go and it’s rather a small dining room with white on white tablecloths, gorgeous, an enormous platter of cold cuts in the middle of each table and cheeses of all kinds and big baskets of fruits, and there was my daughter, and she looks and she looks, and she started to cry.</span> <span id="s1085">I couldn’t stop her.</span> <span id="s1086">“What is it?”</span> <span id="s1087">“Mother, I told you.</span> <span id="s1088">I told you not to give our ration card before we left.</span> <span id="s1089">See, now we won’t be able to get anything!”</span> <span id="s1090">She couldn’t believe it, she couldn’t believe that there was such a thing as getting food for free, food you didn’t have to have a coupon for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: She was nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: She was nine years old.</span> <span id="s1093">She had never seen white bread in her life.</span> <span id="s1094">Never.</span> <span id="s1095">It was white bread -- you know, those American sliced breads -- and all that cheese and all those cold cuts.</span> <span id="s1096">And then at one time she was terribly sick and she didn’t eat anything at all for a whole day and that night we had chicken in the dining room, so the next day when she felt better I said To The steward, “Could I get some cold chicken from last night?”</span> <span id="s1097">Because that’s the only thing that’s really light that she could digest.”</span> <span id="s1098">So he said to me, “Cold chicken?</span> <span id="s1099">Where?”</span> <span id="s1100">I said, “We had that last night.”</span> <span id="s1101">“Oh madame, everything that’s left from last night went into the ocean.”</span> <span id="s1102">Ohhh, I tell you this was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1103">All this which everyone takes for granted, for us was such a cultural shock.</span> <span id="s1104">Just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1105">So we had all kinds of experience like this.</span> <span id="s1106">We went on Broadway once and we were looking for a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s1107">She had never had a pair of shoes in four years.</span> <span id="s1108">Every shoe was left as it was, the foot was getting bigger, so we were making a hole at the end to let the toe grow through, and changing the sole by putting a wooden sole on.</span> <span id="s1109">The kids never had a leather sole on a shoe.</span> <span id="s1110">Everything they had was turned inside.</span> <span id="s1111">They had coats when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1112">So okay, those coats became jackets, but you put the inside of the coat out, so that it would look a little less shabby.</span> <span id="s1113">Everything was like that.</span> <span id="s1114">So we got to Broadway and bought a pair of shoes and I don’t know what they’re telling me and what they’re showing me.</span> <span id="s1115">What do you call those white and brown shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Oh, saddle shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Saddle shoes.</span> <span id="s1118">So they showed her that, in brown and white or black and white.</span> <span id="s1119">So she looked at that and she said, “I don’t like it.”</span> <span id="s1120">So the guy says to her, and I have to translate, “But all the children wear that.”</span> <span id="s1121">So, when I translate that to her she says, “Tell him that is the reason why I won’t.”</span> <span id="s1122">She was a fashion individualist and she couldn’t stand that, to be told that everybody wears that.</span> <span id="s1123">She said, “Then I should do it?</span> <span id="s1124">Because everybody else does?”</span> <span id="s1125">Another time we were in a drugstore and somebody was with me and said, well, let her have an ice cream soda.</span> <span id="s1126">So I asked the man for an ice cream soda.</span> <span id="s1127">So she looks at that big glass, like this, and she looks at him putting a scoop of ice cream in it, and he looked at her eyes and he said, “She won’t like it?”</span> <span id="s1128">So I said, “She’s never had one.”</span> <span id="s1129">“She never had one?”</span> <span id="s1130">And I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1131">So he put three ice cream scoops in it!</span> <span id="s1132">(Laughter) And he said, “Let her have one for all these years.”</span> <span id="s1133">She looked at that with enormous eyes.</span> <span id="s1134">She couldn’t believe what she was seeing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: So Joint paid your way over, your ship fare?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Then I worked here.</span> <span id="s1137">I worked for three months.</span> <span id="s1138">I covered 42 states.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: They sent you on a lecture tour.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: They didn’t send me.</span> <span id="s1141">When I got here I was told to see Mr. Moe Levitt at the JDC office in New York, and he was waiting for me because Dr. Schwartz had told him, I came in my own.</span> <span id="s1142">I didn’t come with their money.</span> <span id="s1143">I came on my own, because I wanted my children’s homes to get going.</span> <span id="s1144">At that time we already had eleven houses!</span> <span id="s1145">We ended up with 1,500 kids.</span> <span id="s1146">We got money.</span> <span id="s1147">When I came here I started to campaign among all the French people I knew were in New York, and got money from them.</span> <span id="s1148">I also spoke in Baltimore, and when I was through speaking and all the pledges were in, I saw that they were shush-shushing among themselves; it was a men’s meeting, a dinner meeting, and I don’t know what they are saying, what they’re doing, and after about fifteen minutes the chairman presented me with a check for $500 and he said, “You are coming tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s1149">We are going to pick you up at the hotel, take you to the shoe factory and we’re going to give you as many pairs of shoes as you need for your house.</span> <span id="s1150">And here is a check for $500 for it.”</span> <span id="s1151">So I went and I picked up 110 pairs of shoes and I am so thrilled I am just beside myself.</span> <span id="s1152">I get back from Baltimore and the day I get back to New York, I get a call from Mr. Moe Levitt that he’s expecting me.</span> <span id="s1153">So I go to the office and ho, what I got, he gave me such hell.</span> <span id="s1154">“How can you do that?</span> <span id="s1155">Because you happen to be in America and you represent your organization.</span> <span id="s1156">We have an organization like yours in every country in the world.</span> <span id="s1157">They are in Belgium, in Holland and in Italy.</span> <span id="s1158">They’re all over the place.</span> <span id="s1159">So because you’re here, you’re going to get 110 pairs of shoes.</span> <span id="s1160">What about the others?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: And you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: He gave me 25 pairs.</span> <span id="s1163">I could go on and on like this, believe me, endlessly.</span> <span id="s1164">So I went back, and I came back, and I went back, and I came back, and I did that for eight years, everything for the children, until I met my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Now, how often were you coming over here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: I was coming for the spring campaign every year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: For the Joint?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: For UJA.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: UJA -- United Jewish Appeal.</span> <span id="s1170">And you would have speaking engagements in various cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Sometimes I was speaking three times a day.</span> <span id="s1172">I had a breakfast meeting, a lunch and a dinner.</span> <span id="s1173">Sometimes I only had a dinner but I had the television and the radio and God knows what in between, and interviews with the paper.</span> <span id="s1174">I just never stopped talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: They set this up for you and in exchange you were still working for the orphanages?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: I hadn’t given up.</span> <span id="s1177">I couldn’t stay here more than a certain amount of months.</span> <span id="s1178">I had people taking care of it.</span> <span id="s1179">I had some wonderful counselors and I was mainly involved in that one house.</span> <span id="s1180">But I can tell you a story that you would never believe.</span> <span id="s1181">We were hiding, of course, Jewish kids, but with no other thought but waiting for the parents to come back.</span> <span id="s1182">And none of the parents came back.</span> <span id="s1183">And that we couldn’t convey to them.</span> <span id="s1184">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s1185">Some of those kids never adapted; they could never get through the idea that their parents would not come back.</span> <span id="s1186">“Why not?</span> <span id="s1187">If our parents were taken somewhere, why don’t they come back?”</span> <span id="s1188">Some of the kids came back from camps, because they were not always hidden; we got kids from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1189">They were all checked in at a center in Paris, an informal center.</span> <span id="s1190">Every child was checked in, name, address, parents’ names and everything, and where they would be kept in Paris.</span> <span id="s1191">All my kids were checked in there.</span> <span id="s1192">We had some children who refused to go to school, who refused to get out of the house.</span> <span id="s1193">They refused to do anything because if the parents would come and look for them, they wouldn’t find them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: What kind of counseling did you have for these children?</span> <span id="s1195">How did you try to help them, these children who couldn’t adjust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: They went to school.</span> <span id="s1197">I had one child, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1198">He was screaming during the night.</span> <span id="s1199">He never knew that, but he was screaming, “They’re burning, it smells, it smells, burn, don’t you see the smoke?”</span> <span id="s1200">Things like this, that he never knew he was doing.</span> <span id="s1201">The other kids were begging me to take him out.</span> <span id="s1202">I didn’t know what to do with him.</span> <span id="s1203">I was putting him here, there and the other place.</span> <span id="s1204">The business of Palestine was very far from my mind.</span> <span id="s1205">I really had no contact with it and had nothing to do with it, and never any activity that had anything to do with Palestine.</span> <span id="s1206">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q; You were not a Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Zionist!</span> <span id="s1209">What’s Zionist?</span> <span id="s1210">The French have two very famous phrases.</span> <span id="s1211">They said, “Anybody who wants to be a Zionist, wants to be an ambassador in Washington.”</span> <span id="s1212">And the other phrase was, “A Zionist is a man who talks with another one to see which is the first one they send to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s1213">This is all I ever knew about Zionism.</span> <span id="s1214">Anyway, one night, sometime in ’45, I’m already sleeping.</span> <span id="s1215">It’s about 2 o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1216">I had a room in many of the houses but I was there in the first one we started.</span> <span id="s1217">We had this big property, an enormous yard around.</span> <span id="s1218">By the way, we were the first ones to use the ORT people in Paris.</span> <span id="s1219">Each child was given a plot of ground, and they were watching things grow.</span> <span id="s1220">That was the first house they ever had that in Paris.</span> <span id="s1221">Anyway at 2 o’clock in the morning, like this at the door (knocks on table) I can remember so vividly.</span> <span id="s1222">It was a Sunday night, and I had received my allocation from the JDC Friday.</span> <span id="s1223">There was no way to get that to the bank, neither Saturday or Sunday, so I had a lot of money in the house.</span> <span id="s1224">I said that’s it!</span> <span id="s1225">There are people who know that, and who comes in the middle of the night, like this?</span> <span id="s1226">So I open my window.</span> <span id="s1227">I’m above the entrance door.</span> <span id="s1228">I see forms of men.</span> <span id="s1229">It’s pitch black.</span> <span id="s1230">I say, “What do you want?”</span> <span id="s1231">“Open the door.”</span> <span id="s1232">“I don’t open any door,” I said.</span> <span id="s1233">“What do you want?”</span> <span id="s1234">“Open the door.”</span> <span id="s1235">“I don’t open any door” So I closed my window and called the police.</span> <span id="s1236">The police come and with a big spotlight, they throw the light on those three men, and here on the arm they have “Palestinian Brigade” and I don’t know who they are, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1237">But when I saw that, I decide they’re something, and I said, “Oh, I’m terribly sorry, I didn’t expect them, I didn’t know they were coming.</span> <span id="s1238">I’m sorry and now I know that I should open my door and I should have them for the night.”</span> <span id="s1239">The police were absolutely besides themselves because the first thing they said, “What’s those two trucks outside there?</span> <span id="s1240">There are two trucks in front of the gate of your property.</span> <span id="s1241">What are they?”</span> <span id="s1242">So I said I wouldn’t know, so one of the men said, “They’re sick people, that we are taking to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1243">They come from a D.P. camp.”</span> <span id="s1244">So the police didn’t know whether they should be angry or they should do something, but they didn’t know what to do, and they left.</span> <span id="s1245">And what I got!</span> <span id="s1246">The one who was the chief of the three said to me, “Do you mean that we’ve gone through the four occupation zones -- we went through the Russian zone, the French zone, the British zone, the American zone and we finally get to Paris and to a Jewish home, and you call the police.”</span> <span id="s1247">But I said, “I don’t know who you are, why you’re here, and what it’s all about.”</span> <span id="s1248">He said, “You’ve been notified.”</span> <span id="s1249">I said, “No, I haven’t.</span> <span id="s1250">I have not been notified.”</span> <span id="s1251">This was six miles from Paris, it’s a suburb of Paris, and this is where Napoleon had his summer home, and we had two homes there.</span> <span id="s1252">One was called “Malmaison 1” and one was called “Malmaison 2.”</span> <span id="s1253">“Malmaison 2 had been notified, but they didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1254">They asked where “Malmaison 2” was, and they were sent to me.</span> <span id="s1255">In the meantime, what do I do?</span> <span id="s1256">They want to unload the people.</span> <span id="s1257">And they have almost 200 people in those trucks.</span> <span id="s1258">They want to unload them, leave them with me overnight or a part of the day, because they have in their truck a double bottom, and in the double bottom it’s full of arms.</span> <span id="s1259">They want to go to Marseille as fast as they can, without any witness, unload their arms, come back of course empty, and pick them up.</span> <span id="s1260">And they’re taking them to an illegal boat which they’re expecting to arrive somewhere.</span> <span id="s1261">Well, what do we do?</span> <span id="s1262">Those people were exhausted.</span> <span id="s1263">When the kids saw them and saw how bad they looked, they all got up, and they gave them their beds.</span> <span id="s1264">They refused to use their beds, they refused to take a piece of bread, they refused everything.</span> <span id="s1265">They waited.</span> <span id="s1266">They stood there and they waited until the guys came back.</span> <span id="s1267">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1268">Those things never happened again, until the state was created.</span> <span id="s1269">I did one of those in January, and the state was created five months later.</span> <span id="s1270">I did one of those from Italy, and believe me, we loaded a boat.</span> <span id="s1271">The people who haven’t lived that period don’t know.</span> <span id="s1272">It was unbelievable, what the arm of Haganah that was called “Brichah” was doing in Europe.</span> <span id="s1273">And Brichah was doing all the illegal immigration.</span> <span id="s1274">All of the Aliyah Bet was done by them.</span> <span id="s1275">They were absolutely unbelievable1 Most of the people went to Cyprus, but they got away.</span> <span id="s1276">And we emptied the D.P. camps long before we were given permission.</span> <span id="s1277">So this was a funny way to be broken into Zionism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Did you work with Haganah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: I worked with Brichah.</span> <span id="s1280">I did a lot of Aliyah Bet.</span> <span id="s1281">I did it from Italy.</span> <span id="s1282">I did it from Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: You’re getting tired, I think.</span> <span id="s1284">Would you want to talk about it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: You mean in public?</span> <span id="s1286">In public I don’t talk too much about it.</span> <span id="s1287">The kind of work we did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Oh, it was fantastic.</span> <span id="s1290">After the Exodus was picked up, and after the British brought them back to the north of Germany in a camp called Poppendorf, then Brichah started to take people out of there.</span> <span id="s1291">The British were monsters.</span> <span id="s1292">They took the people from the Exodus and put them on those three boats and those three boats were taken from Emilite all the way up near Hamburg -- Poppendorf.</span> <span id="s1293">And the British pushed them out of the boats with the butt of their rifles.</span> <span id="s1294">It was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: And these were survivors.</span> <span id="s1296">These were people who had been in camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: From refugee camps.</span> <span id="s1298">And they were all released, but if they were on the list of Haganah they were going; if they happened to be on the list of Irgun, they were never going, and they didn’t know the difference.</span> <span id="s1299">The people in the camp were subject to all kinds of political party pressure.</span> <span id="s1300">All kinds.</span> <span id="s1301">They didn’t know from anything, no more than me.</span> <span id="s1302">What did I know that there were 36 political parties, and each one had a hand in doing something, and one who was listed with the Stern gang or with the Irgun never got there.</span> <span id="s1303">Only the ones with Haganah were leaving.</span> <span id="s1304">And these are the ones who were taken to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1305">Most of the time it was rare that the boat was really landing in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1306">Very rare.</span> <span id="s1307">Most of the time it was Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1308">But, at the time of the Poppendorf thing, there was a fabulous guy in Munich whose name was Yitzhak.</span> <span id="s1309">Don’t ask me anything else, that’s all I know.</span> <span id="s1310">I’ve always wanted to find him.</span> <span id="s1311">I would have loved to find him again.</span> <span id="s1312">Yitzhak was in charge of this whole transport.</span> <span id="s1313">He was a little guy.</span> <span id="s1314">You wouldn’t give him five cents, but he was capable of doing something courageous.</span> <span id="s1315">He was tiny and small and thin.</span> <span id="s1316">So they took me with them.</span> <span id="s1317">We got three trucks of people who had been taken out of Poppendorf and they had to cross at least three borders, at least three zones of occupation.</span> <span id="s1318">The goal was to get to a camp in Italy, because the boat that was going to load them was on the Italian coast.</span> <span id="s1319">They passed easily the American border.</span> <span id="s1320">They passed the French border.</span> <span id="s1321">Then comes the Russian, and at the Russian border, the guy is absolutely inhuman.</span> <span id="s1322">He is not going to let them go through.</span> <span id="s1323">“Your papers!”</span> <span id="s1324">And Yitzhak, clever, picks up from his wallet his Hebrew birth certificate, written in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1325">Apparently, for an illiterate Russian, the Hebrew letters looked like the Russian letters enough for him to think that that’s an order for passage.</span> <span id="s1326">He doesn’t know, he can’t read anyway, but he recognizes if it’s written in English or if it’s written in Russian.</span> <span id="s1327">It was “nyet” and “nyet” and “nyet” until he saw that paper, and then he opened the barricade and we went through.</span> <span id="s1328">We got to Chiave near Milano and I think we stayed there overnight.</span> <span id="s1329">Then from there we went to Cinecitta.</span> <span id="s1330">That was the Hollywood of Rome.</span> <span id="s1331">That’s where all the films are made in Italy.</span> <span id="s1332">We were given by the Italian government half of that “Hollywood.”</span> <span id="s1333">It was a sight.</span> <span id="s1334">Unfortunately, I never took a picture.</span> <span id="s1335">One part of it there were people in costumes, and filming already movies and so forth.</span> <span id="s1336">The other part were our people in rags.</span> <span id="s1337">We left them there in that camp.</span> <span id="s1338">We had tents there, and they were fed, and we didn’t know really when we would get a boat without checking into a hotel.</span> <span id="s1339">I stayed there one day, and half the night, and I get a phone call, “Get ready immediately.</span> <span id="s1340">We’re ready to go.”</span> <span id="s1341">So I go down to the hotel and they picked us up.</span> <span id="s1342">We had three trucks.</span> <span id="s1343">We went about 70 kms north of Rome.</span> <span id="s1344">We had a fabulous girl.</span> <span id="s1345">She was Italian and she found the place where we could load the boats.</span> <span id="s1346">The boat could never come in.</span> <span id="s1347">The boat was always at least three miles away, in the deep sea.</span> <span id="s1348">When we got there, there was already many fires on the beach and the boys from Haganah were there, and they were going in the water, and it was bitterly cold in the water.</span> <span id="s1349">I know exactly when it was -- January 31, ’48.</span> <span id="s1350">That’s what I said, it was five months before liberation.</span> <span id="s1351">And I know exactly when it was because I was married January 31, so it was my wedding anniversary that night.</span> <span id="s1352">We take the people out of one bus, take ten of them out, and the boys have inflated those rubber boats that belonged to the American army.</span> <span id="s1353">We put them on those rubber boats with one strong man -- there were many, many old people --s one strong enough to hold onto the rope.</span> <span id="s1354">And what the boys had done before we got there with the trucks, is that they had made a link between the gangplank that was built on the beach and that boat that was two miles or thee miles away.</span> <span id="s1355">The rope was extended between the deck of the boat and the dock.</span> <span id="s1356">It was pitch black.</span> <span id="s1357">There could be no moon and no stars, otherwise they could never do that.</span> <span id="s1358">It had to be a moonless night.</span> <span id="s1359">We were shipping them.</span> <span id="s1360">You didn’t know where they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: They just vanished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1363">They were holding that rope and just going in the complete darkness.</span> <span id="s1364">They had no idea where they went.</span> <span id="s1365">They just followed that rope.</span> <span id="s1366">They got on board ship.</span> <span id="s1367">We must have unloaded almost two buses, and when the boys were pushing those boats in the water, the water was ice cold, so they were running in and getting to the fire, and getting warmed up, and drinking coffee, and another gang was going; than that gang was coming back.</span> <span id="s1368">The man who was directing them was an older man.</span> <span id="s1369">He was about sixty.</span> <span id="s1370">It was very interesting because you could see the respect that those boys had for him.</span> <span id="s1371">The minute he was giving an order it was done, just like that.</span> <span id="s1372">Then suddenly the sea became awful.</span> <span id="s1373">The waves were so high, we had to stop.</span> <span id="s1374">We just couldn’t go any more.</span> <span id="s1375">When they told me to go to the bus and tell them that we couldn’t load them…wow.</span> <span id="s1376">So we had to take that one bus back to Cinecitta and I think the boat stayed there two nights, two more nights before we could load.</span> <span id="s1377">It was during the vernal equinox and the sea was just…you couldn’t put in those little rubber boats.</span> <span id="s1378">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s1379">But the number of older people there…there was an old man who was carrying a Torah under his arm.</span> <span id="s1380">The nerve they had to be willing to do that in the darkness of the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: How did you happen to be there?</span> <span id="s1382">Who were you working for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: I was involved because those three boys came to my house.</span> <span id="s1384">The man who really had the idea of doing it was a strong Zionist, and little by little we became the receptacle of those illegal entries into France, to take them to Marseille so they could board those illegal boats.</span> <span id="s1385">I got very well acquainted with a lot of them and then I went to Munich because I wanted to for a while work with the JDC there.</span> <span id="s1386">So I was there at the end of ’47.</span> <span id="s1387">That’s the year I went to Theresienstadt and Prague and I went to I don’t know how many D.P. camps all over Austria, and everywhere.</span> <span id="s1388">I got acquainted with all of them, in the different places where they were, so every time I was asking to go along, they always said yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: You were a very adventurous person, always.</span> <span id="s1390">You involve yourself.</span> <span id="s1391">You don’t sit back and watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: When you had lived through the Occupation, you know, nothing was scary.</span> <span id="s1393">Nothing could have been worse than the Occupation.</span> <span id="s1394">You could be hooked by the British or the Russians, but what could they do to you?</span> <span id="s1395">They couldn’t do much.</span> <span id="s1396">And it was fascinating, because those people had waited and waited.</span> <span id="s1397">One bunch that we picked up from Munich, I spent the Friday night before with them, and the old man who was carrying the Torah was the one who had conducted the Shabbat service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Meanwhile your children…</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: The only trouble was my Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1400">How could I be Jewish and not speak Yiddish, that they could never understand.</span> <span id="s1401">“You’re not Jewish,” they said.</span> <span id="s1402">“I’m Jewish but I don’t speak Yiddish,” I said.</span> <span id="s1403">“How can you not speak Yiddish?”</span> <span id="s1404">“Because I don’t speak Yiddish.”</span> <span id="s1405">I could speak German with them, they would understand my German, but I couldn’t understand what they were saying.</span> <span id="s1406">For me it was a massacre of the German language.</span> <span id="s1407">(Laughs) There was a group there from a certain place in Lithuania and they were saying “bitte, bitte” something and I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1408">They were asking me, “bitte?”</span> <span id="s1409">Why in the world were they asking me?</span> <span id="s1410">“Weider” means “the two of us “ in German.</span> <span id="s1411">I couldn’t translate it into real German.</span> <span id="s1412">That happened to me all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: So then for eight years after the war, which takes us up to 1954…</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: I was married in September, ’54.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: You were working with the orphanage, the children’s home, and after the state of Israel was created, there was no more of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: No more illegal immigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Were you still involved in the Zionist movement then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Not everything was legal.</span> <span id="s1419">We did a lot of illegal immigration, from Libya, from Morocco.</span> <span id="s1420">Our illegal immigration from Libya was absolutely something unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1421">If we hadn’t done that I don’t know what would have happened.</span> <span id="s1422">If we had left the Jews in Libya.</span> <span id="s1423">They were loaded at night on board ship and then the government asked us one thing -- to leave some silversmiths, because the Jews in Tripoli were fabulous silversmiths.</span> <span id="s1424">All of them.</span> <span id="s1425">And apparently the Libyans were not good at it.</span> <span id="s1426">So the government asked us to leave a certain number of those silversmiths to teach the Libyans, but gave us the absolute pledge that we would be able to take them.</span> <span id="s1427">I don’t remember if they wanted them three months, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1428">This was done with papers signed, and everything else.</span> <span id="s1429">But then we took them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: This was referred to as Operation Magic Carpet wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A; No, I don’t think we ever had a name for the operation in Libya.</span> <span id="s1432">We had one from Ethiopia, we had one from Yemen, of course the Magic Carpet, but I don’t remember having a name for the one in Libya.</span> <span id="s1433">Because this was not plane, this was boats.</span> <span id="s1434">We only gave a name to the plane transport.</span> <span id="s1435">There, we never transported them by plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: What was your job assignment?</span> <span id="s1437">What actually did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: I went with the director of the JDC in Rome.</span> <span id="s1439">We both flew into Tripoli and we met there someone whose name was Nelly Benetar.</span> <span id="s1440">She was the head of the entire JDC working in Libya.</span> <span id="s1441">I got involved in this operation of emptying places.</span> <span id="s1442">They were actually transported from Bengazi into Tripoli at night, and then they were kept, very often in children’s rooms.</span> <span id="s1443">It was amazing that we were able to actually load people from the docks there in Tripoli.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: So you would be arranging transportation, notifying people when to show up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: Everything.</span> <span id="s1446">You were doing everything.</span> <span id="s1447">Sometimes you were just going to feed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: But in each community there would be some sort of Jewish center that you could contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: They came from the different villages into the big city, like we did in Morocco.</span> <span id="s1450">We took them from the Atlas mountains and put them into Casablanca, and too them out.</span> <span id="s1451">I don’t think that there are any Jews left in Tripoli.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: So you were a career mother, and Francelyne and Nadine were still back in Paris.</span> <span id="s1453">How much of the time were you gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: This wasn’t the best thing, because the kids very often resented it.</span> <span id="s1455">I really left them alone a lot.</span> <span id="s1456">It was very rough.</span> <span id="s1457">They’d been schlepped in so many places, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1458">A young girl that was one of my kids after liberation in one of the children’s homes -- but that’s another story, a long one --I was able to find that her mother had a sister here in Detroit, and we finally got the papers to bring her over.</span> <span id="s1459">She was already doing medical study in France when I brought her over.</span> <span id="s1460">Anyway, I took her to New York and I kept her with me and she went to Hunter College.</span> <span id="s1461">And she was very unhappy there because those people only had a son, and she felt very foreign to them because they spoke Yiddish among themselves, and she was terribly shocked by that.</span> <span id="s1462">She stayed in my apartment in New York and stayed with the kids so that was good, because at least they were able to have a normal life.</span> <span id="s1463">They went to a French school in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Now what year was this that you brought the children over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: ’50? ’</span> <span id="s1466">51?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Had you wanted to emigrate to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Well, because I married an American.</span> <span id="s1471">If I wouldn’t have married an American, I wouldn’t have.</span> <span id="s1472">My whole family lived in Paris, nieces and nephews and sisters and brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1473">I don’t have anybody here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: So you were on a speaking engagement and you met…how did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: It was very prosaic.</span> <span id="s1476">The first time, one of my very first meetings was here, and I spoke here.</span> <span id="s1477">I still have the American Jewish World of April ’46, and there was a regional conference of the JDC.</span> <span id="s1478">At that time JDC used to have regional conferences which was a marvelous device because they were educational, with no fundraising, and the people learned something.</span> <span id="s1479">After that they learned nothing, because when we had to pitch for money, we didn’t have the time to educate them.</span> <span id="s1480">We pitched emotionally to get money, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1481">Chairman of Hospitality at that meeting was Midge Berger.</span> <span id="s1482">So Midge said after the meeting, “What are you doing?</span> <span id="s1483">I understand that you’re speaking in St. Paul tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s1484">I said, “Yes, I think so.”</span> <span id="s1485">I didn’t know what St. Paul was compared to Minneapolis, but I said, “I think so, how do I get there?”</span> <span id="s1486">So she said, “That’s easy enough, but what are you doing now?”</span> <span id="s1487">It was about 3:30, a quarter to four, and the convention was over, it had lasted the whole day.</span> <span id="s1488">I said, “I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1489">Nothing.”</span> <span id="s1490">So she said, “Well if you don’t mind, come into my house.</span> <span id="s1491">My beds aren’t made because I left very early this morning, but if you don’t mind coming back with me we’ll take care of you.</span> <span id="s1492">We’ll go out for dinner.”</span> <span id="s1493">I said, “All right, I’ll make the beds with you.”</span> <span id="s1494">So I made the beds with her.</span> <span id="s1495">(Laughs) One day I awarded her an award from the bond drive here.</span> <span id="s1496">I think I was chairman of the drive that year.</span> <span id="s1497">After I gave her the award she had to answer and thank, so she said, “Little did I know that one day after she helped me make the bed, that she would also wash my linen.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: So there you were, washing Midge Berger’s sheets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: When I became G &amp; K!</span> <span id="s1500">(Mrs. Fink’s American husband owns G &amp; K Launderers and Cleaners).</span> <span id="s1501">She said, “I never knew when she helped me make the bed, one day she would wash my laundry!”</span> <span id="s1502">If I was speaking in Duluth or if I was speaking in Iowa, she always said, “Whenever you’re in the neighborhood and you can manage to come for the weekend, you should drop in here.”</span> <span id="s1503">That way we became very close friends.</span> <span id="s1504">My parents came and they met my parents here and then they went to Paris and they met my parents in Paris, and my father and Ben Berger became very good friends.</span> <span id="s1505">Ben was always after me.</span> <span id="s1506">“You can’t go on with your life like this; it’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1507">You should get married.”</span> <span id="s1508">I said, “Leave me alone.”</span> <span id="s1509">He always wanted me to meet people.</span> <span id="s1510">I said, “Look, I have no desire to start all over again.”</span> <span id="s1511">My life was so different from what it would be here.</span> <span id="s1512">I couldn’t see how I could settle here like this.</span> <span id="s1513">I just couldn’t see it.</span> <span id="s1514">I was waiting really for the kids to be in college.</span> <span id="s1515">My oldest one was already a freshman when I met him.</span> <span id="s1516">My little one was going to finish high school and she wasn’t even here.</span> <span id="s1517">That year she was in Paris; she stayed with my parents the whole year.</span> <span id="s1518">I think I had spoken in Sioux Falls, and I stopped at the Minneapolis airport for an hour or two, and Midge came to the airport.</span> <span id="s1519">Then I took my plane for Duluth.</span> <span id="s1520">I was coming back the next day, so she said, “Do you want a date?”</span> <span id="s1521">And I said, “Please don’t start that again with that business.</span> <span id="s1522">I’d much rather enjoy being with you.”</span> <span id="s1523">All I knew in Minneapolis was the airport and Schiek’s restaurant.</span> <span id="s1524">That’s all I knew.</span> <span id="s1525">And the Calhoun Beach.</span> <span id="s1526">So I said, “Look, I enjoy being with you, and if you take me out for dinner it’s okay.”</span> <span id="s1527">Well, she didn’t say yes or no.</span> <span id="s1528">But then when I came back she picked me up at the airport again, it was Saturday morning, and she said she got a date with somebody who was supposed to go fishing but when he heard that they have a French friend who was coming, he got piqued and wanted to know who she was.</span> <span id="s1529">He had never met a French woman before, I think.</span> <span id="s1530">And that’s the way I met him.</span> <span id="s1531">So he never heard me speak and he said that if he had heard me speak he never would have looked at me.</span> <span id="s1532">Because he thought I was one of those women who look down on men when they speak!</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Well, of course, I remember him as a television personality.</span> <span id="s1534">He was a speaker too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: We still go places today where the people see him and say, “Oh, I know you.</span> <span id="s1536">I remember you from television.”</span> <span id="s1537">I think, it’s so funny when the people come up with that.</span> <span id="s1538">How can you remember that?</span> <span id="s1539">It’s so old, really 30, 32 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: You obviously do have a book inside you.</span> <span id="s1541">We should talk again.</span> <span id="s1542">But we have some of these questions, sort of winding it up, because this is going to be a book that’s designed for high school students to learn about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1543">Can you tell me what it means to you to be a survivor?</span> <span id="s1544">Have you thought about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: First of all, what it has meant, mainly, was this involvement of mine.</span> <span id="s1546">I don’t think that I would ever have gone on and on and on the way I did, if I didn’t feel that it was my duty to go on.</span> <span id="s1547">I have always felt that if we have been spared, if we have been able to live through it, we have a duty in talking about it.</span> <span id="s1548">I’ve always said that.</span> <span id="s1549">I don’t believe in keeping quiet, and not explain it.</span> <span id="s1550">The one thing that I’m sorry about is I did a lot of speaking in front of non-Jewish groups, but not enough.</span> <span id="s1551">Not enough.</span> <span id="s1552">I’m very sorry that we haven’t reached enough non-Jewish groups.</span> <span id="s1553">There was so much to tell them and so much to teach them.</span> <span id="s1554">We haven’t done that enough.</span> <span id="s1555">There we have really failed.</span> <span id="s1556">And I’m not the only one who’s asked about it.</span> <span id="s1557">We have the Council, Federation, even the Minnesota Council, they should have provided us with a platform to speak to non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1558">It’s a shame.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: What would you tell them?</span> <span id="s1560">When you speak to a group of non-Jews, what do you tell them about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: (Laughs) It’s easy enough to show them what anti-Semitism leads to.</span> <span id="s1562">And what every hate group leads to.</span> <span id="s1563">What can be achieved by pushing and propagandizing and influencing people in hating a certain group of people.</span> <span id="s1564">They don’t have to be just the Jews.</span> <span id="s1565">You teach people to hate the blacks.</span> <span id="s1566">From hate automatically comes Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1567">And there is absolutely no way out.</span> <span id="s1568">A holocaust of a certain kind.</span> <span id="s1569">But it’s a holocaust.</span> <span id="s1570">Look at the holocaust in South Africa.</span> <span id="s1571">I mean, this is a holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Can you describe to me your general feelings about human nature, about people, about Germans?</span> <span id="s1573">Do you have any?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: That’s a bad question.</span> <span id="s1575">For me it’s almost an impossibility to be able to find myself on German soil.</span> <span id="s1576">The strange thing is that it had repercussions too for my children.</span> <span id="s1577">My children won’t go through Germany.</span> <span id="s1578">They won’t go anywhere where it means going through or stepping on German soil.</span> <span id="s1579">They won’t.</span> <span id="s1580">I’ll tell you one thing that happened to my oldest one, Nadine.</span> <span id="s1581">When we were in N.Y. the first year, we were invited by the Hunter College president to come and speak.</span> <span id="s1582">I welcomed that very much because I think that this is one of my greatest attachments even today, to speak to the young people, the young leadership.</span> <span id="s1583">This is who needs me, not my generation.</span> <span id="s1584">We were invited to lunch, and after lunch we went into a big gymnasium and we saw children making CARE packages.</span> <span id="s1585">So my daughter, who still didn’t speak a word of English, said, “What are they doing?</span> <span id="s1586">Where are they sending that to?”</span> <span id="s1587">So I asked the president and he said, “This is going to the poor German children who have been starved for so many years.”</span> <span id="s1588">She listens to that, she becomes red in the face.</span> <span id="s1589">And she’s ten years old.</span> <span id="s1590">He looked at her and he said, “You don’t approve?”</span> <span id="s1591">And always with me in between she said, “Oh, no.”</span> <span id="s1592">And he said to her, “You would be facing a German child.</span> <span id="s1593">You wouldn’t shake hands with that child?”</span> <span id="s1594">And she said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1595">So he said, “You can’t carry hate like this.”</span> <span id="s1596">So she looked at me and she said, “Mother, would you tell him that that German child, it might be her father who killed mine?”</span> <span id="s1597">This is it.</span> <span id="s1598">You cannot change them.</span> <span id="s1599">When Nadine finished school, when she was graduated from Minnesota she went on a European tour with some of the students and she went with them until that tour took a trip on the Rhine.</span> <span id="s1600">Then she stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: You were going to back track and tell me about your family and the German branch of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: There’s one branch of Germans and I have a cousin, she’s a descendent of that branch.</span> <span id="s1603">When they all lived in Berlin they were very prominent people there, and the brothers and the mother and everybody applied to go to South Africa because I think that one of her brothers at the time had a business there.</span> <span id="s1604">They went, but she never wanted to leave Berlin.</span> <span id="s1605">She was like all of us, “Nothing can happen to me.”</span> <span id="s1606">And when she finally decided to go, South Africa had absolutely closed the immigration, so she couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s1607">She went to England and from England she finally came to America, and she lived in New York all these years.</span> <span id="s1608">Then one day she called me here and she said, “What would you think if I moved to Minneapolis?”</span> <span id="s1609">I said, “My God, what are you going to do in Minneapolis?</span> <span id="s1610">You’ll never get used to it.</span> <span id="s1611">You lived in Berlin and from there you went to New York and London.”</span> <span id="s1612">“I don’t know, I’m getting so scared of New York, so petrified to go out and I don’t go out at night any more.</span> <span id="s1613">I just don’t do anything here any more.</span> <span id="s1614">Maybe in Minneapolis I would have a freer life, and I would maybe enjoy it.”</span> <span id="s1615">So I said, “Come and look.”</span> <span id="s1616">So there’s all kinds of people like this.</span> <span id="s1617">Francelyne was in Paris two years ago and she was coming back here and I was staying longer, and she was on Air France, and she left, and all of a sudden two or three hours later I get a call from her in Paris.</span> <span id="s1618">“Where are you calling me from?</span> <span id="s1619">You left.”</span> <span id="s1620">You know when you leave Paris, you cross the ocean twenty minutes later.</span> <span id="s1621">“Where are you?</span> <span id="s1622">In Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1623">And if you don’t think I’m sick about it, I am sick.</span> <span id="s1624">We had plane trouble.</span> <span id="s1625">The only thing he did was to come here.</span> <span id="s1626">It was the easiest way.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: So she was in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: You will never change that.</span> <span id="s1629">No matter how much we are told that it shouldn’t exist and you shouldn’t be that way, the pain is too hard, the hurt is too profound.</span> <span id="s1630">When I know how they tortured my husband and what they did to him and what they did to all the people they had in their grip.</span> <span id="s1631">When you think of Barbie, an absolute bastard.</span> <span id="s1632">He was a man who tortured, himself, one of the biggest persons in the French resistance, Jean Moulin, an unbelievable person.</span> <span id="s1633">He was a writer, he was a leader of an entire movement, and Barbie tortured him himself and killed him himself.</span> <span id="s1634">They made a word in German, which is called “schadenfreunde” and that means “the joy of doing harm.”</span> <span id="s1635">And that’s the Germans.</span> <span id="s1636">The joy of doing harm.</span> <span id="s1637">This is a people, emotionally they lose their mind when they listen to Beethoven they lose their mind.</span> <span id="s1638">They’re so emotional, they’re so sentimental.</span> <span id="s1639">So the brutality on the other end, how does that go?</span> <span id="s1640">In Bayreuth when they play Wagner, you should see them.</span> <span id="s1641">They can’t breathe, they’re so emotionally taken.</span> <span id="s1642">And then they can go and do the things they did.</span> <span id="s1643">It’s not to be believed what they did.</span> <span id="s1644">The Chinese torture was nothing compared to what they devised.</span> <span id="s1645">Where do you find the idea of taking the skin of people to make lampshades?</span> <span id="s1646">And make soap.</span> <span id="s1647">Where do you get that taught to you?</span> <span id="s1648">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1649">It’s a people of such opposite extremes that you can’t understand them.</span> <span id="s1650">They’re highly intelligent, very skilled engineers, very skilled in their profession, and then you can see them in the bierstube.</span> <span id="s1651">If you see them drinking beer in one of their basement places, they have no bounds.</span> <span id="s1652">They scream and they sing and they’re not civilized.</span> <span id="s1653">They’re not civilized!</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: You’ve been to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: Oh, yes, many times.</span> <span id="s1656">I was in school in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: But after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: No, I was in Munich in ’47 when the JDC asked me to go, but then I went from D.P. camp to D.P. camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: But other than that you haven’t been back since?</span> <span id="s1660">You wouldn’t go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: We were in Salzburg, in Austria, five or six years ago.</span> <span id="s1662">We stayed in Salzburg for about a week and we did an awful lot of sightseeing around it, and one day my sister and I were driving and we wanted to go to a certain mountain resort that’s fabulous to see and there was no way unless we would have spent the whole day driving to get there, and we couldn’t even come back that night.</span> <span id="s1663">There was no way of avoiding to cross a little corner of Germany and all of a sudden my husband looks at the road and he sees a sign, “Berchtesgaden.”</span> <span id="s1664">He looks at us and he says, “What are you doing?</span> <span id="s1665">You mean we are in Berchtesgaden?”</span> <span id="s1666">And we say we are not now; we are just passing through to get back here, instead of going like this, which would have been a tremendous amount of driving.</span> <span id="s1667">He didn’t allow us to stop, nothing.</span> <span id="s1668">I would have liked to take the bus and go on to the top, because they don’t let you drive to the top.</span> <span id="s1669">You can drive your car to a platform and there they take you by bus to the “Eagle’s Nest” up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Hitler’s retreat, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Would you say your belief in Judaism or in God has changed because of the things that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: No.</span> <span id="s1673">I have always been a fatalist.</span> <span id="s1674">I feel the way I always did.</span> <span id="s1675">I feel that what I am, I am, and I am proud of what I am, but I would never make any big fuss about it, by saying I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s1676">I think that any Christian is as good as I am, and what I am, I want to be.</span> <span id="s1677">My belief as a youngster, when I used to go to Temple regularly and I used to sing in the choir for all the High Holidays, I’m the same way today with Temple.</span> <span id="s1678">I have always believed that there is someone, there is some protection.</span> <span id="s1679">I got it about ten days ago; I almost got killed in my car.</span> <span id="s1680">Rosalind said to me, “Mother, there was somebody above.”</span> <span id="s1681">I didn’t see it; there was an arrow that I had to wait to make a left turn, it was green and I turned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: Be careful of those things.</span> <span id="s1683">Do you read books about the Holocaust or see movies about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1685">I refuse to see Shoah.</span> <span id="s1686">I just won’t.</span> <span id="s1687">I know all that by heart, I know everything that happened, I lived it.</span> <span id="s1688">I have been involved so much with the ones who got back, and that we tried to rehabilitate, to put back on their feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: But do you think these should exist for other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1691">I understand that Shoah is absolutely a “must.”</span> <span id="s1692">You don’t think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: It’s not my interview.</span> <span id="s1694">We’ll talk about it afterwards.</span> <span id="s1695">It’s interesting who is going to see it.</span> <span id="s1696">I think a lot of non-Jews are seeing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: That’s what I hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: Do you have any photos, mementos, anything that you would be willing to share with us if we put up an exhibit?</span> <span id="s1699">Do you have any photos from pre-war, during the war and immediately after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: I have pictures from the Chambon, for instance, with the kids there, and pre-war I have a lot of pictures.</span> <span id="s1701">But so much of my stuff is in Palm Springs.</span> <span id="s1702">There I was able to give them a lot of stuff but I would have to really look there just to find it.</span> <span id="s1703">Here I have tons of clippings, but tons.</span> <span id="s1704">I was just looking last night into a big basket that I have, and I couldn’t remember what was in that big basket.</span> <span id="s1705">It’s all clippings.</span> <span id="s1706">There’s one that I just found from the St. Louis Jewish World from 1960.</span> <span id="s1707">I think that my photo album where I have the Chambon pictures are here, because I one day showed them to Nelly (Nelly Trocme Blackburn Hewett).</span> <span id="s1708">I think they’re here.</span> <span id="s1709">I’ll have to look.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: That would be wonderful, if we could have something like that, perhaps, in the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: I’m sure I have a picture of the children with their father, the last pictures that were taken,</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: It’s as though you’ve lived two lives, in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: (Laughs) Even more than two lives.</span> <span id="s1714">It’s very strange; I’ve never been understood by anybody in France, about my involvement here.</span> <span id="s1715">They don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1716">They can’t understand that I should be involved with the Jews and with the Zionists and with the movement.</span> <span id="s1717">It was very good what we did during the war, but why do you have to go on?</span> <span id="s1718">My own family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: And what do you suppose makes you go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: Nothing would stop me.</span> <span id="s1721">As I said, I don’t think that any of us who’s gone through it and came out of it has a right to stop!</span> <span id="s1722">I’m very unhappy when I don’t do enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: But they don’t feel that way.</span> <span id="s1724">It’s Paulette.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: A lot of them were not there.</span> <span id="s1726">Among the fourteen of us who were together -- I had my brother-in-law, my sister-in-law --they don’t blame me for doing it, but some of them do.</span> <span id="s1727">Some of them think I am nuts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: Perhaps it’s because they went back to Paris.</span> <span id="s1729">And it was easier for them to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: All they did was to leave the countryside to go back home.</span> <span id="s1731">In France you never felt the need to assert yourself as a Jew, in my time.</span> <span id="s1732">People will say to me, well, what about the Dreyfus affair?</span> <span id="s1733">I said, “Now wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1734">The Dreyfus affair happened at the turn of the century.</span> <span id="s1735">The people who were involved in it, all the French population, felt a terrible sense of guilt.</span> <span id="s1736">But terrible.</span> <span id="s1737">After the whole thing cleared up, after Zola and after everything, they felt terribly guilty.”</span> <span id="s1738">And my generation benefited from that.</span> <span id="s1739">You see, I never had any feeling of anti-Semitism, I was never called a dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s1740">I never heard that I was different because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1741">Never!</span> <span id="s1742">I had a life absolutely exempted from any of that.</span> <span id="s1743">And so when the war broke out and when the occupation took place, to convince me that I was more Jewish than French and that I had something to fear because I was Jewish, I couldn’t!</span> <span id="s1744">It’s very strange!</span> <span id="s1745">The people who like my parents lived the Dreyfus affair, and lived before it, will say the year of the Dreyfus affair was really rough for the Jews, because they were in the hands of the Action Francaise, the French Action, that was headed by Moros, who was a vicious anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s1746">And my parents, of course, always felt it.</span> <span id="s1747">But as far as we were concerned -- we had a very Jewish name -- I had as many non-Jewish friends as Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s1748">There was no such thing as just being among Jews.</span> <span id="s1749">Why should you only have Jewish friends?</span> <span id="s1750">We had a much more broader kind of experience in life, than to be centered among just our own.</span> <span id="s1751">And even today I’m much happier in a non-sectarian club.</span> <span id="s1752">In Palm Springs we live in a club which is maybe 60-40 or something like this.</span> <span id="s1753">I feel that this is better.</span> <span id="s1754">It’s more normal.</span> <span id="s1755">Why should you only be with the people who feel the way you do and think the way you do?</span> <span id="s1756">You don’t get any broader perspective that way.</span> <span id="s1757">You can’t.</span> <span id="s1758">But here you have to defend yourself much more.</span> <span id="s1759">You see, I never felt the need for defending myself.</span> <span id="s1760">When I came here for the first time and I was told that there were certain areas where the Jews could not build a house and there were clubs where you Jews could not belong and there was a quota in university and colleges, I never heard of that.</span> <span id="s1761">In France, if you have the means to belong to a club, and you have two sponsors, you belong.</span> <span id="s1762">Nobody asks you what church you belong to.</span> <span id="s1763">I mean, it was unbelievable to me.</span> <span id="s1764">It might very well change.</span> <span id="s1765">Who knows?</span> <span id="s1766">Today the world is so full of racial hatred in spite of so-called programs that was made.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: I know Francelyne is married and lives here in Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: And Nadine lives in Boston.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: And how many children do they each have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: Nadine has two boys and Francelyne six children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: So you have a lot of grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: We have seventeen altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: When I’m interviewing someone, I usually say at the end, “What did I forget to ask you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: Well, I expected that we could go on in a lot of directions, but I think that the most important thing is to carry the message to whoever -- and I don’t care who it is -- who has really felt the pressure and the prejudice that we lived through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">PAGE 13</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">PAGE 13</span></p></body></html>
