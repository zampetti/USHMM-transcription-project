forbid them?
Nothing . They just forbid it.

When was the first time you were picked up?
1939. They put us in jail. Then to a prison. Then to a
concentration camp.

Did they keep Jehovah Witnesses together? Yes. There were only
three of us.
So it was a very small group? Yes.
Were you able to have Bible discussion?
Yes. We could preach in the concentration camp in France. Nobody paid any attention. We were persecuted because we would not salute the French flag. We were brought to the prison of the concentration camp. They asked why we would not salute the flag, and we said because we were jehovah's Witnesses. There were so many rats I could not stand it. The rats could walk on the corners up the wall about four feet, and then jump.
How long were you in the prison?
It's hard to tell. I think three months. You slept on two pieces of board and we ate only once a day.
How much longer were you in the concentration camp? I don't know.
We were working in a mine.
We were free two months and we were preaching again. Then, they arrested us again and put us in prison. They came and laughed at us. They said we don't exist. We went to a concentration camp in Brussels. After that we went to Holland , I forget the name.
What type of treatment did you receive?
Real severe. Just working. I saw Himmler. He put his hand on my
shoulder.
Did he say anything?
No. He talked to nobody. He just touched you. They took us from Holland in a train. There was no room for lying down.We rode for about a week.There was no bathroom.Then they brought us to
Orani‰nburg/Sachsenhausen.
What was the treatment like?
Police came and everybody sat down. They kicked you and hit you and I saw many get hit. Then we went to the barracks and we were
working.
Did they put numbers on you? No. Not at Sachsenhausen.
Did they take your clothing?
No. We had our clothes from the other concentration camp. Then, we got another uniform with a number and a purple triangle.

The next day. They had big showers and they shaved your head. There were 150-200 people in the barracks. By the end there were three to

They killed people when we were working. There were many jews killed. One guy was killed because he was [digging incorrectly].
Why did they kill them?
I don't know. They needed oil for the trucks and planes. So they would take the human cadavers and burn them to get the oil.
From the human bodies?
Yes. From the human body. They just got the oil from the fat. I don't know if this was true, I just heard this. Or they take people to dig a hole. When the hole was over someone's head they would shoot him and the others would cover it up.

skeletons.
So, people got thinner and thinner? Ya. I worked in a bakery.
How was it that you worked in a bakery I was a bakery. They were looking for Jehovah's witnesses for bakers. I distributed bread for S-men and prisoners. It was a terrible job. The S-men would ask for more bread and you could not give it. It was a terrible job.
What type of food did you make in the bakery? Just bread.
What were other groups besides Jehovah~s Witnesses and Jews?
Yes. Russians and Germans. Criminals. There were many different types of people there.
How did they treat the soldiers from Russia?
I don't know. They were skeletons. The S-men would say, "Come here", so I would go there to him. He could knock me down, beat me, then say"Go back", and then "Come again".
What was the most unusual thing you witnessed while you were there?
I saw people put on a roof and made to sweat, then they threw you on the concrete---15-20 feet down.
What about the stones?
What stones? [someone else talking] Oh yes.
Many prisoners, if they did something wrong had to take off their shoes and run on stones. Then, they would be shot.
Did you see anyone executed?
I saw many who were executed There would be three or four soldiers with machine guns. You would hear a cry and someone would fall.
Then an officer would walk over and shoot them in the head.
How many people a night would you say died in the barracks? I don't know. I never counted.
So, you had someone die every day?
Yes. After that we had the death march. When the Russians were approaching and the Americans were approaching. The S-men were afraid to be captured by the Russians. They wanted to be captured by the Americans. Also, they cut their hair and put on the same suit that we had.
