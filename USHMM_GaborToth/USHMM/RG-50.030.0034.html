id="s17">Will you tell me your full name please?</span> <span id="s18">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s19">My name is Regina Bomba, from home, Hamburger</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Where uh when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: I was born in Poland, Lódz, on the 5th of June, 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Will you tell me, Regina, what happened to you, please, when the Nazis came in to Lódz?</span> <span id="s23">01:00:33</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s25">When the Nazis came into Lódz, we were still on this place, a summer home.</span> <span id="s26">It was name Wísniowa Góra, and we decided that we going to go back home to the city.</span> <span id="s27">When we got into the city, our home was taken away by the Nazis, so we stayed in a house of a brother of ours, of my oldest brother, Rubin (ph), who at that time was in the Polish army fighting in Warsaw and his wife and a six-month old baby was with us.</span> <span id="s28">And after that we stayed with my brother in my brother's house, and I'm not going to say how it happened that my brother came home from the army and he took his wife and a six-month old baby and he said he wants to go to Soviet Russia.</span> <span id="s29">That's the only place he said where the Jews could survive, and he went.</span> <span id="s30">My father, my mother, my sister and one brother, sister younger one, a brother older one than me that were staying in this house until March 1940, 10th of March 1940 when the Gestapo came into the house.</span> <span id="s31">We thought that we're going to go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s32">They already made it for the Jews, the ghetto.</span> <span id="s33">They took everyday from certain streets to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s34">The fact that my mother had a sis...a brother in the ghetto and he said uh bring every...all the stuff here because when you're going to go, all you can do take is a valise.</span> <span id="s35">This way bring over stuff to me and when you come to the ghetto you'll have everything.</span> <span id="s36">So that's what we did.</span> <span id="s37">When the the Nazis came in to take us down...it was during the night...one o'clock at night...my mother forget that she went down in the house shoes.</span> <span id="s38">And we went down...we thought we're going to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s39">And we said alright.</span> <span id="s40">We're going to have everything over there in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s41">For us the soldier said wouldn't you let me go back.</span> <span id="s42">My mother is cold and she would like to have some shoes.</span> <span id="s43">He said oh, it's going to be soon summer.</span> <span id="s44">You can go barefoot.</span> <span id="s45">She can go barefooted.</span> <span id="s46">So instead to the ghetto, they took us to a place and they told us that we're going to be going out from the city.</span> <span id="s47">They took away our money, our possessions.</span> <span id="s48">They took off a ring from my mother...she had a fat finger...and they couldn't take it off...with the flesh and they sent us to a small town near Czestochowa named Nowo Radomsko and they put us in a burned synagogue.</span> <span id="s49">That town that town Radomsko was</span></p> <p><span id="s50">1 maiden name bombarded very, very badly and they had already a ghetto over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">01:03:11 But I must say the Jews from the town, especial there was a man named Burger (ph)...he was the oldest from the town and he brought some food special for the children.</span> <span id="s52">I still have my little sister...was a still a small little girl and uh I always....I younger...I always looked older, and my mother said, well, we have to do something to make something to eat.</span> <span id="s53">What we going to do?</span> <span id="s54">My mother was washing floors for people, because my father got ill right away when...he was a very delicate man, long, very tall, and uh from the nature he was not...my mother was the stronger one, for everything for father, and he...from the beginning he said right away I don't want to live.</span> <span id="s55">I cannot live like this, and I don't want to live.</span> <span id="s56">From mine...seven children I brought up, from my home, for everything what I worked, I'm here in a burnt synagogue and strolling and a (indecipherable), and on the top of it, his foot got very swollen and very ill.</span> <span id="s57">So we decided that...there was no hospital, no Jewish hospital and in the Polish hospital, Jews were not allowed.</span> <span id="s58">In Czestochowa was a Jewish hospital, so we hired a Polish (indecipherable)...a Polish...that was a horse and carriage.</span> <span id="s59">Called in a Polish (indecipherable), a horse and carriage and we...I took my father and we went to Czestochowa and there we arrived in the Jewish hospital in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s60">That's the time that I came...the first time in my life to Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s61">My mother was behind in that synagogue with my sister and my brother and I decided...my father was out out of the hospital...how...where is he going to go back to that burnt synagogue, so I was looking around a way to to remain in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s62">I had 50 Polish zloty...what the Germans give...I took away...we...our Polish...our town in Lódz belonged to the 3rd Reich, Litzmannstadt they called it.</span> <span id="s63">So I..</span> <span id="s64">.</span> <span id="s65">and that Poland and Czestochowa was Protectorate for us for that's where they give us the Polish money, so with that money I rented an apar...uh a room by a family, and I brought over my sister and my brother and my mother so we stayed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">01:05:27 In 1942 I said I'm going to make a brief...before Yom Kippur, and that's the first time of our life that comes this kind of a holiday.</span> <span id="s67">The saddest time of my life.</span> <span id="s68">I guess all the lives from Czestochowa Jews, and maybe for other towns, that was a day that their Gestapo came and they took out the people for the liquidations.</span> <span id="s69">They call it the akti...the aktions.</span> <span id="s70">I don't know how it is...akt...aktion... aktion in Polish.</span> <span id="s71">And before that all it was the holidays and they took out from the ghetto and made another ghetto, so we did not have an apartment.</span> <span id="s72">We were the refugees so we didn't know so many Czestochowans, people...so many...you know, that protects you, how you say, that we should get an apartment.</span> <span id="s73">So the (indecipherable) rabbi from Radomsko invited my father with his family for the holidays, and I was left behind to wait for an apartment, so they went and I was left behind.</span> <span id="s74">I stayed there for a little while and I said no...I am going also going there, so I went back to Radomsko, just for a few days.</span> <span id="s75">Stayed with them and then I decided since I don't look so Jewish, I am going to go back on the train and I went into the train, bought a ticket, and I went back to Czestochowa to wait for the apartment.</span> <span id="s76">In meantime in Radomsko was judenrein...you know what that means, judenrein.</span> <span id="s77">Clean of the Jews.</span> <span id="s78">Only a few I think were left behind because two of them came back, two sisters.</span> <span id="s79">They came back to Czestochowa later on, in a bunker.</span> <span id="s80">They were hid in a bunker.</span> <span id="s81">And I stayed there...I met a fellow in that hospital while my father was laying there in the hospital, and he took me into his house...he had a father and a mother and a sister, but the mother said it's not nice that a girl should stay in the same house, one room, with a fellow, so they decided that I should get married to him.</span> <span id="s82">He was much older than I was.</span> <span id="s83">He was fifteen years older.</span> <span id="s84">I got married by myself, and I even...somebody borrowed me a little veil and a dress and I got married, and if you don't want to have children, then you have them sometimes, and I become pregnant.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">01:07:54 I called up my mother and I told her about it.</span> <span id="s86">It was May 15, 1942.</span> <span id="s87">And I told her, and she said I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s88">I would like to come, but I can't because we....they were not allowed, the Jewish people, to travel and that was the last time I spoke to my mother.</span> <span id="s89">I spoke to her by telephone through the Jewish komitet in Nowo Radomsko and in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s90">Now after that, my husband was working in a hospital, in that hospital in Czestochowa, so he took me into that hospital.</span> <span id="s91">His parents were sent away with the whole family, sisters, two sisters and a niece and his parents, and we stayed behind.</span> <span id="s92">After that we were...I was washing the bloody wash from the people.</span> <span id="s93">I didn't know what else to do but I wanted to help.</span> <span id="s94">They left us for the next ones to go.</span> <span id="s95">After that they send us to a factory.</span> <span id="s96">The factory was named Factory Iskovitch (ph), and across the street was another factory...I don't know the name...where my husband was near the factory.</span> <span id="s97">All of a sudden when I was in the factory...I hadn't mentioned his name.</span> <span id="s98">His name was Shlomo Muskovitch (ph).</span> <span id="s99">And somebody say hey, Muskovitch (ph) is outside, and I looked it out and I saw him taking his rucksack and his head down...he didn't see me.</span> <span id="s100">I saw him through the window, and that's the last time I saw him.</span> <span id="s101">They were shipped to Treblinka because they needed another hundred men for the transport, so this they sent him away.</span> <span id="s102">And here I came into the ghetto...they sent us to a small ghetto and pregnant, alone, not from a strange town, without any family, without nobody.</span> <span id="s103">So everybody was making groups to take a room in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s104">It was rooms in the ho...in houses.</span> <span id="s105">That's what they give us...a few streets, and uh I was sitting outside on my rucksack and my things...I took a few things because I was thinking we weren't going to have some place the baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">01:10:04 In fact the doctor wanted to make an abortion right away.</span> <span id="s107">And I said what, my father would...he was a religious man.</span> <span id="s108">That would be the worst thing that anybody could have done.</span> <span id="s109">It's a sin.</span> <span id="s110">So I didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s111">But by the time we came to the ghetto, by the time think it was late...so we were in...eight people in one room and there was a wo...a lady...at that time to me she was an older lady.</span> <span id="s112">Maybe she was forty-five years old and she had a daughter my age and she said, believe me, Regina, you'll see...make an abortion.</span> <span id="s113">Otherwise you're not going to live because she said you're young.</span> <span id="s114">You'll get married again.</span> <span id="s115">You'll have children.</span> <span id="s116">And I went to one doctor to make an abortion.</span> <span id="s117">He he wouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s118">He thought it's too late.</span> <span id="s119">Then we went to another doctor.</span> <span id="s120">I even remember her name...her name was Dr.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Grunwald (ph), a woman doctor.</span> <span id="s122">In middle of abortion, she said I think you're going to die...the head is so big.</span> <span id="s123">You are very far...you must be having the fifth month already.</span> <span id="s124">I said yes I am.</span> <span id="s125">She said why I didn't ask you any questions.</span> <span id="s126">She said I've assumed that you're in the beginning.</span> <span id="s127">I didn't...I didn't show so much.</span> <span id="s128">I'm I'm tall, so I didn't show so much.</span> <span id="s129">I said no, I I..</span> <span id="s130">.</span> <span id="s131">you didn't ask me what it is.</span> <span id="s132">And she said well...and the abortion was made on a small, tiny table, holding my own legs because there was no hospital or anything, and of course we they didn't want to wait any longer because it was pretty late and I listened to that older lady, what she said.</span> <span id="s133">She said if you don't go and make an abortion now, a little bit soon it's going to show and then they're going to send you away for the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s134">We want you to live, and that's what happened.</span> <span id="s135">I had an abortion and I was...after that had to go to work, bleeding, and go to work and I was working and uh after one year they made another ghetto.</span> <span id="s136">They made three streets.</span> <span id="s137">The young, the girls that we had no husbands like me, the men, and married couples where they also had a street, so there were three streets.</span> <span id="s138">Everything in Czestochowa in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s139">We were going out to work.</span> <span id="s140">What happened...a lot of things what with my husband even said I was listening there about uh that uh Vislovich (ph) that they killed him laying right before my feet.</span> <span id="s141">But like I said, we're going to make it short.</span> <span id="s142">They sent us to this...I was working in a place named HASAG.</span> <span id="s143">I worked...got up in the morning, five o'clock appel.</span> <span id="s144">Seven o'clock we went to work and seven o'clock we returned, and we worked there until June 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">01:12:51 That day we didn't go back to the ghetto anymore.</span> <span id="s146">We prepared to go back to the ghetto like every day and all of a sudden and to this day I don't know how that happened...all of a sudden we looked around by the gate of going out from that HASAG, from the factory...it took us an hour to walk to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s147">All of a sudden thousands of Ukrainians with their machine guns to us and from where they come from until this day I don't know how that happened so quick and they said, halt.</span> <span id="s148">And a table was put up and at that table went up a man...he was some kind of director from that factory and he said...this this was exactly his words, because I was there: "In eure gewesenem Lager geht ihr nie mehr gurück."</span> <span id="s149">That means in the ghetto you don't go never back again.</span> <span id="s150">You're going to stay here until we're going to let us live.</span> <span id="s151">That was exactly his words.</span> <span id="s152">Women were fainting because they had children, mothers...the ghetto still had, you know, a lot of people and I had...knew Abraham...I had him and I (inaudible).</span> <span id="s153">What I'm going do?</span> <span id="s154">So my uh two cousins of mine, two sisters...there were three but one of the sisters was working by sor...sorting buttons from the people from the stores who left behind, so they had a thing, the job was to put buttons to buttons.</span> <span id="s155">They found a sock with buttons for a Pole...for a Polish man, and he said that the people from the Garibaldiego street where they working with the buttons, they give him the buttons.</span> <span id="s156">So they took my cousin, a first cousin, my mother's sister's daughter...the two sisters have survived.</span> <span id="s157">They're here in too in America and living in New York, and took her...her name was the beautiful Paula.</span> <span id="s158">She was such a beautiful girl...I I cannot ex...there's pictures 2 Hugo Schneider Aktiengesellschaft-Metalwarenfabrik, Leipzig from her too.</span> <span id="s159">The sisters have pictures from her, and they took her and other eight people, nine, and a child nine year old because there was a couple with a child...and other seven...nine people.</span> <span id="s160">They took them to the cemetery and they put a ditch and they killed them and she had a ring and she had a little uh how you call it...a chain, a golden chain, and there was a German standing and he said she was so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off of her, and she said listen.</span> <span id="s161">You're looking at me.</span> <span id="s162">Do me a favor.</span> <span id="s163">I have two sisters in that factory HASAG.</span> <span id="s164">Could you give this to my sisters?</span> <span id="s165">I'll give you their name, and he came back and he gave it to them.</span> <span id="s166">They still have this.</span> <span id="s167">My husband saw this girl...you ask my husband what a beautiful girl she was and uh we we come in and he came on the table and he told us that we don't go no more to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s168">My cousins said to me, the two sisters said you talk pretty good German.</span> <span id="s169">Why don't you ask him what's going to happen to the people in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">01:15:53 From nature I am not a shy person like my husband.</span> <span id="s171">I walked over to him and I got my courage and I said I would like to ask you, do me a favor.</span> <span id="s172">Please Mr., what's going to happen to the people in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s173">He said they're going to come tomorrow to that to that place here.</span> <span id="s174">For a minute we were very happy that that he said that but we didn't know.</span> <span id="s175">The next day...Abraham came and another couple of people came...I don't know how many exactly but quite a few young people came in.</span> <span id="s176">Was no children, not older people, plenty of young people didn't come in.</span> <span id="s177">When I left that day in the morning...I saw Abraham at night and I told him, Abraham, you know I had a pair of earrings of my grandmother's put it on on me when I was only three days old.</span> <span id="s178">I said I'm going to give you these earrings.</span> <span id="s179">It's very dear to me, and I had a watch and I had a wedding band and I had pictures.</span> <span id="s180">That was the most important for my family, a lot of pictures and he...I said I'll leave this with you after and you take care.</span> <span id="s181">He said oh, of course I'm going to take care of that, but when they took them out from the ghetto to the to the uh market place, they told them to put all their valuables...they didn't know they're not going to go back, so everything was left in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">01:17:07 But I was so happy and pleased and that he came to the place, and we told him look, they made a place for all the women, one on top of the other, and a place for the men.</span> <span id="s183">And then they stopped making barracks and they made for about...we were about six hundred in each barrack and what I wanted to tell you that the police...my husband mentioned it already...that the police were taken with hammers over the heads, knocking them down and then taking them to the cemetery for burial, and the wife of one policeman...her name is Mrs. Kohn (ph).</span> <span id="s184">She lives now I believe now in Israel.</span> <span id="s185">She was left alone with a young baby sixteen months old.</span> <span id="s186">Her name, his name was David.</span> <span id="s187">We called him Doodoo (ph), and she came in to that HASAG, in that factory with him.</span> <span id="s188">She put him in a sack, give him a sleeping pill, put him in a sack, and how shocked she was, and she brought him over.</span> <span id="s189">But later on when she sit down on the chair, in that HASAG, she could not talk and she was like you know not herself.</span> <span id="s190">She didn't know she had a child, like you call it crazy.</span> <span id="s191">Mishkoiradich (ph).</span> <span id="s192">Regardless of how you say it in English, like like...not like crazy running around but quiet, very quiet.</span> <span id="s193">We had a doctor and he said that nothing he can do for her, so we gave her a broom in her hand and that she is the one who cleans the barracks and that...with that broom she was sitting all the time in those barracks.</span> <span id="s194">What we going to do with the child?</span> <span id="s195">We made it a little bunker on the bottom under mine where I was sleeping on the first one.</span> <span id="s196">Then there were three like the bunk beds, and this child they made it a little draw...drawer...door and inside they made for him a little bed.</span> <span id="s197">He got very tiny and he didn't grow and he was there.</span> <span id="s198">Whatever we could, you know...everybody from us gave him a little tiny whatever we got from bread or a spoon of soup.</span> <span id="s199">We had enough.</span> <span id="s200">He was so smart and so quiet.</span> <span id="s201">He didn't show himself.</span> <span id="s202">He didn't...he knew when he saw Nazis or Germans, he knew.</span> <span id="s203">He run away.</span> <span id="s204">Opened like a little door and ran in there, and one day he couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s205">That Nazi saw him and they called the...Mr. Kurlon (ph) I think was the man from the Jewish uh elders and he called him and he said what's this.</span> <span id="s206">He said listen.</span> <span id="s207">I lost my family but I cannot, I couldn't have the heart to give this child.</span> <span id="s208">I'll do with him whatever you like.</span> <span id="s209">He said you know what.</span> <span id="s210">Give him a portion bread and a soup.</span> <span id="s211">Let him stay.</span> <span id="s212">You know, it...like who knows tomorrow what's going to be with all of you, and would you believe it or not, he stayed with us until 1945 when we were liberated.</span> <span id="s213">The only child.</span> <span id="s214">He didn't grow.</span> <span id="s215">He's in Israel today.</span> <span id="s216">Uh his father had a brother there in Israel and she's met...she's married.</span> <span id="s217">She got well in Israel and she got married.</span> <span id="s218">I don't know exactly how at this moment it is with them.</span> <span id="s219">You're not interested in everyone but this is the episode that I wanted to tell you that I thought it was interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">01:20:11 We stayed in that HASAG.</span> <span id="s221">I was working very, very hard.</span> <span id="s222">I was working so hard because they took away...every time a couple of hundred of people and they send them to the Auschwitz or Tre...I don't know wherever they sent them away from us.</span> <span id="s223">We didn't know exactly where they were sending people, so like I had one machine...we were making ammunitions.</span> <span id="s224">Then I had to have three machines, so if one machine made Schmelz...Schmelz means when the Rohstoffdid not come out too good, so he...it was punishment, so I I I couldn't be at once on all the three machines, that was for three people.</span> <span id="s225">Abe called me I'm a dancer, I'm dancing from one machine to the other, and at the top of it they made it very hard for us.</span> <span id="s226">Why?</span> <span id="s227">We used to take the Rohstoff, put it in a very high, big machine inside and that machine was going this way and it came out at once in a big box, the Rohstoff, and this was only uh we called it MatrizenThat means that the the bullet goes in 3 in a stupor (Yiddish) 4 melted metal (German) 5 raw material (German) 6 mold (German) in that.</span> <span id="s228">I don't know how you call it in English.</span> <span id="s229">We call it in German the Matrizen.</span> <span id="s230">And the bullet goes in in that.</span> <span id="s231">The bullet was a different place where people were working.</span> <span id="s232">So one day I had Schmelz down but the work was not done.</span> <span id="s233">He said why did you do that?</span> <span id="s234">I didn't do it, nothing.</span> <span id="s235">I said I have for this machine then that happened.</span> <span id="s236">You've got to call up Heinrich (ph).</span> <span id="s237">That means the man who's fixing the machine.</span> <span id="s238">I said I did but I couldn't do it while I was on this machine, so I got 'strafe...punishment.</span> <span id="s239">Punishment...it was my twelve hours work regular.</span> <span id="s240">The other twelve hours was the 'strafe and then it was again my time to work and it was at night time.</span> <span id="s241">For thirty-six hours without nothing, eating, standing what we got to eat, so I was so tired so I sit down.</span> <span id="s242">I don't know a German walked over... where he got such a foot I don't know.</span> <span id="s243">I was not such a little girl.</span> <span id="s244">I'm tall.</span> <span id="s245">He picked me up with his foot and he he...I I got up, with his foot, while I'm sitting and eating.</span> <span id="s246">I'm not going to tell you how many times we got beaten up for things that was...a minimum we got beaten up.</span> <span id="s247">As long as we were not shot, and then on the top we had a very bad time.</span> <span id="s248">What happened?</span> <span id="s249">There was another camp uh Skarzysko.</span> <span id="s250">They had liquidated that camp and they sent the people to our camp in that HASAG in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s251">With them came the Meisters.</span> <span id="s252">Means the the German Herrschaft.</span> <span id="s253">They came and they were the...if ours were very bad, theirs were ten time worst.</span> <span id="s254">They didn't talk.</span> <span id="s255">They went with the guns like that.</span> <span id="s256">There was special one man...his name is so good for him...his name was Bartenschlagerand he had...he didn't go...he didn't talk to nobody.</span> <span id="s257">If he did see something he didn't like it, he shot you.</span> <span id="s258">And I had the pleasure once to see him next to my machine.</span> <span id="s259">I figured that seven o'clock we're finishing and at five to seven I made my accord everything was finished.</span> <span id="s260">Five minutes before I'm going to clean up my machines.</span> <span id="s261">Everything had to be spotless.</span> <span id="s262">They're very clean, the Germans.</span> <span id="s263">That that you can't take away from them.</span> <span id="s264">I cleaned up my machine and he came over and he said, "Wieviel spät ist es?"</span> <span id="s265">What time is it now?</span> <span id="s266">And I said, Herr Meister.</span> <span id="s267">Seven.</span> <span id="s268">He said seven?</span> <span id="s269">He looked at the watch and it was just maybe a quarter second after seven.</span> <span id="s270">He hold that gun, "Pass' mal auf.</span> <span id="s271">"Because he saw my machine was clean already, and I was so lucky that he didn't shot me.</span> <span id="s272">He must have liked my face.</span> <span id="s273">I don't know, because he didn't do...he didn't talk.</span> <span id="s274">He'd have shot right away.</span> <span id="s275">That was another luck I had.</span> <span id="s276">And then again, I had a cousin and she was working in a place named Augenschein (ph).</span> <span id="s277">That was the bullets...they had to make the bullets so nice and so clean cause any tiny little scratch, the bullet doesn't shoot out, so it had to be done very...and she was a very beautiful girl, a face like a doll, with with big lashes but when she looked up the lashes went until here and if you looked down the lashes went until here.</span> <span id="s278">So she couldn't see so good.</span> <span id="s279">Every day she went...there was Wache There was a Wache...but the Germans took you.</span> <span id="s280">Somebody signed it for you and the Ukrainians beat...resumed the beating on the behind.</span> <span id="s281">They take off everything.</span> <span id="s282">Bend down 7 control, mastery (German) 8 Bartenschlager, Georg, SS# 77325.</span> <span id="s283">Sources: Berlin

one thing.</span> <span id="s288">It didn't do to me, but it did it such a thing to me that I'll never forget as long as I live.</span> <span id="s289">There were five brothers Leibermann (ph).</span> <span id="s290">Four of them survived.</span> <span id="s291">I don't know if you ever heard of them.</span> <span id="s292">You did?</span> <span id="s293">And one took away...I don't know if he...from where he had a piece of leather because those those big belts from the machine, it was from leather, so he must have, you know, cut off a piece because there was something wrong with it and another piece and they found a piece on one of the brothers.</span> <span id="s294">And they beat the one of the brothers two hundred...he had it...until he died on to under that thing and didn't say it was his brother.</span> <span id="s295">He didn't want...he knew they're going to kill me maybe anyway.</span> <span id="s296">I don't want to to in...implicate my brother.</span> <span id="s297">In fact I had something to do with the liberation of his brothers.</span> <span id="s298">I said something in in like a novi...you know what a novi means...somebody who knows to say it something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s299">What I said in it and the four of them survived.</span> <span id="s300">I always meet them when there's a gathering, uh memorial for the Czestochowa people.</span> <span id="s301">We're always there so we always meet.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: You...</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yeah, and that was... Q: ...slow down a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s305">No, it's OK.</span> <span id="s306">I I can go on.</span> <span id="s307">I'm strong.</span> <span id="s308">I can go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: You had a story about the woman who fought with the Nazis?</span> <span id="s310">You had a story about a woman who fought with the Nazis?</span> <span id="s311">Was that interesting?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">01:26:05</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: This girl...you want me to tell you about her.</span> <span id="s314">Yes.</span> <span id="s315">That was uh still when we were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s316">That was not in the HASAG.</span> <span id="s317">We were working in a place named Ausbahn (ph).</span> <span id="s318">Ausbahn (ph) means the the trains were going to...out of the country to like to France or other places, and I remember trains passing by with Jews and there must have been Litvak Jews because they were talking Jewish in Letish (ph)...must be from Latvia some place.</span> <span id="s319">They begged us to give them a little bit snow so the train...while the trains were rolling, not standing, we were making very hard uh balls from snow and throwing.</span> <span id="s320">They were killing each other to get that piece of that snow.</span> <span id="s321">They must have been very very thirsty, and they also asked us where they are and we screamed it's Czestochowa, so I was working...I don't</span></p> <p><span id="s322">11 prophet (Yiddish) know to say that English...but in in German we call this a kilofIt's like a big hammer with a stick that you cut the ice with it, with a spit.</span> <span id="s323">This...I was working like a man and we were cutting the ice from the train, near the train but the train should, you know, could pass by and in the summer we were making uh uh ditches.</span> <span id="s324">So one day we were working by the ditches just like that and that one of the foremens...actually he was from the uh train...a foreman, from train.</span> <span id="s325">He was a tall man.</span> <span id="s326">I believe that man must have been seven feet big.</span> <span id="s327">Such a tall man I never...we had to look up.</span> <span id="s328">I am not so small...had to look up looking like that to see him.</span> <span id="s329">His name was Lajzer (ph).</span> <span id="s330">I don't know the second name...the second name was Lajzer (ph).</span> <span id="s331">I know he had a wife, no children, because she had a home right next to the tracks and she used to take in two blond girls, you know...friends of mine also from Czestochowa, two sisters to warm up a little bit and they...she used to give them socks to mend that they should rest a little bit.</span> <span id="s332">I never had that uh luck to go in there.</span> <span id="s333">I used to go in to the little booth sometime from the uh uh conductors from the train to warm up but they had a fire going and it was bitter cold in January, February, but working outside and we didn't...we were not clothed so uh all of a sudden he he said uh he opened a tent and he took in our...one by one asking questions.</span> <span id="s334">When the people came out, each boys and girls, we asked them what did he say.</span> <span id="s335">What did they want?</span> <span id="s336">They said we're not allowed to say anything, so until I didn't go in I didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s337">When I went in he asked me a question.</span> <span id="s338">He called me by my name Regina.</span> <span id="s339">I don't know.</span> <span id="s340">For some reason he liked me.</span> <span id="s341">He said Regina, you tell me the truth.</span> <span id="s342">I said of course Herr Meister, I'll tell you everything...in German.</span> <span id="s343">He said, did Paula said something about me.</span> <span id="s344">I said oh no.</span> <span id="s345">Never.</span> <span id="s346">You walk with her to the ghetto everyday in five...we were walking five.</span> <span id="s347">I said we're walking every day but she never said one word and the woman was sitting with him was a Jewish woman, and I said to her...Rosa was her name...Rosa, what do you want me...you better tell she said.</span> <span id="s348">I said what do you want me to tell?</span> <span id="s349">I don't know what it's all about.</span> <span id="s350">She said well, they're talking that I am in love with Mr. Lajzer (ph) and that I am have business with him and they took him to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s351">She told me that and that they're making a big uh investigation about him, because this is not allowed.</span> <span id="s352">A Jewish woman with a German is not allowed.</span> <span id="s353">So I said believe me that's the honest truth...and all of a sudden they told me to go out.</span> <span id="s354">When I went out, they called her in.</span> <span id="s355">She was the next one to go in and as she went in, she went out.</span> <span id="s356">That same minute.</span> <span id="s357">And he behind her with a gun, just like that.</span> <span id="s358">Shooting.</span> <span id="s359">And she did like that...and all of a sudden he grabbed her and she grabbed him and they were twisting.</span> <span id="s360">I don't...like I said she was a small woman, not a big woman like me.</span> <span id="s361">A girl, a young girl, maybe sixteen or fifteen.</span> <span id="s362">She throwed him down, that big man, fat man.</span> <span id="s363">He throwed down...she was rolling with him...he was all...his his clothing, you know...the German was full with sand and with mud and she didn't let herself killed.</span> <span id="s364">All of a sudden, like I said...we walked over.</span> <span id="s365">We begged him, and then there was a like man who used to be a neighbor of his in in Germany.</span> <span id="s366">He was sent to the Lódz ghetto, the Litzmannstadt, and then from there to Czestochowa and he walked over to him.</span> <span id="s367">He grabbed him by his arm and he said listen Mr. Lajzer (ph).</span> <span id="s368">You're such a good man.</span> <span id="s369">You've been my neighbor.</span> <span id="s370">Please, you're going to be sorry later on.</span> <span id="s371">She's a young kid.</span> <span id="s372">Maybe she didn't mean it.</span> <span id="s373">Don't kill her, please.</span> <span id="s374">About that time she ran and she ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">12 pickaxe (note: "kilof" not found in German dictionary, rather in Polish dictionary) She ran away very, very fast, far as she could and she walked into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s376">She's all been to a different group from people working also out but they walk into the ghetto and she got in back to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">01:31:03 The next...she had a husband this one young lady.</span> <span id="s378">But she got married a short time before and his name was Stefek (ph).</span> <span id="s379">I don't...cannot remember the second name but my husband has a picture in uh the mountains from his grave because there's massen-gravethere.</span> <span id="s380">They called them they called them twenty-seven at once and he was working in a different place and she took him to this place because he should have easier for him, but at that time she didn't know that she's going to be in love with this.</span> <span id="s381">One thing she did tell me when I asked her...I said your husband is complaining that you're going out to dinner.</span> <span id="s382">Not...I didn't say with Paula.</span> <span id="s383">I said your husband.</span> <span id="s384">And said that you're going out to dinner with a German and he is jealous.</span> <span id="s385">So she walked over and she said to that to that German, you know Herr Meister my husband is eifersüchtig.</span> <span id="s386">That means he is jealous, and and he said no, you pass my love.</span> <span id="s387">I have nothing to do with your wife.</span> <span id="s388">He was very very jealous and she told him that and she didn't think anything, you know, and he didn't think anything, but when we went back to the ghetto and he said Regina, she's not coming home to sleep anymore.</span> <span id="s389">She cannot say that she is not going out with him.</span> <span id="s390">Of course I..</span> <span id="s391">.</span> <span id="s392">my mouth was sealed, not allowed to say anything.</span> <span id="s393">I said oh don't say that.</span> <span id="s394">Maybe she is working with him.</span> <span id="s395">Maybe, you know, there's a lot of things to work...she's a foreman.</span> <span id="s396">She's a Jewish foreman.</span> <span id="s397">All of a sudden when we come back the next day for work, they send us a different job.</span> <span id="s398">He didn't come back, the German, and not did Rosa.</span> <span id="s399">They disappeared, both of them.</span> <span id="s400">What happened...later on when we were working this husband of hers...I remember Stefek (ph)...that I remember.</span> <span id="s401">He was a blonde, fairly young, maybe twenty-five, twenty-four.</span> <span id="s402">Beautiful, good looking, tall and he went to work with another twenty-seven I think or twenty-eight or twenty-seven boys...or men.</span> <span id="s403">The women didn't work on that Saturday or Sunday or Saturday, and he went to work, and that man, that Lajzer (ph)...came and that partisans, a lot of partisans, walked into that group to go into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s404">All they wanted to go into that HASAG.</span> <span id="s405">They needed uh ammunition, so I guess they must have wanted to go in to get some ammunition.</span> <span id="s406">They were taking big risks, and somebody from the Gestapo noticed it, or they were informed from the Polish partisans.</span> <span id="s407">We don't know.</span> <span id="s408">Somebody there informed the Germans that partisans are with this group, and they took that Lajzer (ph), the one that went away with her, with that Rosa, to take out every second to be killed and he took him out too.</span> <span id="s409">That Stefek (ph), and they were all shot and killed and they made a massen-grave in the Jewish cemetery in Czestochowa and when Abraham was now in Poland he took a picture of that grave.</span> <span id="s410">He he knew that I was very interested in him.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">01:34:14 13 mass grave (German: Massengrab) I saw her once.</span> <span id="s412">I saw her once, this woman, after the liberation and then I saw her again a couple of years later.</span> <span id="s413">I saw her first in Poland.</span> <span id="s414">She came back with her seventeen month old child and when we asked her what happened to him, she said he took her to the woods and in the woods, there is like...you know, in Polish they say (indecipherable)...I don't know how we say it in English...a man who takes care in the for the woods, and he was with a wife and he went in there with a gun to his head he said you must take care of her.</span> <span id="s415">She is pregnant, and this is my first child.</span> <span id="s416">I never had children before and I want her to have this child and I want her to be safe, and that's the way they survived in there.</span> <span id="s417">But in 1945 when the Russians liberated that place, that Polish Gayoua (ph) told him who he is.</span> <span id="s418">He knew that he is a Nazi and on the spot they killed him and her with the child...</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: ...the German, her husband, her lover, whatever he was at that time and they send her back and let her go.</span> <span id="s421">She's a Jewish woman with a child.</span> <span id="s422">She come in.</span> <span id="s423">She had a uncle and a aunt.</span> <span id="s424">I lived here and I saw through the window and the uncle lived on this side, and I saw her walking with the baby on the end and then I know very well that that aunt, she still is alive.</span> <span id="s425">The uncle not, but the aunt.</span> <span id="s426">And the second time I saw her was at the IschorThat means when we had the Ischor after our six million departed, she came.</span> <span id="s427">I walked over there and I said like that I am not going to do nothing to you.</span> <span id="s428">I would not even open my hand to touch you because you're too dirty but I'm going to tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s429">Whom do you come to cry for?</span> <span id="s430">For your husband Stefek (ph) or for Lajzer (ph), for the German, and I said you have no right to come here whatsoever.</span> <span id="s431">And my husband says she has two brothers, very nice, fine people and she came from a good family, but that's what she told me during the war.</span> <span id="s432">I'd do anything to survive.</span> <span id="s433">That she did tell me once.</span> <span id="s434">He wants to help me, that she told me.</span> <span id="s435">He wants me to survive.</span> <span id="s436">She was not afraid for me to tell me, but that he's going to kill her husband I don't think that she knew that.</span> <span id="s437">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s438">I don't think she would allow that.</span> <span id="s439">He...he he was really lovely and good looking.</span> <span id="s440">She loved him but I guess she was so...wanted so much to live that she ran away with him.</span> <span id="s441">That that that is what happened.</span> <span id="s442">That's why he wanted to shoot this girl.</span> <span id="s443">That's what I said, but I told...just show you the pictures to show you that that's her I met after so many years and she knew then who I was and she, you know, that all the time we were not eating at that party...it was a New Year's party.</span> <span id="s444">We were just standing together holding hands and talking and she wants to find but her husband said no.</span> <span id="s445">She has in Baltimore a restaurant.</span> <span id="s446">I think she's very well off.</span> <span id="s447">She has one daughter who is married to a very, very nice uh educated man and uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Excuse me...at this point, when...just briefly...when were you liberated?</span> <span id="s449">01:37:17</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: I was liberated in January 16, 1945 in Czestochowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">14 memorial (Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: By then you were married...?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s454">Of course with Abraham, yes.</span> <span id="s455">We were together and like Abraham told you, we ran away from the...the night before.</span> <span id="s456">That was for itself a thing that we could have been killed just like that.</span> <span id="s457">There was Offensive.</span> <span id="s458">The Germans were fighting with the Russians, and wherever we went, the Germans told us don't go here.</span> <span id="s459">They didn't know who you are, when we ran away from the camp.</span> <span id="s460">But they told us to go in a side, over the side.</span> <span id="s461">Then all of a sudden I said to my husband, Abe, if the Nazis did not killed us, they they the bullets are going to kill us.</span> <span id="s462">Let's go in to any place we can, so we went into a place and there was Polish people standing outside and I went over and in Polish...I speak a very good Polish...and I said to them, please, couldn't you let us in just for one night.</span> <span id="s463">We are going home from work and we don't seem...the Nazis don't let us go home, go past.</span> <span id="s464">There were Germans all over tell us to go this way.</span> <span id="s465">So I said you know what?</span> <span id="s466">Go in here, on the ground floor.</span> <span id="s467">There's a Polish woman.</span> <span id="s468">She has only one son and she has a big apartment.</span> <span id="s469">So we did.</span> <span id="s470">I walked in and I said in Polish, "Niech bedzie pochwalony Jezus Chrystus."</span> <span id="s471">It's the truth.</span> <span id="s472">It's the honest truth and I said please, we cannot go home.</span> <span id="s473">Would you...oh she so (inaudible).</span> <span id="s474">She said of course, of course, come in.</span> <span id="s475">In fact she said to me if we're going to have to run, if they're going to bombard our house, you take...grab anything because you don't have anything.</span> <span id="s476">She was sewing on a machine rucksacks, you know, to put in stuff.</span> <span id="s477">She put a lot in stuff and she said you can take something and go.</span> <span id="s478">She gave us something to eat and to drink.</span> <span id="s479">Abe was so frightened with Jewish face that he all the time was holding his head down and like sleeping and uh there was another woman running after us, a blonde woman.</span> <span id="s480">I don't remember her name but she was a blonde, older lady and she was together with us and she went into the same house with us and she was sitting also straight and she looked all the time at my husband, this woman but she didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s481">Uh there was another woman from the sixth floor with a son, a daughter-in-law and a baby a couple of months old.</span> <span id="s482">The son had no hands...Polish people...because in in Warsaw...they were from Warsaw...but the bombardment...the bomb it dropped into the house and cut off both of his hands, so he was normal only he had no hands, so uh I looked at him and she says that she lives on the sixth floor and with a baby that during the bombardment she is afraid to be in the sixth floor.</span> <span id="s483">That's why she came down to that neighbor where we were sitting also.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">01:39:49 About five o'clock in the morning she said she's going to go up and make a bottle for the baby, the older lady, the grandmother, so she went up.</span> <span id="s485">She made a bottle.</span> <span id="s486">She came down with the bottle.</span> <span id="s487">And she said in these words.</span> <span id="s488">In Polish she said there's so many Jews outside on the steps and they're all shivering.</span> <span id="s489">It was cold, in January...such a cold in Poland January...even here in January it's cold in America, but in Poland it is ten times that much colder, and and they didn't have...they were not clothed.</span> <span id="s490">They didn't have too much clothes 15 "May Jesus Christ be blessed."</span> <span id="s491">on and she said this in Polish.</span> <span id="s492">She said maybe people from that concentration camp ran away because the bombardment is like that, so I said to myself let me go out and look on the steps, so I opened the door and I went out on by the first floor and I see people that I was together in the camps.</span> <span id="s493">And I said what happened?</span> <span id="s494">What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s495">She said what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s496">I said well we ran away the night before and we were hiding in this home for the night, and they said we don't know but all of a sudden, about three o'clock in the morning, we didn't see no Germans, so we were afraid because like I said there were (indecipherable) my husband says bombs, it was not bombs.</span> <span id="s497">It was hand grenades in a in a uh cover, a cotton cover.</span> <span id="s498">They were holding hand grenades.</span> <span id="s499">That's what they did in a lot of camps, so when (indecipherable) you poisoned food, so we didn't eat that day and for the hand grenades we were afraid.</span> <span id="s500">That's why me and Abraham went out from the camp.</span> <span id="s501">It wasn't so easy but we we left and uh so so they said we were afraid that they should throw the hand grenades so we ran away, and when we went to the to the gates, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s502">The Germans knew that the Russians are coming, so they ran away, so my...Abe said three o'clock in the afternoon, Abe's sure that the Germans are running to the trains and the trains that are going fast, where they could drop.</span> <span id="s503">I said you know my father said 1914 there happened something like that, 1916, when the war was, you know, that his father told him that the Germans are running up.</span> <span id="s504">The Russians came in, you know, 1st World War...it looks like 1st World War, but the Germans are running away.</span> <span id="s505">But he wasn't sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">01:41:58 Then uh when I saw that I went out and what I saw...I saw...that picture I'll never forget as long as I live either.</span> <span id="s507">I saw Russian tanks coming up to the city, waving to us and we asked them how are you.</span> <span id="s508">Thank God that you liberated us.</span> <span id="s509">They said, "NaBerlin, na Berlin, na Berlin."</span> <span id="s510">They were so happy, so like like not to go for war...like it was a party.</span> <span id="s511">That hit me so hard.</span> <span id="s512">I said my God, look at those young boys how they're running na Berlin.</span> <span id="s513">And I went back to the apartment, and I said to Abraham in Yiddish, KimHe opened his eyes.</span> <span id="s514">He said what what are you saying?</span> <span id="s515">I said baby,the Russians are here.</span> <span id="s516">We are free.</span> <span id="s517">We are liberated.</span> <span id="s518">He said I cannot believe it.</span> <span id="s519">I said believe it, believe it.</span> <span id="s520">And the woman took it up and all of them got up and all went out, but what I still cannot forget, the last minute because she said you don't have too much time but I'll tell you that anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">01:43:00 The Polish woman, the one who had the son without hands, came over and said like that, and the other Polish woman, the the owner from that apartment.</span> <span id="s522">He said what's your name, and I told him.</span> <span id="s523">He said to me, listen to me.</span> <span id="s524">Go to the Holy Mother and the Holy uh Hill...that's the</span></p> <p><span id="s525">16 to (Russian)</span></p> <p><span id="s526">17 Come on Matka Boska Czestochowa...they're coming from all over the world, the Christian people by foot, walking and pray to her because she liberated us because you see when we were liberating this apartment, that place was right nearby.</span> <span id="s527">Abe was now there when...he made a lot of pictures also uh from that place.</span> <span id="s528">That she told me.</span> <span id="s529">And with that we left.</span> <span id="s530">I want to tell you one more thing.</span> <span id="s531">When we left, we didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s532">Nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s533">Nothing to drink.</span> <span id="s534">Nothing to wear.</span> <span id="s535">No place where to go, so we decided that we're going to go and see where is more Jewish people, so we found somebody that my husband took out in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s536">He told you that he had this eyes, like, that didn't want...three times he took him out and said they wouldn't let him out but finally...he still...my husband just saw him.</span> <span id="s537">Of course he's very ill...he's eighty-five, eighty-six years old.</span> <span id="s538">He's in Israel.</span> <span id="s539">He lost a wife and four children but he remarried a couple of times after that.</span> <span id="s540">He lost another two wifes then but he has two sons, very very fine sons.</span> <span id="s541">One is in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s542">The other one has a business in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s543">They're like my own children because their mother was very very dear to me.</span> <span id="s544">She died when one was eleven and one was six.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">01:44:37 And uh when when we went in to her apartment were Christian men that my husband knew, an older couple, and he said...name was Gornik (ph) I think...and he said, oh Abraham, you survived.</span> <span id="s546">Come in to my house, come in.</span> <span id="s547">We went in.</span> <span id="s548">He give us his bed and he gave us food and we eat.</span> <span id="s549">The next morning we looked out to the window and what we saw one KatyúshaI don't know what you name...it was like the bullet small what we made in the camp, that was a big one.</span> <span id="s550">Very very big.</span> <span id="s551">Bright like that and big one like that, very big one.</span> <span id="s552">I never saw such a thing in my life but he's looked at that that Pollack and he said, oh the Germans are coming back.</span> <span id="s553">Out Zydy, Jude.</span> <span id="s554">Jews out.</span> <span id="s555">And he throwed us out.</span> <span id="s556">So he took us in.</span> <span id="s557">He knew Abraham.</span> <span id="s558">We went out and we're walking to a street named Garibaldiego.</span> <span id="s559">And there we met this man that is in Israel I told you...that old man.</span> <span id="s560">He took us in.</span> <span id="s561">The kitchen was only free.</span> <span id="s562">Only the kitchen.</span> <span id="s563">So I had a toothache, all this time in that concentration camp.</span> <span id="s564">After the abortion, that toothache started and I didn't stop after the liberation.</span> <span id="s565">And I was afraid to go to a dentist because we didn't have nobody.</span> <span id="s566">If you go to dentist, they just didn't give injection or just to take out alive, so I was afraid.</span> <span id="s567">So finally Abe said we have to go.</span> <span id="s568">And I went once to the dentist in the concentration camp and it was a woman was then.</span> <span id="s569">She took out a good tooth.</span> <span id="s570">Just like that.</span> <span id="s571">Without anything.</span> <span id="s572">I screamed and that's when the tooth got out, and that tooth was by...I told her...the other tooth.</span> <span id="s573">But exactly maybe I didn't know myself which one, so she took out the good tooth, so that explains.</span> <span id="s574">So my husband goes in the street, and he meets a young man, a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s575">He said I'm a dentist.</span> <span id="s576">Oh my husband...oh my wife has such a bad tooth.</span> <span id="s577">Couldn't you...he said I'm a barber.</span> <span id="s578">I'll cut your hair.</span> <span id="s579">So they made an exchange, and while taking out my tooth...he didn't take out the tooth.</span> <span id="s580">He broke a vein and at night...I'm lost that that two days after the liberation almost all my 18 The picture of the Black Madonna in the Jasna Gora church in Czestochowa 19 lorry-mounted multiple rocket launcher (Russian) blood.</span> <span id="s581">I had uh hemorrhages...and Abe was such a shy man that when I I saw what's going on.</span> <span id="s582">They give me a pail and the pail was full with blood, so I said to him, please call on for the dentist.</span> <span id="s583">I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s584">He figured my God, how can anybody wake somebody out at night.</span> <span id="s585">I said I think I'll never forgive him that, but he did.</span> <span id="s586">Finally a woman called the dentist.</span> <span id="s587">He come back.</span> <span id="s588">He almost killed my husband.</span> <span id="s589">Said why didn't you call me right away.</span> <span id="s590">He give me a tampon and three times that tampax and three times I took that...the fourth time the blood finally stopped, but I was anemic for many, many, many years.</span> <span id="s591">After such a condition I had to lose all all this blood, but little by little we uh...it is another story from 1945 until now which you can write a big book...</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Maybe I should write a book.</span> <span id="s594">Q: Regina, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: You're
