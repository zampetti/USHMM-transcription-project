very intelligent.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: So were your parents hard on him in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yes, because he wasn’t making good grades, and they want him to

id="s365">A: So they decide to send me instead.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s367">And what sort of school was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: It was a Greek school, but we had French, and Latin, Ancient Greek.</span> <span id="s369">And we had to work very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: I liked it, but we had to work hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: It was mainly working, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Was this difficult for you to be away from the house, because you had been so much in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: I know, it -- it was difficult, especially at the beginning, you know.</span> <span id="s376">I always miss them.</span> <span id="s377">I always miss them.</span> <span id="s378">But I thought they were doing the best for me.</span> <span id="s379">I always thought so.</span> <span id="s380">I never put in my mind that they were doing the wrong thing, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: So you wouldn’t criticize them, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Did it help you to become a little bit more independent because you were away?</span> <span id="s384">Was it helpful?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: N -- no, see there -- they followed the Swiss mentality, that we -- they had to keep the children, you know, more in -- in schools, maybe, in boarding schools, things like that.</span> <span id="s386">And str -- strange with it -- I mean being -- not being soft.</span> <span id="s387">See, I used to get in my window in -- in Drama and look outside.</span> <span id="s388">And I used to see boys or girls, you know, with no shoes because they were poor, walking in the rain.</span> <span id="s389">And I used to be to -- envy them that they were free, and I didn’t have that freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: And you didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s391">Even though you knew they were probably poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: But they were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: But I -- I didn’t know what poor was, or anything, you know.</span> <span id="s395">And see, the thing with me is I used to read also Russian, la -- you know, when -- the fall of the communist, those Russian.</span> <span id="s396">And they didn’t have a good -- they didn’t talk well about their -- the poor, they thought they were peasants.</span> <span id="s397">They didn’t have manners, they didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s398">They [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s399">And I started thinking like them, and now when I think of myself, I’m -- I’m -- you know, I feel bad about it, because if we didn’t have that -- all these people, that they work so hard, a-and they were good, and everything, you know, we wouldn’t have the things that we have today.</span> <span id="s400">It’s because of them that we live better.</span> <span id="s401">And only when I came here, and I was living the way I wanted to live, you know, but I started thinking, poor -- poor people, you know, working on the streets with this heat, and every -- how they can manage?</span> <span id="s402">And what I’m doing?</span> <span id="s403">Nothing, in comparison with them.</span> <span id="s404">You know?</span> <span id="s405">And I started feeling different about people.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: I didn’t know them wh-while I was at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: I di -- I knew only their friends, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: And the children of those friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: So it was a very small society that you were a part of.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Right, because I wasn’t free to go outside --</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: -- and meet with other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: And when you went to school, were this -- a mixture of people, or again it was a very rich -- from -- from prominent families of which --</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: From prominent families.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s419">So you lived in --</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: But they -- they were -- in school there were some Jewish people, but in boarding school, especially the first years I was all alone.</span> <span id="s421">I was the only Jewish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: The only Jewish -- and what did that mean?</span> <span id="s423">Was -- was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: But they treated very well, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s427">And their -- the one that owned the school, I mean, I was her favorite, she just loved me.</span> <span id="s428">And everybody in the school, they never showed any anti-Semitism there.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: So you never experienced anti-Semitism as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Only one day in the -- going back at home with the train.</span> <span id="s433">I was sit -- there were some people sitting with me, and they were talking about the Jews.</span> <span id="s434">And of course, not good things.</span> <span id="s435">And -- and I only was listening, and I didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s436">And then finally one of them said to me, “Well, we don’t hear anything from you, you know, what do you think about the Jews?”</span> <span id="s437">“Well,” I said, “you’re looking to one of them.”</span> <span id="s438">And they became all red, you know, and said, “But you’re better than we are.”</span> <span id="s439">See, they were from villa -- not villages, places where they didn’t have any -- they -- they knew nothing about Jews.</span> <span id="s440">Whatever their church will tell them, that we killed Jesus, and we -- they didn’t even know that Jesus was a Jew, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: We’re going to st -- stop and change the tape right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Before -- before we get back to the story, I just wanted you to make clear, when you talked about Spanish, you really were talking about Ladino, am I correct?</span> <span id="s448">A: I found out th-the language here, they -- they said Ladino, in -- in the United States.</span> <span id="s449">In -- in Europe my father used to say the Spanish that they used to speak at that time in -- when -- when we -- the Jews left --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Left in the 15th century.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yeah, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s453">Now, you had particular interests, who -- and one of them -- I’m going to ask you about other ones, but you were interested in design, I understand, fashion.</span> <span id="s454">And you were, as a little girl, di --</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: You know --</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: So tell me what you did, your -- you ha -- somebody came in and they were making clothes for you, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yeah, and a -- how to call it, a seamstress?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: A seamstress, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: And if I didn’t like what she made, I would ex -- tell her, do you think this way will be better, or this way.</span> <span id="s460">You know, can you change it a little bit?</span> <span id="s461">And sometimes she would undo the whole thing, and do it -- so, and that’s how my father thought that probably I have the -- th-this what I would like to be when I grow up, be a designer.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Wa -- was he right, would you have liked that?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I don’t know, because see, after the liberation, things were so --</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Were so different.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: But you --</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: I don’t know, and then I was so involved with the -- the children, and everything --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: -- here see.</span> <span id="s470">I never did the -- and -- this jobs before, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: So I had to learn from the beginning how to do a -- everything.</span> <span id="s473">And it was little bit difficult on me.</span> <span id="s474">And so -- and I -- I was afraid at the time, although that I had my driver’s license, I didn’t drive, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s475">And I - I spent all my time in the -- in the house.</span> <span id="s476">And -- and I liked to do everything from st -- scratch, you know, the food, everything, I didn’t use --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: -- so I spent all the day like this.</span> <span id="s479">And then I couldn’t wait for my children to come, and hug them, kiss them, talk, things what they did and everything.</span> <span id="s480">But unfortunately my worst enemy was the television at the time.</span> <span id="s481">Now, I like it, because otherwise I feel very lonely.</span> <span id="s482">But that time, I-I need to have a conversation with them, and the only time that I -- I wouldn’t let them watch television is when we will sit at the table, then I’ll turn it off.</span> <span id="s483">And that way we had a little time to discuss something.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: As soon as we’ll get out of the table, they’ll all [indecipherable] television.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: They were watching television.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s488">And that was a difficult part.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So -- so when you were growing up, what other interests did you have?</span> <span id="s490">Did -- were there particular interests in school, that you liked one subject better than another, or did -- did you just like everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Well see, I had one year in -- I went at the university in Athens.</span> <span id="s492">And then we had to h-hide, you know, I couldn’t continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: And here I thought that maybe I can become a -- well see, a -- oh, what was this place?</span> <span id="s495">The French -- sometimes my mind stops, I can’t think.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: You’re thinking of a place?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Oh, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Or some [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: It’s somewhere where they teach French.</span> <span id="s500">The school a -- scho -- the Berlitz school of languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: I went there, and -- and I-I had very good time there, teaching, you know, Greek.</span> <span id="s503">And I became friends with some people who lived in River rocks at that time.</span> <span id="s504">River rocks was against -- they didn’t want any Jews around, and she became such a good friend with me, she went to Greece, she wrote me letters from there, and so I-I was very interested.</span> <span id="s505">And see, that’s when I think what my father thought, you know.</span> <span id="s506">The only time that we can be friends with each other is by knowing each other.</span> <span id="s507">See, otherwise -- say this woman ha-had no idea about the Jews, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: And we came such good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: So were -- were you observant as Jews in the house, and you went to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: And -- you did, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: It was just that this was a very private --</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: No, the thing is that we’d -- we didn’t say that we weren’t Jews, they knew we were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: People knew, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: But we didn’t try to -- we tried to connect with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Not too Jewish, ya -- not, you know.</span> <span id="s522">Tried to be modern.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Yes, yes,

like they used to live 3,000 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s529">And did you discuss religion with your friends as you got a little bit older, or was that not a subject that people talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Well, I don’t know if my father discuss any.</span> <span id="s531">I-I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: You

id="s536">Q: No-Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: No.</span> <span id="s538">I didn’t ask them, they didn’t ask me.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: But they knew I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s542">Did you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I never intended to do that, because I was proud, I always was proud being a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s545">Did you go to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Yes, you did,

is.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: And I used to go before, but the pronunciation of the Hebrew was different, and I thought that I -- I had forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: And then the pronunciation changed, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: And was this an Orthodox synagogue that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Beth Usurum was no, not Orthodox, was -- what’s next to Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Conservative.</span></p> <p><span

10 commandments, which are the -- the laws.</span> <span id="s577">I mean, we did that, and people should be thankful to us for many things.</span> <span id="s578">And the Greeks, that poem, he is thankful because we don’t have any more the -- so many go -- gods, you know, that they believe in, and the -- the Romans too, the same.</span> <span id="s579">So it’s more believable, what do we believe, you know, it’s one God, perfect God, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: You didn’t go hiking in the mountains, or skiing, or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: No.</span></p>

<span id="s593">As a matter of fact -- Rinette didn’t bring that picture.</span> <span id="s594">It was a beautiful picnic.</span> <span id="s595">I’m sorry she didn’t.</span> <span id="s596">And it was going to Sofia.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Well anyway, we went to the theater, went to all kinds of --</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: But this is as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Yeah, with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: You’re not going alone anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span

id="s607">This was how you were raised, and this was the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Right.</span> <span id="s609">I thought always they were doing the right thing for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s611">When Hitler takes over in Germany, when the Nazis take over, in 1933, do people get worried?</span> <span id="s612">Does your family get worried?</span> <span id="s613">Do you feel it?</span> <span id="s614">I mean you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Not a -- not as worried as we should.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Because m-my parents had friends that were Germans, and they used to come at our house, and that’s why they wanted me to learn German.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: And -- but they were different at that time, before Hitler ruined them.</span> <span id="s620">And -- and the Austrians were very nice.</span> <span id="s621">So their … one more country, I can’t think the name now.</span> <span id="s622">Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Switzerland.</span> <span id="s625">At that time we -- we lived in it, my parents open an account, and they supposed to have total --</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: They open an account in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: In Switzerland, but we didn’t -- none of us was to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: It was secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Just the -- their name.</span> <span id="s632">My uncle’s name and his name.</span> <span id="s633">In -- in -- and consequently I couldn’t go and take the money out, because my name was -- and they kept secret there.</span> <span id="s634">This was a -- they had a way.</span> <span id="s635">So -- but I don’t think that money was lost, I tell you why.</span> <span id="s636">My uncle survived, his brother, and they had the money together --</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: -- and probably he got it.</span> <span id="s639">He didn’t say anything to me.</span> <span id="s640">I went to Switzerland myself to get it, and a friend of my father said, don’t do anything because there will be more anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s641">So I left it.</span> <span id="s642">But I have an idea that my uncle probably did it.</span> <span id="s643">And he didn’t take it for his own benefit, he was a wonderf -- a very good man, you know.</span> <span id="s644">He did it to help the rest of the relatives, the ones that were suffering more.</span> <span id="s645">You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: And that’s why I don’t keep any --</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: A grudge?</span></p>

id="s661">So -- but I don’t care.</span> <span id="s662">I never cared about -- about money, as long as I -- I can be independent, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: I -- I don’t care.</span> <span id="s665">I don’t care about.</span> <span id="s666">Because I -- I feel -- I always felt like they had more problems, the -- wh-who --</span></p>

impact on you in 1936?</span> <span id="s686">You’re still in school --</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: On me, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: No, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: No,

id="s763">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: When I -- I would dance -- when I would dance with a boy, you know, the family was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Uh-huh, so it was always chaperoned in some respect.</span> <span id="s766">You look a little funny with that.</span> <span id="s767">You don’t think that was such a good idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Well, in that time, it was a good idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s770">Who decides to move to Athens?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Well, they both decided.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: They both decided.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: I tell you what, we had [indecipherable] friends and I -- and they thought that the Germans were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: So they thought you should leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: We should leave and we left everything, all the furniture, everything, just a -- our clothes, and we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Well, let me ask you something before, cause that’s really very important.</span> <span id="s779">Wh-When you and your family are in Drama, your father is close to the king.</span> <span id="s780">Am I right, or at least he knows --</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: [indecipherable] the king was coming to town with his [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: That was -- okay --</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: My voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: It’s okay, is it all right?</span> <span id="s785">Because I -- it’s going to start with me, too.</span> <span id="s786">The if the king would come to town, to Drama, your father would see him, yes?</span> <span id="s787">And -- am I right that you tell me when he wanted to call his wife he would come to your house, because he could be private, and nobody would be listening.</span> <span id="s788">So your -- your family was not only wealthy and -- and prominent in terms of being wealthy, but they were very well connected in terms of people who knew what was going on in the world.</span> <span id="s789">So, in a sense t -- your father was warned, maybe it would be just better to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Well now, I tell you that our friends were all Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: That they were the -- they used to say come any time during the day, the night, any time that you feel someone saw you, and you are in danger --</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: -- our house is open for you.</span> <span id="s795">And that’s what we did, especially my brother because he used to go.</span> <span id="s796">Couldn’t stand much at home.</span> <span id="s797">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Now were these people in Athens who said that, or people all over Greece who said that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Well, over Greece --</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: And maybe outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Well, no, they didn’t know yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: In Drama they didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: But in Athens there were a lot of our friends from that -- that they m -- they had moved, were Greeks, but the-they had moved in Athens.</span> <span id="s806">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Let -- let me ask you just a funny question now.</span> <span id="s808">You say Greeks, and you mean Greek Christians.</span> <span id="s809">So what did you call yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Greek Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Greek Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: But when you say Greeks, you don’t mean Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Greek Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Greek Orthodox when you say Greek.</span> <span id="s816">I’m just -- it’s very -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: I said just Greek, and like the Greek, we say.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Right, but you were a Greek Jew, not just Greek.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s820">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: No, right.</span> <span id="s822">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s825">When you moved to Greece, was that before the Italians attacked?</span> <span id="s826">Cause you moved in October of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: And October 28th, the Italians attacked Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Right, and they were gone quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: The Greeks were very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Yes, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: But I remember seeing them, you know, walking through the streets of -- and they were humans, like all of us.</span> <span id="s834">You could see in their face that they were thinking of their wives, or their children, you know?</span> <span id="s835">You could see it.</span> <span id="s836">But the Germans were, I mean, robots.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Right, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: I -- I used to call them robots.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: So when -- when you left Drama with the family, you left everything there, and you just took clothes.</span> <span id="s840">And did you go by car?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: No, we flew.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: You flew from Drama to Athens.</span> <span id="s843">And did you go to someone’s house in Athens, or did you rent a place, or buy a place?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: W-We rented a place, and then we bought a place.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s846">And was it as big, and as --</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: No [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: No, it wasn’t, no.</span> <span id="s849">It wasn’t like what it was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: No, it was two storey house with -- it wasn’t the same, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: It was a middle class people, even less [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s854">And what happened to the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: We left it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: You just left it?</span> <span id="s857">Did that make you feel funny?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Well, no, I didn’t even think of it when I was -- I didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s859">And my parents probably did.</span> <span id="s860">But when we sold it, we sold it for nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Cause nobody wanted it.</span> <span id="s863">Who wants a big house like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: You know, they were all poor after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: The war.</span> <span id="s868">So we sold it for nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: So you didn’t feel much of a transition to go to Athens and live in a smaller place?</span> <span id="s870">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: It’s interesting, cause y --</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: As long as I was with my parents, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: It was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: -- you know, it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: And Haim, of course, is with you, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s878">But we put him first with a friend of ours, a Christian friend of ours, because we thought to be with us in a house, day and night, he couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s879">So we left him alone with a family, but he couldn’t stand it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: He couldn’t stand it?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: No, because he wanted to be with us.</span> <span id="s882">And he wrote a letter to my mother, and I have to read it again, because I forgot it.</span> <span id="s883">And it was a -- I read little bit, it was so sweet to my mother, you know?</span> <span id="s884">And she didn’t want to -- her to know that she wa -- he wasn’t happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: But my mother knew, so we brought him --</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: You brought him to -- so he’d be with you.</span> <span id="s888">He wasn’t hitting you any more though, I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Oh no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: No, this --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: That was when we were very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s893">And was your father still working in Athens?</span> <span id="s894">I mean, how would you take care of yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Well, in Athens, see, he didn’t stay only with the tobacco, my father.</span> <span id="s896">And never -- he always wanted to do other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Which, the tobacco company was very big at that time, you know, because we used to sell to the majority companies.</span> <span id="s899">And -- but he wanted to do something else, and in Athens he bought things to sell for -- like clothes, and for the bedroom things, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Sheets

<p><span id="s904">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: He had two places, one that he could sell every day, and one that was only wholesale.</span> <span id="s906">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Is there a school for you, or no school?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: After the --</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: In 1940 -- not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: In 1940 I went i -- to [indecipherable] was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: I had finished public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Uh-huh, high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: To college, college.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Oh, to college?</span> <span id="s918">In Athens?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: But maybe less than a year, because the --</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: The Germans come in --</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: -- in ’41, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: In ’41, they came in?</span> <span id="s924">I don’t remem -- remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: I think so, yes.</span> <span id="s926">In April they invade --</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: -- in 1941.</span> <span id="s929">When you moved to Athens and you see the Italian soldiers, are you then more afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: I wasn’t afraid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Nothing.</span> <span id="s932">And you know the war is going on in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Yeah, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: But you’re not afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: But no, because they were -- they were caught by the Greeks at the time that I saw them.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Right, the Italians were stopped, or at least there’s a stalemate, they can’t get through.</span> <span id="s937">But then the Germans come in, and they do win, and they divide the country into three parts.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: But the archbishop didn’t want to give us away, but at the end, couldn’t make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: And especially there, in Thessaloniki, in Salonika, where there were so many, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s942">No, the Salonika Jews just get -- it’s dec -- decimated.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: 90 percent of them perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s945">Do you remember when th -- when, after the German invasion, and that Athens is occupied by both the Italians and the Germans?</span> <span id="s946">Do you remember seeing both troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s948">As a matter of fact at the beginning, we didn’t think that this -- the archbishop didn’t want to give their na -- our names or any -- anything.</span> <span id="s949">I used to go -- I still used to go to the theater.</span> <span id="s950">We have an ancient theater in Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Ancient theater, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Ancient theater, we -- has a -- has a better acoustics than the latest theater here in the United States.</span> <span id="s953">Amazing, it’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s954">So I was in that theater, and besides me, there were Germans, and when I turn, who do I see?</span> <span id="s955">My piano teacher, that she used to tell me that she was Jewish, and she was German, she was with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: She was with them.</span> <span id="s957">So that must have been a big shock, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: And to have the Germans behind us, but we weren’t afraid at that time, you know?</span> <span id="s959">It’s when they started taking the Jews and putting them in -- in Haidari, the prison in Greece, then --</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Then you got worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: We thought that this was momentarily, and finally you know that, and understand that they were all --</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: That they would stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Yeah, but we were wrong with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s965">We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Wer -- where was this ancient theater?</span> <span id="s969">This wasn’t the colis -- this is not --</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: In -- in Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: In Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: But they are in other parts of the -- but this one was -- is inside Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: And if you heard Yanni.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Have you heard Yanni?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: He played in that theater in Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Uh-huh, so -- I see.</span> <span id="s980">These outdoor theaters are just -- it’s outdoors, right?</span> <span id="s981">It’s -- it’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Outdoors, wonderful.</span> <span id="s983">And always it’s ni -- in the evening it’s always nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: You never get hot or sweating, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: No matter when, in the year, really?</span> <span id="s987">It sounds wonderful.</span> <span id="s988">Were there restrictions once the Germans took over Athens?</span> <span id="s989">Did you have to wear a Jewish star --</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: No Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: No.</span> <span id="s993">They took us all of the sudden, you know, it seemed, that they decided to take us in -- in Athens.</span> <span id="s994">I don’t know what they did in Salonika.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: No, but you’re not -- you’re go -- you move too fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: That was in 1944.</span> <span id="s998">I’m talking about 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: When they take over, are there -- there must be restrictions for Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: No, n-not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: They asked to show up in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1004">I don’t know too much because, see, I wasn’t with the -- the rest of the Jews to see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: -- what was going on.</span> <span id="s1007">See, I was i-inside with this family.</span> <span id="s1008">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: No, I’m talking about before you’re in hiding.</span> <span id="s1010">You go into hiding f -- ’42 - ’43, but you’re not -- you’re in your house with your parents and Haim in 1941, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: In 1941, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1015">So for one year --</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: -- you’re not in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s1020">So what happens?</span> <span id="s1021">You stay pretty much in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: No, we go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: You go out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: And -- and so you don’t feel -- are you going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: No, you couldn’t bi -- ga -- you couldn’t go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Probably -- no, probably that -- that’s when I used to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Now, was everybody stopped from going to school, or only the Jewish students, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: I tell you the -- I don’t remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: You don’t remember, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: -- I mi -- I don’t -- I don’t know what the other children did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Because I was with Christians, Greeks.</span> <span id="s1035">Orthodox Greeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1037">So you don’t know, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: I don’t know much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: So who ma -- the su -- was there a discussion in your house about hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: There was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: And then is when we came in contact with all our friends.</span> <span id="s1043">They said you can come out in house whenever you want, in the evening, any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: And the last house that we went to before we were caught, they had the big house, they send the maids away because they were afraid that the maids may say something.</span> <span id="s1046">And they enclosed themselves in one room, and they gave us the rest of the house -- to us, and my father said, “Why are you doing this?”</span> <span id="s1047">“Well,” she said, “because I want to show that there are nice people out there -- there -- there were, because we can go out, we are free to go out any time we want to.</span> <span id="s1048">But you stay home, and you need more room and everything.”</span> <span id="s1049">So they did that, and the love that they show us, and they used to bring us food and this and that -- amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1051">So you didn’t just stay with one family during this -- is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: No, n-no, about two or three families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Two or three families.</span> <span id="s1054">And who ma -- did your father make the decision that you sh -- you should hide, or was it obvious, there were a lot of families who were doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: No, because when we thought that someone has seen one of us, because my brother used to walk around, but he thought someone saw him, or someone may see him, or someone saw me in the -- in the window --</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: You know.</span> <span id="s1058">We had to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Did you look -- I don’t know what it means in Greece.</span> <span id="s1060">In Poland it seems that some Jews looked Jewish to Polish Catholics.</span> <span id="s1061">Was there a look, so that if someone saw Haim they would think he was a Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: N-No, no, but there were some that look -- so.</span> <span id="s1063">But ma -- the majority looked like a -- like a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Like everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: But when you say Haim might be seen, it was because he was known to be Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: -- not because he looked Jewish, I see.</span> <span id="s1069">So were you afraid of these Germans now?</span> <span id="s1070">Did -- at some point did you become afraid of these guys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: If -- we’re afraid now, or then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: No, no, no, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: When -- when you went into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Well, until we went to Haidari, I wasn’t afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: It -- Haidari they put us in a room with two other people, and -- and then after that they put us all together in one big room, where we stayed there, and after a week they send us to -- put us in trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: In trains, to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: To Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: So the hiding period is not such a terrible period because you’re with people who know you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Who care about you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: In Greece, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: In Greece, and want to be good to you.</span> <span id="s1085">But your life is all indoors, because the Germans are clearly looking for Jews, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Or someone will tell them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: -- there, because the Germans didn’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: -- who were Jews, and who were not, you know.</span> <span id="s1091">Or, we didn’t have ghettos like --</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: -- other places.</span> <span id="s1094">We lived everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: So they couldn’t know unless somebody told them that these are Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1098">Now, your father is not working when you’re in hiding, or is he going in and out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: No, he stays in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: He stays -- he stays inside.</span> <span id="s1101">Do you think your father is -- is -- is helping with the cost of keeping you there by paying people, or are these wealthy people and they don’t want money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Well, they don’t want money, but my father was -- didn’t want them to spend all their money, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: We used to give them money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Now, what happened to the house that you had bought?</span> <span id="s1106">You just left that house, with now less clothes, I assume, and go into hiding.</span> <span id="s1107">So each time you move, you have less and less things.</span> <span id="s1108">Is there something that you take with you because you -- some, I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: No, I tell you, when we were caught, we decided that -- we used to listen the radio, th-the British --</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: -- telling us all the time that we’re coming, this and that, and years went by and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1112">And my father was still very young, and my brother, they were getting tired.</span> <span id="s1113">We leave the country.</span> <span id="s1114">[inaudible].</span> <span id="s1115">So we decided to go to Egypt, and from Egypt to Israel, and -- and we decided that we’re -- we’re going to get dressed as if we’re going to a wedding, in case they si -- they stop us, we’ll tell them that we are going to a wedding.</span> <span id="s1116">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1117">And a friend of ours -- you see, we had so many friend -- one of them gave us up.</span> <span id="s1118">He [indecipherable] in Germany, and we thought that he was working for the Greek government, trying to find out things from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1119">And maybe he did, but he was on both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: And maybe the Germans found out that he was hiding Jews, who knows if he gave us up.</span> <span id="s1122">And all of a sudden Germans stop us going to the -- to the ship, and since I knew German, I got out of the car, and I said, “I don’t understand why you taking us.</span> <span id="s1123">I mean now, as you see, we are dressed, we are going to a wedding.”</span> <span id="s1124">He said, “Fraulein, we know everything about you.</span> <span id="s1125">You don’t have to tell us any more.”</span> <span id="s1126">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1127">“So you’ll come with us.”</span> <span id="s1128">And they took us to a place to -- where the Germans were.</span> <span id="s1129">And they started to interrogate first my father and my brother.</span> <span id="s1130">So they came back, when they came back I was so scared to look at them, because my father didn’t have the front teeth, and you know, it seems that they hit them.</span> <span id="s1131">So then they came to pick us up, my mother and myself.</span> <span id="s1132">And I spoke to them in German because I knew German, and -- and probably that’s the reason they didn’t behave bad with us, they didn’t do anything to us.</span> <span id="s1133">So we went back to the room where my brother and [indecipherable] and my brother comes to me and says, “You are no longer my sister.”</span> <span id="s1134">I said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s1135">“Why they didn’t do anything to you?</span> <span id="s1136">Look at us,” you know.</span> <span id="s1137">“Probably you told them where our relatives are.”</span> <span id="s1138">I say, “I wouldn’t do that for anything in the world.</span> <span id="s1139">They ask me, and do you know what I told them?</span> <span id="s1140">In -- in German, I told them, and they didn’t hit me.”</span> <span id="s1141">So, I told the Germans, I know where my -- I don’t know where my relatives are, but even if I knew it, I wouldn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s1142">So they started laughing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: The Germans started laughing?</span> <span id="s1144">A: So then after that they let me -- let us go, you know?</span> <span id="s1145">And my brother was very mad at me thinking that if they let us go like that, without hitting us, I told them where my relatives are and so forth.</span> <span id="s1146">I didn’t do it, and that’s why all my relatives who were hidden, they were alive after we returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1148">Did he believe you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Your brother, when you told him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: He did.</span> <span id="s1153">That was a very difficult situation I would imagine --</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: It was, it -- it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: -- very painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: -- it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: And hi -- was he hit?</span> <span id="s1158">Did he look as beaten -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: He -- oh, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1161">Do you think also that they were hit because they were men and you were women?</span> <span id="s1162">Do you think there was some difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: N-No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: N-No.</span> <span id="s1166">They didn’t hit us because I spoke to them in German, and I guess they liked that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: But didn’t your father speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Oh, he didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: No, that’s why he wanted me to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: -- learn German, so that when the German come at our house, someone would know how -- what to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Oh yes, right.</span> <span id="s1174">So did this person who denounced you, who told the Germans, did he know that you were leaving?</span> <span id="s1175">He must have known, because otherwise why would they stop your car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Mm-hm, right, right.</span> <span id="s1177">We told him that we were leaving, he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Ah, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: -- thinking that he was a very good friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1181">But he wasn’t the person at the time who was -- whose house you were staying at?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: No, it was somebody else’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Someone else.</span> <span id="s1185">We stayed there another time at his house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Did you ever re-meet this man?</span> <span id="s1187">Did you ever see him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Well, I tell you, when -- a-after the liberation, I went to the court, and he was there.</span> <span id="s1189">And he was sitting in the place where the Greeks help others, and on the other side where there was [indecipherable], and the judge said, “Do you see the person that,” -- I said, “Yes, he is right there.”</span> <span id="s1190">And he said,

id="s1220">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1221">So being in Haidari had to be a big shock for you, because now you knew you were endangered, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Well, yeah, still

id="s1391">Nothing?</span> <span id="s1392">You must have been all in shock.</span> <span id="s1393">So what happens when you arrive in this place?</span> <span id="s1394">Nobody -- of course, they don’t tell you that you’re going to Auschwitz, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: No, we arrive there, and they said we are going to have a shower.</span> <span id="s1396">Well, they took our -- our hair away, completely -- hair, and then they put the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: They did put a tattoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: -- tattoo.</span> <span id="s1399">The tattoo,

<p><span id="s1402">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: They didn’t know anything about it, nothing about it.</span> <span id="s1404">So when they saw my number here, they said, “Is this your phone number?”</span> <span id="s1405">And they ask all kinds of silly questions all the time.</span> <span id="s1406">And I have a very good friend, Jewish friend with me, and he says, “You know, Rachelle, I have a good dermatologist, what about -- I think he can do that, he can take it off.”</span> <span id="s1407">Because it was for me, it was so demeaning, for people to think that I put my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Telephone number, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: And at that time we didn’t have a car, I was waiting for the bus, you know, and everybody would ask questions, and I didn’t want to talk all my -- I -- I was very -- I’m a person that I keep everything --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: -- inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: You know, unless they are friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: But not to strangers, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Let -- let me go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s1419">When -- when you arrive in Auschwitz, they separate the men and the women, yes?</span> <span id="s1420">So you’re with your mother, and you see your father and your brother off -- going off to another direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: Me -- right.</span> <span id="s1422">And my mother was with me, and she was holding me tight.</span> <span id="s1423">Said, we’ll stay together, the two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Then somebody came that she was from Greece, and she knew us, we didn’t know her, but she knew us.</span> <span id="s1426">And she said, “Look [indecipherable] let your mother go, because if she comes with you, they’ll make her work hard, like you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: She knew there is -- she listened [indecipherable] immediately my mother went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: To the gas chamber?</span> <span id="s1430">But this was a way to save you, what she told.</span> <span id="s1431">She knew what she was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: The reason she did that is to -- to save me, right, because if I -- I would go with my mother, they’d the same thing.</span> <span id="s1433">But I thought that was a good idea, she won’t work, and she’ll be better off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: And how long did it take you to find out what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Almost at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: At the end of the war, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: See, I -- I didn’t stay too long there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Right, you were -- a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1440">I was liberated early.</span> <span

<p><span id="s1499">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: -- together with my mother, and she was so upset by seeing a Jew portrayed in a very negative stereotype --</span></p> <p><span

play.</span> <span id="s1521">Did they do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Well, she ask that, but I don’t know, we didn’t go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span

id="s1541">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: She -- when she felt like she was right, she would talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1544">So she was a strong woman in many ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: She was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: And I know you have the

and sent you to Bergen-Belsen, am I correct?</span> <span id="s1551">Do you remember whether this was before -- there was an uprising in Auschwitz in October.</span> <span id="s1552">Do you think this was before the uprising, or it was after the uprising, or -- or do you not remember?</span> <span id="s1553">You don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1554">Do you remem --</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: All I remember that my friend Paula, she started to be upset that I was getting too thin, and they would take me to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: The [indecipherable] of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: No, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Oh, to the gas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: To the gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: And it was the day that they were looking at different barracks to find out which ones were thin, and -- or not healthy, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: So -- and my friend Paula took me to her barrack while they were doing that, and that’s how I survived, otherwise I would have been with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Now, is Paula somebody you knew from Athens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Or had you -- you met her in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: I met her in Haidari, I believe I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Where did you meet her, in Haidari?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Haidari.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: Uh-huh, so she was Greek?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1572">But she married a Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1574">So this was quite an act --</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: And she wrote also poems about the Holocaust and everything, and I have one poem with me, I don’t know where it is.</span> <span id="s1576">Rinette has it probably.</span> <span id="s1577">And it’s very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1579">Well, maybe we can read it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: And her po -- poems, she was an international poem thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: A competition?</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: Y-Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: And that was here in Washington I believe, and she won it.</span> <span id="s1585">Yeah, yeah, and I have some papers with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: And what’s her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: She died.</span> <span id="s1588">We were such good friends, even though w-we lived so far away from each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: We used to call each other every si -- almost every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: And all of a sudden I heard she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: And how was she able to come to you in the other barrack?</span> <span id="s1594">Were you working in a similar place in Auschwitz so she could see you regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Well see, she wasn’t like all of us, she was like --</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Oh, she was a blochal -- sh -- a Blochalteste, she was the head of the barrack [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Oh yeah, yeah, I’d say so.</span> <span id="s1598">But she was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1600">But she had more freedom to move around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: So that was wonderful for her to do that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: She could be in trouble also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s1605">Did you then go back to your barrack, or you stayed in her barrack, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: I stayed for a little bit, until they left -- the Nazis from our bar -- they took whichever they found, and they left, and then she took me back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1608">So she was a real protector, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1610">And she was always like that, till she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: Was she older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: No, I think we were the same age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: About the same age?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: When did she die?</span> <span id="s1616">Few years ago, about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: I think it’s a -- a year ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: My mind is getting so bad.</span> <span id="s1622">Rinette probably will remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1624">Do you remember leaving Auschwitz for Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: N -- well, what I remember is that they had us for a couple of days outdoors, it was raining and everything, and we didn’t have any clothes, or right shoes, or anything, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: And -- and until today I’m flabbergasted how I didn’t get sick.</span> <span id="s1628">The whole time that I was there, I never had any headache, or I was sneezing or anything.</span> <span id="s1629">You know, isn’t that strange?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1631">So you -- you’re saying in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: And I don’t know, maybe it -- this time when we were out [indecipherable] women, then they moved us.</span> <span id="s1633">And then they took us to where they make arms and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1635">A munitions factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: Yeah, a factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: This is in Bergen-Belsen?</span> <span id="s1640">You think -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: I don’t know, I think it was in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1644">And we were staying there for a little bit.</span> <span id="s1645">In the meantime they heard that the -- the allies were coming.</span> <span id="s1646">And they gave it to each one of us, my friends and myself, they gave us something to cover ourself.</span> <span id="s1647">It’s because the allies were coming.</span> <span id="s1648">And so -- and we couldn’t see, you know, because it was cold, and we had it lowered, and I couldn’t see where my friends were, and we used to call every five minutes, Leoni, Milka,</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: And then finally -- we always stay together, and they took us to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1651">That was a ghetto, and there were -- there were Jewish doctors and everything, and they were so sweet to us, so nice.</span> <span id="s1652">And my hair had started to -- to be okay, you know, I had some hair after all this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: So, and -- to one of the [indecipherable], because they were cutting our hairs because we had typhus, all of us.</span> <span id="s1655">So I said, “Would you please don’t cut my hair,” I said, “because I’m going to meet my father pretty soon, and I don’t want him to see me like that.”</span> <span id="s1656">And he said okay, and he took care, he treated me and everything, and he [inaudible] you know, and then we -- we were there, all Jews in this ghetto, and -- and they would come to me and say Rachelle -- the Russians --</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: After the liberation, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: -- the -- the -- the Russians are outside, and they’re cooking, and we didn’t have any food.</span> <span id="s1659">Said, “Why don’t you go in the window, maybe they’ll give you some food?”</span> <span id="s1660">I said, “Why don’t you go?</span> <span id="s1661">I mean, th-there’s a -- why are you sending me, I do -- I don’t want to go.”</span> <span id="s1662">“Well,” they said, “you are the only one who has hair.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: So did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: Well, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1666">And did they give you food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1669">What were the Russians like when they came, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Well, they seemed to be very sweet and everything.</span> <span id="s1671">And then after that, they moved me to a hospital where the Russians were, because they didn’t have all the necessary things there in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: So -- and they took me there, and while I was there I heard that they were taking all the Jews to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1674">And I thought to myself, no way.</span> <span id="s1675">So I had th -- they gave me a shirt to sleep, and I had -- how do you call it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: The pillowcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: The pillowcase.</span> <span id="s1678">From the pillowcase I made that -- a skirt, because I couldn’t go out, and I couldn’t go through the door because they will attack me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: So, from the window, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: You jumped from the win --</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: -- I jumped.</span> <span id="s1683">And nothing -- I was very thin, you know, and nothing happened to me, and I started walking fast.</span> <span id="s1684">And I found some French women that they -- I-I knew in the concentration camp, and they said to me, “Oh Rachelle, comme vous êtes chic.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Whoa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: Chic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: Chic [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: See, I had the -- my hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: And so that was funny.</span> <span id="s1691">And I always say something funny to friends if they ask me something, you know, because -- and you will see some pictures, you saw some pictures where -- where the ji -- the Americans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: -- and y-you can’t tell that I’m a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: You know, I’m laughing, like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: Because I had this thing in my mind that we have to do the best we can while we are alive, forget what happened.</span> <span id="s1698">We are good friends, you know, [indecipherable] and -- but then when we went to Greece, we didn’t find the parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1700">Where was pa -- Paula did not go with you to Bergen-Belsen?</span> <span id="s1701">Cause you mentioned Leoni and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Melka --</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Milka, rather.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: Right, no, Paula, no, she wasn’t with us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: She wasn’t with you.</span> <span id="s1708">But the three of you went --</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Went -- we stayed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: -- to Bergen-Belsen, Theresienstadt, and then you all became interpreters --</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: -- with the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1714">See, we -- we didn’t want to stay there with the Russians because -- so i -- it was the French Red Cross that came to pick up their people.</span> <span id="s1715">So we all knew French [indecipherable] so they took us, and they took us to where the Americans were, in Frankfort.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: Did they say that you were French?</span> <span id="s1717">Did you say we’re French, or you just said you spoke French, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: We -- we spoke to them fr -- in French, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: In French?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: -- and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Now, why did they take you to the Americans, do you think, rather than to the French side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: Well, that’s where they were -- they weren’t going straight to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: -- yeah, they stopped there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: And the Americans [indecipherable] they wanted us as interpreters, and they gave us clothes because we didn’t have any clothes, we were dressed alike.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: With a soldier’s clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Right, because you were all dressed in pants and a shirt, just like the soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1731">And I look fat there, and you know, little earlier I was very thin --</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: -- when I [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1734">But the Americans gave us everything good they had, they used to send them from th -- America --</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: -- they used to give it to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: Yes, you didn’t look very thin in those photographs, so soon you gained --</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: Yeah, I-I know.</span> <span id="s1739">I know, and the l-laughing, I mean, like nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: Yeah, it’s because we had th-that kind of thought, you know?</span> <span id="s1742">We’ll forget what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: -- hap -- happened in the past, now we’ll have to start a new life --</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: A new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: -- and try to do the best we can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: So you’re 21 years old when the w -- when you’re liberated.</span> <span id="s1748">So you’re s -- still a kid, in a certain way, and you don’t know what’s happened to Haim, to your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: I didn’t know until later, until I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Rinette tried to -- because you see, Rinette said, maybe he went -- they send him to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1752">I said, if [indecipherable] they sent to Siberia, he was too intelligent not to know how to come back to Greece, you know?</span> <span id="s1753">So I didn’t believe that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: That he went, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: So then we found out that he died immediately after the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: And my father, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: And the three of you, you and your two friends, go back to Athens because you’re all hoping to find family, I assume?</span> <span id="s1759">And you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: And the thing is, where I used to ask rush -- the Russians, that we wanted to go back to Greece, and they said, well, we can give you some money.</span> <span id="s1761">But we were -- how can we go from -- that far, you know, go to Greece with a little bit of money.</span> <span id="s1762">Was impossible.</span> <span id="s1763">Instead, when I spoke to the Russians, the Russian were telling us, we’ll take you to America, and we’ll give you good life and everything.</span> <span id="s1764">Ye -- well, I-I said I’m sorry, I said --</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: You mean the Americans said this to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: Not the Russians, yes, okay, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: No, the American.</span> <span id="s1769">They were extremely nice.</span> <span id="s1770">And I said, “Well, I can’t.”</span> <span id="s1771">I said, “We can’t go now because we have to go back and find out -- our parents, if our parents returned.”</span> <span id="s1772">And do you know what?</span> <span id="s1773">He gave us a plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: He gave you a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: A plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: A plan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: Plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: A plane?</span> <span id="s1779">To go from Munich to Athens?</span> <span id="s1780">Really?</span> <span id="s1781">For just the three of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: No, it w-were about six, but a -- ma -- the -- most of the plane was empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1785">See, w-who would do that?</span> <span id="s1786">Nobody, nobody.</span> <span id="s1787">They were so nice, it’s -- I’ll never forget that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1789">But then of course, you go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: But you know, it was one of us when -- a Jewish man that he ask me to be his girlfriend, and I said, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1791">At this point, you know, my mind is not ki -- cannot think anything, you know, right now.</span> <span id="s1792">I want to go to Greece and find my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: So what he did is he was writing the names that will be on the plane, he took my name off.</span> <span id="s1795">A Jewish man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: He took it off?</span> <span id="s1797">Because he wanted you to be his girlfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: Yeah, because I said that I couldn’t be, because -- I had a good reason, I mean it’s not that I was going with anybody else, or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: I said that I wasn’t ready for something like that.</span> <span id="s1801">And so a friend of mine, Leoni, took the list, and she says, “Well, Rachelle is not here in this list.”</span> <span id="s1802">And that’s how I know.</span> <span id="s1803">I got back into the list, and I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: So he put you back on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Well, Leoni put it back on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: Or la -- Leoni -- but this was a very difficult trip for you, because what you found at the other end was that no one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: Well, we didn’t expect the same day to find them, you know?</span> <span id="s1808">We thought with another plane, with -- or maybe they -- they -- there were nice other people like this Americans, you know.</span> <span id="s1809">So -- and maybe they’ll come in a few days.</span> <span id="s1810">And my uncle, which -- I mean, he -- like I said, he’s a good man, very good man, he helps others, he doesn’t care about himself, but he wants to help with the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s1811">He went to -- to our friends, and he wanted the things they were holding for us, to take h-he -- and you know, ma -- our friends were embarrassed by that.</span> <span id="s1812">They [indecipherable] and they said well, when Rachelle or the rest of the family comes, you know, we’ll give it to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Now, th-the -- the people who were holding your -- the stuff from your family, were these the people who were hiding you also, or was this another family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Well, we -- we used to go from one house to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1816">So they kept it for you, and are those the people you went to first when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: In Athens?</span> <span id="s1818">Q: Yeah, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: No, first we bought a house, because the Germans weren’t there yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: No, no, I meant after you came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: Oh after I ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: After the war, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s1824">Well, I saw them, but I could tell that they were very embarrassed by my uncle -- what my uncle did, and I was embarrassed too.</span> <span id="s1825">And -- and with that man that gave us up, you know, to the Germans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: All this started coming up, you know, and I didn’t want to think much about it.</span> <span id="s1828">So -- and I was involved with my relatives and others, so -- I didn’t see -- and I forgot their names.</span> <span id="s1829">My daughter -- every time we see each other, she tries t -- for me to remember, I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: I only remember one name, Kalantzi.</span> <span id="s1832">He’s the one who wrote the poem, but I didn’t know him, I knew his -- a-another man that was a friend of my father, and his name was Kalantzi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Kalantzi, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: But this one I didn’t know, as -- just we met, you know, and it’s amazing the poem he wrote.</span> <span id="s1835">Things that we Jews don’t say, you know, he said for us.</span> <span id="s1836">And that’s the kind of friends we need.</span> <span id="s1837">We can say a lot of things, instead of making friends, we can make enemies, but when they say the good things, then people listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1839">So were the three of you living together when you went back to Athens, or did you split up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: Well, we intended that because Leoni had an aunt in Athens that survived, and she had a big house, and she told us you stay with me, we’ll stay together.</span> <span id="s1841">But when my cousin came to see me, she said -- he said, no I don’t think you can stay here because my mother will die.</span> <span id="s1842">See, she was my only aunt, there.</span> <span id="s1843">But I wish I would stay with my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1845">So then you stayed with your aunt, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1846">That was -- was that difficult for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: It was difficult because I couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s1848">I -- I used to say -- you know me, I don’t say things that are very bad, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: I try to make things, I don’t know, easier a little bit for the other person that listens.</span> <span id="s1851">And I didn’t -- knowing that she lost her brother, you know, I tried to be nice, and yet she -- she fell down by herself.</span> <span id="s1852">She lost --</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: You mean, she became weaker?</span> <span id="s1854">Or she really fell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: Sh-She fell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: How you say that -- the word when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: She collapsed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: Collapsed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1861">Was this -- your aunt was on your father’s side, or your mother’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: On my father’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: Your father’s side.</span> <span id="s1864">So you really couldn’t talk with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1867">So how long did you live with her?</span> <span id="s1868">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: Well a la -- I lived about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: And then I went to the house that my father had bought.</span> <span id="s1872">But other people were living inside.</span> <span id="s1873">So they decide to give me two or three rooms there.</span> <span id="s1874">So I stayed there for awhile, and then my ex-husband -- we used to be good friends, but that’s all, you know?</span> <span id="s1875">I was too young, and I didn’t date before, I didn’t know too much about men.</span> <span id="s1876">I don’t know -- well, I thought since he is my best friend, you know, we’ll be good.</span> <span id="s1877">But unfortunately -- I -- I stayed with him until the children grew up, they finished college and everything.</span> <span id="s1878">And then I thought, ah well, that’s it, I ca -- I can’t take no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: And you know, sometimes I think maybe the reason that we both went through a lot, maybe this is the reason that we couldn’t stay together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Because it was too much to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: You know, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: It’s possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: Yeah, you know, because if I would marry someone that didn’t go through all this -- we would just say sometimes jokes and things like that, that will make me change little bit, or -- but no, it -- it wasn’t a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: It wasn’t easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: It wasn’t easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: And did you have two children?</span> <span id="s1888">Rinette is one, and a boy, or another girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: A boy.</span> <span id="s1890">I lost my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: You lost your son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: I lost my son when he was 25.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1894">So you haven’t had an easy time at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: That was my worst part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: Did you -- did you talk a lot about the Holocaust, a-about your experiences after the war?</span> <span id="s1897">You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: Cause nobody knew in Houston about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: And you -- when you were in Greece, were you talking with people more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: It was -- it was -- did it make it easier to talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: Yeah, right, because they were asking me questions like you ask me now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: Exactly like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: And that was easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: But still I wouldn’t say, because my aunt fainted, and I found out the word now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: And so you thought that that’s what peo -- what would happen to people if you talked?</span> <span id="s1908">You would be doing something bad to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: And I tried to make some jokes, and I mean [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1911">I -- okay, let’s change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: You know, it’s interesting, because it -- when the camera was not -- was not on, you were talking about what you had to learn, which I guess you watched your mother cooking, but you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: Oh, you didn’t?</span> <span id="s1917">So you were not aware of how to keep a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: Is th -- the way, is I smell the food, that’s how I thought that that’s what probably did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q: So you -- you could tell what the smell was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: -- that a food should --</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: And my ex-husband used to say that I’m the best cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: How long did it take you to learn how to cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: It didn’t take me long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: Didn’t take you long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: No.</span> <span id="s1927">And it’s amazed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: Because I never liked to cook, and I cook so well, because he used to say that I’m the best cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1931">Was it easy for you to learn how to take care of children, or was that hard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: It was hard, especially that my ex-husband didn’t -- he wasn’t the type to -- what he -- when he wanted to talk to them, he would write to me, please tell Rinette so and so, or tell Fred so and so, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1934">So he wouldn’t communicate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: And he wouldn’t communicate with me that -- he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: Ah -- wa -- but he’s communicating with you?</span> <span id="s1937">No.</span> <span id="s1938">Was he different after you got married than before?</span> <span id="s1939">You said you were best friends, so you must have communicated beforehand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: Yes, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: But not after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: He change afterwards.</span> <span id="s1943">I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: People are complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: Yeah, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: Why did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: He wanted to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: He wanted to come.</span> <span id="s1949">Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: Because I believed in family and being together, to the place where you’re born, where you have friends, where you have family.</span> <span id="s1953">I believe in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: Now if you tell me to go back, I won’t go -- go back.</span> <span id="s1956">I lived here for 52 years and I love this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: You know, and if I want to travel -- before, I used to love to travel in Europe, you know, go to Paris, London, this and -- I don’t care any more.</span> <span id="s1959">If somebody tells me here, the United States to go, that’s what I want to do, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: In the United States, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1962">I feel that this is my country now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">A: So it’s true that w -- there are mistakes done in every -- but in the history, when is -- was everything all right, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1966">But why Houston?</span> <span id="s1967">You stay in New York for a f -- couple of months [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Okay, a friend of his --</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: -- came in Texas, and they -- the pa -- there was a man and a wife, and they told him that it was very nice, and that -- so his [indecipherable] our relatives in New York, they wanted us to stay there.</span> <span id="s1971">You know, they had jobs for us and everything.</span> <span id="s1972">But he didn’t want to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: Now, his sister was alive after the war, am I right?</span> <span id="s1974">His sister -- his -- her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: Yes, his sister, all the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: -- her -- her husband --</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: -- all his -- husband died, and their child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: -- and the child died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: And he -- she was also very good friend to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: I consider her a good friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: But Houston, when you move there, must have been nothing.</span> <span id="s1983">So it must have bee -- coming from New York especially, let alone from Greece.</span> <span id="s1984">Did you get depressed?</span> <span id="s1985">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: But I try not to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: -- because I was busy all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: No -- nobody said, are you depressed.</span> <span id="s1991">I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: No, nobody asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: No, nobody ask, and I don’t think I show anybody that I’m depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: I try to do the best I can.</span> <span id="s1996">And then I -- I decide that I have to drive, and I took lessons again, you know?</span> <span id="s1997">The driver, you know, s-saw my license, say why -- “I can take you t -- a couple of times, you know.”</span> <span id="s1998">“No,” I said, “think that I am a -- a child, I’m just starting now, and we’ll go from there.”</span> <span id="s1999">And that’s what she did.</span> <span id="s2000">She was very good, and I got some pa -- a -- I still am afraid to drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s2002">Were you afraid when you got your license?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: When did you get your license?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: When I -- we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: So -- but you drove?</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: But you drove always with fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: Drove a little bit, maybe, but not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: Well to -- what were you afraid of?</span> <span id="s2011">What are you afraid of?</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: Especially I was afraid hitting somebody, or -- you know, I wasn’t afraid that somebody would hit me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: But you were afraid of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: But you’ve never hit anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: I still -- I still have this fear, to -- to -- for you to give me a gun, I would never take it.</span> <span id="s2017">If you give it to me like that for -- as a gift, never take it.</span> <span id="s2018">You know, I’d rather somebody shoot me than to shoot anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2020">So what is that?</span> <span id="s2021">Where does that come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: That’s me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: That’s you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: And I don’t ask my daughter how she thinks, or how she doesn’t think.</span> <span id="s2025">You know, it’s their -- it’s her person, and we are all different.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2027">You know, there’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: Well, of course in Greece then, nobody had guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q: Guns, right.</span> <span id="s2030">But you know what the -- Plato quoted Socrates as saying it’s better to suffer wrong than to do wrong.</span> <span id="s2031">So I begin to think that maybe this comes from your Greek background.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: The Greek philosophy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2034">Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: Maybe.</span> <span id="s2036">I didn’t think about that, but maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: I don’t know any --</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: You know, the friend of -- the h-husband of Paula’s is Socrates.</span> <span id="s2039">He died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: His name was Socrates?</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: His name was Socrates.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: When did you decide you would tell your children about your experiences?</span> <span id="s2043">Did you tell them when they were very young, or did you wait?</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: I wait, because they didn’t have a chance to speak with anybody.</span> <span id="s2045">It was much too much to tell them, and to keep them inside of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: You know, nobody, even in the synagogues, there -- people won’t let their -- the rabbi to speak about the Holocaust, until recently.</span> <span id="s2048">About 10 days in -- 10 years, because they didn’t want their children to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: They didn’t want their children to know, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: So it was very hard for the children [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q: Because they felt something.</span> <span id="s2052">So did it take you a long time to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">A: Their --of course they felt something, because they saw the number on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: -- on the -- on his father, and then sometimes something was said among -- among us, the father and me, you know.</span> <span id="s2056">Or they would hear something on television.</span> <span id="s2057">They knew, because my daughter one time, she said, “Is that what the Germans did to you?”</span> <span id="s2058">When she was watching something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: And what did you -- did you say yes, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: I said not exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: But that was the extent of you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: So when did you tell her?</span> <span id="s2064">Cause she know -- she knows --</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: Well, it’s after I brought her here --</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: -- last year.</span> <span id="s2068">It did a lot of good her.</span> <span id="s2069">She wasn’t talking at all.</span> <span id="s2070">See?</span> <span id="s2071">And I thought -- and I tell you the truth, if I came, I came more for her.</span> <span id="s2072">So that she will see other people, she will talk, she will find out things --</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: -- and you know, because you know, I-I could tell her suffering, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2076">And she -- she --</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: She had -- she had to let it go, you know, and talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: And I think it did a lot of good, because coming back to Houston, she started talking and being involved in everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: And could she hear you better, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: Yeah, I think so, and we talked these things together a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2083">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: We didn’t talk for years, until recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: So the tribute -- you’re talking about the Holocaust museum tribute to survivors in November of ’93.</span> <span id="s2086">I guess it was a year ago.</span> <span id="s2087">No, less than a year ago.</span> <span id="s2088">This past November.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: Is that ’93?</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q2: ’03.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Q: ’03.</span> <span id="s2093">I’m sorry. ’</span> <span id="s2094">03, right, 2003.</span> <span id="s2095">Well that’s interesting, because it’s a long time to not talk.</span> <span id="s2096">Do you wish you had spoken before, in some ways, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A: Well, I was hurting her, it felt like I was hurting her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: By telling her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2100">That’s why I wanted t -- for her to talk with other people the same age, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: Right, right, right.</span> <span id="s2102">Do you think she thinks it hurts you too much to talk, so that’s why it hurts -- see that -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s2104">Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: So in some ways it stops both of you, because you don’t want to hurt each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: That’s right, she’s very sensitive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2110">Have you talked with -- with your grandson?</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: But I think probably his mother talked to him a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: Not much, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2117">Have you ever talked in schools, with -- with kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: Well, I tell you, they were asking me a lot to go to schools and talk, and I went once, they force [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2119">It was a woman from a school, a Jewish woman, but she used to teach that school, it was for advanced children.</span> <span id="s2120">And they told her to -- to whom to come, and she came to me.</span> <span id="s2121">I liked her very much.</span> <span id="s2122">And I said, “Well why you want me?</span> <span id="s2123">You see that I have difficulty, and,” -- I said, “I can tell you -- I can tell you which people you can go to, and th-they help you out better.”</span> <span id="s2124">“No,” she said, “I want you.”</span> <span id="s2125">And she kept coming, coming at my house until she made me go.</span> <span id="s2126">I said, “Okay, but we won’t let my daughter come, because she’s going to be embarrassed.”</span> <span id="s2127">So -- and she didn’t come, we didn’t tell her.</span> <span id="s2128">So -- and I went with her, and the children were so involved that they didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s2129">They [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q: They didn’t want to leave you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: They didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s2132">The -- their mothers came to pick them up and they didn’t want to leave.</span> <span id="s2133">So what happened is their mothers stayed there.</span> <span id="s2134">And -- and the mothers all start asking questions.</span> <span id="s2135">I -- I th -- I thought that I won’t be able to -- to talk, and I said I’ll embarrass everybody, you know?</span> <span id="s2136">But they liked it.</span> <span id="s2137">And -- and they keep asking me again and again, but I said, “I don’t know what happened that day,” I said, “it’s a miracle, because I -- I can’t -- I can’t discuss.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: Did it mean something to you that they were so involved?</span> <span id="s2139">Was that goo -- good for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: Oh, of cour --</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: It must have been, yes, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: -- oh, you should see the way the children came and hugged me, and one black child was there, and -- what did he say?</span> <span id="s2143">I don’t remember what, he said something that impressed me, but I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s2144">And -- and the one Jewish girl, her mother ma -- married a -- a Jew, and her mother was -- she said that, “If I lived at that time in Europe,” she said, “that’s what they will do to me, too, even though.”</span> <span id="s2145">I said yes.</span> <span id="s2146">It doesn’t make [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2147">I had to be honest, you know.</span> <span id="s2148">Because it doesn’t -- if one of the parent Jew, they go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2150">So, if that was so meaningful, why do you think you didn’t do it again?</span> <span id="s2151">You think it was some miracle?</span> <span id="s2152">It was some odd event?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: It couldn’t have been me, I couldn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: It couldn’t be you?</span> <span id="s2155">I don’t think you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: That’s what I used to say, why doesn’t me believe me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: Tell me something, what do you -- what did all of this teach you, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: Well, it teaches me to learn lessons from the past, and not to ne -- e -- repeat them again, because we’re getting more interesting, more intelligent, it’s -- it’s why go through this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: You think the world has changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: It hasn’t change, but we want to change.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: Yeah, they can see all these things.</span> <span id="s2163">Instead of having all of these ugly movies and everything, we should have more history, say what happened, you know?</span> <span id="s2164">And things keep repeating and repeating, and they’re getting worse now.</span> <span id="s2165">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: So do you really think people can learn from the past?</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: I don’t think, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: But you as an individual, did you think that these events changed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: Of course I’m not the same person that I was before, but I’m stronger.</span> <span id="s2170">Maybe you see me now walking when I [indecipherable] today I wasn’t feeling well.</span> <span id="s2171">But I feel strong inside of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: And I feel like we have to do the best we can, and talk.</span> <span id="s2174">Talk not maliciously, talk in the way that we can understand each other, and be friends with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: And everybody can, if they want to pray to God, or they want to pray to Christ, and they can do that.</span> <span id="s2177">But you can -- there’s no reason for us not to talk, not to be friends.</span> <span id="s2178">We all are children of God.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: But you also learned that from your father, didn’t you, in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: Well -- well, I -- I think I learned more from my uncle [indecipherable] than my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2183">He was very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: My father wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2186">He would wake up in the morning and he’ll put his --</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Tefillin on, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">A: Uh-huh, yeah.</span> <span id="s2189">And five o’clock he’ll be up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: This is your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A: He was a very good man, and very religious.</span> <span id="s2192">None of us was -- was religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: Was -- yes.</span> <span id="s2194">And you’re more religious now than you were when you were a child, when you were younger, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: Well, I believe -- n-now I believe that our religion makes sense, you know?</span> <span id="s2196">And I don’t see any other makes sense as a -- as ours.</span> <span id="s2197">And I think it’s superior.</span> <span id="s2198">And I feel like how can anybody believe anything else, you know, and we do.</span> <span id="s2199">We made mistakes, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: But still, I think, we gave the best to the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2203">Is there anything more you’d like to say?</span> <span id="s2204">Something I haven’t asked you, or [indecipherable] think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: You don’t know, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: I wish I can think something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: Let me ask you what’s -- what -- I don’t even know if it’s a fair question.</span> <span id="s2209">Do you wish all of that didn’t happen?</span> <span id="s2210">I know -- I mean it -- clearly you wish that your relatives hadn’t died, and other people hadn’t died.</span> <span id="s2211">But in terms of what happened to you, since you survived, do you look at your life and say I just wish all of that didn’t happen, or is there something about it that actually became important for you in who you became?</span> <span id="s2212">I don’t know if that’s even a fair question, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: Well, I thi -- I couldn’t wait to -- to be free.</span> <span id="s2214">And I thought the first thing that I would do is I would go to a mountain and thank God, you know?</span> <span id="s2215">Or -- but I was too sick and -- to do that, I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s2216">First thi -- I -- I had -- I couldn’t understand why God did this to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">A: Couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s2219">But now I feel maybe they are in better place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: And I’m not afraid to die myself.</span> <span id="s2222">I’m going with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: Well, I want to thank you.</span> <span id="s2224">It’s really been wonderful to be with you today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: Oh, I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: It really has, it’s been a pleasure for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">A: Okay, oh, you -- you’re wonderful.</span> <span id="s2228">I couldn’t do it with anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Q: Oh, well, well.</span> <span id="s2230">It’s really be very moving for me to be with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: Thanks so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Beginning Tape Six
