is married.</span> <span id="s26">She has two children.</span> <span id="s27">And I lived there until I got married.</span> <span id="s28">Then we moved to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Tell me about when you were very little, growing up.</span> <span id="s30">What was it like to be a little child in that family in Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Well, I have very pleasant memories.</span> <span id="s32">I remember, well I was very young, and I remember when the Germans came–</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Let's do before.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Before the Germans came?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Let's back up.</span> <span id="s36">You were very little.</span> <span id="s37">You were a child.</span> <span id="s38">What did your father do?</span> <span id="s39">What was his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: My father had a business, men's clothing business, on the main street in Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s41">We were – he was – we were what you call pretty well-to-do.</span> <span id="s42">And, my mother didn't work, and I was little and my sister I think she was in school.</span> <span id="s43">Yeah, we were both young.</span> <span id="s44">It was a very pleasant life.</span> <span id="s45">We had a maid.</span> <span id="s46">We lived in an apartment and I just have very good memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Tell me, did you have lots of friends?</span> <span id="s48">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Well….</span> <span id="s50">You talking about before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s52">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: I was just four years old.</span> <span id="s54">I don't – I just remember going downstairs and playing with a tricycle on the street.</span> <span id="s55">People weren't afraid of letting the children out alone, and I have only good memories.</span> <span id="s56">I don't remember the other friends.</span> <span id="s57">It is a long time ago, but just pleasant memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: What do you remember of when the Germans came?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Well, I know that my uncle called up – my, my mother's brother called us up.</span> <span id="s60">I remember that.</span> <span id="s61">And he said, "Go downstairs on the street and look up in the sky.</span> <span id="s62">The Germans are invading Denmark."</span> <span id="s63">And I remember very – like it was yesterday going down with my father and my mother and my sister looking up and all of a sudden seeing sky was full of black airplanes.</span> <span id="s64">That was April 9, 1940 – 1940, April 9th, and the Germans were coming and – like a little kid was excitement.</span> <span id="s65">I didn't realize what will happen.</span> <span id="s66">And the Danes fought for, I think, two hours and then they were occupied.</span> <span id="s67">They were taken over.</span> <span id="s68">Denmark is a small country.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Was there any change in your life once the Germans occupied?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Not that I can remember.</span> <span id="s71">No.</span> <span id="s72">Denmark went on as usual.</span> <span id="s73">Nothing happened to the Danes or the Jews and Germany was sort of a friendly takeover.</span> <span id="s74">The Danes cooperated.</span> <span id="s75">The police was still – I mean they hated the Germans, but they didn't, you know they didn't fight them because there was still Danish police stay – still stayed for few years.</span> <span id="s76">And the government stayed.</span> <span id="s77">It was really like sort of a benign takeover for a few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">01:03:55</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Did you go to school?</span> <span id="s80">By that time you would be six?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s82">I went to first grade.</span> <span id="s83">I went to Jewish school.</span> <span id="s84">Carolineskolen, it was called.</span> <span id="s85">I think I went to first grade and second grade before we fled.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Tell me about it.</span> <span id="s87">Tell me about that school.</span> <span id="s88">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: It was only Jewish.</span> <span id="s90">We were girls and boys in the class.</span> <span id="s91">And I liked it.</span> <span id="s92">It was a nice school.</span> <span id="s93">I just, I just remember now that it was Chanukah time.</span> <span id="s94">I remember learning the “Ma’oz Tzur” in class.</span> <span id="s95">And I remember just one instance that – you know, although we weren't religious, but it was still when you sat in Denmark in those days, you had to sit with your hands folded like when you were quiet.</span> <span id="s96">But being it was a Jewish school and we shouldn't make a cross, we sat with our hands without, without folding them, like this.</span> <span id="s97">It was just a, a little memory, but it was interesting.</span> <span id="s98">And we went to school, I think it was from eight to two, like all other schools.</span> <span id="s99">And I don't know if we learned Hebrew.</span> <span id="s100">Denmark is really not a religious – even the Jews weren't religious in those days, but it was a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s101">I, I remember some of my friends.</span> <span id="s102">I remember one friend from the class kept saying – this was only in like 1941 or '42 – that she heard rumors that the Germans were going to do something to the Jews.</span> <span id="s103">But that was like a year before it really happened that there were big boats waiting in the harbor to take the Jews.</span> <span id="s104">But we sort of didn't believe her.</span> <span id="s105">It proved to be right in the long run, but this was like a year before.</span> <span id="s106">One of my classmates–</span></p> <p><span id="s107">01:05:57</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: What was your impression, as a child, of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, nothing at all oppressive.</span> <span id="s110">I have no – we didn't know what was going on the world and the Germans did nothing to the Jews.</span> <span id="s111">My father had an open store with our name.</span> <span id="s112">My maiden name is Schønbaum, which is sort of Jewish or German.</span> <span id="s113">And he had a, you know, store with his name on and it was going on, and nothing at all happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s114">We went to Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s115">All, all Christian schools, whatever public schools, whatever.</span> <span id="s116">I mean maybe because I was so young.</span> <span id="s117">Maybe my husband has different memories, but I don't remember anything negative at all about the occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: What did you and your friends do to play, say after school?</span> <span id="s119">Did you go to ballet lessons?</span> <span id="s120">Did you take piano lessons?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: I did, yeah.</span> <span id="s122">But I don't know now if I am thinking if it was after we came back from Sweden or before.</span> <span id="s123">But I did a lot.</span> <span id="s124">I went to tap dancing, acrobatics – yes, acrobatics in Danish.</span> <span id="s125">I took dancing lessons after school.</span> <span id="s126">We went skiing.</span> <span id="s127">You know there are not that many hills in Denmark, but we went with a train.</span> <span id="s128">We went to small hills.</span> <span id="s129">I had a very good childhood.</span> <span id="s130">I played tennis.</span> <span id="s131">My father was an avid tennis player so we would always rent houses at the beach where there were tennis courts.</span> <span id="s132">And we always had a maid and I just remember everything as being very pleasant and nice.</span> <span id="s133">Some of the memories are, I am sure, from when we came back, because you have to remember I was young when we fled.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">01:07:29</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: When did you get a sense of something changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Only the day we heard that we shouldn't go home that night.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Tell me what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Well, we were told, I think it came from the synagogue, from the Rabbi.</span> <span id="s139">He had heard that the Germans were going to round up the Jews.</span> <span id="s140">It was on a Friday night and we shouldn't – none of us should go home to our apartments or houses.</span> <span id="s141">And I remember we had a maid and she just took care of the apartment.</span> <span id="s142">She stayed home, and we went.</span> <span id="s143">I remember, my father, mother, sister and I and an uncle who was married to a non-Jew, he also wanted to flee with us, and his wife stayed home – stayed in their apartment because they wouldn't – they weren't going to touch, touch the non-Jews.</span> <span id="s144">So the five of us – I remember, I – we put on two, two dresses and a toothbrush in the pocket.</span> <span id="s145">That's all we fled with.</span> <span id="s146">And we went and....</span> <span id="s147">Would you like to hear about how we fled?</span> <span id="s148">We went to the train.</span> <span id="s149">No.</span> <span id="s150">First – I remember – first, we knew it would cost to flee.</span> <span id="s151">We would have to pay.</span> <span id="s152">We knew that fisherman were going to charge about 2,000 crowns a head.</span> <span id="s153">That's what we were told.</span> <span id="s154">So my father took a cab.</span> <span id="s155">On the same day in Copenhagen he went to the bank and he took money out and I remember he brought my mother also.</span> <span id="s156">We were told that we shouldn't take money to Sweden because we weren't going to use them.</span> <span id="s157">And he bought a bracelet, as a matter of fact, for my mother.</span> <span id="s158">And when I was 50, she sent me – she send it to me.</span> <span id="s159">And this is the one that she sent me.</span> <span id="s160">And that is what he bought and I saw it had gotten smaller, narrower, but I thought maybe as a child I remember it as being bigger.</span> <span id="s161">But now that my mother passed away two years ago and I inherit the other bracelet which is exactly the same, but just much wider.</span> <span id="s162">I have that at home.</span> <span id="s163">But I remember that.</span> <span id="s164">He went to the bank, took the money, bought bracelet for my mother and the rest of the money he took in his pocket to pay the fisherman.</span> <span id="s165">And then he went home and we all got dressed and like I said, we had two dresses on.</span> <span id="s166">It was October so I guess a coat you would wear.</span> <span id="s167">Remember was two dresses instead of one.</span> <span id="s168">And my father probably had two suits.</span> <span id="s169">That I don't remember, but my sister and I had two dresses on and a – we each had a toothbrush.</span> <span id="s170">We bought new toothbrushes and put in our pockets and then we went to the train station.</span> <span id="s171">And strangely enough, nobody stopped us.</span> <span id="s172">Not the Germans either.</span> <span id="s173">I mean you could see people coming out on the train and there was no, no, no–nobody stopped us and we went up from Copenhagen to Snekkersten, which is a place that's closest at the seashore to Sweden.</span> <span id="s174">I mean, my father took care of everything.</span> <span id="s175">We were kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">01:10:19</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s178">What do you remember of that train ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: I remember sitting there and being a little scared, but I didn't really know what being scared meant because we hadn't experienced anything bad.</span> <span id="s180">So it was a little bit of an excitement for me.</span> <span id="s181">And I also think we did have one suitcase along, but I am not l00 percent sure.</span> <span id="s182">But I just knew that nobody stopped us.</span> <span id="s183">Nobody came over and there were no Germans on the train to inspect it.</span> <span id="s184">Later on, you see all these stories of people being asked to show passports.</span> <span id="s185">It wasn't – didn't happen.</span> <span id="s186">The only thing that happened was, while we were away that they would – they came to our apartment to ask for us.</span> <span id="s187">That I know and I know that our maid said when she opened the door.</span> <span id="s188">They knocked, Friday night, on the door.</span> <span id="s189">We weren't home.</span> <span id="s190">This is just what we heard.</span> <span id="s191">They knocked on everybody's door.</span> <span id="s192">They had a list from the synagogue about all the Jews, where we lived and she said – when she opened and asked for us, she said, "They wouldn’t be so stupid to stay home."</span> <span id="s193">And she just closed the door.</span> <span id="s194">They didn't go in.</span> <span id="s195">They didn't – maybe they went in to look, but they didn't take anything from the apartment.</span> <span id="s196">They left everything intact.</span> <span id="s197">And as a matter of fact, I don't know if I am wondering if I should continue.</span> <span id="s198">My father had bought a house.</span> <span id="s199">We lived in an apartment in the suburb of Denmark [Copenhagen], and he had bought a house meanwhile.</span> <span id="s200">But we didn't get to move into it and when, when we came back from Sweden, we moved into the house.</span> <span id="s201">It was furnished and everything and he rented it out to a woman before we left, and that woman married a German soldier or Kommandant.</span> <span id="s202">So when we came home from Sweden – my memories are coming back now – there were Hitler's picture all over the wall.</span> <span id="s203">And the movers were, you know, like the Danish movers, they kicked and it was like they kicked all the pictures down from the wall and you know they were very angry.</span> <span id="s204">But otherwise the house was standing and, you know, a lot of furniture was there and then we moved into when we came back from Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">01:12:24</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s207">Let's go back to the train ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Meanwhile, let's go back to the train ride.</span> <span id="s209">We were on the train ride.</span> <span id="s210">It takes about 30 minutes, the train ride from Copenhagen to Snekkersten.</span> <span id="s211">I don't know why my father knew to get off at from Snekkersten.</span> <span id="s212">He didn't know anybody there except that he was closest to Sweden, and we got off the train station, went down the stairs, you know, out off the train and a man comes to us.</span> <span id="s213">Tall, I don't remember his face exactly.</span> <span id="s214">He was – he looked he would be about 40 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s215">And he said, "I know why you are here.</span> <span id="s216">I am Mr. Bagge, Herr Bagge.</span> <span id="s217">Please come with me.”</span> <span id="s218">And we just followed him and we came into a big white house and he said, "Just stay with me.</span> <span id="s219">I'll take care of you ‘til we find you a fishing boat to take you to Sweden."</span> <span id="s220">And he took about a week.</span> <span id="s221">We stayed there and you know, we had – it was upstairs.</span> <span id="s222">We stayed in his house.</span> <span id="s223">And everyday – my father's blond so he didn't look Jewish, so he and Mr. Bagge would go – I mean my mother and I were dark or I wouldn't have gone.</span> <span id="s224">But my father was blond and he went with Mr. Bagge every day down to the – to see if you could get a fishing boat to take us to Sweden.</span> <span id="s225">You know, you had to get a man that would take us and pay and everything.</span> <span id="s226">And it was hard because everybody was trying to flee at the same time.</span> <span id="s227">And one day my father came home and said he got a rowboat instead.</span> <span id="s228">He couldn't get a fishing boat.</span> <span id="s229">He got a rowboat.</span> <span id="s230">So we would go that night.</span> <span id="s231">And we all got dressed and were ready to leave and then he didn't come to pick us, the man.</span> <span id="s232">And they said that – I think he did come and he shows his hands and they had big blisters on it from the night before and he couldn't row again he said.</span> <span id="s233">So we couldn't go.</span> <span id="s234">And then, I think it took one or two more days, my father came back and he said – I mean, he came back every time with Mr. Bagge – that they found somebody would take us the next day at three o'clock.</span> <span id="s235">It was during the day, which itself was strange that we were able to flee during the day, but I was told later on that the Germans were paid off.</span> <span id="s236">So, the Germans that were guarding the harbor, it was a harbor, wouldn't say anything.</span> <span id="s237">So that day we just walked down from Mr. Bagge's house.</span> <span id="s238">I remember when we left, I remember his kitchen had a big picture window and he turned around and he cried and he just hoped we would get over there safely.</span> <span id="s239">He was such a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s240">I mean he risked his life and he didn't do it just for us.</span> <span id="s241">He did it, lots of people went through his house.</span> <span id="s242">And every October second – we fled October second, and that day my father would always send him a present in silver to commemorate the day.</span> <span id="s243">I just heard that he had died now.</span> <span id="s244">But I don't know when, but he died an old man.</span> <span id="s245">But he really saved many, many people.</span> <span id="s246">So we walked down to the fishing boat and I remember was the going down – you know this fishing boat has where the fish is usually square opening?</span> <span id="s247">We went way downstairs and we were with 14 people.</span> <span id="s248">It took more than us, and it was a family that I knew and I met the children.</span> <span id="s249">They were the same age as me.</span> <span id="s250">I just met them in Israel.</span> <span id="s251">Their name was Marcus.</span> <span id="s252">I remember and they had an old aunt along and she – I remember her putting her foot down, in the fishing boat to go down and she said, "Oh, I forgot my umbrella.</span> <span id="s253">I have to go home and get it."</span> <span id="s254">And my father took her leg and pulled it down and said, "You are not going back home.</span> <span id="s255">We are leaving."</span></p> <p><span id="s256">01:15:38 And, and then we all sat around, you know, was very dark down there, and they closed up the, the opening of the boat and then the fisherman came on board and we left.</span> <span id="s257">And I remember everybody being seasick and I was a little child.</span> <span id="s258">I mean how old I was in '40?</span> <span id="s259">Six years old?</span> <span id="s260">And I remember I was so proud of myself.</span> <span id="s261">I was the only one not being seasick.</span> <span id="s262">And we stayed very quietly and the boat went out.</span> <span id="s263">And when we were in the middle of the ocean between Sweden – it was about 30 minutes into Sweden – between Sweden and Denmark, a big boat came and we were afraid it was Germans because there were soldiers on it.</span> <span id="s264">They were dressed – they looked just like Germans.</span> <span id="s265">But it was a Swedish patrol boat that came to pick us up.</span> <span id="s266">They came in Swedish waters.</span> <span id="s267">They were allowed to go out and the Germans couldn't….</span> <span id="s268">And then we were safe.</span> <span id="s269">The Germans couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s270">They came a big boat and they helped us up from the fishing boat and we stayed on the deck.</span> <span id="s271">Then we were, we were saved.</span> <span id="s272">And we went into a little harbor in Sweden.</span> <span id="s273">I think it was right outside of Helsingborg.</span> <span id="s274">Yeah, Helsingborg.</span> <span id="s275">And, you know, they're welcoming us; and they all look like Germans because the Swedes – they were wearing the same dresses and we came in and we got coffee, tea and they told us where we could stay.</span> <span id="s276">They put us actually in the Grand Hotel.</span> <span id="s277">It's called the Grand Hotel.</span> <span id="s278">They paid for the suites, paid for everything and they said we could stay there ‘til if we had any relatives in Sweden we could go to them.</span> <span id="s279">I think we stayed about a week.</span> <span id="s280">Every day my parents would go down to the harbor to see if my grandparents had come.</span> <span id="s281">They will still – and an old aunt I had, my grandfather's sister, they were still in Denmark when we fled.</span> <span id="s282">And a few days later, four, five days later they came on another fishing boat.</span> <span id="s283">I am not sure where they came from, but I know that everyday my parents went down to hear if they had come.</span> <span id="s284">And we were all saved.</span> <span id="s285">And we stayed in the hotel, until my father – my mother had relatives, an uncle in Malmö, so we went to them.</span> <span id="s286">And I remember in that apartment there were lots of other Danes, relatives and I remember we slept on one of these beds you pull out for two, and we slept all four in them.</span> <span id="s287">And, and the only sad thing I remember from there was – remember I was only six or seven – that the other children that were there, they had some relatives that bought them a little doll and I didn't get a doll.</span> <span id="s288">I remember still that I was very unhappy I didn't get that doll.</span> <span id="s289">But we stayed with this family.</span> <span id="s290">You see my father was young.</span> <span id="s291">My father must have been at that time when he's born in 1906 so he was 30, 40 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s292">He got out and got a job.</span> <span id="s293">First, he got an apartment for us, ‘cause he had some money along, and he got us an apartment – “Västergatan,” small apartment.</span> <span id="s294">I remember we had to buy it furnished with real junky, furniture we bought it and we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">01:18:55</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Where did your father get the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Well, he had money.</span> <span id="s298">Well, he had taken some money along, but actually it cost 2,000 for every – we paid 8,000, 10,000 crowns for the five of us.</span> <span id="s299">I remember my uncle was there too.</span> <span id="s300">But I think that they did give us money.</span> <span id="s301">That's right.</span> <span id="s302">The Swedes gave us money.</span> <span id="s303">They gave us coupons to eat so we could go into a beautiful restaurant to eat.</span> <span id="s304">And they gave us money, pocket money until we got ourselves – I mean they were wonderful, the Swedes – ‘til we got ourselves established.</span> <span id="s305">My father got a job right away selling artificial teeth.</span> <span id="s306">He would travel.</span> <span id="s307">I remember the little package with the teeth and he would travel and come home and he got, you know, salary for that.</span> <span id="s308">My mother got a job in a store.</span> <span id="s309">What is that called?</span> <span id="s310">With women's clothes, lingerie?</span> <span id="s311">These were Swedish people either that we knew before.</span> <span id="s312">I think that my parents must have known them.</span> <span id="s313">And my sister got a job.</span> <span id="s314">My sister was five years older.</span> <span id="s315">I think she was watching children, little children.</span> <span id="s316">And I, I just played and we lived in that apartment the whole – in Västergatan – during the war we lived.</span> <span id="s317">We moved and then we moved away from our relatives moved into the apartment.</span> <span id="s318">Now I know my father – the first job was not with the artificial teeth.</span> <span id="s319">The first job was in a chocolates – chocolate factory called Mazetti.</span> <span id="s320">It is a very famous Swedish chocolate factory.</span> <span id="s321">And they would always give him chocolate when he left to go home to us every day to the – you know they always call us the “flykting,” in Swedish.</span> <span id="s322">“Flykting,” which means, “the refugees.”</span> <span id="s323">And they were very nice to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">01:20:34</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: What did you do as a child at this point?</span> <span id="s326">You are in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: In Sweden?</span> <span id="s328">Well, the first – I don't remember when they made the Swedish school, but I would say at the first half year I just played.</span> <span id="s329">I didn't – my best friend I remember had another apartment.</span> <span id="s330">Her parents had another apartment.</span> <span id="s331">At the same street they rented another apartment.</span> <span id="s332">We would get together to play and – so, I didn't do anything ‘til they started opening a school in Sweden, a Danish school in Lund.</span> <span id="s333">I think it was after we had been there a few months or maybe even half a year.</span> <span id="s334">They opened the school and I would go and I went into third grade.</span> <span id="s335">And my sister was five grades ahead of me.</span> <span id="s336">And then we would go everyday to school like in Denmark.</span> <span id="s337">They would make it with the Principal was Danish.</span> <span id="s338">Her name was Lachman.</span> <span id="s339">And there was another very good teacher.</span> <span id="s340">His name was Bertelsen.</span> <span id="s341">He wrote a book later on about it.</span> <span id="s342">He wrote a book called October 2, 1943.</span> <span id="s343">Aage Bertelsen.</span> <span id="s344">He was a head teacher, the headmaster.</span> <span id="s345">And she was the Principal.</span> <span id="s346">And we went to a little – I went to a little school.</span> <span id="s347">It was like a school and a big school, probably like elementary and more of a high school.</span> <span id="s348">And it was very pleasant.</span> <span id="s349">It was a 20-minute ride with a train to Västergatan, from Malmö to Lund.</span> <span id="s350">And we had regular school – we work.</span> <span id="s351">And my sister, of course, stopped working also.</span> <span id="s352">She went to school.</span> <span id="s353">She went to – it's called mellemskole, the middle school.</span> <span id="s354">Probably like ninth or 10th grade.</span> <span id="s355">And I remember for lunch, they had a place where we all would go to eat.</span> <span id="s356">It would be for kosher and non-kosher.</span> <span id="s357">A big place!</span> <span id="s358">And I also remember I had piano lessons in Sweden after hours, I remember.</span> <span id="s359">So we lived a pretty regular life.</span> <span id="s360">And then my father got this other job, which was better paid, I guess, working for his friends selling teeth.</span> <span id="s361">That he did the rest of the, of the occupation.</span> <span id="s362">And, I mean, life went on.</span> <span id="s363">It was a very good time for us.</span> <span id="s364">There was nothing, no hardship.</span> <span id="s365">We, you know, they – like they gave us money ‘til we could – very soon my father, you know, got the job, and my mother.</span> <span id="s366">We didn't need to get any money from Sweden.</span> <span id="s367">And also a very strange thing is that my father's business in Denmark continued, with a Jewish name, continued going, and they sent us money over.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">01:23:10</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: How did they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: I don't know how they sent the money.</span> <span id="s371">I just know that the Germans did not touch any Jewish store, any Jewish home.</span> <span id="s372">Everything stood intact and went on as before, which is very strange even after they, you know, so to speak got rid of all the Jews.</span> <span id="s373">I don't know how they sent money over, but they did.</span> <span id="s374">Curious.</span> <span id="s375">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s376">And I know that it went on and my father's – all his employees – he had like about 20 people working for him – and they all took care of it and they were very honest.</span> <span id="s377">They sent money over or kept it.</span> <span id="s378">I mean there was no stealing, no looting.</span> <span id="s379">You know, wasn't – the Danes are good people.</span> <span id="s380">They didn't only save us.</span> <span id="s381">They saved our things.</span> <span id="s382">Saved our things.</span> <span id="s383">So, like I said, it was, it was not a bad life in Sweden for us.</span> <span id="s384">It was a good life</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did you hear at all about what was going on in Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: In Denmark, not so much.</span> <span id="s387">We didn't know the bad things that were going on in the world or.</span> <span id="s388">… No, I don't think anybody believed it or knew it.</span> <span id="s389">No.</span> <span id="s390">That's why we weren't really afraid either when the Germans were occupying Denmark.</span> <span id="s391">We weren't scared because we never.</span> <span id="s392">… I don't think we knew or maybe because I was so young, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s393">But I don't think we knew what was going on in the world at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">01:24:41</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: What – you are in Sweden.</span> <span id="s396">You are going to school.</span> <span id="s397">By then you would have been seven, eight, nine.</span> <span id="s398">You didn't hear anything about what was happening, about even in terms of Denmark, their attempts to round up the Jews?</span> <span id="s399">You didn't know about any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: No.</span> <span id="s401">No.</span> <span id="s402">Well, we knew they were going to – that they were attempting and we knew that 99 percent of the Jews were saved, because we knew – you know, we met people and, and the only ones that were taken were the ones that didn't believe it and stayed home.</span> <span id="s403">Which was about 400 people.</span> <span id="s404">And those 400 people were all sort of taken care of specially.</span> <span id="s405">I don't know if you want to hear about that, but they weren't….</span> <span id="s406">No.</span> <span id="s407">Where they went – no, that's not–</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: No.</span> <span id="s409">What we want is just your story at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Right.</span> <span id="s411">Well, I mean my whole family was saved.</span> <span id="s412">My grandparents, they also went to Malmö.</span> <span id="s413">They lived there in an apartment.</span> <span id="s414">My mother's parents and my mother's brothers and sisters with their family.</span> <span id="s415">Everybody was saved and they all lived either in Malmö or in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s416">Somebody lived near Lund.</span> <span id="s417">And we got together with them, and we had like a normal life there.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Did your parents or did any member of your family that you know of have any connections or involvement with the resistance or with any groups that were?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Well, my father became a brigadier.</span> <span id="s420">I think it's called a brigadier – Brigade in Danish.</span> <span id="s421">He was 40 years old and they, they trained them in Sweden.</span> <span id="s422">They trained them to go back when the Germany – when they, when they capitulated.</span> <span id="s423">When they knew that it was going towards the end of the war and they were going to send them back to help round up the Germans and so my – the minute the war was over, my father left with the whole battalion of soldiers.</span> <span id="s424">And we stayed in Sweden.</span> <span id="s425">We didn't go back to Denmark ‘til May 28th.</span> <span id="s426">The war was over May fifth, I believe.</span> <span id="s427">Germany gave up.</span> <span id="s428">But we stayed ‘til, you know – I guess we all, all the Danes went back on one big boat to Sweden – to Denmark, on May 28.</span> <span id="s429">And I remember that very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">01:27:21</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Describe that trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: That trip – I just remember standing on this tremendous boat, being very happy going back.</span> <span id="s433">You know, this was just my mother and my sister and I. And I remember when we came towards the shore, all the Danes – millions of Danes, thousands of Danes were standing there with red and white flags, the Dannebrog waving, welcoming us back.</span> <span id="s434">And they were wonderful all the way.</span> <span id="s435">And I just remember we went to, to the house we had my father had bought before the war.</span> <span id="s436">And that's why I remember all, all these pictures that were broken on the floor from German soldiers and, and I also know my sister stayed back because she stayed for another month to graduate.</span> <span id="s437">She was in a middle school where you had ‘til – I guess it's like high school here.</span> <span id="s438">So, in order to graduate they had to finish the year.</span> <span id="s439">So they – she stayed.</span> <span id="s440">I think they went to Lund and stayed there.</span> <span id="s441">It was like about 30 people, from that class, that had to stay.</span> <span id="s442">And when she came back her classmates from school came to welcome her in the house.</span> <span id="s443">I remember that.</span> <span id="s444">She – in our house and they came all over to welcome her back.</span> <span id="s445">And–</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: What was the–?</span> <span id="s447">You came back to Denmark.</span> <span id="s448">You found this house.</span> <span id="s449">Did you go to your apartment, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: No, because my father had bought it before and I think that the maid probably had moved all the furniture or I am not sure.</span> <span id="s451">But we never went to the apartment.</span> <span id="s452">That was rented out.</span> <span id="s453">But all our stuff was completely where we – nothing was stolen.</span> <span id="s454">And I know my father had a car before the war.</span> <span id="s455">It was still standing there.</span> <span id="s456">And his business was still running, with the same foreman and same people working there.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Did he get his business back?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s459">He just, he just started back.</span> <span id="s460">And it was just running as if he had been there, there all the time.</span> <span id="s461">Which was strange, that they – it was strange that the German's didn't close down the Jewish businesses.</span> <span id="s462">They didn't.</span> <span id="s463">And I started school, and then I must start in a new school.</span> <span id="s464">I went to a public school then, in the fourth grade.</span> <span id="s465">Fourth, fifth grade I stayed there.</span> <span id="s466">And, you know, everybody was asking us, “What happened in Sweden?</span> <span id="s467">How were you’re experiences?”</span> <span id="s468">And everybody was curious.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Did you either before or after the war, what did it feel like being Jewish particularly in Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Well, there was no– the way I look at it, there was no difference between being Jewish and not Jewish.</span> <span id="s471">And I did not come from a religious background so maybe I never felt anything and I remember very – I mean today I feel differently, but I remember standing outside our house with some friends.</span> <span id="s472">We had just been going to dance class and we were discussing whether one should marry – one should stay and marry only Jewish people, and they all felt sure, and they were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s473">I remember they were saying that they felt that Jews should marry Jews.</span> <span id="s474">And I say, “Why you marry?</span> <span id="s475">You are in love with them.”</span> <span id="s476">This is my background I guess.</span> <span id="s477">You don't marry for religion.</span> <span id="s478">You marry.</span> <span id="s479">But we really did not feel any difference, there was – of being Jewish or not Jewish in Denmark didn't.</span> <span id="s480">My husband might tell you different stories.</span> <span id="s481">I don't know – because he comes from a religious background.</span> <span id="s482">So it's different.</span> <span id="s483">But I, I didn't feel any discrimination ever.</span> <span id="s484">Never heard the word “Jew” said.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">01:31:10 And I went to – well, the first few years I went to Jewish schools and when I came back, I was – there was one more boy that was Jewish in the class.</span> <span id="s486">When I went to the higher schools, there was another girl.</span> <span id="s487">I went to an all girls’ school then from sixth grade ‘til I graduated.</span> <span id="s488">And there were two Jews in the class: me and another girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Did you feel any difference because there were only two of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No, I never even thought – it’s just that I knew her and I knew her family, that I know she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s491">But no, I never felt anything different between being Jewish and not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: What was it like immediately after the war in Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: How I remember that, we couldn’t get chocolate.</span> <span id="s494">Because I knew my father would buy things that nobody could get, so he would like buy – you know, it was rationing, and he would get it for us.</span> <span id="s495">But it was not a hard life.</span> <span id="s496">We went to school and just classes – I know people didn’t have as many cars as we do now.</span> <span id="s497">I would go by bicycle to school always, like everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Is there anything you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s500">Except that I love the Danes and I think the best part that happened to me, is that I’m Danish.</span> <span id="s501">I’ve always been – I feel very fortunate to be born there and I love the country.</span> <span id="s502">What they did for the Jews, the way they – later on I realized what other countries had done to their people, and I realized that it was not that the Germans were better in Denmark, it was because the Danes were better.</span> <span id="s503">So, I think that should be known always, never forgotten.</span> <span id="s504">Alright?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">01:33:10</span></p> <p><span id="s509">[Conclusion of interview] Ma’oz Tzur Yeshu’ati [Stronghold and Rock of My Salvation] (Hebrew); popular Chanukah
