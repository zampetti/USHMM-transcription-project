id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Brooks McClure, on July 7th, 2011, here at the co – Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, at the m – hol -- United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s12">And Mr. McClure, thank you very much for agreeing to meet with us today.</span> <span id="s13">I’m going to start the interview as fairy tales do, at the very beginning.</span> <span id="s14">And that’s going to be to ask you your – when you were born, the date you were born, what was your family like, and we’ll take it from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Answer: Well, I was born in – on March 8th, 1919 in New York City, and lived there for the next 20 years of my life.</span> <span id="s16">I never went back, really.</span> <span id="s17">So I – my recollections of course, are of a nearly ra – a disruptive period.</span> <span id="s18">We were going through the Great Depression, and I thought for a while I was more or less exempt from the effects of this thing.</span> <span id="s19">But my father was an engineer and he got very sick early in his life, and died at 53.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: This was 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: So you were 21 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I was 21, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And had you liv – when you said New York City, were you – did you grow up in Manhattan, or in the outer boroughs?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I grew up in Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s27">Had you done – attended college?</span> <span id="s28">Had you finished high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: No, that was the thing you see.</span> <span id="s30">We were relatively well-off, and also terribly conservative economically.</span> <span id="s31">So, we had no debt, and never borrowed from anybody for anything, and the result is that we were relatively well off when things went awry.</span> <span id="s32">But, there was a fund, of course, for the future, for my education [indecipherable] and that suddenly disappeared, because they knew that my father was mortally ill, and we were going to have to take over in some fashion, and this is – this would be very dis-disorganizing, as it was.</span> <span id="s33">And so –</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Did he – excuse me – did he have his own business, your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: No.</span> <span id="s37">He worked for somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: He worked for the New York state transportation department, and his own job had to do with train wrecks.</span> <span id="s39">When – when there was an accident, they had a team that went out and tried to find out why it happened.</span> <span id="s40">And he was very good at that business, I guess, because he went right through from – he was a very young man, almost an office boy when he arrived, and worked his way up.</span> <span id="s41">And the thing is, he had no education either.</span> <span id="s42">He – he was born in Ohio, and he went to the good schools.</span> <span id="s43">I guess you would say he was a very ambitious man, and he read all the time, and that was a great influence for me.</span> <span id="s44">He had me reading Dickens and Dumas when I was nine and 10 years old, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: That’s pretty impressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Well, if you starting at the right end –</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: – you know, for instance – well, I guess it was Robert Louis Stevenson, it was – was the start of my foreign education, and – what was it, the – “Treasure Island” was the first book.</span> <span id="s49">So, he very carefully chose the books to be at a level where I could understand, hopefully, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Were you his only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Were you his only child, or did you have br –</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: No, no, there was a girl after me.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: So you’re the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Well, I was – I was the eldest, yeah.</span> <span id="s56">And well, at any rate, I – I got a piece of education from reading, and I – the reading habit I got into, and had occasional troubles with my schoolteachers because they didn’t think that the family should race ahead of this program, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Curriculum, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: So, at any rate, he was a wonderful old man, and – but he – he got very, very sick.</span> <span id="s59">Heart can – heart condition, and we knew he wasn’t going to be around a long time, so we had to prepare for this.</span> <span id="s60">And the preparation did not include any possibility of going to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Because not only did we not have enough money to cover that, but I knew that with a high school education, at that time when jobs were very scarce, I didn’t have much of a chance.</span> <span id="s63">So – but I did have an interest, and the interest was in journalism, which actually I developed in the grammar school.</span> <span id="s64">And before I got out of grammar school, I had an idea, I – I had a – I wa – a little play friend, the – these correspondences with children from other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Oh, pen-pal.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Yeah, one of – one of my teachers went to, of all places, western Australia, which is just – just about west of anything in the wor – in the world.</span> <span id="s67">And so I-I got the – my friend sent me the local paper – matter of fact, all of the local papers.</span> <span id="s68">And I noticed that one was a weekly, which looked more like an American paper than any of the others.</span> <span id="s69">There was the lingering influence of the British journalism, with the ads on the page one and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s70">This was different, this had headlines on page one [indecipherable] news on page one.</span> <span id="s71">And I was really intrigued by this.</span> <span id="s72">And I had already started my self-education, read every book that had to do with journalism.</span> <span id="s73">I don’t know whether I understood it or not, but at any rate, I did that.</span> <span id="s74">And – and then one day I got the notion that maybe these people out in poor old Australia, would like to have a correspondent in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Not a bad notion.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: And I noticed that they had a regular correspondent in – in Asia who traveled around.</span> <span id="s77">And then they had another correspondent in London, which was home to the Australians.</span> <span id="s78">And so these were very special needs.</span> <span id="s79">One was, of course, the local aspect, of the – of news, and the other was London.</span> <span id="s80">And – but I said th – I-I decided to write a letter to the editor.</span> <span id="s81">So I went to the British – the – I don’t read it any more, but oh, I can’t remember the name of it.</span> <span id="s82">At any rate, it’s – was – it’s a – it’s a British publication, similar, but rather more serious than the World Almanac for – that we have.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: The Economist?</span> <span id="s84">Would it be the Economist?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No, no, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: – no, no, no, this i – no, no.</span> <span id="s88">No, it says – A2: You mean like the encyclopedia.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Sure, it’s got the name of a – of a the – research publication, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: But at any rate, it was the one place where they had all of the editors by name, everywhere in the British commonwealth.</span> <span id="s92">And so I thought, well, in the British commonwealth, they speak English, and that’s the only thing I can speak, so I wrote them a letter and I said, I am a student of journalism.</span> <span id="s93">No mention of grade, age, anything like that.</span> <span id="s94">So, I had the – and I followed my father’s rules.</span> <span id="s95">He said, when you write a letter, you keep it on one page, if you possibly can, because you lose the reader on the second page.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Absolutely right.</span> <span id="s97">Absolutely right.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: And so – so I followed all the rules, and I used the simplest language, don’t be fooled by the multi-syllable words.</span> <span id="s99">So I just said in plain English that I was a – a journalism student [indecipherable] without experience as of now, but I noticed their paper, and I noticed that they had correspondents in these other places, and none in the United States.</span> <span id="s100">So would they be interested in taking me on, course free, as a correspondent.</span> <span id="s101">And I thought afterwards, what a stupid thing to do, you know.</span> <span id="s102">I consulted no one, and I got – I had the shivers afterwards.</span> <span id="s103">Then, in the normal turn of events, which between the United States and – and Australia is about two months, I got a letter back, and it was from the publisher, who said, you know, we are – we are interested in you.</span> <span id="s104">We have to know a lot more about you, but then he said, let’s consider it a possibility.</span> <span id="s105">And so I did, I – I found the name of the editor of the publication: that was on the masthead of course, And I wrote him and sent him a very long article about the failure of the – o-o-of Roosevelt’s policies.</span> <span id="s106">Because at that time, it were – that was about 1937 was it, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: So you weren’t even 20 years old?</span> <span id="s108">You were like 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Oh, oh, I was far from 20 years old.</span> <span id="s110">I – I was [indecipherable] nothing man, I had – had absolutely nothing, so – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: But chutzpah.</span> <span id="s112">A lot of chutzpah.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Oh, a lot – a lot of – a lot of gall.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: So, I’d like to turn this now to – as you’re speaking, a number of thoughts are going through my mind.</span> <span id="s115">When I’ve interviewed other people who were part of liberating forces, U.S. forces, most of them do not have the exposure that it sounds like you did, to news, to world events, to – it – to people who were different from yourselves.</span> <span id="s116">So one of the key questions that I often ask somebody is, before they even get to Europe, did you meet anybody who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s117">Well, if you live in Manhattan, chances are you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: You couldn’t miss them.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Oh yes, well, that’s a Jewish city, almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: And then my second question is, is that if you were interested in news and journalism, were you aware, even as a teenager, of the news coming out of Europe, of what Germany was doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Oh, oh certainly.</span> <span id="s123">I was right – I – I was reading about Hitler, it seemed, when he first came up.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: To power.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: [indecipherable] by – what was his name?</span> <span id="s126">A famous, very arrogant guy, who seemed to win wars without thinking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A2: Hindenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Hindenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A2: Talking about Hindenburg, von Hindenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Von Hindenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A2: Paul von Hindenburg.</span> <span id="s132">Paul von Hindenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Paul von Hindenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: That’s right</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A2: The chancellor.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: The chancellor, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s142">And so I a – I was a con – conscious of the growth of Hitler.</span> <span id="s143">Actually, almost everybody was, but I read so much.</span> <span id="s144">I read internationally because I was interested in international affairs, but I was also – I-I was taught at home that you – you’re a man when you gu – when you’re born, and you use your brain from there on.</span> <span id="s145">And so it was a very good policy.</span> <span id="s146">And I had a mixed literary education, in that I – there was “Tarzan of the Apes,” which I also read, and the bi – the – was it the Hunter boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: A-Another series.</span> <span id="s149">And so here I was reading the classical 20th century – or 19th century literature from Europe, in English, of course, translated, and then these other books, and enjoying them both.</span> <span id="s150">But at any rate, no, I was really up on the news in Europe.</span> <span id="s151">There were a lot of other things too, the same time, an awful lot of trouble there.</span> <span id="s152">France was having a terrible time.</span> <span id="s153">This was followed up by the other activities that are – were very ominous in Japan.</span> <span id="s154">They were going after Manchukuo – ma – Manchuria.</span> <span id="s155">And – and in Africa the Italians were trying to take over –</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Ethiopia.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Ethiopia.</span> <span id="s158">So, it was a very disturbing time, interesting time.</span> <span id="s159">I can’t say that I was scared by it.</span> <span id="s160">I was intrigued by it, and there was some very good books at the time coming out, various commentators; professional journalists wrote books.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Well, William Shirer, I think, was based in Berlin at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Oh yeah, well I – he was a giant in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: – in the group.</span> <span id="s165">But at any rate, there was a great deal of concentration on the things that counted abroad, and also many of the problems at home.</span> <span id="s166">We had no military policy, and we were – we were terribly weak at the time, and that was one of the big issues coming up in the United States, how do we protect it?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: So I’d like to turn it back to, again, what you talked about earlier in your father, and his role in your education.</span> <span id="s168">And – did these – these events, these world events that you are talking about, not only in Europe but elsewhere, but of course for us it’s particularly what was going on in Europe; were you discussing these at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Oh yes, well, we – we, of course, had dinner every night in the dining room, and it was a conversat-sational sort of sport.</span> <span id="s170">So we talked about everything, and sometimes when I wasn’t old enough to know, I got instructed from the higher people, my mother and father.</span> <span id="s171">And yeah, you know, it was a – it was a very good way to get educated, I think, without feeling the pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Yeah, it is.</span> <span id="s173">It is.</span> <span id="s174">To have got – to have – to have conversations around the dinner table about important events of the day is something that doesn’t happen that often any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: There were a lot of people then, commentators on radio.</span> <span id="s176">There was one fellow – what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A2: Kaltenborn.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yeah, Kaltenborn.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A2: H – H.V. Kaltenborn.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s181">He was a – and there was also a man who spoke so fast, we couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s182">So we turned him off.</span> <span id="s183">And Lowell Thomas, and you know, a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: The pretty – pretty much accomplished journalists.</span> <span id="s186">And the – and who could expound on a-anything.</span> <span id="s187">I think they had a little more freedom than they do today, because there are other people who popped up and said, you’re wrong.</span> <span id="s188">And so that was a very good example of growing up in a democratic state.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: It was a – it was a fine experience, and a lot of fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: So, did you write – after that first article that you sent to the Australian newspaper, did you become their correspondent?</span> <span id="s192">Did you end up submitting pieces?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Well, I did, actually I did, but that – long before that, they had that article, which was very long.</span> <span id="s194">It took a whole bedsheet of paper, that they used to print on those days, and oh, they had the [indecipherable] that they – usually you find in the – in the English press, but in the American.</span> <span id="s195">Our correspondent in New York –</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s197">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: – tell us what in the world is going on there?</span> <span id="s199">So – so I was astonished, because they were sort of ta – presuming.</span> <span id="s200">They didn’t know how old I was.</span> <span id="s201">I know they wanted to find the –</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: They didn’t ask the basic questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: They weren’t – well, they wanted to find out, but events were moving too fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: And I was, of course, absolutely stunned, because I had a plan.</span> <span id="s206">As soon as I got that rejection, I would write to an English paper in South Africa, and see if I could work on them.</span> <span id="s207">And there was no – there was no compensation for this, but every few weeks I’d get a very generous check, a hundred dollars, which to me –</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: That’s a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: – was a lot of money, to cover my expenses.</span> <span id="s210">Well, my expenses were because I traveled by subway, and you know, were – were very slim.</span> <span id="s211">And – but I – I had a terrible time because I found that between reading about these things and getting an idea of how coverage is done, and then having your pencil in your hand and trying to decide, do I do it, or d-d – or don’t I?</span> <span id="s212">I had a couple of disastrous – potentially disastrous experiences.</span> <span id="s213">One was Lena Medina.</span> <span id="s214">Lena Medina was a five year old girl in Lima, Peru who gave birth to a child – at least the story, this is what the story said.</span> <span id="s215">And my source was I had read it, it was a UP dispatch.</span> <span id="s216">And I knew because I’d gotten the – a sort of the copy boy’s job at the “Herald Tribune” at the – at that time.</span> <span id="s217">I knew that the paper always substituted the UP for AP or anybody else in Latin America, because they felt that it was more reliable.</span> <span id="s218">So in comes this strange story, and I was too young to have the educational experience of anything involving women.</span> <span id="s219">Women were there, and what it takes – what I assume it – you know, it assumes that.</span> <span id="s220">But at any rate –</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: That it’s unusual if they give birth at five.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: – this was all to – very unusual, I thought it was – I thought instinctively it was impossible, because I had never met anyone five years old who had a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A2: Reasonable conclusion.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: And so I sent in my cable as one of the little stories I had from America, this strange place where five year olds have children.</span> <span id="s225">And then apparently –</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: They printed it, I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: They – they printed it, oh what they did though, they did a very clever thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: They also doubted the veracity of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: So they called every [indecipherable] person in Perth, and asked them what they thought of it, and they said, it’s crazy.</span> <span id="s232">It can’t be, it’s impossible.</span> <span id="s233">So then they – they ran that story together with my story, in order to take the onus off themselves, in case I – I’d gone crazy.</span> <span id="s234">And – but they had, and they didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s235">And so then there was that dead – dreadfully dead period, nobody wrote me or anything saying you shouldn’t take these stories seriously.</span> <span id="s236">And I had my explanation all done, because I realized, I talked to some older people, th-they said, oh, that’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s237">So then –</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Trial and error.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: – “Life” magazine was bought by somebody on the paper.</span> <span id="s240">And this was a – oh, month or two later, and all – everything goes very slowly out there.</span> <span id="s241">So – and it showed a picture of Lina Medina, her surgeon who had per – performed the operation.</span> <span id="s242">It was a – it was a – a Caesarian operation.</span> <span id="s243">And – and there was the little infant, believe it or not, there he was.</span> <span id="s244">And – and they got very excited about this, so immediately they jumped on it.</span> <span id="s245">They – they reported the existence of the photograph, and said they’d – or they – they thought that they should print the fact that this was photographed, maybe everybody would be interested in reading it, or seeing it.</span> <span id="s246">And they – they got really very excited.</span> <span id="s247">The publisher began going back to the Monday lunches that he had sort of artfully dodged, after that terrible thing.</span> <span id="s248">And the –</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Does this mean your journalistic career was born with that article?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Oh, I don’t know, I had the writing, yo-you know, I’d been submitting stuff, and they’d been printing it, and I got pretty sassy about it.</span> <span id="s251">I expected to see the story repeated, whatever I said, with a byline on it.</span> <span id="s252">They put a byline every story, even a short one.</span> <span id="s253">And no complaint, no instructions, nothing from them.</span> <span id="s254">They just let me go.</span> <span id="s255">I had – and then in 1941, I still had this job, and I had the – another one of those shocks.</span> <span id="s256">I was – I – I had a very weak – weak week.</span> <span id="s257">Poor week for journalism.</span> <span id="s258">Nothing was developing that I thought I could afford to send.</span> <span id="s259">It was 35 cents a na – a – a word, press if I filed.</span> <span id="s260">So I was very conscious of this, par-particularly because of my Scottish ba – background, and I didn’t want to waste the paper’s money.</span> <span id="s261">So I came to this crisis where that weekly cable looked pretty feeble.</span> <span id="s262">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s263">And there was a big, big event the Wednesday before.</span> <span id="s264">This was about Friday, I was filing.</span> <span id="s265">And there was a battle at Aron between the French and the British.</span> <span id="s266">Maybe you remember it.</span> <span id="s267">I don’t know how they [indecipherable] but this was a pretty exciting story because the British and French were allies, and they – the French had been trying to get Admiral Darlan, who was in command of the French forces, to – to surrender, and the – the French were very stubborn; they wouldn’t surrender.</span> <span id="s268">So finally the British said, all right, if you don’t surrender, we’re going to fight you.</span> <span id="s269">And they started this battle, a really horrible thing because the casualty rate was enormous.</span> <span id="s270">Some of the biggest ships then operating in the two navies, had been sunk, there in Algeria, of all places.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Is that where the battle was taking place?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: In Algeria, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yeah, that was it.</span> <span id="s275">And so I knew all about this, of course, and then source reports in the general news that so many ships had been lost, and so many people had been killed.</span> <span id="s276">It was a pretty horrible outcome.</span> <span id="s277">But I thought [indecipherable] and maybe – maybe I could sneak it in, and they’d realize that I was using old news, but I had to.</span> <span id="s278">And so, oddly enough, they printed it.</span> <span id="s279">But what they did is they ran – they went to the archives and got the Jane’s book – Jane’s ships, and copied out the pictures that were mentioned, all of the casualties, and read it down one side of page one.</span> <span id="s280">And then they sent all of – the few little words I had to say, I never mentioned anything that I – you know [indecipherable] to repeat.</span> <span id="s281">But obviously the battle had been fought, and I had to say something about it.</span> <span id="s282">So I did that, and that was all printed in eight point type.</span> <span id="s283">So must have been a very impressive thing.</span> <span id="s284">I never saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: You never saw that piece as it ran?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No, the paper never came.</span> <span id="s287">My – every once in a while I’d miss a copy.</span> <span id="s288">So, any rate I – I was agonized when I discovered that they printed it, and no other paper in Australia printed it, of course.</span> <span id="s289">And so th-there was no wi – no battle and all of its casualties from Brooks McClure.</span> <span id="s290">So I wondered how – how we got around this, and what happened.</span> <span id="s291">Well, what happened was that I – I always made s-small reports, as small as I could make them, and put each story on a different page.</span> <span id="s292">And then I’d sit in the telegrapher’s office and peel them off wa – one by one.</span> <span id="s293">Well, because this was such a bad reporting day, I worked very hard and very late, to get the best I could out of it, and so I guess the cable came in with this odd story in the middle, and the rest of it much less important stuff.</span> <span id="s294">And so the Australian censor then record it.</span> <span id="s295">What they done is they blanked it out.</span> <span id="s296">And so, on the next Wednesday was an announcement that Churchill is going to make a special speech.</span> <span id="s297">And so everybody in the world was listening to that, and they heard all about the Battle of Aron, many of them for the first time.</span> <span id="s298">So, at any rate, I escaped –</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: – that time, and I didn’t even know it.</span> <span id="s301">And I thought I was so smart, oh boy.</span> <span id="s302">[indecipherable] to get it.</span> <span id="s303">They said they didn’t know what to do, they held a – and editorial conference, and – and they were all standing around, they – all the editors, and debating this thing.</span> <span id="s304">Finally somebody said well, look, he’s our man, and we’re – we – we trust him, and it’s all down on paper.</span> <span id="s305">I think we should stick with it, see what happens.</span> <span id="s306">And so everybody more or less agreed, that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s307">And they saved themselves a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s308">Well, all right, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s309">I hope I didn’t digress –</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: – too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: It – it – this is – it is all very relevant, because it brings me to the next point.</span> <span id="s313">And that is, you had mentioned earlier that your dad passed away in 1940, and that your life changed at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: And I wanted to – I wanted to ask in which way it had changed, and how did you – did you have to leave journalism then?</span> <span id="s316">Did you have t – did you make decisions to go into the military, were you drafted?</span> <span id="s317">I want to bring – get us to the place where you’re ending up in Europe, and t – and tell me what the sequence of events was.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Oh well, I was – I was not drafted yet, and I guess I had a slightly preferential rating, because I had al – besides my father, who was very sick, I had three women to take care of in the immediate family.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: And they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: So I had – may have had a [indecipherable], but the – but I – they didn’t draft me, and I didn’t volunteer until much later.</span> <span id="s321">But wa – events moved very fast.</span> <span id="s322">He was a stubborn old Scot and he – he went to work every day.</span> <span id="s323">He didn’t know he was dying and his physician was recommending that he quit, and all that.</span> <span id="s324">No, he wanted to go on, do the job.</span> <span id="s325">So it was a terrible strain on everybody who loved him, of course.</span> <span id="s326">And I – what changed – well, one thing that didn’t change was the journalism idea.</span> <span id="s327">I had now fixed it, because I did this silly thing.</span> <span id="s328">And I knew that that’s what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s329">Regardless, I – I went hunting all over New York, all over Westchester County to try to get a job.</span> <span id="s330">And of course, they almost laughed.</span> <span id="s331">What school did I go to?</span> <span id="s332">And I only [indecipherable] curious creature.</span> <span id="s333">I was six-one, 180 pounds, and in other words, always out of line with my peers, and – and always doing silly things.</span> <span id="s334">So – so I – I got the desserts I – I really worked for, and couldn’t get a job in – on a newspaper.</span> <span id="s335">So, we had – we had to manage – course, we had to live on the re – the savings of the family, and it was very hard.</span> <span id="s336">I – I was out run – running around, trying to get another job and all this, and it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Did you stay – where did you live in Manhattan?</span> <span id="s338">Was it in –</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Laurel Hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: And where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Do you know Laurel Hill?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Well, Manhattan is ver – is long and lean.</span> <span id="s344">And when you get up to the top, there’s a little – little piece at the very top, it’s a mountain, and it’s called Laurel Hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Is it near the Bronx?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Near the Bronx?</span> <span id="s348">Is it near the Bronx?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Oh yeah, sure, it’s a na –</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: – it’s the next thing to the bran – Bronx.</span> <span id="s352">And, in fact, in grammar school, I went to school in – in the Bronx, and in – and afterwards, in high school, I went to George Washington High, which is down at Washington Heights.</span> <span id="s353">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: I know the area now.</span> <span id="s355">I get a better sense of that.</span> <span id="s356">I wanted to then – you were looking for – you were looking for a job.</span> <span id="s357">Did you eventually find one?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Well, I got a job, oddly, on the – on the “Herald Tribune.”</span> <span id="s359">I had been writing a little bit, trying to sell some articles in America, too.</span> <span id="s360">And I didn’t do spectacularly, but I made a few sales.</span> <span id="s361">And then there was a man named Charlie McLenden(ph), who had just taken over as city editor of the “Herald Tribune,” and I got an interview with him.</span> <span id="s362">And I brought my clippings, to show him that I was doing something.</span> <span id="s363">And he said well, I’m sorry, we don’t have any jobs for – for people like you, you know, education, all those considerations, on – on the staff.</span> <span id="s364">But he said, I – I’ll hire you for – on the – for – as a copyboy.</span> <span id="s365">That was another irrelevancy, here I was over six feet tall, and running copy from one desk to another.</span> <span id="s366">Sort of an embarrassing situation.</span> <span id="s367">And so I had that job for a long time, they didn’t fire me, they kept me on.</span> <span id="s368">And they had a reputation for those that they – that passed the test and stayed, of – of making them reporters after a certain length of time.</span> <span id="s369">But all these people had, you know, education.</span> <span id="s370">So it didn’t look very promising.</span> <span id="s371">But I was able to use the paper’s facilities, their library, the – they had an internal telegraph office, where I spent a lot of time writing up my stuff.</span> <span id="s372">And the work wasn’t hard.</span> <span id="s373">The – this big goof was running around doing it.</span> <span id="s374">And so, at any rate, I used it to good advantage, and almost gave up.</span> <span id="s375">I – I was – I was then 23.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Mm-hm, so that’s 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s378">Well, that’s when I joined the army, and I – my mother and I had a ken – consultation.</span> <span id="s379">I asked her what she would think if I went in the army.</span> <span id="s380">She said she thought it was a very intelligent thing to do.</span> <span id="s381">After all, there are all kinds of people, big sons like you that have to go.</span> <span id="s382">Sure they have to die, they have to suffer, but they’re going.</span> <span id="s383">And she said that, you’re an American, you have to decide what to do.</span> <span id="s384">So I joined the infantry, which was the most idiotic thing to do.</span> <span id="s385">I’m sure I could have gotten a job at a – at a better branch of the service, but – but I fel – felt very patriotic at the time, I did the right thing.</span> <span id="s386">So – and then, of course, I had to make a lot of changes, I had to quit my job in aus – Australia.</span> <span id="s387">Which actually was paying off a little bit, you know, they were paying me far more than I was worth, and I had originally asked just to – to work for nothing, but they wouldn’t accept that.</span> <span id="s388">So, they were very nice.</span> <span id="s389">And so then off I went into the infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: And where were – were you stateside for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Were you based in the – in the U.S. for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: United States?</span> <span id="s394">Oh yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s395">I’d, of course, did all the basic training and all, which is a – which is another great exercise.</span> <span id="s396">It’s very, very hard, you know, you – you have to fall on your rifle, and do all sorts of odd things that normal human beings probably wouldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: But – but I got along all right, I got promotions.</span> <span id="s399">And then I had a – a specialty, I – I developed a special skill [indecipherable] because I worked at night, and sometimes I stayed over, and then the fellow down – we had a wire link between New York and Washington, and there was another young fellow there, just in my same position.</span> <span id="s400">And we would send long messages to each other.</span> <span id="s401">And I – I got so that I could type 60 words a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: And then – that’s the speed of the transmitter distributor that does it automatically, you know.</span> <span id="s404">And so, when I got in the army, I did another foolish thing.</span> <span id="s405">They said, put down anything you think y-you might be able to do in the service, if you have a special –</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Skill, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: – skill.</span> <span id="s408">So I thought about that a little bit.</span> <span id="s409">I thought the only thing I knew how to do was to type.</span> <span id="s410">So – so I told him that I could – I – I could imitate the speed of a – an electric transmitter on the typewriter.</span> <span id="s411">Well that’s – really that wasn’t such a – an achievement.</span> <span id="s412">There are millions of girls with typewriters who could do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: But they’re not in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: No, that’s right.</span> <span id="s415">And they didn’t get the opportunity to do this.</span> <span id="s416">So somebody had run the IBM rod you know, through the bo – through the cards, and came out with this remarkable fact that one of their soldiers – actually, I had – I had this experience with computer – with transmitters that, you know – computer transmission.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A2: The teletypes.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: The teletypes probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A2: The teletypes.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A2: The teletypes?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Was it the teletypes?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yeah, teletypes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: That’s right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: So, well, then I didn’t know this, but the – the army decided in the earlier period, when they weren’t so overwhelmed, that they would experiment with a – a wireless.</span> <span id="s426">Well, wireless was an unknown then, for teletypes, although it’s – today it’s e-everywhere.</span> <span id="s427">And so they – they transferred me.</span> <span id="s428">I think I was a – I was probably just a PFC at the time.</span> <span id="s429">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Private first class?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Private first class?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Private first class.</span> <span id="s434">And all of a sudden I found that I was still in the infantry, but I had this special assignment.</span> <span id="s435">They had teletype machines, and you could practice on them, and I practiced on them, and somebody else did too.</span> <span id="s436">And one of – two of – two other men were taken in for this, but they were both noncoms.</span> <span id="s437">One was a master sergeant and the other ta – the next le-level.</span> <span id="s438">And so – but they came out of the – out of the signals business, they worked for railroads, you know, all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s439">So they had plenty of experience.</span> <span id="s440">They knew all about how – how these things worked.</span> <span id="s441">I didn’t know, I couldn’t repair one.</span> <span id="s442">I wa – I wasn’t going to tell them I wasn’t qualified.</span> <span id="s443">I was secretly pleased that the – well, I guess I already had a grade.</span> <span id="s444">I was probably a corporal or a sergeant by that time.</span> <span id="s445">And I’ll tell you, when you think and what you do in the infantry, how you will get home to mama is a question.</span> <span id="s446">So – so I the – I – I decided I’d do what the wa – army wanted me to do.</span> <span id="s447">And so I had this curious job all through – actually variations in my career, I joined the air force, and I – I – I qualified, and I was very keen about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Was this post-war?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Joining the air force was post-war, or during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: No, this was during the height of the casualties in – in the eighth army, you know, in the – in – in Europe.</span> <span id="s452">And of course, we weren’t doing too well the – Asia either, but – but it was a – it was a death wish, actually, if you got into that.</span> <span id="s453">And I – I was willing to go, but when I had any kind of alternative, I – I was willing to accept it.</span> <span id="s454">Then a –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Because the in – can I just –</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: – clarify?</span> <span id="s458">Because being in the infantry would have been the worst possible situation.</span> <span id="s459">Is that – i-if I understand this properly?</span> <span id="s460">It was –</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: – not the – the least of – le-let me see if I can rephrase that.</span> <span id="s463">Is it if you want to get home to mama, being in the infantry is going to be the place where it’s least likely to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Oh, wi – yes, I would say so.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s466">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Although the – although I discovered after I got in the air force, that the casualty rate was just as great.</span> <span id="s468">They shoot you out of the sky, and – instead.</span> <span id="s469">So the question – I – I – I wasn’t doing too good at artful dodging, really.</span> <span id="s470">But at any rate, things were all right.</span> <span id="s471">I was just getting around, and then finally wind – wound up back in the infantry when Eisenhower declared that they had too many fliers, and – and that they were going to pair – send all the fliers and [indecipherable] specialists, and all the special kinds of people back to the infantry.</span> <span id="s472">Some of them had never been in the infantry when they were put in.</span> <span id="s473">If you ever heard of the Battle of the Bulge –</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: – there was a – there was a tremendous of them [indecipherable] to that.</span> <span id="s476">And to go in to a – to a war like that, that was murder.</span> <span id="s477">And – but I didn’t – I was sent down to a regular infantry division that was only training.</span> <span id="s478">I-I –</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Oh, let’s see.</span> <span id="s481">Oh, this was late ’43 or early ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: And I – and I joined this infantry unit, one of the last to go to Europe, actually, and oddly enough, you know, was a late arrival, I was put into Patton’s Third Army, which had one of the dreadful infantry scores – casualty scores.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s485">So you arrived in Europe – I want to establish this fact: you arrived in Europe when?</span> <span id="s486">In early ’44?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Let me see.</span> <span id="s488">Must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: And we were the last division to arrive, so we were sort of a – a poor gift to the army that got it.</span> <span id="s491">But we trained very hard, and I had had a little training before, so I felt, they can train me to death if they want to, because I want to be equal to the job when I get it.</span> <span id="s492">So – but in the meantime there was this typewriter business.</span> <span id="s493">Now, if you can imagine, they had, while we were in the States, they had the typewriter equipment, and they had this special articulated truck, one of those things that swings in all directions, you know, to – to transport it.</span> <span id="s494">And I was tra – I was trained in how to park this thing, and you know, to run it, in case they needed me.</span> <span id="s495">But – but they had a regular team of transport people who – who normally handled this job.</span> <span id="s496">Well, I went into the field in Mississippi, and did all these things, and that’s the last I saw of the truck or the – or the computers, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: The wireless teletypers?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: The tele – wireless teletype.</span> <span id="s499">And they didn’t – course they don’t – didn’t consult me in the service on anything, really, but I didn’t know what ha – what happened to it, but they had forgotten to cancel it or change it in some way.</span> <span id="s500">So there was always this little strange thing, that I went abroad, I was – I was posted in the signal company of the 65th infantry division, and got assignments occasionally, but it was not a – not terribly a busy job for me.</span> <span id="s501">A division is about 14,000 men, so you can see they had a lot – lot of people that do their normal work.</span> <span id="s502">And – and I never was pressed too much, because I had this secret job.</span> <span id="s503">Nobody ever talked about it, it was just – I was just out in the cold, I guess.</span> <span id="s504">I got a couple of promotions.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Well, what did you do?</span> <span id="s506">This is wa – something I don’t understand: when you were in the infantry, what was it that you were doing over there in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Well, I was – I was attached to this super-secret mission.</span> <span id="s508">So, I don’t know, that was enough for me.</span> <span id="s509">But I was in – getting in a few – few firefights, but nothing –</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: So you didn’t really see battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: You didn’t see battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Well, sure I f-fought.</span> <span id="s514">I was shot and – shot at and I shot back, and no, I had enough experience so I could say I was an infantryman, but – but there I was encased in this situation, and they –</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Well, what can you tell us – what can you tell us about this su – this secret mission?</span> <span id="s516">What was its goal, what was its purpose, what was –</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Well, the thing was, they wanted to develop a wireless system, which would connect the – the frontline troops with headquarters, and – in-instantly.</span> <span id="s518">And you can do it with teletype, but you can’t do it if you have to have lines between teletypes being cut by the enemy all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s520">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: And just laying the lines is too hideous a job.</span> <span id="s522">But this was obviously the beginning of a project that we were trying to analyze all the aspects, and see if they can straighten it out.</span> <span id="s523">I – I could understand, but I never – never thought it was terribly funny, but I happen to be the beneficiary, so I wasn’t going to argue about it.</span> <span id="s524">Well, as a result though, I had a distorted military career, in which – during which I had the two experiences that we – we were to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: And that we’re – I’m hoping, yeah, that we can now.</span> <span id="s526">So di – does this – the fact that you were in this – in this particular – I don’t know if the right word is occupation or activity, is that what brought you closer to – when we’re going to talk about Ohrdruf, that – why you happened to be there at – at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Well, you know, it’s only because I got into this peculiar subculture –</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: – in the military.</span> <span id="s530">There were other people in the army, some fascinating people.</span> <span id="s531">There – you can’t imagine how some noncommissioned officers got positions of enormous authority, and it’s because of that, in this instance, that I got into one of these things.</span> <span id="s532">The one about the – the wor – the work projects of the – to so many of the Holocaust victims.</span> <span id="s533">And so from there on I was – I was part of an infantry unit, didn’t have to go – di – wasn’t callable and ba – and part of the [indecipherable] and really just give it – I had a lot of free time.</span> <span id="s534">And that was the real trouble.</span> <span id="s535">Free time and McClure don’t go together.</span> <span id="s536">So I went out, had some adventures.</span> <span id="s537">I was actually AWOL, I guess a ti – absent without leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: And – but nobody missed me, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Were you in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: – I answered all the – you know, you get up in the morning, they blow the bugle, they get you out, they – they check your name to make sure you’re there.</span> <span id="s542">Then you go to breakfast, and then, of course, McClure vanishes.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Where did you vanish?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: My wer – might work on a keyboard, but he’s not doing anything most infantry men would respect.</span> <span id="s545">So, at any rate, the way I – I at some time will get to the – to these two things, two very different experiences, quite profound.</span> <span id="s546">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: In all of this, you say you arrived in 1944, early in 1944, and probably it’s a year and some months later, maybe a year and three months later when you come onto Ohrdruf.</span> <span id="s548">In that time, did you know, was it spoken of, was it known about, of what was happening basically to the Jews and others in Europe?</span> <span id="s549">Was it – was – were you aware, were others aware?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Well, that’s an interesting question because as an individual, I don’t remember being terribly well-informed about – well, once – once they opened Auschwitz, all right.</span> <span id="s551">But before that – well, I was aware of the Saint Louis incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: And the criticism of Roosevelt because he didn’t save those people, keep them from going back and dying, like they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: And so I – I was aware of that, and of course I knew that the German propaganda was all anti-Jewish.</span> <span id="s556">But this business of gathering up people just to kill them, I didn’t – wasn’t aware of being aware of that.</span> <span id="s557">And in fact, when I – when – when we discovered that the work quarters of these poor people in south Germany, first time we had encountered it – apparently, I don’t know how they got away without being caught, becau – of course, Germany is a very big country.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: And – and we went after the cities first.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: So tell us about – you say the first time you encountered this was in south Germany?</span> <span id="s561">So was that like Bavaria?</span> <span id="s562">In Bavaria is –</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: No, no, I – it’s that province next to Bavaria that’s a little south and east.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Baden Württemberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: That’s a little southwest, closer to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: That’s where Ohrdruf was.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Oh no, no, then we’re going the other direction, then it’s Thüringen.</span> <span id="s569">Then – was Ohrdruf the first time you came into contact with what this policy had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Oh yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s571">And I wasn’t the only one, I was – I was one of many, many – everybody.</span> <span id="s572">Nobody –</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Can you – now can we go into some detail about this?</span> <span id="s574">You were – when you were already almost there, what was your – what was your job?</span> <span id="s575">What were you doing when you were called to go to Ohrdruf?</span> <span id="s576">What was y – what were you involved in?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Oh yeah, well, that’s the – the – the thing here, I referred to about th-the sub-class in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s579">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Some awfully smart people of very low rank got in, and it’s amazing.</span> <span id="s581">He was in the – i-in g – G3, the – the operational side of the division.</span> <span id="s582">And he did some magnificent, good work.</span> <span id="s583">He made sure everybody got decorations who were supposed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Who was this person?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: A young man from Chicago, ju – was just a name to me.</span> <span id="s586">I got to know him, but he wa – he worked on the “Chicago Tribune,” and had – that was a fascinating – something that I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s587">Because, I guess he had good talent, he was taught to do all the main jobs on the paper.</span> <span id="s588">So that the – if the – if the printers went out on strike, he would go down and work a linotype machine.</span> <span id="s589">So, at any rate, he was a – a pretty – pretty savvy young guy, and had been kicked around a little bit, so he – he knew how to – how to handle problems.</span> <span id="s590">And – and he had a boss, a – I don’t know, a colonel, or a lieutenant colonel who was very enamored of him for a while; this is a smart boy.</span> <span id="s591">And so he gradually elevated in authority.</span> <span id="s592">He was given [indecipherable] of things to do, th – his boss wanted results, and he was a results getter.</span> <span id="s593">And so, at any rate, by the time I ga – I got to know him pretty well, because of my interest in journalism, I found he had been with the “Chicago Tribune,” which was not the New York Tribune – “Herald Tribune.”</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: But – but we had a similar interest, and we joked about – about journalism, and so on.</span> <span id="s596">And so it got so, for little things.</span> <span id="s597">I was mostly idle, in another part of the camp.</span> <span id="s598">The – the camp is a city, really.</span> <span id="s599">And he’d call on me if he ever had something that – a job to do, that he couldn’t do or – so – so we got pretty chummy.</span> <span id="s600">Then one day a – one day a Jeep showed up first thing in the morning.</span> <span id="s601">I – I was just finishing breakfast, I guess, and I was being called by my friend.</span> <span id="s602">So I got in the Jeep, and off we went, over to his headquarters, and he told me we – we’ve discovered some anomaly here, strange thing, a lot of people dying and I don’t know, we just got a radio report on this thing at – I need this – h-he – he described it.</span> <span id="s603">Well, he said he – he wanted to send me over there to take a picture of this thing.</span> <span id="s604">He said we should have pictures of it.</span> <span id="s605">So he gave me a no – a German 35 millimeter camera, one of the best that they make.</span> <span id="s606">And – but it had film in it, I didn’t know the speed of the film, and that was a big handicap because I knew I couldn’t take many pictures in the shadow, if – if – if that was standard film.</span> <span id="s607">So, off I went, and they had a driver, really quite incredible.</span> <span id="s608">He had surveyed the route to this place by – by using a – automobile company maps.</span> <span id="s609">And so we went right there, it was no problem, he made no mistakes, he drove right there.</span> <span id="s610">And we got into the area, we didn’t know where the camp was, but we saw all of the military equipment that had been gathering.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: So, by the military equipment, do you mean U.S. military?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s614">And how long, you know, from where your unit was to where this camp was, was it a half hour drive, was it an hour drive, do you remember?</span> <span id="s615">Was it –</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: It was – I – I – I – as I – I feel it now, it seemed to be about half an hour, 45 minutes.</span> <span id="s617">Though I – I could be wrong about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s619">But anyway, it wasn’t half a day.</span> <span id="s620">It wasn’t something that was very far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: We didn’t have to eat or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s625">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: So, well, I came upon this rugged terrain.</span> <span id="s627">We got off the main drive.</span> <span id="s628">He wa – he was absolutely sure of where he would find it, and he came – he came into an area where we saw a lot of – a couple of tanks, and a lot of other motorized equipment, American, and we figured we’d – we’d hit something.</span> <span id="s629">And then we were – were led by the locals, wha-whatever G.I.s we could find, and led to this place.</span> <span id="s630">Well, it was very remote in the woods, and the little building, all of raw wood.</span> <span id="s631">And they had a huge gate, with a slogan, let’s see if I can remember.</span> <span id="s632">It’s a very simple slogan in German, and [indecipherable] although most people had to deal with it.</span> <span id="s633">Arbeit – something about arbeit that – well, work is a liberator, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Arbeit macht frei.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yeah, that macht frei, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Arbeit macht frei.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Arbeit macht frei.</span> <span id="s638">And there was this – that’s the only metal I could remember, everything else was just wood.</span> <span id="s639">And I learned also later that they built hundreds of these on the same plans, so that if you encountered one in one place, it looked like the same you saw before.</span> <span id="s640">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: So, was like a wooden building?</span> <span id="s642">Did it look like a storehouse, or a warehouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: No, no, it didn’t have any distinction or appearance of authority or anything like that.</span> <span id="s644">It was just a little – I want to say, a crudely built architecturally nil kind of construction.</span> <span id="s645">And it – it was designed for its purpose, which it was just to house the Holocaust victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: So, did you open the – did you open a door to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Oh, I didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s648">I arrived, I was just another G.I. I – well, I was more than that, I was a – I think I was a sergeant by then, but I was just another guy dressed in all the same clothes that everybody else was, and I liked that because nobody asked any questions.</span> <span id="s649">I wasn’t part of the rescue team though, and I had free access, I could go around, take pictures wherever I wanted.</span> <span id="s650">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: What’s the first picture you took?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: First picture I took was of the – of the grave.</span> <span id="s653">There was about, oh, I would say about 800 feet long, very long, and very deep, and about 15 feet wide.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: And what did you see in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Well, bodies.</span> <span id="s658">In fact, I – I had no trouble understanding what it was for, because they were in the process of dumping more bodies in, all of them naked.</span> <span id="s659">They take – they took off the rags that they had been wearing, washed them, and then they’d use them again, you see.</span> <span id="s660">But th –</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: So when you came aco – across this first scene that you took a photograph of, there was actual dumping of bodies going on in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Yes, oh yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Was this now the U.S. military that was cleaning it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Oh, there were.</span> <span id="s665">There was a lot of work to do, because there were many bodies in this – in the barracks.</span> <span id="s666">Barracks were three – three stages high, as I remember, and they were just lay – laid out on the floor of th – each level.</span> <span id="s667">And some of them were so weak, they couldn’t get up to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: So, when you were in the barracks there were people who were alive, as well as people who were dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Oh yeah, well, they were dying.</span> <span id="s670">That’s what they were doing, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Was this men or women?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: All – all – all – both.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Both men – any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: No, I didn’t notice any children.</span> <span id="s675">I think they disposed of the children very quickly.</span> <span id="s676">I know –</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: When you say – excuse me that I’m interrupting – when you say three stages, do you mean that there were – the bunks were in three bunks –</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: – and that people were on each level?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Three tiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s683">Now, of course, the stronger ones so happened to be on the top, because they could still get down, but – but there were a lot of them even in the – on the lowest level, who were just comatose.</span> <span id="s684">Ju-Just a terr – it’s a terrible sight.</span> <span id="s685">These are people who should be dead, but were alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Did you take pictures there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Did you take pictures of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Couldn’t, because I wasn’t sure of the – of the film.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s692">I figured it was not a ver – a super speed, that’s what you need for that, in order –</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Because it would be inside, and darker, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Your light, there’s – there’s almost no light in there.</span> <span id="s695">So I didn’t – I took some pictures, but they didn’t come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s697">And do you have an idea of about how many bodies you saw, or how many people you saw in there?</span> <span id="s698">Was it stuffed to the gills?</span> <span id="s699">Was it a hundred, 200?</span> <span id="s700">Was it 50?</span> <span id="s701">I know those are abstra – you know, sort of estimates, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Yeah, hard to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: – to get a sense of a –</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Hard to tell how many there were.</span> <span id="s705">I went in, I took a look, I saw some of them, and I came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Did any move to you?</span> <span id="s707">Did anybody want to talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Oh yes, well, not – not – I mean, they didn’t campaign, but you could see they’d look at you with those empty eyes, and beg you, really, to help.</span> <span id="s709">But th – they were very pleased, they were – by – by the time I got there, the operational troops had called for help, and they got some – some very skilled medical people, by the way.</span> <span id="s710">They couldn’t do much for the ones that were dying, of course, but they were dying, and they had to be disposed of, because it was a very great danger, biological danger.</span> <span id="s711">So, when I got there, I – the one thing I remember, the one, looked like pretty husky guy, a man, maybe in his middle 30s, something like that, carrying a skeleton.</span> <span id="s712">Dang – skeleton was just dangling there.</span> <span id="s713">And then – then tossed it into the trap, you know, into the –</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: By trap, do you mean that 800 foot long –</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yeah, di –</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: – ditch that –</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: It was the grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Yes, it’s a – and somebody, they put in lime.</span> <span id="s720">And I saw this, and I think that was early enough so that – it isn’t the way it necessarily looked at the end.</span> <span id="s721">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: So this is before the lime starts taking effect?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: This is before the lime starts doing what it does?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Yes, that’s right, it wasn’t – th-there – there was some lime underneath.</span> <span id="s726">Th-This – the depth of this, human depth was maybe three or four feet already, so a lot of bodies underneath that al – already been disposed of, and I don’t know how long that gash had been there.</span> <span id="s727">I suspect that it was there be – before the guards left.</span> <span id="s728">They – they got a warning that the Americans were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Can – do you have a sense of how long the U.S. military was already there before you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Well, not to my – it wasn’t too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: A day?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: A – no, no, not a day.</span> <span id="s733">They – the tank came on it – what was that hour, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s734">It could – I think it was a man who became General Abrams, who was the commander of the tank.</span> <span id="s735">He was then a captain, or something.</span> <span id="s736">And then he had other trucks, cars with him, with troops.</span> <span id="s737">Let’s see.</span> <span id="s738">I think it was fairly late in the day when he came on, or possibly even later.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: In the evening, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s741">And he immediately re – radioed back to headquarters, and – and they of course notified the division command.</span> <span id="s742">And that’s the way I got the word myself, very first thing in the morning.</span> <span id="s743">We – so they must have been there, couldn’t have been doing very much, because of the darkness.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: And I suppose they were – they must have been suspicious too.</span> <span id="s746">A lot of serious trouble going on one place, you know, and th – and after dark, you don’t dare endanger yourself.</span> <span id="s747">But at any rate they – they notified us.</span> <span id="s748">They used their own medics in the – the little group that arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Do you remember the date this was?</span> <span id="s752">[technical interruption] End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: I’m just going to say something here, okay?</span> <span id="s755">This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Brooks McClure.</span> <span id="s756">We’re on a separate track, that’s why we’re go – so, I was asking you about the date.</span> <span id="s757">Do you have an idea about when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Oh, I didn’t keep track of dates.</span> <span id="s759">I – I could be a week off –</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: – at any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: But it was April.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: It was April, you think.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: I th – I seem to remember that it was April.</span> <span id="s766">I was looking – incidentally, I didn’t mention this, but I had a few notes, and I had some of the pictures that I took, in my files.</span> <span id="s767">And my wife died, and I got sick, and so I didn’t follow up very much on this.</span> <span id="s768">Had to sell the house and – and move into an old people’s home.</span> <span id="s769">So, I – I – I wasn’t aware of this very much, but unfortunately a lot of the files that I preev – prized, were lost.</span> <span id="s770">And so I would have had the date, and a – a lot – lot of other things in there.</span> <span id="s771">I – I can’t imagine my not noting that down, because this was such an unusual experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Was it cold still?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Was it cold still if you –</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Oh, it was always dank.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Sort of chilly, you know.</span> <span id="s780">I do – there was certainly in the air, and it was in – I suppose even in – it might have been in spring, you know, the weather.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: But I was wearing a re-regular uniform, no coat or anything.</span> <span id="s783">So I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s784">It couldn’t have been very cold.</span> <span id="s785">But those poor people, oh my heavens.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Did anybody try to speak with you from those – from –</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s788">Usually in a language I didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s789">A lot of them were Poles, ge – Germans, Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s791">So you think you sa – maybe there were Soviet soldiers who were in the group, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Oh, it’s quite possible.</span> <span id="s793">The Germans were not very respectful of the – of the Russians –</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: – soldiers.</span> <span id="s796">So, anyway, that’s really the extent of my experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: How long do you – did you stay there?</span> <span id="s798">How long did you stay wi – in this one place?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Not – not very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: We were – we were on the move.</span> <span id="s802">The – the – the army as itself, was moving very fast.</span> <span id="s803">And that’s why I think they – they overtook some people that were trying to get away.</span> <span id="s804">And Patton moved at times, 50 miles in a day.</span> <span id="s805">Now, if you can imagine a military force of maybe clo-close to a half a million men –</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: That’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: – moving this fast, and actually, if you read up on it, it’s quite interesting in retrospect, to see how well the Americans did.</span> <span id="s808">They fought like fiends.</span> <span id="s809">The Germans de-defending their own country, didn’t do nearly as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Do you want to take a break a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Do you want to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: No, thank you –</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: No, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: – I don’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Okay, I think maybe he wants to sit up?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: I’m full – A2: Want to sit up a little bit, Brooks?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Yeah, I know, I – I’m –</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Want some help here?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: – I’m not in perfect condition, and I hope you will excuse.</span> <span id="s821">Sometimes I – I can’t remember, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: I think you’re doing great.</span> <span id="s823">I think you’re doing just great.</span> <span id="s824">Before [interruption] okay, continue, yes, all right.</span> <span id="s825">It’s going to be another track, or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Miss?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q2: All right, now it’s going, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: She’ll have to talk a little louder than normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Cause I – I’m losing my hearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q2: Okay, you’re fine, you’re fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Everything’s fine with the recorder.</span> <span id="s834">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A2: Brooks, I think you once mentioned something about the guards from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Yes, I wanted to ask about this –</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Oh, oh, yeah, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: – the guards from the camp.</span> <span id="s839">Could you tell us something –</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: It would be a shame not to talk about that.</span> <span id="s841">The – the camp had th – been warned by wireless, and immediately started to disband.</span> <span id="s842">And ul – a lot of the – the guards seemed to have rooms or something down in the town of Ohrdruf, o-h-r-d-r-u-f, as I remember the spelling.</span> <span id="s843">And some of them dashed down and changed their clothes, and just mingled with the local people.</span> <span id="s844">And s – but very soon the Americans realized what had happened, and they sent a tank down and they put them on the tank, brought them back – the ones they could find.</span> <span id="s845">They fu – found quite a number apparently.</span> <span id="s846">This all happened before I arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: So very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Yeah, oh, yeah, so was –</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: – no delay.</span> <span id="s851">I thought the military did a wonderful job.</span> <span id="s852">They didn’t pause for a minute.</span> <span id="s853">And they brought them back dressed in their [indecipherable] uniforms, and – and civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s854">And this town, by the way, is a lovely little paradise, beautifully kept.</span> <span id="s855">They all had flower – window flower arrangements.</span> <span id="s856">And – and it was really a wonderful place to go to.</span> <span id="s857">They had the [indecipherable] and then the – all the arrangements.</span> <span id="s858">And so – and they had a full population town, I guess, mostly middle aged people, women and men.</span> <span id="s859">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: About how far was the campsite from the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: I’d say about two miles now, my guess – my guess is.</span> <span id="s862">I don’t know how you – one measures distance when you’re walking –</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Did you walk it?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: – especially when you’re a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Did you walk it?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Oh, I walked it, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: About how long did it take you to get from the town to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s869">And I don’t know why I walked it, because we had a car.</span> <span id="s870">But – but I don’t – I don’t know, I went down – maybe I’m a – had company.</span> <span id="s871">I can’t remember now.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: But, at any rate, I got down there, and I remember entering the town from one end, and seeing how beautiful it was, and how fiendish the whole idea seemed to be.</span> <span id="s874">At a-any rate –</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: The guards – excuse me that I’m interrupting, but we go back to the guards.</span> <span id="s876">They were brought back in civilian clothes to the camp.</span> <span id="s877">Did anybody recognize them and identify them, from the – from those dying people?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Oh yes, well, that’s what I was about to say.</span> <span id="s879">There were some of the Holocaust victims who were at least strong enough to stand up and move around.</span> <span id="s880">And when the – when the Americans brought these people in, I heard, and I – and thi-this is not my personal experience, but they attacked them.</span> <span id="s881">And at first the Americans had to intervene, and stop it and so forth.</span> <span id="s882">And – but that didn’t appease the – the victims at all, of course.</span> <span id="s883">The – but all of this is hearsay.</span> <span id="s884">I wa – I – I heard this when I – when a – when we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Another question.</span> <span id="s886">Maybe my final one that has to do with Ohrdruf, unless Joe has some more, is when peop – when the Americans came, the G.I.s – no, I have two more.</span> <span id="s887">When the Americans came, and they saw this, did they have any idea of what it was that they were seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: No.</span> <span id="s889">No.</span> <span id="s890">Of course, the first thing you see is the dead and dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: And these were obviously not people armed, so they weren’t soldiers in the normal sense.</span> <span id="s893">And they were all dressed in these curious uniforms, with the stripes going down, you know.</span> <span id="s894">And so they – they were – must have been aware that these were prisoners who had revolted, or something.</span> <span id="s895">I-It was hard to piece together a story, even when I was there.</span> <span id="s896">And the next day, a passel of – of generals came to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Well, that’s my second question.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Does the name Franks say anything to you?</span> <span id="s900">Franks, as a last name.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: French?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Franks.</span> <span id="s903">Frank, with an S at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Like – like the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: No, no, not like the country, like the hamber – no, like the hot dog.</span> <span id="s906">A frank.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Oh, the franks.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Yeah, does the name Franks say anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: No, no, I di – I never met a Frank knowingly.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s911">Because I had heard that there was – this was a person who was responsible for getting some of the higher-ups to come to Ohrdruf and Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Oh, well, I may have.</span> <span id="s913">I ma – oh, no, Buchenwald is something else again.</span> <span id="s914">This is an entirely separate and belated development.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: So no, the next day they got Patton, Bradley, I think – what’s that?</span> <span id="s917">Field Marshall Montgomery, and then a couple of others, because they found that it was something very unusual.</span> <span id="s918">Actually, how it escaped their notice so long, I don’t know, because our patrols extended far in.</span> <span id="s919">But I suppose er – if it had been er – discovered ear-earlier, it would have been a little bit – bit of a situation.</span> <span id="s920">For one thing, maybe the response, because of the time of day, would have been quicker.</span> <span id="s921">They – they rea – they – they recognized – the medics that they had were just regular combat medics, and they knew they couldn’t do a great deal.</span> <span id="s922">All they did was recognize the principle that after a certain point of not eating, you are doomed.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s924">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: And – and there were a lot of doomed people around there.</span> <span id="s926">Oh, it was really awful.</span> <span id="s927">And, you know – well, you’ve all seen pictures of these people; they’re so thin, it’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s928">Their veins stood out on their arms and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: [indecipherable] didn’t seem human.</span> <span id="s931">And I wonder how they got along.</span> <span id="s932">There was a good mixture of languages, but you’d have to organize it among the survivors, a few could speak English or French.</span> <span id="s933">Otherwise, they were out of communication, really, I think.</span> <span id="s934">Maybe some of the Germans mixed in would have been re-reasonable</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Oh, I didn’t stay very long at all.</span> <span id="s939">Took my pictures.</span> <span id="s940">I knew they wanted them back at headquarters, and so I – I just about jumped in the car, and off we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: So were you there a couple hours, perhaps, or half a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s943">Not very much at all.</span> <span id="s944">I realized early on that I couldn’t spend much time in – inside these buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s946">So it was more than one building?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Oh well, I think so.</span> <span id="s948">I think there was.</span> <span id="s949">I only went into one, but it was a – it was a pretty sizable thing.</span> <span id="s950">I don’t know how many workers they had to have, or they were using for whatever project they were doing.</span> <span id="s951">They were – they were probably cleaning out the – the … the woods, you know, because the Germans do that.</span> <span id="s952">They make it a policy, clean out the underbrush wherever they are, and they use it, of course, profitably, to burn.</span> <span id="s953">But – and I wouldn’t have been – I don’t know where the – how – I don’t know how – how the civilians managed.</span> <span id="s954">They – the tradition in Germany is to go into the woods and clean it out.</span> <span id="s955">Well, you know, if – if the – if the camp was two miles away, I don’t know how they would escape being discovered, but I don’t think that’s an issue.</span> <span id="s956">These – the – the townspeople all knew about this.</span> <span id="s957">I understand that afterwards, the Americans took the Bürgermeister and a number of senior civilian officers up to watch this process that I watched; they were still burying these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Did you ever write about this after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Did you ever write about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: No, I never did.</span> <span id="s962">I never did.</span> <span id="s963">But I – but I – I think that after the war it was well known, and wasn’t quite as dramatic as hanging them with piano wire in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s964">But the – the whole thing is unbelievable, more-so – you know, one says that it’s unbelievable that a group of people would be killed this way, for nothing other than being what they are.</span> <span id="s965">And that binary nature of these people, who could be very polite and – and com – polite society, in their polite society, and yet they – th-there was – the Germans did an analysis of one of their big meetings and it survived the war, and I saw it in Germany, in fact.</span> <span id="s966">This was after the war.</span> <span id="s967">And it was appalling to see these people who were responsible for th-th-the disposal of human beings, joking about it and going about it in such a detached way.</span> <span id="s968">No – no – no emotion involved.</span> <span id="s969">Well, but at any rate, that’s not pertinent to what we’re talking about, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: It is, but it is not – it’s not direct witness, it is the impressions that you get after the fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: So it ties in, it ties in.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s974">It didn’t have to be a visual presentation at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: You just think of the idea, planning and executing these people in such a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: And this was the other way.</span> <span id="s979">These were the dregs.</span> <span id="s980">These were – these were not the people who were employed in [indecipherable] plants all through Germany, or – there – there were a lot of commercial properties that were managed and run by these people.</span> <span id="s981">Some fantastic stories about that, but seeing it is an emotional experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Did you talk about it to your folks when you came home, to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: My mother was the only one left, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: When – when Patton moved on at that clip, that pretty fast clip of moving, you know, such a wall of humanity forward, 50 mi – did you go forward as well, as part of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: No, well, the country is vast.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: We had the – the – the third army had the southern quarter of Germany to take care of.</span> <span id="s990">We – we were – were – we were at one point closest to Berlin, then moved down, on orders, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: And Patton was assigned this last southeastern quarter of Germany, and what went with it, a little bit of Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: And – and Austria, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: The Austrian experience is also – that’s where they have separate comment.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: I’d like to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: We were all a little anxious, I suppose.</span> <span id="s999">We were doing very well, but when you’re in a battle, if you’re moving forward, you feel pretty good about that, but your – you’re further exposing yourself to doom.</span> <span id="s1000">And the – I was – I was not aware of – of this sweep, but I knew it happened.</span> <span id="s1001">And in fact, after – after the Battle of the Bulge, our – our – our army – I – I – I – I’m afraid I – I shouldn’t say our army, I wasn’t in the army, but I – in that army, but because I – of my personal experience.</span> <span id="s1002">But oh, the casualties were fearsome.</span> <span id="s1003">And the men who really fought have a different, instinctive feeling about it.</span> <span id="s1004">But our infan – infantry really ch – went through them so fast, that we had some surprises.</span> <span id="s1005">We overtook the – the retreat of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1006">They’d retreat a while, then they’d surrender.</span> <span id="s1007">And so – but as I say, in – in Austria they got another picture of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: What happened in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Because they were – these were civilians and – and the Austrians that were in the army were, of course, in the German army.</span> <span id="s1010">And so they didn’t have much to do in Austria.</span> <span id="s1011">I know wa – in our experience, the Austrian takeover was a cinch, after the fighting that we had done before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Was this already – if you were in Ohrdruf in a – in April, where did you – when the war ended in early May, do you remember that, where you were at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Yes, I was in Linz, Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1016">Sure, I – the – the end of war is really the end of war for – for the Austrians, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s1017">And all the pretty girls, some very eager to cooperate ger – Austrians, but not – not resisting.</span> <span id="s1018">We had to face the possibility that we’d have to fight through it, but they didn’t have – they did – they didn’t have a home guard or anything, to give us any trouble, so [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Let’s talk then about that second – second episode –</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Oh yeah, well, that’s a different thing entirely, and – and in retrospect, it’s a funny experience.</span> <span id="s1021">I enjoyed it so much afterwards, because it was so dangerous when it was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: So tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: I – we were – we were stationed in Linz, in western Austria, and I was – I – I had attached myself to the – to the intelligence section of the army.</span> <span id="s1024">And get – got to know a very affable, probably 25 year old major who was working there too.</span> <span id="s1025">He was an infantry officer, a big man.</span> <span id="s1026">I – apparently he certainly never showed any fear or anxiety under extreme pressure.</span> <span id="s1027">But at any rate, I reported in one day.</span> <span id="s1028">It was across town, I was with ya – with my infantry friends, and – eating there and so forth.</span> <span id="s1029">So I came in one morning, about eight o’clock I suppose, and there was this major whose name I can’t remember – and that’s a shame, you know, that just – should never forget the name of somebody who made such an impression.</span> <span id="s1030">But at any rate, he was a good – good old boy, an Irish American, and he looked in his flushed face [indecipherable] and he looked very affable, friendly, took care of his non-coms and was very much appreciated.</span> <span id="s1031">So, he had come into the office just before me, and he got a call from the director of the museum.</span> <span id="s1032">And the director said oh, he was very sorry, had to bother him this way, but he heard about the – the exchange of troops.</span> <span id="s1033">We had gone on the – on the u-upper Austrian side of the Donau river, and had – the Russians had moved in too far when we – when we met.</span> <span id="s1034">There was a clerical error.</span> <span id="s1035">So that was passed.</span> <span id="s1036">The Russians were in that territory, we didn’t try to throw them out, of course.</span> <span id="s1037">But they were advanced maybe – maybe a couple of miles on – on what was supposed to be a straight line of division.</span> <span id="s1038">And so they now – now decided that they would settle all this at the very highest level.</span> <span id="s1039">Probably Patton himself participated, and they decided they’d better change this.</span> <span id="s1040">So they got together with the Russians and with perfect agreement on it, the Russians would pull back, and we would mo – we’d move forward into that area.</span> <span id="s1041">And when – although we didn’t know anything, or I didn’t know anything, of course, let me say that when I say we don’t know, that means I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1042">But at any rate, I didn’t know there were planning to do this, they didn’t consult me.</span> <span id="s1043">And so, both the major and I were very upset.</span> <span id="s1044">What happened was, when we first came in, the major went over to this museum, and talked to the director, who seemed to be a perfectly reasonable sort of person, to see were there kind of any pictures that were reputed to have been put there by Hitler.</span> <span id="s1045">And – excuse –</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: The director at that time said that no, there were no pictures, but that we could see that there were spaces where pictures had been.</span> <span id="s1048">And we didn’t know what – what wa – happened to them.</span> <span id="s1049">So – but nevertheless, any amount of questioning as the director, produced no answers.</span> <span id="s1050">And then of course, suddenly, the – there came this change, and he discovered what he knew, or something, that the pictures were in a certain farm wa – in a – in a barn, couple of miles in – in that area.</span> <span id="s1051">And so he said –</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Where the Russians were – where the Soviets were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1054">And he had – he had the – in fact, address.</span> <span id="s1055">He knew exactly how to get there.</span> <span id="s1056">He’d obviously checked somebody.</span> <span id="s1057">What they were, were cases, beautifully made, of wood, for each picture, whether it’s small or large, and were beveled off so that they wouldn’t hurt anything.</span> <span id="s1058">And he said, he se – he was sort of apologetic because he knew he should have revealed this before.</span> <span id="s1059">Although I do – I think if that had happened, what would happen is the Russians would have stiffened, and taken him away.</span> <span id="s1060">So we’re probably lucky that this happened.</span> <span id="s1061">And – and so, they – I’m – I’m surprised they didn’t have Russian guards on – on these things.</span> <span id="s1062">But, at any rate –</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Did he ask – was his request to your Irish American major that – that the Americans go and get his pictures back?</span> <span id="s1064">Was that what the request was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: No, it was a sort of a – a spontaneous reaction of idiocy by everybody there, you know, they – they really – we all agreed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: That you had to get the pictures back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Yeah, had to get the pictures back.</span> <span id="s1068">And I don’t know what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1069">I – I’m not prone to make profound decisions like this, but – but he went around, and asked each soldier, do you want to go?</span> <span id="s1070">It’s a little dangerous, but let’s go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: And this is your major?</span> <span id="s1072">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yeah, this fella, he didn’t know any more than I did really, but at any rate, he’s a very low rank in that big army, and he was making an awful decision.</span> <span id="s1074">But he – we could have all been wiped out.</span> <span id="s1075">Was the craziest thing, going over the Linz bridge, to the other side of the Donau, and feeling that you might be going to your death.</span> <span id="s1076">Anyway, there we were, all armed, everybody had a rifle or a machine gun or something, whatever had been assigned to them.</span> <span id="s1077">And it was a – I thought it was a comical thing afterwards, but I didn’t think that – very much that way at the time.</span> <span id="s1078">So we all went in a little convoy, with the major out ahead in a Jeep, and most of us back in the trucks.</span> <span id="s1079">We had two big trucks, and we didn’t know how much we were going to face.</span> <span id="s1080">Well, we got out there, and in very short order I remember thinking, if I were driving, I wouldn’t have been that – that – that good.</span> <span id="s1081">But we arrived in there, in the top of an enormous barn.</span> <span id="s1082">You know the way those barns were constructed?</span> <span id="s1083">They used the upper levels for hay that they dropped down in the spring.</span> <span id="s1084">And so there were the pictures, among a lot of fressen for the cow – for the – the bulls, or what have you.</span> <span id="s1085">And the – we became a little worried, because the biggest thing of the lot – not – not – not the – the heaviest thing was an unusual shape.</span> <span id="s1086">It was about two feet wide, two feet high, and about six feet long, and weighed like lead, oh.</span> <span id="s1087">We c – we – we could move the pictures pretty easily, but this thing, we didn’t know what it was, we couldn’t take the time to open it, and so we thought we had [indecipherable] take – take it.</span> <span id="s1088">So for our two and a half ton truck, we – we put it on the – the – down early.</span> <span id="s1089">But it took all the muscular strength we could master.</span> <span id="s1090">And so when we got back, w-we drove back, and that was a terrorizing experience, because there was nothing but death.</span> <span id="s1091">Nothing moved in that whole distance that we had –</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: You did – did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: – that – that they had evacuated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: So no people were there, at the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: No people were at the farmhouse, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: No, no, well, I’m sure there’s some took the alternative of going into the cellar, to be discovered later.</span> <span id="s1098">But an awful lot of them went visiting the relatives and friends in the safe part of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: No Soviet soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Did you see any Soviet soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: No, I saw – I didn’t even see an – an ordinary dog.</span> <span id="s1103">You know, they – the little street dogs everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: But we saw nothing breeding in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: The dogs went visiting too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Oh yeah, I mean, they went visiting or – or hid in the cellar, too.</span> <span id="s1108">But at any rate, it was just a naked run really, from the safe sa – place, to this – and it wasn’t too long, and so I figure a couple miles, maybe.</span> <span id="s1109">Then we loaded it all up, and came back.</span> <span id="s1110">And of course, that was the loneliest automobile trip I ever made.</span> <span id="s1111">And so we went across the bridge and got back, and we – we decided to put it in the museum, we could put a guard on it there.</span> <span id="s1112">And we didn’t have anybody el – of the ability to examine them, and we – we didn’t want to – there, there was a – was a big station in – in south Germany, near Munich.</span> <span id="s1113">Munich th – yielded an awful lot of those paintings.</span> <span id="s1114">And they had – there we had some American – those specialists, who knew these paintings, you know.</span> <span id="s1115">You needed somebody like that to make a judgment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Did you open up the cases, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: No, but we did open up one.</span> <span id="s1118">The major said, that damn thing that [indecipherable] and so forth.</span> <span id="s1119">He wanted to see what was in it, so we opened it.</span> <span id="s1120">Was a beautifully encased box.</span> <span id="s1121">And what was it?</span> <span id="s1122">It was a rowing machine with a [indecipherable] iron base, that apparently the officers wanted to take with them, or get rid of, or something.</span> <span id="s1123">Didn’t want to yield to the Russians, maybe.</span> <span id="s1124">So in all that happened, we had a good laugh after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Bu-But [indecipherable], it tied us up for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: So was this – did this whole thing es – did this whole adventure take half a day?</span> <span id="s1128">A day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Oh, well you can be sure we did it as fast as we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: And that – see, that was early in the morning when we first got the word, and the major took no – no time making arrangements with the motor office.</span> <span id="s1132">And, we were up and gone in – in a matter, I’m afraid, of minutes.</span> <span id="s1133">Every able-bodied soldier in the area were – well, at least there was a mass of early risers, you know.</span> <span id="s1134">And the major went around, asked each one of them, you know, why they – why they do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Any flak about it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: And he guessed right.</span> <span id="s1137">Huh – huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Any flak about it from the higher ups later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: None – none that I heard of.</span> <span id="s1140">I didn’t stay on very much longer.</span> <span id="s1141">I got reassigned to France.</span> <span id="s1142">I was going to go home, and they put me in a safer place, I guess.</span> <span id="s1143">But oh, I was – that was quite an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Quite an adventure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1146">And I – I – I thought it was, thinking about it afterwards, I thought it was pretty darn clever of these fellows to say yes, you know, that’s – then it’s a very freaky thing.</span> <span id="s1147">I’m sure that if you ask the same people, a lot of them would have said no.</span> <span id="s1148">But that’s th – I know how those things happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Well, when you’re young, and the war is over, it sort of – it can go with the territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: It can go – so tell me, when did you return back to the States?</span> <span id="s1152">Did you stay in Europe much longer after the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Well, I was assigned to a place in Mourmelon in France.</span> <span id="s1154">I then was shipped to Paris, and got a job as an editor on the “Stars and Stripes,” which I thought was a delightful way to finish up with the army.</span> <span id="s1155">And then in due course I had enough credits to come home.</span> <span id="s1156">Was a lovely assignment there.</span> <span id="s1157">I don’t know what happened to the teletypes.</span> <span id="s1158">They just never showed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: I guess not.</span> <span id="s1160">Well, is there anything else you’d like to add to – to this story that we’ve talked about this morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1162">There – there’s an after play, you might say.</span> <span id="s1163">I stayed on in – in Austria for quite a time, and these people got out of their cages, and they’d just walk around, stupefied.</span> <span id="s1164">I don’t know how they ate.</span> <span id="s1165">I – I was a nonsmoker, and it – but I took my smoking rations.</span> <span id="s1166">And cigarettes were worth an awful lot of money.</span> <span id="s1167">You could get a dinner, a whole dinner, for a cigarette in some places.</span> <span id="s1168">And I had no use for them, so – so I – I – I gave mine away, rather than destroy them.</span> <span id="s1169">And they di – they’d know, as soon as they saw the cigarettes, I was being a friendly – I-I don’t know how they were treated by other soldiers, you know?</span> <span id="s1170">And it’s a terribly disturbing thing if somebody comes up and says in a perfectly modulated civilian voice, something obviously understandable, if you could understand the language.</span> <span id="s1171">It’s a terrible feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Sometimes they just want a sa – a cigarette, or some – or a – or – they’d never ask for a cigarette.</span> <span id="s1174">They’d get it if somebody gave it to them.</span> <span id="s1175">It was much too valuable a piece of property.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: You’re talking now about people who had been prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Yes, right, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Former prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: – didn’t speak a language that I understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: By then I could get along all right for primitive things in da – German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: I had studied it, and so I ha – had an advantage.</span> <span id="s1184">But I don’t know, it – it seems unreal.</span> <span id="s1185">I don’t even think I – sometimes I don’t think I ha – I went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: It’s not – you know, there are people I’ve talked to who have been survivors of some of these camps, and they say the same thing.</span> <span id="s1187">Sometimes they say, I wonder if this really happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1189">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Funny experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1193">Well, thank you.</span> <span id="s1194">Thank you so much –</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Well – well, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: – today, Mr. McClure, for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Thank you for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: – sharing in all this with us.</span> <span id="s1199">I appreciate it.</span> <span id="s1200">The museum appreciates it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1203">And this concludes our interview with Mr. Brooks McClure, on June 7th – July 7th, 2011, at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s1204">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span
