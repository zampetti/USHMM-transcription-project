id="s2">PS: This is Phil Solomon, interviewing Mr. Fred Kulick for the Holocaust Oral History Archive of Gratz College.</span> <span id="s3">Mr. Kulick is a veteran of World War II, having served in the U.S. Army in Europe.</span> <span id="s4">The date is April 23rd, 1990.</span> <span id="s5">Mr. Kulick, can you tell us when you arrived in Europe and the identity of your unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">FK: Yes.</span> <span id="s7">I was a member of the 336th Engineer Combat Battalion, Amphibious.</span> <span id="s8">Certain Engineer Combat Battalions had been taken several years earlier in America and diverted from the normal training, given such units, and placed along the east coast of America to conduct amphibious training, which is the ability to move army across the boundary between the land and the sea.</span> <span id="s9">We were scheduled very early on for the Normandy landing, and we were sent to Wales about a year earlier than the landing, excuse me, nine months earlier.</span> <span id="s10">And we practiced on the Welch beaches that which we had to do in, for real, in Normandy on June 6th, which we did.</span> <span id="s11">And after that we stayed on the beach a great while because we, the Navy, could not successfully open the ports they had hoped to supply the Army with.</span> <span id="s12">Therefore supplies had to come in over the beach for a protracted period.</span> <span id="s13">At the end of that period, we were also kept back because there was supposed to be a second invasion into Belgium, in Belgium, the Walcheren Islands, to relieve the pressure on the English Army on the north flank.</span> <span id="s14">And finally they decided that we were doing well enough in Europe.</span> <span id="s15">There would not have to be a second invasion, and we joined the, I believe it was the Ninth Corps in crossing the Roer River, and later the Rhine River, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">PS: That was the Ninth Corps of which army?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">FK: Pardon me.</span> <span id="s18">Not the Ninth Corps.</span> <span id="s19">It was the Ninth Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">PS: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">FK: And I don't recall the corps number.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">PS: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">FK: It might have been 19th or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">PS: You mentioned June 6th.</span> <span id="s25">That would be June 6th of 1944, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">FK: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">PS: So you...</span></p> <p><span id="s28">FK: It was called D-Day...</span></p> <p><span id="s29">PS: D-Day, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">FK: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">PS: At that time were you aware of Nazi atrocities against humanity?</span> <span id="s32">Were you aware at all that there were concentration camps, that there were, that the gassing of prisoners, the crematories?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">FK: No, I was not aware at all of what they call the Final Solution today.</span> <span id="s34">I was certainly aware, I remember thinking about it actually on the beach on June 6th.</span> <span id="s35">I think that I felt, and I think others, if this damn fellow Hitler hadn't been so rude to, bad to the Jews, we probably wouldn't have to be there.</span> <span id="s36">That was very much on my mind.</span> <span id="s37">But we knew nothing of any plan to institute the death of the Jews.</span> <span id="s38">We just felt it was the old antisemitic stuff that the Nazis had been pulling since the late '30s, which is well-known around the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">PS: Now you were then in combat through France.</span> <span id="s40">During your advance through the country, that is through France, did you see any examples of Nazi crimes against, like displaced persons, against civilians, against prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">FK: No, I saw nothing of that type in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">PS: And you heard nothing of the extreme treatment of both humani--of humans in the displaced persons and prisoners of war camps or...</span></p> <p><span id="s43">FK: There were always rumors, but I couldn't, I don't remember anything specific.</span> <span id="s44">We knew they were bad guys, and had a great disdain for the eastern people and the Jewish people and etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">PS: Then you entered Germany in which area?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">FK: We entered Germany by crossing the Roer River [German: Ruhr River].</span> <span id="s47">It's R-O-E-R.</span> <span id="s48">And went in through the Roer so to speak.</span> <span id="s49">The situation as I recall it was, it was not a combat crossing for us.</span> <span id="s50">There had been an, a river combat, river crossing a few days before we got there, and as I recall it, things were going very well.</span> <span id="s51">We were coming pell mell up against what they call the Siegfried Line.</span> <span id="s52">But I don't remember it being a hard go at all.</span> <span id="s53">We made a good many miles a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">PS: At that point were you above the Saar valley?</span> <span id="s55">North of Saarbrücken?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">FK: Yes.</span> <span id="s57">Yes.</span> <span id="s58">We were.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">PS: When you first saw your first atrocity, whether it was a scene or a concentration camp, at what point was that, Fred?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">FK: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s61">PS: That you saw your first example of...</span></p> <p><span id="s62">FK: I had some trouble with this.</span> <span id="s63">I recall it was a town named Gardelegen, G-A-R-D-E-L-E-G-E-N.</span> <span id="s64">And I don't know where it is.</span> <span id="s65">We crossed the Roer River, and then we set up across the Rhine River.</span> <span id="s66">Then we went all the way up.</span> <span id="s67">I think it was after the Roer River.</span> <span id="s68">It may have been after the Rhine River.</span> <span id="s69">It was a small, rural town.</span> <span id="s70">I'd never heard of it.</span> <span id="s71">I've heard of it only coincidentally since.</span> <span id="s72">We were on the road travelling.</span> <span id="s73">We were on the extreme northern flank of the American Army, up against the British, which we'd been all the way through.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">PS: Then you came upon a concentration camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s75">FK: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s76">PS: Or another facility that...</span></p> <p><span id="s77">FK: Yeah, I'll try to describe it, because I couldn't call it a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s78">It was a rural area, a small, neat little German town down in the valley, and on the outside of the town, oh, as much as three miles, was an intensely agricultural area, and that's where this incident occurred.</span> <span id="s79">There was a great barn, such as the Germans in that area used.</span> <span id="s80">It seems to be made out of an orange colored tile.</span> <span id="s81">They're very large, with large, heavy oak like doors hung from no [unclear] at the top and with a dirt floor.</span> <span id="s82">And there was about a quarter of a mile away from that a lot of tar paper shacks, in a glen of woods.</span> <span id="s83">And we were informed that these people who suffered this incident were agricultural labor from some camp nearby, where the farmers would bring in like our own migratory workers.</span> <span id="s84">They would live in these tar paper shacks and do the work in the fields and the barns for the farmers.</span> <span id="s85">Of course the difference was these people were prisoners.</span> <span id="s86">And there was a detail of S.S. men to secure them, although there was not heavy concentration camp structure.</span> <span id="s87">It was almost as though it were a transient operation, as opposed to what I was later to see as a full concentration camp.</span> <span id="s88">What had happened was, apparently as our column approached, and being the first ones in that area, the workers had been locked in the barn.</span> <span id="s89">It's estimated there, I, my estimate is 75 to 100, although it could have been 200, certainly the true numbers are in the battalion report of the daily report of the 336th Engineer Combat Battalion if one were to research it.</span> <span id="s90">And they had been locked in this barn.</span> <span id="s91">That is to say this large, heavy door had been shut.</span> <span id="s92">There were many bales of hay in the barn.</span> <span id="s93">The soldiers apparently had set up a machine gun outside the door of the barn so to shoot anyone attempting to escape.</span> <span id="s94">The barn had gotten on fire inside.</span> <span id="s95">Whether the soldiers set the fire with the machine gun from outside, or whether it was set from inside, there would be no evidence that we would see.</span> <span id="s96">But, what did happen is they were not permitted to come out.</span> <span id="s97">And everybody was killed by smoke inhalation or burning.</span> <span id="s98">When we finally got the door open, the bodies were all black.</span> <span id="s99">The barn itself didn't seem to burn.</span> <span id="s100">It was so big, and being made of masonry.</span> <span id="s101">The horrible thing, the thing that will live forever in my mind was the people who were extruded under a one inch gap between the bottom of the heavy sliding oak door and the earth surface of the floor of the barn and the threshold through the door.</span> <span id="s102">It indicated without a doubt that the pressure of the poor devils to get out was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">PS: Did you believe at that time that the fire was set due to the advance of the American troops, rather than have them rescued by the liberators, that they deliberately killed them by locking them into the...</span></p> <p><span id="s104">FK: Yes, that's the only...</span></p> <p><span id="s105">PS: Barn or...</span></p> <p><span id="s106">FK: Logical conclusion I can come to.</span> <span id="s107">I keep looking for an accidental excuse which would relieve the soul of anybody who saw it to realize it was an accident.</span> <span id="s108">But it could not have been.</span> <span id="s109">A, it would have been no effort for anybody outside, especially a group of tough soldiers, to open the door and let them out...</span></p> <p><span id="s110">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">FK: Had it been an accidental fire.</span> <span id="s112">It was obviously an intent to keep them in there.</span> <span id="s113">Just how the fire was set, I don't know.</span> <span id="s114">But simply a tracer bullet from the machine guns could easily ignite all the stacked bales of hay.</span> <span id="s115">The interior of one of these barns is as much as, oh, forty, fifty feet high.</span> <span id="s116">They were huge things.</span> <span id="s117">It reminded one of more of a little airplane hangar.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">PS: When you did gain access to the interior of the barn to observe, you did observe...</span></p> <p><span id="s119">FK: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">PS: The bodies?</span> <span id="s121">Could you determine, were there any children, if there were any children among these?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">FK: No, I don't recall seeing bodies of children.</span> <span id="s123">And I think I would, because our commander, Lieutenant Colonel Paul Bennett, made a decision that these people at least deserved a decent burial.</span> <span id="s124">You must remember this was a very isolated agricultural area.</span> <span id="s125">There hadn't been no Wehrmacht in there that we were aware of.</span> <span id="s126">There'd been no attempt by any army to defend.</span> <span id="s127">It was, and to us it was just a passage through to a point we'd been ordered to go to, and we ran across the thing by accident.</span> <span id="s128">And we presume that the detail of S.S. guards, which I don't believe was more than about ten, were the only army around.</span> <span id="s129">And they had not exhibited no hostile intent toward us.</span> <span id="s130">But, our colonel had decided these people deserved a decent burial.</span> <span id="s131">So he sent someone down to the little town and gathered up some fine citizens there--I believe the Burgermeister and anybody he could put his hands on--and brought them back and they were ordered to remove this pile of charred bodies and dig graves for them right in that site.</span> <span id="s132">And in turn I remember that we put some soldiers with bayonets in charge to make sure that the Germans did the job fairly and smartly and as I recall, one of our sergeants was so furious that the thing he [unclear] the Germans running by with the charred remains in their hands, to get them to act smarter and move faster.</span> <span id="s133">We were always concerned that the soldiers would start shooting just out of sheer disgust.</span> <span id="s134">It never happened in this case.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">PS: Was there any communication between the men in your unit and these German civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">FK: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">PS: Such as...</span></p> <p><span id="s138">FK: Epithets [chuckles].</span></p> <p><span id="s139">PS: There was no interrogation to determine how much they knew or what they were denying?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">FK: I think there was.</span> <span id="s141">Now, I have to tell you it's going by a fading memory, but I know that we made a full report of it, and I know that the Burgermeister and his people had no idea this was going on.</span> <span id="s142">And I can believe that.</span> <span id="s143">That doesn't mean to say they didn't know that there were conscripted labor out there from the camps to help with harvest and so forth, planting in the spring time.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">PS: Do you believe that there...</span></p> <p><span id="s145">FK: But I don't think that they knew that the S.S. was going to shoot these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">PS: Or a possibility that they may not have even known that there were the harshly treated, probably deprived of subsistence, as far as, you know, their food and so forth.</span> <span id="s147">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s148">FK: Well, I can't separate what I might remember about that from what I feel about that although I spent much of my mature life in Germany.</span> <span id="s149">I, and even during the war I went to Dachau just after the war.</span> <span id="s150">In May I took a little leave to go down and look at that thing.</span> <span id="s151">And, Bergen-Belsen also.</span> <span id="s152">And whether the German citizen knew, I don't know.</span> <span id="s153">I know that there were some camps where these atrocities didn't go on.</span> <span id="s154">For instance, our battalion liberated the Volkswagen factory at Wolfsburg, and they were putting these cars out at a good rate, in spite the fact that British in night bombing had bombed a hole right in the middle of this long assembly line.</span> <span id="s155">We met the manager and talked to him.</span> <span id="s156">He had been trained at the Ford Motor Company assembly plant in Long Island in the '30s.</span> <span id="s157">And he was selected to run this first big Volkswagen plant.</span> <span id="s158">They had a tremendous number of prisoners to service the labor needs of the camp.</span> <span id="s159">And I don't think we heard of any gross abuse of human rights there, in the way that we speak of when we speak of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s160">Certainly it was a very rugged, miserable and probably very unfair prison system.</span> <span id="s161">Incidentally, they assembled the cars by putting them on a conveyor belt as all people still do.</span> <span id="s162">But the bomb, one of the bombs from the British cluster made a hole in the assembly line, in the middle of a long, a several block-long assembly line.</span> <span id="s163">So they would have gangs of prisoners with a cradle pick the car, half assembled up, in a cradle and maybe twenty fellows would take it way out in the fields and around by the other end of the assembly line.</span> <span id="s164">Ingenious.</span> <span id="s165">But the point is I don't remember seeing anything except miserable, tar paper shed conditions with police guards and a lot of barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">PS: And I guess with the essential work that those people were doing, they probably were, received enough food to keep them physically able to perform the labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">FK: Also I think because the Volkswagen plant was one of the glories of Germany...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">FK: Certain visitors would come and they wouldn't want them to see the...</span></p> <p><span id="s170">PS: When you entered the barn, were any of the, were the bodies, I imagine they were so badly burned that you were not able to determine what the general physical condition was prior to the cremation.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">FK: No, it's...</span></p> <p><span id="s172">PS: Was there...</span></p> <p><span id="s173">FK: It's, all I can compare it is if you've ever left a chicken in the oven too long and brought a black smoking thing out...</span></p> <p><span id="s174">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">FK: That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">PS: So you couldn't determine whether or not they were starved...</span></p> <p><span id="s177">FK: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">PS: Starved and just skin and bones?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">FK: No.</span> <span id="s180">And the amazing thing, and we never found a survivor alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">PS: Oh, I was just gonna ask you if they...</span></p> <p><span id="s182">FK: [unclear] apparently after gathering them all up.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">PS: We had the same experience where, I often thought that you would think that with the approach of whether the British or the Russians or the Americans, that they would feel, well, you know, these poor people have been through enough...</span></p> <p><span id="s184">FK: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">PS: That, let them live, but in almost every case we've heard of, they just went on a last minute mere frenzy of killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">FK: Apparently that was organized from Berlin.</span> <span id="s187">You know, I can't believe that simultaneously all those people would think to do that.</span> <span id="s188">I think that it must have been an order.</span> <span id="s189">I'll always feel...</span></p> <p><span id="s190">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">FK: It was a centrally controlled plan, determined effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">PS: There were, as you say, there were no living...</span></p> <p><span id="s193">FK: No survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">PS: In that general area, and at that point you still had not seen any displaced persons or prisoners of war that had been liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">FK: Oh I, we probably, we would go through a rail center...</span></p> <p><span id="s196">PS: I guess...</span></p> <p><span id="s197">FK: We'd see them being shunted around.</span> <span id="s198">We had drawn German prisoners ourselves to accomplish some engineering work.</span> <span id="s199">But, we wouldn't think too much about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s201">I believe you said that this incident was recorded in your regimental history?</span> <span id="s202">It's...</span></p> <p><span id="s203">FK: I'm sure it's in the battalion records.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">PS: Of the 363rd...</span></p> <p><span id="s205">FK: 336th.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">PS: Oh, 33-...</span></p> <p><span id="s207">FK: Engineer Combat Battalion, Amphibious.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">PS: Then, from there, oh, do you recall the approximate date that you witnessed this atrocity?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">FK: I'm sorry, I can't give you that.</span> <span id="s210">I know it was in the spring time.</span> <span id="s211">We were moving, well, it would certainly be in the months...</span></p> <p><span id="s212">PS: Probably...</span></p> <p><span id="s213">FK: During...</span></p> <p><span id="s214">PS: April?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">FK: No, no.</span> <span id="s216">Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">PS: Earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">FK: I'm sure it was earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">FK: Well, March...</span></p> <p><span id="s221">PS: That would have been...</span></p> <p><span id="s222">FK: April time frame I'd have to place it at.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">PS: Yeah, that would have been after the crossing of the Rhine, I imagine, wouldn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">FK: I have trouble with it.</span> <span id="s225">I don't know as I sit here whether it was after the crossing of the Rhine or after the crossing of the [pause] Roer.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">FK: I don't think it hap--you know the Roer River is on the, Roer River is on the French side of the Rhine.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">FK: It's a small, narrow strip of land as you're looking at a map.</span> <span id="s230">It could have been in there, but it could have been after the Rhine too.</span> <span id="s231">I know we had broken out and were going hell for [unclear] to get further up toward Berlin.</span> <span id="s232">We wound up across the Elbe River north of Berlin.</span> <span id="s233">The records will show that though.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">PS: After the incident that you just described, between then and the end of the war, the surrender of Germany, did you witness any other sites or atrocities?</span> <span id="s235">Any concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">FK: No.</span> <span id="s237">After the war I did, but not up till...</span></p> <p><span id="s238">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">FK: The end.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">PS: Do you remember the, you described the area.</span> <span id="s241">Do you remember the name of a, of an adjacent or a nearby area to...</span></p> <p><span id="s242">FK: I believe it's Gardelegen.</span> <span id="s243">G-A-R-D-E-L-E-G-E-N.</span> <span id="s244">I probably couldn't remember a lot of this if it hadn't been for an incident that occurred a good many years ago.</span> <span id="s245">I'd like to tell you about it, because it'll key a lot of things here.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">PS: Oh, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">FK: My boys went to the William Penn Charter School, and one of them came home--I believe it was my older son Fred--and at the dinner table he told me that he had the impression from the teachings there about the war that a great deal of the [pause] horrors visited upon the Jews was the result of imagination, etc., etc.</span> <span id="s248">That is to say as though the thing had been overblown.</span> <span id="s249">And I was aghast at this.</span> <span id="s250">And I remember that our battalion photographer, Engineer Combat Battalion Seven, cameraman, put, had been ordered by the intelligence officer as to take pictures of the event.</span> <span id="s251">By the event I mean the, our interring this, interring the soldiers, the victims.</span> <span id="s252">And I had a, he passed out collections of these pictures to various people, and I had brought one home with me as one of my mementos of the war.</span> <span id="s253">I don't know why we hang on to things like that, but as probably we can’t separate, you wouldn't believe it, so here, look at it.</span> <span id="s254">Anyway, I was so aghast that my son was being misinformed as a student that I went up to my chest of army garbage you might call it, and brought them down and made him look at them and explained this whole incident to him.</span> <span id="s255">Not too long after that, within a year or two, I noticed a piece of, in The New York Times, put in there by Yad Vashem people in Israel, and they wanted to know if anybody had knowledge of the atrocities that occurred at two points, they mentioned--one of which was Gardelegen.</span> <span id="s256">And I thought, that sounds exactly like where this occurred.</span> <span id="s257">So I arranged through Israeli colleagues in my business--we have a plant in Haifa--that this set of pictures should go to them, along with a little description of what I remembered about it.</span> <span id="s258">And shortly after that I got an invitation from the old general running the Yad Vashem that the next time I was in the vicinity he would ask me to call on him.</span> <span id="s259">I did that and we had tea and he thanked me for it, and that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s260">But, it was because of that happening a long time after the war that I have a fairly good memory, though I can't seem to say exactly where it was.</span> <span id="s261">He said that, the story and the pictures went into their files and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">PS: That's the files of the Yad Vashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">FK: Yes, in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s265">You mentioned that after the incident of, you mentioned the barn, the burning, you mentioned I believe that you saw nothing else that was a, of a major atrocity or a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s266">But do you recall when you first heard, and was it prior to the end of the war, that you first heard of concentration camps, of the gassing of prisoners, of the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">FK: Yes.</span> <span id="s268">We, you know, the U.S. Army had a newspaper.</span> <span id="s269">I forget the name.</span> <span id="s270">Stars and Stripes.</span> <span id="s271">And I recall it was always full of the latest findings.</span> <span id="s272">Look what the sons of bitches have done next.</span> <span id="s273">So we were well aware of that.</span> <span id="s274">Also, one of our captains had visited Bergen-Belsen during the war.</span> <span id="s275">As I told you, our battalion was always the one next to the British Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">PS: British, yeah, the northern...</span></p> <p><span id="s277">FK: And they liberated Bergen-Belsen, and he jumped in there and took a look at it.</span> <span id="s278">He told me some horrible stories about what he saw there.</span> <span id="s279">But by then I think everybody in the armed forces knew...</span></p> <p><span id="s280">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">FK: Very much about this.</span> <span id="s282">It hadn't been secret for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">PS: Now I believe Bergen-Belsen was the first concentration camp liberated on the western, by either British or Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">FK: He was shown a lot of things that, you know, people with livers ripped out of them.</span> <span id="s285">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">PS: You say that after the end of combat, you visited, you mentioned Dachau.</span> <span id="s287">You saw...</span></p> <p><span id="s288">FK: Dachau, yes.</span> <span id="s289">It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s290">PS: Was that very soon after the German surrender?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">FK: Yes, it was very soon after.</span> <span id="s292">We were ordered, do you mind if I give you a little history of our unit so I can...</span></p> <p><span id="s293">PS: Oh, oh certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">FK: Put it in the context of...</span></p> <p><span id="s295">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">FK: After we crossed the Elbe River, we were facing the Russians, who were coming in.</span> <span id="s297">We contacted the Russians.</span> <span id="s298">And the whole German S.S. Corps, which had never been in battle, was, had been up in Denmark.</span> <span id="s299">If you look at the map, Denmark is a finger running up to the north.</span> <span id="s300">And these people were up there and supposedly to repel an invasion, had we made that second invasion.</span> <span id="s301">And they wanted to surrender to us.</span> <span id="s302">And we were then part of the 19th Airborne Corps, which included the 101st Division.</span> <span id="s303">We, the idea that these S.S. Corps had was that if they would surrender to us, we would take them by, let them come back into Germany or to France even, and they'd be safe from the advancing Russians, who had just about crushed Berlin and nobody could stop them.</span> <span id="s304">So, we were elated.</span> <span id="s305">We thought that would be the end of the war.</span> <span id="s306">But we got word from Eisenhower's headquarters in Reims, France that we could not take anybody back over the Elbe.</span> <span id="s307">Well meanwhile we had let them come down and sit on the banks of the Elbe, and we had forced them to set up their own camps.</span> <span id="s308">They outnumbered us maybe 20 to 1.</span> <span id="s309">We were just terrified of whether we could control them, and they were fully armed, had never been in combat, were very morose about Germany losing the war and it was a very dicey situation.</span> <span id="s310">But anyway, these people had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s311">We had no food for them.</span> <span id="s312">They had to forage themselves in the countryside.</span> <span id="s313">We just set up machine guns to contain them.</span> <span id="s314">And then one night we were told, "At three o'clock in the morning the Russians will appear and they will replace you at your machine guns.</span> <span id="s315">You get in your trucks and go."</span> <span id="s316">[chuckles] We were not unhappy about that.</span> <span id="s317">So we then went down to Trier, in the German Palatinate I think you call it, and there we were put to work stripping transformers and power wiring and every thing else off the German countryside and handing it over to the French so they could re place war damage in France.</span> <span id="s318">And in this period I took a little leave and went to Munich.</span> <span id="s319">And I went to Dachau and I saw that.</span> <span id="s320">That was my first real experience of the inside of a concentration camp where the Holocaust had been ordered.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s322">PS: ...the interview with Mr. Fred Kulick.</span> <span id="s323">You were speaking...</span></p> <p><span id="s324">FK: Yes, we were just talking about, I was trying to respond in a very circuitous way, to the question whether, did I think the German citizen really knew of the atrocities going on in the camps in their vicinity.</span> <span id="s325">And as I said in my contacts with Germans I have come close to, I've always eventually gotten down to the question, "How could it have happened?</span> <span id="s326">Did you know?</span> <span id="s327">Why didn't you know?"</span> <span id="s328">And, I think they knew, but psychologically they couldn't admit it, and physically they could do nothing about it.</span> <span id="s329">There had never been a successful uprising against Hitler or any of his methods.</span> <span id="s330">They lacked that kind of bravery, or that desire to get killed for resisting too hard.</span> <span id="s331">But they had to have known about it.</span> <span id="s332">But I also know that sometimes a denial process occurs.</span> <span id="s333">I also feel that, and they've used the excuse with me, "Well, you know the camps were to accomplish the removal of antisocial people from our streets.</span> <span id="s334">We had all kinds of trouble after World War I on the streets."</span> <span id="s335">And so every good German understood the necessity for having camps.</span> <span id="s336">They felt they were the normal penal style and everybody took comfort in the fact that we're, making them free [chuckles].</span> <span id="s337">But then, it's unbelievable that Dachau, as close as it is to Germany, people that I talked to who were not little people in any sense--they were business leaders and business owners--had to have known.</span> <span id="s338">Certainly they all were requisitioning people from the camps to do work for them.</span> <span id="s339">And I just will never believe they did not know.</span> <span id="s340">But I also have an understanding on how we deny things that are absolutely unacceptable to us, even though they're true.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">PS: When you visited Dachau, had it been cleaned up pretty well?</span> <span id="s342">That is all, as far as burial of all victims and...</span></p> <p><span id="s343">FK: Yes, but there were still people alive who, and I remember a medical person said to me that they probably would die, would never get to leave Dachau.</span> <span id="s344">But I think that they'd been set up in a [pause] comfortable situations by a medical fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">PS: Did you witness any other, after the war, that is...</span></p> <p><span id="s346">FK: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">PS: Any other concentration camps or any other examples of sites of atrocities?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">FK: [pause] Not in Germany.</span> <span id="s349">That's a measured answer, because certainly the French were very beastly in their handling of German prisoners, especially S.S. prisoners.</span> <span id="s350">And I suppose they justify it because of things that happened to French...</span></p> <p><span id="s351">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">FK: People.</span> <span id="s353">I do remember visiting Saint-Lo, where there was, there's monuments to the deportation of the Jews.</span> <span id="s354">And certainly I visited the monument of the tip of the Ile de la Cité in Paris.</span> <span id="s355">So I'm sure that this went on everywhere, but only in the certain camps of Germany have I ever heard of this random killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">PS: When you first heard of the random killings such as the [unclear] gassing, the crematorium and so forth, did you really in your wildest dreams ever imagine that the final figure would be twelve million people who were exterminated during the course of the Nazi regime?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">FK: No.</span> <span id="s358">No.</span> <span id="s359">One would hope the world had moved away from that type of retribution, reprisal.</span> <span id="s360">It hadn't, and it made one very uneasy about the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">PS: Yeah, we often, so often hear the slaughter of the six million Jews.</span> <span id="s362">And I guess a lot of people don't stop and realize that there were just as many non-Jews--Poles and Gypsies and all the political prisoners...</span></p> <p><span id="s363">FK: Antisocials.</span> <span id="s364">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s365">PS: Antisocial, of course which could apply to I guess anyone they cared to label...</span></p> <p><span id="s366">FK: And I think the key...</span></p> <p><span id="s367">PS: Label as such.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">FK: The key belief of Rosenberg or Hitler, whoever cooked it up was, that people of eastern origin were inferior, someone less than human, a sub-human species, and therefore had not to be treated with the reasonableness that one--which had been going on for centuries.</span> <span id="s369">I think the idea to downgrade a whole continent like that, I just couldn't believe it happened.</span> <span id="s370">I couldn't believe it could happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">PS: Were you at any time aware that, well now there were first the rumors, but then I think it's, it was backed up by facts and records, that the German soldiers them selves, as they advanced through eastern Europe, were encouraged to kill, with the, being told that they were entering countries that had an inferior civilization...</span></p> <p><span id="s372">FK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">PS: And encouraged to, you know, we heard that quite often.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">FK: Well, it was like the government gave them moral absolution for the deeds the government required to be done.</span> <span id="s375">It's not the first time that's happened.</span> <span id="s376">But certainly that's true.</span> <span id="s377">And, but I also know that it didn't work too well.</span> <span id="s378">There were just too many Wehrmacht people to--you know the German Army conscripted soldiers--didn't have it in them to kill that way, so they always had to back them up with S.S. people, the death sentence people.</span> <span id="s379">Not the WaffenS.S.</span> <span id="s380">And they--seemed to take a delight and enthusiasm in doing this job, which I think would have been repugnant to the average German soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">PS: I've always been very proud to say that my own experience in combat through Germany, that regardless of what we saw, all the evidence of the just unbelievable, all but unbelievable atrocities of the Nazi regime against humanity, I've always been proud to say that I actually never saw an American soldier mistreat a German civilian.</span> <span id="s382">Do you have any comments on the men in your outfit and your, you know, the attitude, physical, mental, toward German, the German civilian population?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">FK: [pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s384">PS: Any resentment that was taken out on, let's say unarmed, defenseless civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">FK: I was told of cases of rape, against women, which I suppose is not rare in any war.</span> <span id="s386">But, where certainly the American soldier, no, I can't say he [chuckling] might have raped a woman in Wilkes Barre the same day...</span></p> <p><span id="s387">PS: Yeah, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s388">FK: That is, so I can't...</span></p> <p><span id="s389">PS: In other words there was no...</span></p> <p><span id="s390">FK: I can't believe that there was...</span></p> <p><span id="s391">PS: There was no...</span></p> <p><span id="s392">FK: There was no...</span></p> <p><span id="s393">PS: Really organized...</span></p> <p><span id="s394">FK: No, quite the reverse.</span> <span id="s395">I think that the American soldiers even tended to share their rations and...</span></p> <p><span id="s396">PS: That's...</span></p> <p><span id="s397">FK: A certain sympathy with the German civilian who was as much a victim of the ravages of war as anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s399">I know we felt the same.</span> <span id="s400">In fact I think in most cases, to us they represented a mother and father image.</span> <span id="s401">Those that we saw were, you know in their middle 50s and 60s.</span> <span id="s402">And I think being away from home and our own loved ones for such a long period, I think I sort of really, looking back on it, I kind of think that in many, many cases or most cases, we related this to a mother and father image.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">FK: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">PS: How long did you remain in Europe after the German surrender?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">FK: Well, after surrender, as I said we'd been sent over back toward France to Trier to do the stripping of power, electrical things for the French.</span> <span id="s406">Then we were sent down to Regensburg, which is over very next to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s407">And there we were told to sit down and keep ourselves out of trouble until they found boat space for us to go down through the Suez.</span> <span id="s408">We were definitely scheduled to go to Okinawa to get ready for the final assault on Japan.</span> <span id="s409">Because we were amphibious we were not permitted to have a leave home--despite the fact that we'd been there since a year before the invasion--because of the necessity for a rapid build up against the Japanese.</span> <span id="s410">And so we sat in Regensburg and stayed out of trouble as best we could.</span> <span id="s411">The men were put in athletics and the things you use to divert troops from being too bored.</span> <span id="s412">And the Germans finally told us that Harry Truman dropped the bomb.</span> <span id="s413">The army never did tell us [chuckling] until it was pretty old news.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">PS: It was a military secret you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">FK: But, how down in the guts of Bavaria, the Bayerische Wald [Bavarian world], I mean really rural forest, how these peasants knew and we didn't I'll never know, but that was the way the world was then.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">PS: What was the approximate date that you left Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">FK: Well, I think it was June, late June, early July.</span> <span id="s418">I know I got home in mid summer and I'd left, at this point, since we were not going to go to Japan, we were selected as individuals and were, our right to go home, parody to get home was a basis of how long we'd been there, etc., etc., etc.</span> <span id="s419">And we traveled as individuals, not a unit.</span> <span id="s420">In fact the unit stayed in Germany quite a while.</span> <span id="s421">So I rode a train out to, they called them the cigarette camps around La Havre.</span> <span id="s422">They built up these large areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">PS: Yeah, Lucky Strike, Old Gold and...</span></p> <p><span id="s424">FK: Yeah.</span> <span id="s425">And finally I got a ride home and came home on I think it was the U.S.S. Anderson I, no, no, I think that was the ship [unclear].</span> <span id="s426">Anyway, army transportation quite sure all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">PS: So you then remained in Europe about six, seven or eight weeks after the end of the war...</span></p> <p><span id="s428">FK: Oh I called May 8th the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">PS: Yeah, May 8th.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">FK: And I don't think I moved for, it'd be right, I don't think I moved toward America, I didn't get to La Havre it was about the 1st of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">PS: Yeah, so around that.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Another Speaker: When was the bomb dropped?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">FK: I don't know.</span> <span id="s434">Oh, it was before this.</span> <span id="s435">No, no.</span> <span id="s436">I don't know.</span> <span id="s437">What was it?</span> <span id="s438">It must have been late May, around that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">PS: During those few weeks, did you see anything of the handling of displaced persons, of the survivors of concentration camps, or our prisoners of war or the survivors of labor camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">FK: Well I saw, I remember as we crossed the Elbe River, we got into this Schleswig Holstein rural area, great farms, and quite a few American prisoners of war approached us, and came along the road.</span> <span id="s441">And they weren't in very good shape.</span> <span id="s442">They'd been, they had been to these farmers what the chaps at Gardelegen had been within I guess conscripted to agricultural work, although they were American prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s443">And they were in terrible shape.</span> <span id="s444">Their teeth were all falling out and they were hungry, and it was hard to believe in this very fertile agricultural area.</span> <span id="s445">If you can imagine being in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and being hungry?</span> <span id="s446">So we would always give our rations to them.</span> <span id="s447">They were very thin.</span> <span id="s448">The number of outfits that got over the Elbe River were very small, and supply was, we only had one bridge.</span> <span id="s449">We'd built it over the Elbe River.</span> <span id="s450">And you could never tell when something would come over.</span> <span id="s451">It was very interesting.</span> <span id="s452">I was in control of the bridge for a little while and a German woman approached me and offered me a string of fine diamond rings if I would let her two girls who were adolescent age get a, roll up in a tarp in the back of one of the supply trucks that we switched back over the bridge to get our daily rations.</span> <span id="s453">And she'd be happy to do that piece of business with me.</span> <span id="s454">Of course I didn't do it, but it shows the terror of these German mothers of young women had, of the daughters being raped, etc., by the Russian Army which was pouring in.</span> <span id="s455">War has so many adjacent horrors which have nothing to do with combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">PS: Yeah, that spill over...</span></p> <p><span id="s457">FK: You have to be there to believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">PS: I believe, Fred, that I have covered just about all that we had intended to accomplish.</span> <span id="s459">In closing, is there anything you would like to add that we haven't covered, or things that I haven't led you, areas that I haven't led you into?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">FK: Not on the Holocaust thing, but on the hate thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">PS: Well, we'd love to hear it...</span></p> <p><span id="s462">FK: It went both ways.</span> <span id="s463">I know that, this is confidential.</span> <span id="s464">I saw a German prisoner shot on the beach at Normandy.</span> <span id="s465">I told you we stayed around helping the ships unload.</span> <span id="s466">And a soldier got very angry, and a German prisoner who'd just surrendered, he'd been up doing a minefield, and there were trenches in it.</span> <span id="s467">On the trenches, running along the brow of the cliff at Normandy, you know that, and somebody had flushed a German Gefreiter corporal out of the, a bunker, and it'd been a week since we'd landed there.</span> <span id="s468">And we thought, what is he living on?</span> <span id="s469">Is he a spy or what?</span> <span id="s470">We had no idea what he was doing but, he said he'd been eating grass.</span> <span id="s471">And he opened his mouth and he showed us all this green, the way you'd get it with fresh cut grass.</span> <span id="s472">And his story held together.</span> <span id="s473">So, he was used to clear a mine, to guide us through a minefield.</span> <span id="s474">And half way through it, someone decided he was trying to lead us into the minefield, and shot him.</span> <span id="s475">He was a, just a poor, disarmed...</span></p> <p><span id="s476">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">FK: Scared, probably.</span> <span id="s478">He was probably a deserter from the German army.</span> <span id="s479">Otherwise he should have fallen back when they did.</span> <span id="s480">So, war is just, forget your morals.</span> <span id="s481">It's, I always felt bad about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">PS: Whenever I speak about these experiences, I think we all have a, just a habit of referring to the men in our outfit.</span> <span id="s483">Then I suddenly think, oh, yeah, we weren't men.</span> <span id="s484">We were kids, 18, 19, 20, 21.</span> <span id="s485">I was one of the oldest men in my outfit, and I was still in my 20s.</span> <span id="s486">So I think we, too often we think of it as, we refer to ourselves as men in those days.</span> <span id="s487">This has been...</span></p> <p><span id="s488">FK: You want an excuse for that fellow, yeah the, and there's always an excuse, was that he was a Polish extraction from Chicago and his Polish family had been run down by the Germans pretty badly and so a little, see a little vindictive you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s490">O.K., this has been an interview with Mr. Fred Kulick, and Mr. Kulick, on behalf of the Holocaust Oral History Archive of Gratz College, I want to thank you very, very much for your most valuable testimony and again, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">FK: Thank you.</span> <span id="s492">It's delightful to talk to another veteran.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">PS: Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
