I come from Czechoslovakia, and my family and I lived in a small town in Southern Slovakia.</span> <span id="s11">I had a brother.</span> <span id="s12">There was two of us.</span> <span id="s13">Two children in the family.</span> <span id="s14">My father had a business.</span> <span id="s15">He had a lumber business.</span> <span id="s16">Lumber mills.</span> <span id="s17">And, he moved to this small town in 1923, when he first got married and he established a business there and, of course, then later on, he raised his family there.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q.</span> <span id="s19">When were you born and what was it like growing up in a small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A. I was born in 1927 and had a beautiful childhood.</span> <span id="s21">Of course, the fact that my parents were so wealthy was very helpful.</span> <span id="s22">And, I really, as far as I can remember, I had everything that I could possibly want when I was growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q. Were there other members of the family—aunts and uncles—around?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A. Uh, not in that small town.</span> <span id="s25">My grandparents lived there—my mother’s parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">I had one uncle, on my mother’s side, who was working for my father in the lumber business.</span> <span id="s27">Later on, he went to the United States in 1938.</span> <span id="s28">My other uncle went in ’39 to Israel.</span> <span id="s29">Uh…on my father’s side, my grandmother lived in a city not too far from where we lived, so we saw each other quite often.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q. Living in a small town, what opportunities were there for a Jewish experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A. Oh, there was a big Jewish community where I lived.</span> <span id="s32">There was, I would say, approximately 250 Jewish families living there, and we had a temple.</span> <span id="s33">There was a Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s34">In fact, for the first five years, I went to the Jewish school and a lot of the Catholic families sent their children to the Jewish school because the education was better than the public schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q. Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A. Yah, and, like I said, we had a very, very active, very nice Jewish community</span></p> <p><span id="s37">there.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q. And you and your family were involved in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A. Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s40">All the time.</span> <span id="s41">Yah.</span> <span id="s42">My mother was the President of the Sisterhood and my father was the President of the Men’s Club…you know like here.</span> <span id="s43">The</span></p> <p><span id="s44">same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q.</span> <span id="s46">So that it really was a very comfortable kind of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A. Yes, yes, very comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q.</span> <span id="s49">You mentioned that the first five years of your education were in the Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s50">Then where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A.</span> <span id="s52">Then I stated high school and I don’t know whether you are familiar with the European school system.</span> <span id="s53">You aren’t?</span> <span id="s54">Well, in Czechoslovakia, instead of going to high school you are going to gymnasium, and I started going to gymnasium in 1938, September.</span> <span id="s55">And then, of course, a few months later, that part of Slovakia, where we lived, was given to Hungary, and the town where I went to gymnasium was cut off.</span> <span id="s56">That remained Slovakia.</span> <span id="s57">So, that meant for me to choose another school, new language, of course, and I went to Hungarian high school then.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q.</span> <span id="s59">That must have been very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A. Well, you know, children learn very quickly.</span> <span id="s61">I mean I was young and…</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q.</span> <span id="s63">How did the other children react to you—being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A. Uh, I didn’t have too many problems in that point.</span> <span id="s65">Uh—I was one of the group and, uh, of course every once in a while they let me know that I was different from the rest of them, but basically I didn’t have too many problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q.</span> <span id="s67">What were some of the things that you did besides go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A. Well, I took different languages.</span> <span id="s69">I studied English and I started to study French, and I studied German, and uh, I took piano lessons and in the wintertime, of course, there was ice-skating.</span> <span id="s70">In the summertime there was swimming and</span></p> <p><span id="s71">camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q.</span> <span id="s73">So the beginnings of problems really did not affect you too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A. No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q.</span> <span id="s76">What did you find was the first evidence that there was trouble?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A. Well, in…let me see, now in 1938, when this change took place, my father happened to have been in the Czechoslovakian army.</span> <span id="s78">When we became Hungary, he could not be a soldier anymore.</span> <span id="s79">But they put him into the labor force.</span> <span id="s80">All the Jews could not wear the Hungarian uniforms.</span> <span id="s81">They were in the labor camps.</span> <span id="s82">Uh—in 1942, my family from Slovakia was deported to Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">My grandmother and my father’s two sisters with their husbands, and the children and nobody ever heard of what Majdanek is.</span> <span id="s84">We got one letter from them and they were telling us they were in a camp and they were going to be working and everything is fine.</span> <span id="s85">We never heard from them.</span> <span id="s86">We never saw them again.</span> <span id="s87">Then, in 19…the beginning of 1944, uh—we heard that the German army moved into Budapest and, of course, almost immediately after that, our travels were restricted.</span> <span id="s88">We couldn’t travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q.</span> <span id="s90">In other words, from 1938 until 1942, there wasn’t much that happened.</span> <span id="s91">And your life went on pretty much?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A. Pretty much normally.</span> <span id="s93">I mean normal.</span> <span id="s94">When I applied for college, I couldn’t get into a college because there was this things called numerus clausus ("closed number" in Latin, refers to anti-Jewish restrictions), where a Jew was not allowed to go to college, but I did manage to find a college that accepted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q.</span> <span id="s96">How did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A. Well, I wrote all kinds of applications and I got into a convent.</span> <span id="s98">I was living there with the nuns and it was an excellent school.</span> <span id="s99">I loved it.</span> <span id="s100">And I was very happy there.</span> <span id="s101">They were very, very good to me.</span> <span id="s102">I was the only Jew there.</span> <span id="s103">In fact, when I left, because of the problems with the Germans, I was afraid to continue.</span> <span id="s104">And I left the school.</span> <span id="s105">They asked me if maybe my mother and my brother would want to come in, and they would try to find a place for us to hide—the nuns.</span> <span id="s106">They were very, very good to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q.</span> <span id="s108">But your mother and brother chose not to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A. No.</span> <span id="s110">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q. And, then from 1942 until 1944, did things become more difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s113">Every day there was something, something new.</span> <span id="s114">You know, one day we had to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s115">The next day, there was a—over the radio we heard the Jews had to give up their cameras.</span> <span id="s116">One day, they came and picked up everybody’s radios.</span> <span id="s117">You know, in those days there were no televisions, only radios.</span> <span id="s118">Uh, of course, my father had a brand new car.</span> <span id="s119">He bought a brand new car every year.</span> <span id="s120">That was the first thing they took from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q.</span> <span id="s122">What about his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A.</span> <span id="s124">The business was taken from us, and, at that point my father was never really home.</span> <span id="s125">He was always in the labor camp and my mother was trying to conduct the business but she wasn’t knowledgeable enough and, then finally, they took the business away from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q.</span> <span id="s127">During the time your father was in the labor camp, did you have—what kind of communication did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A. Uh, only by mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q.</span> <span id="s130">But you were able to keep in touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A. Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s132">Yes.</span> <span id="s133">He could write to us and we could write to him.</span> <span id="s134">They would forward our letters to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q. Censored?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A. Uh, I believe so.</span> <span id="s137">I’m not quite sure but I think they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q. And then what happened in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A. Then, in 1944, well one day, a friend of ours came over and he said that all the Jews have to go.</span> <span id="s140">There was a—I don’t know whether you can call it a factory or a—at the end of the town, a tremendous big building and all the Jews were concentrated in that building.</span> <span id="s141">And, we stayed there for about two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q. Could you bring anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A. Only a backpack.</span> <span id="s144">There was no food.</span> <span id="s145">The only food we had was the food that was lowered through the wall to us by our friends at night.</span> <span id="s146">We had friends on the outside that were Catholic and when they found out where we are, they would bring us the food there every night.</span> <span id="s147">And, we were there about three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">They picked up my mother and she wouldn’t come home at night, back to the place.</span> <span id="s149">And, of course, we were terribly worried about her.</span> <span id="s150">We didn’t know where she was.</span> <span id="s151">The next day they brought her back.</span> <span id="s152">She was all black and blue.</span> <span id="s153">They beat her up.</span> <span id="s154">It was something awful.</span> <span id="s155">They wanted to know what she did with the money and with our jewelry and with— They were asking all kinds of questions from her, and uh—then a few days later, they took us to the nearest big city where there was, what they called, the big ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q. Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A.</span> <span id="s158">That was, I would say, about 20 miles from where we lived.</span> <span id="s159">In a larger city.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Incidentally, that city was where I went to the convent.</span> <span id="s161">The same place.</span> <span id="s162">And then, a week later, they took us to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s163">From there.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q.</span> <span id="s165">What was the trip to Auschwitz like?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A.</span> <span id="s167">It was awful.</span> <span id="s168">It was awful.</span> <span id="s169">They put us in these cattle cars and there was just enough room for everybody to sit on the floor.</span> <span id="s170">Children, old people, women, men—no food, no air, no water.</span> <span id="s171">I believe there were four people—I don’t remember whether three or four people—that died on the train.</span> <span id="s172">Elderly people.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">And, of course, their bodies stayed with us for a week until we arrived at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s174">And the journey took one week.</span> <span id="s175">And, we arrived.</span> <span id="s176">The doors opened, and there were the people, the Germans with their whips, rushing with them, and, of course, we were weak from the trip and we had to march, five in a row.</span> <span id="s177">It seemed like forever, and, of course, my grandparents were with us, and my brother and my mother and I.</span> <span id="s178">There were five of us.</span> <span id="s179">Until we reached—I remember there was a building and there was a gate and at that gate the first thing I noticed were the shiny boots.</span> <span id="s180">Dr. Mengele.</span> <span id="s181">And he determined what was going to happen to each and every one of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q.</span> <span id="s183">We heard about this.</span> <span id="s184">But to have experienced it must have been difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A. Anyway, my mother and I and my brother, we—it was decided that we are going to live.</span> <span id="s186">My grandparents never made it.</span> <span id="s187">And, of course, as we proceeded, we were separated from my brother, and we were pushed into a building and, the next thing I knew, I looked for my mother and I couldn’t find her.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q.</span> <span id="s189">How old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A. I was seventeen—about sixteen and a half—seventeen, and she was standing right next to me all the time.</span> <span id="s191">I didn’t recognize her because they shaved our</span></p> <p><span id="s192">heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q. Do you want to stop a while?</span> <span id="s194">You said, you mentioned that your mother had changed because they had shaved her head.</span> <span id="s195">Did these same things happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A. I had beautiful braids, thick—two braids, and God, I wanted to die when they took that hair off.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q. For a teenage girl…</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A. Oh.</span> <span id="s199">I had beautiful braids.</span> <span id="s200">Never grew back quite that long after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q.</span> <span id="s202">How many were in your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A. Oh, my God, there were wall-to-wall people when we finally made it.</span> <span id="s204">I remember, it was on a Friday when we got to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s205">And, by the time we made it to the barackene, to the barracks, to the camp, it must have been midnight because they put us through delousing and showers, and then we had to wait for each other, and then the march, and it was very, very late and they told us to go into this one barrack, and we stepped all over everybody because we didn’t know that people are sleeping on the floors there.</span> <span id="s206">And, uh, and the next day was 4 o’clock in the morning, they woke us up for a head [count].</span> <span id="s207">Outside, it was freezing, and all day, we were just standing around, just sitting around outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">No food, no water.</span> <span id="s209">No showers, no baths, no toilets, and, after a few days, my mother recognized a childhood friend of hers, and she was like the manager of that particular barrack, and my mother went over to her, and she told her who she was, and this woman then gave us all kind of information—what kind of place we are in, what the name is, what do they do to people, what happened to her family, and she also said that, as soon as we can, if they are looking for a group of women for work, to volunteer and get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q. Work outside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A. Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s212">But this didn’t happen until about four or five months later, that we were able to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q.</span> <span id="s214">This would be early in 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A. Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q.</span> <span id="s217">How did you manage until then?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A. No, this was—this was like closer to the end of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q.</span> <span id="s220">How did you manage until then?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A.</span> <span id="s222">We lost a lot of weight.</span> <span id="s223">I was really surprised that they picked us for labor because we were really emaciated, but I guess we—we could still walk.</span> <span id="s224">That’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q.</span> <span id="s226">What kept you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A. Well, this friend of my mother gave us a little bit of food, whatever she could spare, so the two of us had a little bit more food than anybody else.</span> <span id="s228">Plus the fact that we were young and healthy and, I guess, just the willpower to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q.</span> <span id="s230">What did you know of your brother during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A. Nothing.</span> <span id="s232">Uh.</span> <span id="s233">We saw him once from far away.</span> <span id="s234">He was marching.</span> <span id="s235">They were coming back from some kind of a work commando and we saw him from far away.</span> <span id="s236">Uh.</span> <span id="s237">We couldn’t talk to him.</span> <span id="s238">That was the only time we saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q. Then, he did not survive, to the best of your knowledge?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A. No, he did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q.</span> <span id="s242">What happened with the work detail?</span> <span id="s243">How were you selected and what did that</span></p> <p><span id="s244">mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A. Well, they came.</span> <span id="s246">They needed some 1000 women.</span> <span id="s247">So we were standing again, five in a row, and we had to parade in front of Dr. Mengele, stark naked, of course, and I guess he felt that we would be strong enough to go to work, so we were amongst the 1000 women.</span> <span id="s248">Um.</span> <span id="s249">They took us into Germany, with cattle cars again, of course, and the trip was also about a week.</span> <span id="s250">About.</span> <span id="s251">We arrived to a place called Allendorf, which was not too far from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s252">And, they took us into the camp.</span> <span id="s253">It was a nice beautiful camp—beautiful.</span> <span id="s254">Nice cut grass, and green.</span> <span id="s255">And nice clean barracks and clean bathrooms and we were able to shower.</span> <span id="s256">The food was a little bit better, and we worked in an ammunition factory and we had the night shift.</span> <span id="s257">The whole factory was under ground and we left our camp, I guess around five o’clock in the evening and it took us about an hour to get to the</span></p> <p><span id="s258">factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q. Walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A. Yes, we walked.</span> <span id="s261">Every day.</span> <span id="s262">And, we worked all night, and then in the morning we had to shower before we left the factory and march back.</span> <span id="s263">And, uh, we had an old commander, who was very, very good to us.</span> <span id="s264">I think the fact that we all—all of us survived, could be attributed to him, because he was receiving letters from the higher command to evacuate the camp.</span> <span id="s265">That there is nothing for us to do in the factory any more, and he kept stalling, and he kept us there until he thought the Allies were close enough for us to be liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q.</span> <span id="s267">So he really saved…</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A. Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s269">He did.</span> <span id="s270">In fact, after our liberation, they arrested him and we made sure that they suspended the charges against him.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q. Let me stop you.</span> <span id="s272">What was the liberation like?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A. OK.</span> <span id="s274">When finally the Commander couldn’t stall anymore, he called us all together in the yard and he said, “Look, I have received orders that I have to take you away from here.”</span> <span id="s275">He says “Whatever you have, take with you.”</span> <span id="s276">He gave us each extra food rations and we started marching at night, and during the day we</span></p> <p><span id="s277">rested.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q. And hid?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A. That’s what we did.</span> <span id="s280">The second day we hid in the forest and, when the rest of the group was—marched on, we walked deeper into the forest, and we signaled to each other.</span> <span id="s281">There was nine of us.</span> <span id="s282">And that’s how we found each other.</span> <span id="s283">And, we stayed in the forest for about 3 or 4 days.</span> <span id="s284">We just couldn’t take it any more.</span> <span id="s285">It was raining.</span> <span id="s286">We were all wet.</span> <span id="s287">We were cold.</span> <span id="s288">This was the end of March.</span> <span id="s289">And, finally, two of the girls wanted to go to see what’s going on to the main road.</span> <span id="s290">And, they left, and about an hour later, then came back with all kinds of American food, and then we finally came out through the forest and went into the next town and we saw the American army there.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q. And this was in March of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A. Yah.</span> <span id="s293">Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q. Just shortly before the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A. Yah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q.</span> <span id="s297">What were your feelings then?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A. Oh, my God, it’s very hard to describe.</span> <span id="s299">We couldn’t believe that we are free.</span> <span id="s300">We just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s301">That it—that it was all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q. Your mother was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A. Yes, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s304">The first thing that the Americans did for us.</span> <span id="s305">They went into several German homes, and they requisitioned a room for everybody.</span> <span id="s306">And, of course, sleeping in a clean bed, and sitting on a toilet, that was—.</span> <span id="s307">Then I started working for the American army.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q. Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A. Interpreting.</span> <span id="s310">And I was interviewed once by a Jewish chaplain from the Army, and my picture appeared in the—at that time it was the Brooklyn Eagle, in New York—.</span> <span id="s311">And my uncle recognized me.</span> <span id="s312">In New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q.</span> <span id="s314">He wanted you to come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A.</span> <span id="s316">He wrote to the chaplain a letter.</span> <span id="s317">In fact, I still have that letter.</span> <span id="s318">And that’s how my uncle knew that my mother and I are alive.</span> <span id="s319">And, then of course, the end of May, we wanted to go home because we wanted to see who is left from the family, and we decided we’ll go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q.</span> <span id="s321">What did you have to go through to get permission to go back to your home</span></p> <p><span id="s322">town?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A. Nothing really.</span> <span id="s324">The only thing was that it was complicated because all the railroads were bombed and it took us like over a month to get home, and with all the things that were going on there—the Russian Army was there, and women were raped on the trains.</span> <span id="s325">And it was just terrible.</span> <span id="s326">Many times I said to my mother “This is what we have to come home to?”</span> <span id="s327">It was awful.</span> <span id="s328">But we finally got home unharmed and my father was home.</span> <span id="s329">Because my father escaped from the labor camp, and there was this Gentile family—very, very good friends of ours—that kept my father in hiding all these months and, of course, right after our home town was liberated my father went home and he started the business again but he did not know that we were alive.</span> <span id="s330">And, we, of course did not know that he was alive.</span> <span id="s331">So, the end of June, we got home.</span> <span id="s332">June 28.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q. 1945</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A. June 28, 1945.</span> <span id="s335">We got home.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q.</span> <span id="s337">That must have been quite a reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A. Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s339">We were crying.</span> <span id="s340">All of us—for hours.</span> <span id="s341">And we resumed life.</span> <span id="s342">My bedroom was the last room in the house.</span> <span id="s343">And my window, I had a big bay window in my bedroom.</span> <span id="s344">It faced the main gate.</span> <span id="s345">We had like a very high fence around the house because we had a lumber yard and we had big gates up front, for the trucks and the delivery people.</span> <span id="s346">And I stayed up night after night because I kept hearing knocking on the gate and I thought my brother was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q.</span> <span id="s348">What made you and your family decide to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A. Well, after the war, of course, we started rebuilding.</span> <span id="s350">We tried to pick up the pieces and put them together the best we could and my father started the business again and a few years later the Communists said, “Oh, no, this doesn’t belong to you.”</span> <span id="s351">And they gave us a choice—either we stay and my father can be a manager in his own business or, if we choose to leave, they gave us the option to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">And Israel was the only place that we could leave at that time because we did have the registration consulate in Prague but we had very high quota numbers.</span> <span id="s353">We couldn’t make it to the United States so we went to Israel.</span> <span id="s354">Left everything behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q.</span> <span id="s356">The second time you were uprooted.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s358">We went to Israel and life was very hard there.</span> <span id="s359">Very hard.</span> <span id="s360">This was right after the war and a lot of people came from Europe to Israel and they just didn’t have the facilities where to put all those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q. Was this before Israel became independent?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A. Uh, no, this was about a month after.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q. So, you didn’t have difficulty entering Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A. No, no we didn’t.</span> <span id="s365">My husband was drafted in the army right away.</span> <span id="s366">He was in the Israeli army and we stayed with the third brother of my mother, who lived in Israel for many, many years.</span> <span id="s367">We stayed in his place.</span> <span id="s368">And then we moved to Beersheva.</span> <span id="s369">We lived there and, for some reason or other, we could never make a go of it in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q.</span> <span id="s371">You mentioned your husband.</span> <span id="s372">When did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A. I met him, well, he lived, his family lived in the same town where I was brought up.</span> <span id="s374">And, coincidentally, his family had a lumber business, too.</span> <span id="s375">So after the war, what has happened, they both came back, my father and my husband, and neither of them had enough money to start the lumber business on his own, so, whatever they had they put together and they went in as partners and then, of course, when my mother and I came home, we started dating and I married him.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q. And you all went to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s378">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q.</span> <span id="s380">How did you manage to leave Israel and come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A.</span> <span id="s382">That wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s383">They wouldn’t let us out because my husband was an officer in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q. Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A. They—we had difficulty.</span> <span id="s386">They told us that my son and I can go but they wouldn’t let my husband go.</span> <span id="s387">Finally, I don’t know how, somehow it was arranged that they let us go.</span> <span id="s388">And we came to this country in ’51.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q. You, and your husband, your son and your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s391">Yes.</span> <span id="s392">We lived in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q. Where was your uncle?</span> <span id="s394">In Brooklyn?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A. Yes, and then we moved to Queens and we bought a house and I had another child.</span> <span id="s396">And, you know, we worked.</span> <span id="s397">My husband worked.</span> <span id="s398">I was home with the children and life was more or less routine after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q.</span> <span id="s400">What brought you to Florida?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A. Well, I had some friends that moved down here to Venice and I was just tired of New York.</span> <span id="s402">I wanted a complete change.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q.</span> <span id="s404">Did you bring your parents down when you moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A. No.</span> <span id="s406">My parents were living in Miami already.</span> <span id="s407">They were retired.</span> <span id="s408">And after I moved down here, they moved to Port Charlotte.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q.</span> <span id="s410">So that there is some family nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q.</span> <span id="s413">This has been a very difficult thing for you, and yet, you have done this taping with us.</span> <span id="s414">You have appeared at the Federation meeting.</span> <span id="s415">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A. Well, I guess I just feel like everybody else, that the world shouldn’t forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Because once my generation is gone, and the young generation is not going to be told about it, then nobody will really know what happened.</span> <span id="s418">Nobody will</span></p> <p><span id="s419">remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q.</span> <span id="s421">There are many who feel as you do.</span> <span id="s422">We feel as you do.</span> <span id="s423">There are Centers all over the country now and we hope that the efforts of all of us will keep this memory alive, so it will never happen again.</span> <span id="s424">I want to thank you very much, Mrs.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Ruda, you have been very helpful.</span> <span id="s426">I hope that from now on, it is just smooth</span></p> <p><span id="s427">sailing.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A. I hope so.</span> <span id="s429">And thank you very much.</span> <span id="s430">It was my pleasure, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q. Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s433">PAGE 8</span></p></body></html>
