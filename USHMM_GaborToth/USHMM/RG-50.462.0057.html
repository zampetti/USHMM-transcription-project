little bit about your background, where and when you were born and a little bit about your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">DS: I was born in Berlin, 1928, Berlin, Germany, and my parents--my family was--had lived in the Berlin area for many, many years.</span> <span id="s4">In fact, I can trace the family, I can document the family back to the 18th century--as you've seen the pictures, and we have some documents that date even back to the middle of the 18th century.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">JF: In the Berlin area?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">DS: In the Berlin area, yes.</span> <span id="s7">In and around Berlin, perhaps what today might be considered an outer suburb, was at that time an independent little town.</span> <span id="s8">The family lived partially in Berlin, partially out of town; the family was large during the 19th century and--we had people--just to give you an idea--we were involved in the development of the city of Berlin, of the area.</span> <span id="s9">There were councilmen, there were people in banking, in the manufacturing and industry in Berlin.</span> <span id="s10">My grandfather's sister was married to a man who formed a real estate company before World War I, who was responsible for much of West Berlin before it was destroyed during World War II.</span> <span id="s11">In other words, he developed the country.</span> <span id="s12">What my father told me would take him to Nollendorf Square about in the middle of West Berlin and looking west, there was nothing but wheat fields, this is in the 1890's, and he would say, "Son, as far as you can see, that land that I own."</span> <span id="s13">He was a smart man, and a street was named after him.</span> <span id="s14">This just gives you a background of perhaps the social fabric that the family was involved in, and that came--Let's say during the War of 1870 my grandfather fought in the Prussian army and...</span></p> <p><span id="s15">JF: Did you know your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">DS: No.</span> <span id="s17">he died, I think he died before World War I, and I also didn't know my grandmother on my father's side.</span> <span id="s18">She died sometime around 1917 or 1918.</span> <span id="s19">My father was born in 1883, I believe.</span> <span id="s20">Came World War I my father served in the German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">JF: What kind of experience did he have?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">DS: He--I still have his war record.</span> <span id="s23">He first served on the Russian front at Tannenberg, he was decorated with the Austro-Hungarian service medal and then, after the Russian front, he served on the western front, the Somme and the Marne.</span> <span id="s24">He was at the tank battle at Cambrai, he was decorated with the Iron Cross, 2nd class.</span> <span id="s25">He received a gas poisoning and spent some time in the hospital, and fought until 1918, until the armistice.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">JF: Did he ever tell you anything about his treatment while in the army as a Jew?</span> <span id="s27">Did that make any difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">DS: Well no, apparently not.</span> <span id="s29">Not in those days.</span> <span id="s30">He was, well--equivalent of a--when he came out he was equivalent of a sergeant, lst class--something like that.</span> <span id="s31">He started as a private and came out a sergeant lst class--not that I can recall he ever mentioned that.</span> <span id="s32">Times didn't turn different from what I hear until the 30's.</span> <span id="s33">You know--1933--to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s34">You always had antisemitism, from what I understand, but you didn't have it in the upper middleclass.</span> <span id="s35">You see, there was no--not until the 1930's was there anything, to my knowledge, affected his business or his enterprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">JF: What kind of business was your father in?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">DS: He was in banking.</span> <span id="s38">He started out at the Corn Exchange--before World War I you didn't have a stock market.</span> <span id="s39">He started as a broker at the Corn Exchange and then went into the banking business with someone else.</span> <span id="s40">A private bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">JF: A private bank?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">DS: Yes, a private bank and he also had some kind of manufacturing.</span> <span id="s43">Anyway, much of this disappeared by 1934--he had to--the pharmaceutical business went, and then came the inflation, and I think banking stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">JF: Was his banking business involved with both Christians and Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">DS: Oh.</span> <span id="s46">yes.</span> <span id="s47">Natürlich [of course].</span> <span id="s48">The Jews in Berlin, were, again to my knowledge, in major cities, like Berlin--Berlin was very cosmopolitan.</span> <span id="s49">Ever since the emancipation of the Jews in Germany, under Freiherr von Stein I don’t remember my history dates as well, in 1810 or 1820, something like that, or perhaps earlier Jews were very much accepted to a great extent, accepted as equals, active in commerce and industry and in all social activities.</span> <span id="s50">In fact, you had the great school of art in the 20's in Berlin, the theatre, artists, some of whom I've met personally after World War II, and I studied--and it was quite a--Berliners have always been cosmopolitan and liberal in that sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">JF: So from what your parents told you, they themselves did not experience the antisemitism that, maybe, some of the other classes did at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">DS: Possibly no, they did not experience it.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">JF: What was their religious affiliation and experience during the 20's?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">DS: Now, that I really--I don't know, I know that we were liberal, in a way.</span> <span id="s55">Liberal--well, I belong to a reformed synagogue, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">JF: Now, you're talking about?</span> <span id="s57">Then?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">DS: Then, as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">JF: The reformed synagogue as opposed to the liberal?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">DS: Yes, well you had either orthodox or reformed, okay.</span> <span id="s61">To my--a few years back a friend of mine invited me to come to a reform service.</span> <span id="s62">To my astonishment, I discovered that what we considered reform is conservative here.</span> <span id="s63">What is reform here is absolutely amazing to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">JF: So, your family was a member of a liberal congregation or reform congregation?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">DS: Yes, reform congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">JF: Were they involved with any kinds of Jewish organizations or groups?</span> <span id="s67">[unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s68">DS: Well, no, I don't believe so.</span> <span id="s69">I don't believe my father had any affiliations that I can recall.</span> <span id="s70">No.</span> <span id="s71">nothing that I can recall, anything definite.</span> <span id="s72">No major affiliation.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">JF: Tell me about the area where your family lived when you were young?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">DS: When I was young we lived, we always lived in West Berlin.</span> <span id="s75">My father was born in West Berlin.</span> <span id="s76">A little east of where I was born, because West Berlin then spread.</span> <span id="s77">And it was a section of apartment houses, mixed use, stores at the corner, apartment houses were 5 stories, typical Berlin middle-class neighborhood.</span> <span id="s78">Five-story buildings.</span> <span id="s79">Large apartments.</span> <span id="s80">You know, mixed, and small apartments in the back, the rich people lived in the front and the poorer people lived in the back.</span> <span id="s81">And some apartment houses had forecourts and the less money you had, the further back you lived, so you could tell by how far somebody lived back from the street, to judge his income.</span> <span id="s82">It was a class society, don't forget.</span> <span id="s83">The [unclear] took his cap off and said, "Good morning, Maam.”</span> <span id="s84">That was the kind of society it was.</span> <span id="s85">That's what I grew up in.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">JF: This was a mixed religious area?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">DS: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s88">No.</span> <span id="s89">no, there was no Jewish section that I ever knew of.</span> <span id="s90">It was mixed--it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s91">We had we had five-story story apartment houses on both sides of the street.</span> <span id="s92">We owned the apartment house, we lived on the third floor, and right across from us lived a retired general from Kaiser's army, and I remember New Year's Eve, it was a custom to go out on the balcony and toast with champagne to everybody and he would be on his side, and this was still in 1935 and he refused to fly a Nazi flag.</span> <span id="s93">He had the old imperial flag on his balcony and he would toast across the street.</span> <span id="s94">That was the kind of neighborhood we had.</span> <span id="s95">A friend of mine, a non-Jewish friend of mine, with whom I was very close--I had mixed friends, I had Jewish friends and non-Jewish friends in those days--was related to the Bishop of Canterbury in England.</span> <span id="s96">It was an old German family, in fact, I found out after the war that his older brother, whom I only knew briefly, who spent time in England, had taken part on the attempt on the 20th of July to assassinate Hitler.</span> <span id="s97">[unclear] So, that's the kind of neighborhood it was.</span> <span id="s98">It was a good neighborhood, you had all different kinds of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">JF: What are some of your earliest memories of the 30's?</span> <span id="s100">You were a young child when Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">DS: Yes, I remember.</span> <span id="s102">I have some early--The corner bar was used as an election, as a polling places I do recall the SA standing in front of it, that is my earliest recollection, one on each side.</span> <span id="s103">The election was some encouragement to vote for Adolph Hitler, and they guarded the polling place.</span> <span id="s104">That was the earliest recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">JF: Were they intimidating?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">DS: Yes, intimidating--in full uniform, with a leather belt, brown shirt and a swastika...</span></p> <p><span id="s107">JF: Do you recall your parents talking about the election, or what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">DS: Not at that time.</span> <span id="s109">No.</span> <span id="s110">I still have the image and I think that seems strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">JF: You mentioned before that your father's, one of your father's businesses went by 1934.</span> <span id="s112">Now, how did that happen, do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">DS: It was a pharmaceutical company.</span> <span id="s114">Well, several things went in 1934.</span> <span id="s115">I think it was 1934.</span> <span id="s116">Jews were forbidden to have mortgages.</span> <span id="s117">We had two properties, two large properties in Berlin--it's quite interesting because just a couple of months ago the court in Berlin notified me now after 35 years they wanted information on this one property that was confiscated in 1942 and, apparently, now, after 35 years, they are going to make restoration.</span> <span id="s118">The interesting thing though is that the Nazi who confiscated it, who was instrumental in confiscating it, who has been dead since the war--the Russians got him and he never came back and his wife died since--but the son of this couple is contesting the property claim, so that will still have to be decided in court.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">JF: Had you appealed for this property to be...?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">DS: Yes, but this goes back 20 years ago--my parents put the request for the restoration of the property.</span> <span id="s121">This was a property in Alexander Square that consisted of a hotel and restaurant.</span> <span id="s122">We owned the building.</span> <span id="s123">It goes back to my grandparent's owning the building.</span> <span id="s124">It's like at the time before World War II--that area was compared to Wall Street in New York--you know, high commercial street, a busy commercial area and it--the interesting thing is that it got hit during the revolution in Berlin.</span> <span id="s125">It was apparent after World War II, when I still saw the property--everything around there was bomb-damaged--it was one of the only properties that stood in Alexander Square--you could see a large hole where it was hit in 1918 by an artillery shell during the revolution in Berlin.</span> <span id="s126">And it became apparent that after all of the other buildings were down, I'd known about it.</span> <span id="s127">Yes, that stayed there and it was briefly restored to my father and then the city split between the Russian sector and the western sector in 1946 or ‘47--I am not sure--and then the Russians took over the property because, now, my father was not anymore a victim of fascism, he was now a western capitalist, since he lived on the west side of Berlin, and they operated the building for some time.</span> <span id="s128">What happened to it I don't know if it is still stands there, or it has now become part of the Alexander, big Square, or the highway goes through it, or what, I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">JF: It's in West Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">DS: No.</span> <span id="s131">this property that I told you about is in East Berlin.</span> <span id="s132">Alexander Square is in East Berlin.</span> <span id="s133">That was the commercial hub of the city prior after the splitting of Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">JF: But now...?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">DS: The property that we lost in 1934 was the apartment house that we lived in, on which my father had a mortgage.</span> <span id="s136">Since a mortgage could not be renewed, it was canceled.</span> <span id="s137">The property was auctioned off, but it was auctioned off conveniently to certain Nazi sympathizers and already party member, so he got the property and we got an amount of money below the true value of the property.</span> <span id="s138">How much I don't know.</span> <span id="s139">We still have records--the interesting part is we never were arrested to before that because that fellow sold the property to another company between 1934 and 1945 and that company sold it to another company.</span> <span id="s140">It went through 3 or 4 hands after World War II and when the question of restitution came up the Germans simply said that a law had to be passed because there was just nothing on the books so they could restitute because it had gone through too many other hands.</span> <span id="s141">All these people knew from the books that it was originally Jewish property.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">JF: So you may yet receive restitution for the hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">DS: Yes, that was a more direct confiscation.</span> <span id="s144">It happened in 1942 when the fellow who had rented the bar took over the hotel--he operated both and then he decided that it was time for him--he was a party member, up to then, very decent but by 1942 he decided that he would want the property and was tired of paying rent so they confiscated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">JF: What happened in 1934 in the apartment house?</span> <span id="s146">You had to move?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">DS: No, we lived there and continued to pay rent until, let's see, I think it was 1939.</span> <span id="s148">We lived there still after the Crystal Night and...</span></p> <p><span id="s149">JF: When you say that you had to pay rent, were you paying what you normally would have paid for your mortgage, or was there a change in that kind of situation?</span> <span id="s150">Did your parents ever tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">DS: No, they never told me but I would assume that they then paid rent to the new owner.</span> <span id="s152">The apartment was maintained.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">JF: And your belongings and everything remained intact?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">DS: At that time, yes.</span> <span id="s155">Until 1939, end of '39, I'm not certain about the exact date.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">JF: Were there any other changes that occurred in ‘34 or ‘35 when the Nuremberg Laws came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">DS: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s158">JF: That you can recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">DS: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s160">JF: And, how they affected you?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">DS: Well, suddenly, kids started calling you “Jew.”</span> <span id="s162">We spent very much time inside, with selected friends in ‘34 and ‘35 when it really started.</span> <span id="s163">And--you--well, we played with other Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s164">Preferably, we were not seen on the street.</span> <span id="s165">Okay?</span> <span id="s166">Got beaten up.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">JF: Did your parents also lose Christian friends that they had had, that you were aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">DS: No.</span> <span id="s169">not--Well, that's a good question.</span> <span id="s170">I don't really know.</span> <span id="s171">I don't really know.</span> <span id="s172">We were in a special situation.</span> <span id="s173">That is the interesting part.</span> <span id="s174">My mother was Protestant.</span> <span id="s175">Okay?</span> <span id="s176">So we were a mixed marriage.</span> <span id="s177">My father was Jewish and I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s178">So, the interesting part is we lost not only friends, but we lost family on my mother's side, with the exception of one aunt, who suddenly didn't know us anymore.</span> <span id="s179">Okay?</span> <span id="s180">Until after World War II when they suddenly appeared on the scene again.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">JF: They just stopped speaking to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">DS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">JF: Do you remember your mother talking about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">DS: Yes.</span> <span id="s185">Except one aunt that lived with us.</span> <span id="s186">Now these people lived outside of Berlin--my mother's from Braunschweig.</span> <span id="s187">Yes, they stopped contact.</span> <span id="s188">Until 1936, 1937, we used to visit once a year.</span> <span id="s189">We used to stay a week or so.</span> <span id="s190">Then they stopped writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">JF: Did it surprise your mother when this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">DS: Yes.</span> <span id="s193">I think it grieved her to no end when her own family would--this was after her mother died.</span> <span id="s194">Her mother was 80 when she died.</span> <span id="s195">They didn't want contact.</span> <span id="s196">They were afraid for themselves.</span> <span id="s197">I think that's what it was, because fear had set in by that time.</span> <span id="s198">Neighbor looked at neighbor and--but the machine kept going--started looking over their shoulder--It was in back of you.</span> <span id="s199">I remember that.</span> <span id="s200">As odd as it may seem, now my parents weren't very scientific, but if they had friends over during those years and if they sat talking in the living room like we are, they would take a big pillow and put it over the telephone.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">JF: You remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">DS: Yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s203">Always a big pillow over the telephone, because apparently somebody had told them that the Nazis already were able to listen in over the telephone, even though it was hung up.</span> <span id="s204">Of course, it is impossible, but people didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">JF: There was so much fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">DS: That is just an indication of the fear that already existed at that time.</span> <span id="s207">I remember the big pillow...</span></p> <p><span id="s208">JF: You were being educated during part of the 30's?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">DS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">JF: What kind of school were you going to?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">DS: Well, I went to a public elementary school at first.</span> <span id="s212">There were in 1934 and 1935 some teachers already antisemitic and had signs in the classroom.</span> <span id="s213">There was a particular teacher that I am thinking of--and he found out that I was Jewish, and the kids always said, "Hey, he's a Jew."</span> <span id="s214">He had a sign saying, "He's a Jew," you know.</span> <span id="s215">He came over and explained to me that that sign didn't pertain to me.</span> <span id="s216">I do recall that.</span> <span id="s217">It said something about Judenrasse some kind of anti-Jewish slogan.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">JF: And he said that you were exempt from this?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">DS: Yes, I was exempt from this.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">JF: Did you receive a lot of harassment from the other kids in the classroom by that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">DS: Well, it was more--less harassment, as I recall, and more separation.</span> <span id="s222">They went their way and I went my way.</span> <span id="s223">There was no intercourse so to speak.</span> <span id="s224">And you stayed with your Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s225">I had a little friend who lived across the street; we went to school together.</span> <span id="s226">You covered your back.</span> <span id="s227">You watched out for flying stones or some missile.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">JF: You started school in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">DS: I was 5 years old, so it would have been about ‘33.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">JF: And how long were you permitted to stay in the public school system?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">DS: I finished--you start with eighth grade over there--seven, six, five--four years.</span> <span id="s232">That was in ‘37.</span> <span id="s233">At that time you made a choice.</span> <span id="s234">And it was just at that time.</span> <span id="s235">If you wanted to follow an academic schooling, you chose a high school; or, if you were going to--this was the European educational system--if you wanted to go into a vocational area then you continued your elementary span and then went to a vocational or middle school of sorts.</span> <span id="s236">I decided to go on to high school but this was just the time when Jews were not permitted to enter normal high school, so I went to a Jewish high school that was the Holbein School named after a philosopher, Holbein, and it was a Jewish high school and at the time there were two Jewish high schools in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">JF: This was what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">DS: I think it was ‘37.</span> <span id="s239">Yes, in ‘37 because at Crystal Night I still went there, in ‘38.</span> <span id="s240">In ‘39 or ‘38--I know it was after Crystal Night, the two schools were combined, so there was only one school and then that one school--they took both school buildings and they put us in makeshift quarters in the synagogue in West Berlin...</span></p> <p><span id="s241">JF: Before that time you had a regular school building of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">DS: Yes, a regular school building.</span> <span id="s243">Yes.</span> <span id="s244">There were two regular high schools, two Jewish high schools, and they were regular school buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Tape 1, Side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s246">JF: You were telling me about the high school that you went to.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">DS: Yes, I think the education was good for one reason as I recall and that was that somehow we had to prove that we were just as good if not better than everybody else.</span> <span id="s248">There was an intensive training.</span> <span id="s249">And then you couldn't do anything else anyway by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">JF: Now, you were telling me before that you felt that you had to stay off the streets.</span> <span id="s251">Were there activities at the school that kept the students occupied after school hours?</span> <span id="s252">Were there programs that were developed so that there were alternative places for you to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">DS: Yes, there were some.</span> <span id="s254">They also had rooms where they could play ping-pong, as I recall and there was some attempt made to have some kind of Jewish life at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">JF: Were you allowed in any of the public playgrounds or parks, as you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">DS: No.</span> <span id="s257">I think that in--let's see, I believe that after Crystal Night they became off limits.</span> <span id="s258">It was after 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">JF: Until that time you did use them?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">DS: Yes, yes, we did use them.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">JF: And could you do so freely or were you bothered by other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">DS: If you were in an area where they didn't know, unless they recognized that you were Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s263">JF: Then they wouldn't bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">DS: Then they would.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">JF: Then they would, otherwise they would not bother you.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">DS: Otherwise they wouldn't.</span> <span id="s267">You have to also realize that Berlin was a very comfortable city just like Washington in some ways.</span> <span id="s268">The streets don't run like in New York and Philadelphia for miles in one direction, without interruptions.</span> <span id="s269">Usually the city plan is that the streets would run from a square to a square.</span> <span id="s270">A landscaped square is at either end of the street, so to speak, and in between streets, maybe a boulevard.</span> <span id="s271">So you didn't have that kind of activity that we have here about playgrounds.</span> <span id="s272">Maybe they had that in the suburbs or smaller towns but in Berlin we played in the squares.</span> <span id="s273">And some squares had facilities for the kids, others didn't.</span> <span id="s274">There never seemed to be a need for organized play, as I remember, for cosmopolitan, for big city kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">JF: How did that time feel to you as a child?</span> <span id="s276">Were you afraid of what might happen?</span> <span id="s277">Did you think that things would get worse than they were at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">DS: I would say not until--no, I don't think I comprehended that as much until 1938.</span> <span id="s279">That's when it came home.</span> <span id="s280">After the Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s281">I mentioned before that I had a friend who lived across the street.</span> <span id="s282">His father had a book store--not a book store, an office supplies store, paper folders, and things like that, at the corner.</span> <span id="s283">I think it was it started in 1936 or 1937 [unclear] when they had to put their names, you know, the name-calling started then.</span> <span id="s284">I have to say yes, even earlier, I began to realize that things were bad, because my father's cousin, who was a Superior Court judge at the criminal court in Berlin--he and his two sons went to the concentration camp in 1935, ostensibly put there by two criminals he convicted before 1933, who came out and then became Nazis and took revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">JF: Did they stay in the camps or were they released?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">DS: They were released a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">JF: And you talked to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">DS: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s289">I talked to them.</span> <span id="s290">In fact, I talked to them after the war.</span> <span id="s291">That's a story in itself.</span> <span id="s292">He came back in [unclear] and the sons came back in ‘36.</span> <span id="s293">They left Germany in ‘37 or ‘38 for England with the idea of bringing my aunt and his mother over to England and her mother--no, his mother--I am sorry, my aunt to England.</span> <span id="s294">He was there with his sons already.</span> <span id="s295">Since he was a lawyer by profession--and on the continent you practiced Roman law, not English law, you know, he couldn't work in his profession and he worked in a factory and became the department head in some factory at the time.</span> <span id="s296">In 1939, by 1939, his wife had sent all of their belongings to Rotterdam for transport over to England, the war broke out, Rotterdam got bombed, they lost everything, which wasn't too tragic in a way, but the tragic part was that his mother and his wife never got out of Germany.</span> <span id="s297">They were placed in a concentration camp and never returned.</span> <span id="s298">His sons both joined the British army and were in--one of them was in intelligence, and came into, you know, ahead of British troops.</span> <span id="s299">They went into the Ruhr area in 1945 and they were ahead of the troops to collect papers, information and things like that for the British.</span> <span id="s300">After 1945--as the German Government was formed he was offered the high post in the West German government which he declined.</span> <span id="s301">He said that he wouldn't want to go back without his family.</span> <span id="s302">He wasn't about to go back.</span> <span id="s303">He stayed in England and retired there.</span> <span id="s304">His sons both went to Oxford.</span> <span id="s305">One teaches at--it's the university with the name of that famous English outlaw who stole from the rich and...</span></p> <p><span id="s306">JF: Robin Hood?</span></p> <p><span

taught at Princeton, as a guest lecturer, by the way...</span></p> <p><span id="s311">JF: When...</span></p> <p><span id="s312">DS: So that was ‘35.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">JF: When this man came out of the camp, I assume he described the conditions...</span></p> <p><span id="s314">DS: Well, for the first time I saw a man with his head shaved.</span> <span id="s315">I remember that.</span> <span id="s316">I don't think he talked to me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">JF: He did talk to your family.</span> <span id="s318">Did your father at that time talk about leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">DS: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s320">Well, shortly thereafter, yes.</span> <span id="s321">He began to think about it.</span> <span id="s322">He wanted to emigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s323">You know, there was a time my cousin wanted to go to South America--he couldn't get into--I’m not sure if it was Argentina or Brazil, but one of the countries, if you had machinery, you were supposed to--that was part of your requirement for entering a country and I remember his apartment in Berlin was filled with all kinds of grinders, you know machines that he had spent his money on.</span> <span id="s324">He never got out.</span> <span id="s325">Yes, there was talk.</span> <span id="s326">My father did get a number from the American consulate which was about this long, but it never came to anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">JF: In what year did he apply?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">DS: It must have been after ‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">JF: After ‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">DS: Yes, ‘37 or ‘38, somewhere around that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">JF: Do you think your parents were aware of how bad things were getting?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">DS: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">JF: How early do you think they felt that?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">DS: Well, I think before ‘35 they said that--you know, I used to blame the older generation--I’ve always blamed them for that.</span> <span id="s335">You see, they were Germans, don't forget.</span> <span id="s336">They weren't Jews.</span> <span id="s337">Judaism was a religion, just like here.</span> <span id="s338">You're an American, you're not a Jew.</span> <span id="s339">Okay?</span> <span id="s340">I mean they always had been Germans, and their father had been German.</span> <span id="s341">Didn't he serve in World War I, didn't he fight for the Fatherland?</span> <span id="s342">Didn't his grandfather fight for the Fatherland?</span> <span id="s343">So who's this corporal, trying to tell--it will go away, that was the attitude, it will go away, but by ‘35 we began to wonder what would happen.</span> <span id="s344">We began to worry--in ‘36 and ‘37 and in ‘38 came the Crystal Night and my father's friend, who had lost an arm and a leg in World War I, had that store and was brutally beaten, pulled out on the street and was beaten, and there was a shattering of glass.</span> <span id="s345">I will never forget that.</span> <span id="s346">I crawled under the couch during that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">JF: You were home?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">DS: Yes.</span> <span id="s349">We lived on the third floor, but you heard the glass shattering, you heard the screaming, the hollering, the banging on doors...</span></p> <p><span id="s350">JF: Did they bang on your door?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">DS: No, I think they didn't want to climb that high.</span> <span id="s352">Three floors up.</span> <span id="s353">It was safe.</span> <span id="s354">It was mostly the first floor and the stores.</span> <span id="s355">Like my friend's father's store--you know, by that time the names Israel and Sarah were being applied to Jews and he had to paint it in big letters, this high on the store window, his name and it was Israel [unclear] and you knew it was a Jewish store, because the idea being that people shouldn't buy there.</span> <span id="s356">Yes, that was Crystal Night.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">JF: So.</span> <span id="s358">was your family also home at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">DS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">JF: Was any damage done to your father's property outside the apartment house?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">DS: By that time we had the property in East Berlin in Alexander Square--No, because, you see, we owned the building, which no one was aware of on the street, and but the hotel and restaurant was owned by--what happened to be a Nazi member.</span> <span id="s362">This was the incongruity of it.</span> <span id="s363">He didn't have to have a name.</span> <span id="s364">The building was just a building.</span> <span id="s365">It wasn't apparent so there was no damage to the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">JF: What else about that time do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">DS: Well, I remember the Nazi marches through the street and I remember General Bromberg, was it, who courted the girl around the corner.</span> <span id="s368">[unclear] Bromberg?</span> <span id="s369">Blumberg I forget, Hitler cashed him in because he was too little--cashed in [cashiered] him in--What else do I remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">JF: You said that you were still in school up until Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s371">[Kristallnacht].</span></p> <p><span id="s372">DS: And after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">JF: And after that as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">DS: Yes the Jewish school was, well--deportation started, I believe, in 1940, the first things came--we had at that time--the school must have had about 300 Jewish children...</span></p> <p><span id="s375">JF: In 19--?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">DS: In 1940, when deportations started.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">JF: This is when the schools had been combined?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">DS: Yes, they were combined I think in ‘39.</span> <span id="s379">In 1940 the first deportation started It was very slow, people had lots of time.</span> <span id="s380">They could pack all of their belongings, and all this make-believe, and they shipped them out with big crates.</span> <span id="s381">There were all kinds of--at that time, it wasn't looked at as too serious.</span> <span id="s382">Not then.</span> <span id="s383">And, then, kids would disappear from school.</span> <span id="s384">First we would know that they had to leave--it was like moving somewhere, like they moved to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s385">In fact I got post cards from school friends of mine in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s386">Of course, they couldn't say much, that they were fine blah, blah, blah...</span></p> <p><span id="s387">JF: Did you have any idea where the people were being taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">DS: Yes.</span> <span id="s389">Warsaw, we knew that they were going to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s390">It wasn't camps--then that didn't--if any German tells you he didn't know anything about the camps they're full of--excuse the expression...</span></p> <p><span id="s391">JF: They weren't taken to camps until later than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">DS: Well, they were taken to ghettos.</span> <span id="s393">You know, Warsaw was a ghetto where they were concentrated that way.</span> <span id="s394">Put it that way.</span> <span id="s395">I'm not sure, but I know that--what happened 1940: the war was going on against England, in 1939 they had marched into Poland and the war was on against--and England joined it, England and France joined it, and I do recall my father saying--that was ‘39, he said "Now they've lost the war."</span> <span id="s396">Then with France getting in on it, see because they had gone into Austria into Sudetenland and then they had gone into Poland, and then England and France had declared war, and my father said , “That’s it...”</span></p> <p><span id="s397">JF: And he thought it might be over soon, at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">DS: He--No, he didn't think it would be over soon--no, the realization, the hope started after Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s399">We knew that was the turning point, everybody knew that was the turning point!</span> <span id="s400">That’s when the hope started.</span> <span id="s401">That's when I put maps up and the little flags and I started measuring distances.</span> <span id="s402">Because, you know, suddenly your lifeline depended on little flags and the distance between them.</span> <span id="s403">That was--you had to hold on until that time.</span> <span id="s404">So kids disappeared in 1940.</span> <span id="s405">Rather rapidly they were being picked up.</span> <span id="s406">And then, I think, the schools were closed in 1941.</span> <span id="s407">Either the end of ‘40 or the beginning of ‘41, I am not sure.</span> <span id="s408">I think it was the end of ‘40 they just closed the schools down where they remained.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">JF: Was it difficult for you at that time to get supplies or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">DS: Yes, ration cards had started in--I believe it was ‘39, and Jews were not permitted to have meat or milk, eggs, less bread, less vegetables, no fish, no sugar--you just didn't get rations from that.</span> <span id="s411">So we really lived on my mother's rations.</span> <span id="s412">She got full rations.</span> <span id="s413">Thanks to her, it helped it.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">JF: Do you think there were any other ways it helped your family because your mother was not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">DS: Well, it helped later on in several ways.</span> <span id="s416">Number one, we were caught in the Rosenstrasse Aktion.</span> <span id="s417">I don't know if you are familiar with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">JF: Can you describe it to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">DS: I think that was in 1941.</span> <span id="s420">My father was taken on the street and they came home for me, and we ended up at the Rosenstrasse.</span> <span id="s421">You know, there was a whole group of people--they separated those that had Aryan wives, Aryan husbands--one way and the others--a big piece of cardboard around their necks--they were shipped out that way and we sat on the fourth floor of the building--and it was also the first bombing of Berlin at the same time--we were up on the fourth floor with the whole thing going on.</span> <span id="s422">I do recall that.</span> <span id="s423">It scared me, you know.</span> <span id="s424">Scared like anything.</span> <span id="s425">All kinds of people just sitting on the floor, like a big empty--no furniture at all, people just laid on top of each other up there.</span> <span id="s426">And then the demonstration.</span> <span id="s427">I think it was the only demonstration against Hitler during that era.</span> <span id="s428">The women and the men of those people inside were demonstrating outside, screaming that "We want our husbands back."</span> <span id="s429">You know Berliners, once they get to riot, they get to riot and the police trying to hold them back, and nobody knew what happened.</span> <span id="s430">Due to connections, many of these people in Berlin were related in some fashion to important people.</span> <span id="s431">I think that's what saved us.</span> <span id="s432">We were released after a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">JF: You mean the people who were protesting were related in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">DS: Yes, for instance, I had a friend, his mother was related to Udet [phonetic], General Udet.</span> <span id="s435">He was a World War I hero, and a general, a German general, a German Air Force general, a very important man at the time.</span> <span id="s436">Hitler had him killed in ‘43, I think, but then he was a very important man.</span> <span id="s437">So there was a lot of, you know, there were connections.</span> <span id="s438">People had connections, it was a big city.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">JF: How did it feel being in that area, an enclosed area in the fourth floor of that building and hearing the yelling and the screaming and the protest?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">DS: Scared, real scared.</span> <span id="s441">Just plain, plain scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">JF: Did you think it would do any good?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">DS: I didn't think.</span> <span id="s444">I didn't know what to think.</span> <span id="s445">I didn't know what was happening to me at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">JF: Did you think your mother was out there?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">DS: Yes.</span> <span id="s448">Yes.</span> <span id="s449">She was out there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">JF: You knew she was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">DS: Everybody ran--everybody piled against the windows.</span> <span id="s452">In 1941 I was 12 years old so I couldn't see over everybody, everybody was looking for everybody.</span> <span id="s453">My mother was outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">JF: And they kept you there for a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">DS: They kept us there for a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">JF: With what kind of conditions until it was resolved?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">DS: We were taken down to the yard and walked in a circle for maybe half an hour.</span> <span id="s458">And went upstairs again and sat around.</span> <span id="s459">And some food was issued.</span> <span id="s460">Soup.</span> <span id="s461">Minimal.</span> <span id="s462">And I remember the fellow--in fact, I still have that piece of paper, ostensibly yellow, the release sheet, the yellow star, der Jude, the Jew, released.</span> <span id="s463">I remember that he addressed us before we were released, and he cut a very dashing figure in his black SS uniform, and he was icily polite saying, "Gentlemen, I'm sorry I can't send you to the concentration camp."</span> <span id="s464">I will never forget that.</span> <span id="s465">"I can't send you to the concentration camp."</span> <span id="s466">We were released with the requirement to report to the local police station for what reason, I don't know--the local police didn't know...</span></p> <p><span id="s467">JF: You were to report then to the local police?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">DS: You know, on the way out, after that.</span> <span id="s469">And then we were notified to--let me put it this way--before Rosenstrasse, something else happened.</span> <span id="s470">After the schools were shut down and by the way, out of the 300 kids--and you get to know each other--it was very cramped--you get to know most kids--only 3 people left.</span> <span id="s471">One is now in Israel, he went to Israel after the war, one is in this country, and myself.</span> <span id="s472">Only 3 out of 300 that I know of came out of it.</span> <span id="s473">One came back from the camps, the fellow in Israel, the fellow here--I ran into him right after the war in 1945.</span> <span id="s474">He had lived underground for two and a half years and then they caught his mother and she was sent to Theresienstadt and she spent something like 6 months in a cellar until the Russians came and liberated the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">JF: This is out of your class in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">DS: Yes, my boyfriends.</span> <span id="s477">There were friends that I went to school with.</span> <span id="s478">He now lives in Washington, DC--Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">JF: What happened to you after the Rosenstrasse incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">DS: Let's see.</span> <span id="s481">Before the war, after the schools were closed, I worked in the--as a helper so that I would have something to do.</span> <span id="s482">In the Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland, which was the central organization of the Jews in Germany.</span> <span id="s483">And I was an office helper.</span> <span id="s484">It gave me something to do.</span> <span id="s485">And until the day they picked the people up, when the SS came and the Gestapo came, that was before the Rosenstrasse--I believe, yes, it was before the Rosenstrasse--and the trucks were down there and they lined everybody up, and they pushed me forward.</span> <span id="s486">Somebody who knew me said, "His mother's Protestant," and they said, "Okay, you can leave."</span> <span id="s487">I went past the guards, I went home, half in shock, because they had already loaded [?]</span> <span id="s488">the people down into the trucks, you know, furniture vans, closed the doors and off they went.</span> <span id="s489">That was the last I saw of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">JF: Furniture vans?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">DS: Yes, big furniture vans.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">JF: And that was about when?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">DS: 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">JF: 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">DS: Yes, I must have worked there maybe nine or ten months, after the schools closed.</span> <span id="s496">I wanted...</span></p> <p><span id="s497">JF: And you have no idea what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">DS: To them?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">DS: Well, they didn't come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">JF: They didn't come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">DS: I never saw anyone again who was there.</span> <span id="s503">We have the list up to ‘45, a long list of names, there was an aid--an office had opened, the people could find out if their friends had come back.</span> <span id="s504">Nobody came back.</span> <span id="s505">Then the Rosenstrasse and then my cousin--Oh, then came, wait a minute, Rosenstrasse was after the schools were closed in ‘39, before starts--we had to move out of our apartment, we had a large apartment, like a New York apartment, and they gave us one week to move into one room.</span> <span id="s506">Okay?</span> <span id="s507">We moved into one room and another apartment, a smaller apartment, shared it with two other families.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">JF: In your building?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">DS: No, no, a little further west, in the Pragerstrasse and we shared that with two other couples.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">JF: Your parents and yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">DS: Yes, we had one room, one couple had another room, and a kind of a large dining room.</span> <span id="s512">It had--originally it had a large dining room, a large living room, a bedroom and a smaller room, and then a little room next to the kitchen, and then the kitchen.</span> <span id="s513">So, one couple had the small room, we had one of the larger rooms because we were three, they were two, and then there was another couple that originally had the apartment and they maintained their bedroom and we shared the dining room as a common eating place, and, of course, we shared the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">JF: This was 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">DS: Yes, 1940.</span> <span id="s516">In one week, get rid of everything.</span> <span id="s517">You know, how much--a room not bigger than this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">JF: So at that point you had to liquidate a lot of your possessions?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">DS: Yes, well, liquidate, and then store with friends some of the things.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">JF: The friends that you stored these things with were non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">DS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">JF: And they were willing...?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">DS: Yes, my aunt, predominantly my aunt, my mother's sister, in Berlin, who lived in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">JF: And the photographs and the paintings that you showed me of your home, of your family, were stored with this aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">DS: Well, some of the papers my father kept on him.</span> <span id="s526">Mostly the bigger things were stored with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">JF: What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">DS: That's funny.</span> <span id="s529">Then life in one room started.</span> <span id="s530">It was remarkable, you had a bed, and you had to put a curtain across.</span> <span id="s531">You had your own room within a room.</span> <span id="s532">What happened after that?</span> <span id="s533">Yes that was after Crystal Night...</span></p> <p><span id="s534">JF: After Crystal Night this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">DS: Yes, it happened after that.</span> <span id="s536">After the Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s537">And then, as I said, the schools closed, I worked at the central Jewish organization until the Gestapo cleared out the officers.</span> <span id="s538">They just grabbed everybody and put them on vans.</span> <span id="s539">By that time they weren’t polite anymore.</span> <span id="s540">There was no week packing and they just grabbed you.</span> <span id="s541">If they got you on the street, they just grabbed you, and I think there was a time that you had to wear the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s542">It started at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">JF: Now, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Tape 2, Side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s545">JF: You were just saying that the central office that closed, where these people were taken off in furniture vans, of the Reichsvertretung, and the end of the operations...</span></p> <p><span id="s546">DS: That was the end of the central organization of Jews in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">JF: And you, at that point, were not occupied in anyway?</span> <span id="s548">There was not a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">DS: No.</span> <span id="s550">no.</span> <span id="s551">I just went home and I think that the Rosenstrasse Action happened soon after.</span> <span id="s552">It must have been the same year.</span> <span id="s553">And after the Rosenstrasse Action, both my father and I were assigned to a labor gang.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">JF: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">DS: That was in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">JF: In Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">DS: In Berlin, and I was by that time let’s see, it was ‘41, no, it was ‘42 [Actually, 1943].</span> <span id="s558">I was bar mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">JF: You were bar mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">DS: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s561">I was bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s562">I must have been 13 when I became bar mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">JF: This was in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">DS: ‘41, so we didn't have to move until ‘41 and the schools closed at the same time and ‘42, I think, was when the Reichsvereinigung closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">JF: That was 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">DS: 1942.</span> <span id="s567">You see, it gets a little hazy for me.</span> <span id="s568">It was spring of 1942, I am sure [Actually, 1943].</span></p> <p><span id="s569">JF: Let me back up a minute to your bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s570">What condition was the synagogue operation, at that point?</span> <span id="s571">How was your training?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">DS: Well, I was good friends with the rabbi's son.</span> <span id="s573">So his father trained me.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">JF: Privately?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">DS: Yes, it was outside the synagogue.</span> <span id="s576">The big synagogues had been burned, the major synagogues.</span> <span id="s577">This was where the school was or had been operating, in the same building.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">JF: This was another synagogue where the school...?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">DS: There was a synagogue.</span> <span id="s580">You know, the last place that the school operated until the Nazis closed it down.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">JF: It had been a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">DS: Yes, it had been a synagogue but it was in the back of the building, so it had escaped damage because--it wasn't apparent from the street--that was probably the only reason that it did escape damage.</span> <span id="s583">It was a small synagogue--that's in the Joachim Stelerstrasse.</span> <span id="s584">That's where I was bar mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">JF: Can you recall what that was like, given the atmosphere of the times.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">DS: I was scared, I think I was just as scared of going up there and saying [unclear]--reading the part from the Torah as I was of everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">JF: What kind of feelings did you have being bar mitzvah at a time when Jews were being seen in such a way?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">DS: I don't know--I was mad I think.</span> <span id="s589">I was scared and I was mad and I used to blame the older generation all through that period, until even after the war.</span> <span id="s590">I used to tell my father, "It's your fault.</span> <span id="s591">You let it happen."</span></p> <p><span id="s592">JF: What do you mean, "You let it happen."</span></p> <p><span id="s593">DS: His generation, not he personally.</span> <span id="s594">I said that you should have fought.</span> <span id="s595">In fact, we did fight.</span> <span id="s596">Not he, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">JF: You mean fight back within Germany as opposed to leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">DS: Yes, well, you fight back in Germany or leave.</span> <span id="s599">One or the other.</span> <span id="s600">Don't take it.</span> <span id="s601">And I joined the resistance group in Berlin in 1943.</span> <span id="s602">A group of fellows that I worked with, one of the school friends that was still around, also from a mixed marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">JF: Can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">DS: Yeah, we met privately.</span> <span id="s605">We--One of them had contacts with some other group, and never disclosed who he was in contact with.</span> <span id="s606">Especially in the last years of the war, especially during the battle of Berlin, we--I think, did our share to fight back, as you might say.</span> <span id="s607">We cut telephone wires and interrupted communications, cut tires on army cars that were parked on side streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">JF: This was during that two-year period?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">DS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">JF: About how many people were in the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">DS: Six fellows.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">JF: Men, young men.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">DS: Yes, anywhere from 15, 14 to 18, I guess.</span> <span id="s614">That age.</span> <span id="s615">Most of them from mixed marriages.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">JP: Were any of you ever caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">DS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">JF: What was the feeling like among you?</span> <span id="s619">What was the spirit?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">DS: The spirit was excellent in a sense that we had very few weapons, I think out of the six we had two revolvers and I think about 20 rounds of ammunition, something like that.</span> <span id="s621">The idea was, that they are not going to get us.</span> <span id="s622">That was the attitude.</span> <span id="s623">Now maybe we weren't very effective, but in a way, we--I was in this gang working in the reclamation of steel helmets and repair and restoration of mess kits and other equipment for the German army.</span> <span id="s624">And--I was 15 and worked 60 hours a week, on those rations that I told you about and no pay.</span> <span id="s625">And the acid came in very handy because there were several things that you could do.</span> <span id="s626">You filled the mess kit with acid, and the acid used was so strong if you left a piece of aluminum in there overnight the next morning it wouldn't be there anymore, it would be completely dissolved.</span> <span id="s627">And the German foreman would get milk.</span> <span id="s628">We didn't get anything, working with those fumes, so we would fill a mess kit full of acid and put it in a sack of finished goods, and it was shipped out to the German army and you can imagine how much was left when it got there.</span> <span id="s629">Some of the, maybe, juvenile things that we thought up.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">JF: Was that sort of thing ever traced to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">DS: No, they could not trace it to us.</span> <span id="s632">It was never traced to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">JF: You had that kind of job primarily during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">DS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">JF: And what about your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">DS: My father worked in a carpentry repairing, bomb damage, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">JF: And your mother.</span> <span id="s638">Did she have to work also?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">DS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">JF: During those years was she still able to receive regular rations or whatever the...?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">DS: She would receive regular rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">JF: Whatever the population received?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">DS: Yes.</span> <span id="s644">She would go out with a minimum of exposure.</span> <span id="s645">Of course you had to wear the yellow star, I remember two things.</span> <span id="s646">He [my father] came home twice.</span> <span id="s647">Once when he wore the star and he came back and he said two workers accosted him, in a typical German dialect, "Man, what the hell are you wearing?</span> <span id="s648">What's that?</span> <span id="s649">You got to wear that?"</span> <span id="s650">and the other, "Oh, these bastards!"</span> <span id="s651">The Berliners were not necessarily Nazis per se.</span> <span id="s652">Again Berlin was a very cosmopolitan town.</span> <span id="s653">"Those Bastards."</span> <span id="s654">[unclear]--That was at first, which made him very happy.</span> <span id="s655">I had a similar happening to me.</span> <span id="s656">I walked down the street coming home and suddenly a man approached me with a bag in his hand and he said, "Come into the doorway," and before you know it he said, "Take this," and he threw the bag in my hand and took off.</span> <span id="s657">I looked and there were two loaves of bread in it, some butter and some food.</span> <span id="s658">Okay, it's like the--to me it has always been somehow reminiscent of God asking Lot [Abraham] if you find 10 just men I will not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah so there were some just people around.</span> <span id="s659">It has been my experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">JF: Are there any other vignettes that you can tell me like that?</span> <span id="s661">Other help that you received?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">DS: There were people helping.</span> <span id="s663">You know, always was looking over their shoulders, and there were people like they accosted my father, who came home with a star and they beat him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">JF: On the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">DS: Yes, beat him up on the street.</span> <span id="s666">Attacked him.</span> <span id="s667">"You god-damned Jew," just like that.</span> <span id="s668">He came home as white as a sheet.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">JF: On the job, in these labor units that you and your father were in, what was the treatment like?</span> <span id="s670">Who was in charge of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">DS: The German [unclear] were.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">JF: Civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">DS: Nazi members.</span> <span id="s674">You worked and you got rations and if you didn't produce then you go to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s675">You--kind of--you lived in the foyer to these camps, so to speak, either you do or you don't.</span> <span id="s676">They retaliated it in their own way.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">JF: During this time people that you knew were constantly being taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">DS: Hm, hmm.</span> <span id="s679">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">JF: What was your own idea about what was going to happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">DS: Well, we feared for the worst.</span> <span id="s682">In fact, the worst would have come in May of ‘45.</span> <span id="s683">The order had already been given in Berlin that mixed marriages which had been separated in the other towns, except, I understand, for Vienna, Berlin and Hamburg, that we would be separated and then shipped to the camps, and lucky for us, the Russians got in the way of the plans and then the Battle of Berlin started.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">JF: Can you describe that for me?</span> <span id="s685">Your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">DS: Yes, very vividly.</span> <span id="s687">By that time I was used to air attacks, okay?</span> <span id="s688">Night bombings in 1943, and it is kind of interesting to sit there and hope that your friends will miss you.</span> <span id="s689">[laughter] And it's also interesting to note that I had a cousin in the German air-force, and I had a cousin in the British intelligence.</span> <span id="s690">You know--this kind of family situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">JF: Were you in touch with these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">DS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">JF: Was there any way at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">DS: No, no.</span> <span id="s695">Not till after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">JF: And let me ask you one other question.</span> <span id="s697">Was there any way of finding out exactly what was happening in the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">DS: Well, the news came back in 19.</span> <span id="s699">.</span> <span id="s700">by the end of ‘43 we knew, by ‘43 we knew.</span> <span id="s701">Sometime around ‘43 the news came back.</span> <span id="s702">It was brought back.</span> <span id="s703">And the Germans knew because that cousin that I mentioned in the German Air Force came back from Russia in 1945 and then stopped by.</span> <span id="s704">He was in Berlin and actually came and visited us because it was safe again, after the war was over.</span> <span id="s705">He told us he was stationed in Latvia and that their airfield was near a gas works and it had been burned out and that the Latvian people brought the people and lined them up and shot them with machine guns.</span> <span id="s706">Their commander said, "We are the Air Force and we don't have anything to do with it so don't look."</span> <span id="s707">So people knew, I don't care what anybody says.</span> <span id="s708">If somebody says that they didn't know, I don't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">JF: This was common knowledge in Berlin by ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">DS: I would say so.</span> <span id="s711">Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s712">I'm sure.</span> <span id="s713">The soldiers brought it back.</span> <span id="s714">We knew about it.</span> <span id="s715">My cousin Albert--he and his friend tried to escape.</span> <span id="s716">It must have been ‘42 then.</span> <span id="s717">In ‘42 they tried to escape to Sweden and they got as far as Denmark.</span> <span id="s718">His friend got onto the Swedish ship.</span> <span id="s719">He was caught with false papers and we heard from him because a cousin of my father's worked at that collection point, and he said he had seen Albert and he had talked to him and he was going East.</span> <span id="s720">That is the last we saw of him.</span> <span id="s721">We have the records.</span> <span id="s722">All my cousins, all the cousins of mine died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s723">According to the German records that they died due to a type of pneumonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">JF: You have the records?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">DS: Yes, my father got the official notification.</span> <span id="s726">We have the records, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">JF: How did you receive them?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">DS: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">JF: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">DS: Yes, after the war.</span> <span id="s731">I must have them somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">JF: Was there any way of communicating with any of the family that was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">DS: We communicated to Warsaw back and forth because we did get postcards from there and we could write back.</span> <span id="s734">Up until a time.</span> <span id="s735">When, I don't recall.</span> <span id="s736">But up to a time.</span> <span id="s737">That's the only thing that I recall.</span> <span id="s738">And I think to Theresienstadt, too.</span> <span id="s739">My father's cousin was taken to Theresienstadt and he died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">JF: And you could receive some news?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">DS: Yes, we did receive a postcard, again, saying nothing but that stopped after awhile, then there was nothing further.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">JF: We were talking about the Battle of Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">DS: Well, I was mentioning that when a plane went overhead you could tell the--when the bomb, you know, you were used to that.</span> <span id="s744">You figured that if he was overhead he wouldn't hit you.</span> <span id="s745">You learn all that as a kid, at that time, but I think it was one bright Sunday morning--oh, it was a Saturday afternoon, there was an announcement made that the anti-aircraft towers in Berlin would have a practice firing, and it was supposed to last for one hour or something like that, and they started to fire all right but they never stopped.</span> <span id="s746">In facts somebody came from the center of the city and said that the Russians were shooting into the town and it was the very next Sunday morning when a stray shell came across the apartment house and implanted itself.</span> <span id="s747">We were asleep at the time.</span> <span id="s748">We had a Jewish cellar and an Aryan cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">JF: And that was all that was left?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">DS: Yes, and I must say to the credit of the other--Oh, we had some Nazis in the building that wouldn't look at you.</span> <span id="s751">But to the credit of the rest of the people that--the day before the Russians took the city we were--the last couple days, we were invited in the Aryan cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">JP: The Nazis, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">DS: Well, no, the Nazis had left by then.</span> <span id="s754">They didn't stay in Berlin, they went west.</span></p> <p><span

Not until after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">JF: There was no knowledge of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">DS: No, there was no communication with anybody.</span> <span id="s761">The radio was off.</span> <span id="s762">I mean, whatever was on was just propaganda.</span> <span id="s763">The shelling on the last day was continuous from five o'clock in the morning until eleven o’clock noon.</span> <span id="s764">And then it stopped, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">JF: And you were in these cellars?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">DS: I was in the cellar and I watched the crack getting bigger and bigger and bigger.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">JF: How long were you in the cellar from the time of the actual bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">DS: I would say from the day the shelling started--it must have been--it was about eight days.</span> <span id="s769">You came out--like, there was no water, there were pumps in the city streets.</span> <span id="s770">There were pumps there from way back.</span> <span id="s771">Horses were still watered.</span> <span id="s772">There was no gas, no water, no electricity.</span> <span id="s773">Nothing--and dodged artillery fire and run to the pumps for water and ran back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">JF: And when it was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">DS: It was 11 o'clock in the morning, and suddenly it was all quiet.</span> <span id="s776">Oh, there was still firing in the distance, but suddenly the Russians came and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">JF: What did you do when the Russians came?</span> <span id="s778">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">DS: Nowhere.</span> <span id="s780">I just showed them my star and apparently they knew.</span> <span id="s781">A Russian commissar came and wanted to talk to my father.</span> <span id="s782">He spoke perfect German and wanted to know about the Nazis in the area, and wanted information, and that was sort of the first contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">JF: Where did you go to live then?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">DS: We stayed in the basement.</span> <span id="s785">Well, somebody got killed, and first we buried the dead.</span> <span id="s786">One day we got a hit and somebody got killed, while they were making breakfast.</span> <span id="s787">Do you believe it?</span> <span id="s788">He went upstairs to fry himself an egg.</span> <span id="s789">And as a result, he got killed.</span> <span id="s790">They, the Russians, treated you very well if they found out that you were Jewish.</span>

the person was so nervous she called me to get the directions for the man and he looked at me like, "Why aren't you in the army?"</span> <span id="s798">and I was undernourished anyway so I said, "I'm only 11 years old."</span> <span id="s799">I wasn't 11 but he believed it.</span> <span id="s800">That's the information he got.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">JF: That's all he wanted?</span></p>

id="s824">DS: Yes, and what they wanted.</span> <span id="s825">What they wanted us to do,</span></p> <p><span id="s826">JF: So you were taking your cues from another group?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">DS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">JF: Did you know what the other group was?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">DS: No, I had no knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">JF: So the groups were working in connection though through a secret...</span></p> <p><span id="s831">DS: Yes.</span> <span id="s832">There must have--Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">JF: Line?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">DS: Yes.</span> <span id="s835">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">JF: So that there was some kind of organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">DS: There was some kind of organization, limited, I don't think very effective, to be honest.</span> <span id="s838">I, I don't think that what we did made a hound’s tooth of difference but at least there was a..</span> <span id="s839">.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">JF: It sounds like it made a difference to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">DS: It made a great difference to me.</span> <span id="s842">I am a great believer in "Never again."</span> <span id="s843">No next time around, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">JF: How did your parents feel, or did they know about your participation in the resistance group?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">DS: They knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">JF: And how did they feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">DS: They tried to talk me out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">JF: Because of the danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">DS: Yes, naturally</span></p> <p><span id="s850">JF: Is this something that came up later after the war in your conversations with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">DS: I am sure it did.</span> <span id="s852">I'm sure it was--I'm sure--I don't know.</span> <span id="s853">I think that is why I left Germany at the end of ‘48 or beginning of ‘49...</span></p> <p><span id="s854">JF: How did you live during the time, the liberation till...?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">DS: I lived fairly well.</span> <span id="s856">You mean from ‘45 on?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">DS: Well, central services were restored in the city.</span> <span id="s859">You know, CARE packages began to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">JF: And where did you live then?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">DS: The same area where we had lived in the one room except we moved one floor below where the Nazi had lived there and vacated his apartment and moved on to the West so we took over that apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">JF: How did you get the apartment?</span> <span id="s863">Who made arrangements like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">DS: The landlord.</span> <span id="s865">Whoever owned it at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">JF: And then you were able to find some kind of work at that point to pay for the apartment, or was there backing from outside agencies?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">DS: I don't--that's a good question.</span> <span id="s868">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s869">I don't know how that was handled.</span> <span id="s870">I don't know if they even collected rent.</span> <span id="s871">Right after ‘45.</span> <span id="s872">Nobody collected rent for six months.</span> <span id="s873">We just moved down.</span> <span id="s874">It was empty, it stood empty, and finder's keepers.</span> <span id="s875">We just assumed control over something that nobody else cared about.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">JF: You said this during this time a lot of the papers that you referred to, your father had with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">DS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">JF: During the eight days in the cellar and that entire period, he had these papers on his person?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">DS: Yes, yes, he always carried them in his briefcase.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">JF: And the rest of the things were with your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">DS: That's right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">JF: Were you able to find any kind of work after a bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">DS: After the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">JF: After the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">DS: Well, I decided that I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s886">Okay?</span> <span id="s887">So the requirement to study architecture--I started in--let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s888">The requirements were that you had to work nine months to a year on a building, a special arrangement that was union sanctioned as well as--for fellows who wanted to study architecture and you worked with a carpenter and a bricklayer of a large construction company.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">JF: Was this a school?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">DS: No, that wasn't a school, that was just a requirement and you kept--you already had applied--I didn't do anything in ‘45.</span> <span id="s891">I started in the end of ‘45 and I had begun taking that job to prepare myself and at the same time I completed my high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">JF: What kind of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">DS: In a German school.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">JF: A regular German school.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">DS: Sure--That was fine.</span> <span id="s896">As I said, even before the liberation you could move into the Aryan shelter...</span></p> <p><span id="s897">JF: And the school had the same kind of atmosphere?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">DS: Well, I had never been to that school.</span> <span id="s899">The school had all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s900">The high school--it was history thrown together--everything started from zero.</span> <span id="s901">There were returning soldiers who went to the school, there were other DP's who wanted an education, there was a whole mixed...</span></p> <p><span id="s902">JF: What was the interchange between the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">DS: Amazingly, everybody was looking to the future.</span> <span id="s904">None of--let's say, on the surface but--I frankly left Germany in 1948 because I couldn't look anybody in the face, because in my mind was a question: Where were you?</span> <span id="s905">In fact, a person I worked with, a German fellow also an architect-known him for years--I don't think that I had ever got over the feeling, Where were you during that time?</span> <span id="s906">Apparently that doesn't go away.</span> <span id="s907">If somebody is German, automatically my mind clicks back.</span> <span id="s908">I don't ask them.</span> <span id="s909">I ask myself, I wonder what he did during that time.</span> <span id="s910">There is always that suspicion in my mind.</span> <span id="s911">I don't think I will lose that.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">JF: Did your parents want to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">DS: No.</span> <span id="s914">My father said, "Well I'm too old to go anywhere."</span> <span id="s915">My mother came here after we had settled here.</span> <span id="s916">She came to join us.</span> <span id="s917">My father passed away in 1959 and my mother came over in 1961.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">JF: So they did not come with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">DS: No, I left by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">JF: You left by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">DS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">JF: Did you have difficulty leaving at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">DS: No, the HIAS--through the HIAS I came.</span> <span id="s924">[unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s925">JF: What word did you have from your parents about how things were for them in Germany after you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">DS: Quite well.</span> <span id="s927">Everything seemed--They visited--My mother's relatives suddenly discovered they had relatives in Berlin again.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">JF: The Christian relatives had returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">DS: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s930">Then suddenly my parents were invited to come and visit, and life went back to normalcy.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">JF: Do you know whether they ever discussed with the family...?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Tape 2, Side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s933">JF: You were talking about the fact that your family was reunited with the Christian part of your mother's family after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">DS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">JF: But you yourself did not go to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">DS: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">JF: But there was also the contact with the aunt who had helped the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">DS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">JF: The one aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">DS: Yes, she lived in Berlin and that contact was never lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">JF: And she stayed and your parents stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">DS: Yes, in fact she visited us here as well a little later.</span> <span id="s943">No, that contact was never lost, and there were people in the building who were anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s944">As I said we had experiences that gave you hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">JF: And you said, if it had not been for your aunt and your mother that you feel your chances would have been very different?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">DS: Oh, no question about it.</span> <span id="s947">We would have--as I said, all my relatives on my father's side never came back.</span> <span id="s948">Okay.</span> <span id="s949">The people I showed you.</span> <span id="s950">And others I didn't show you--other cousins never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">JF: And your mother came to this country after your father's death?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">DS: Yes, we asked her to join us here and she lived here until ‘63--she passed away in ‘63, ‘64.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">JF: Is there anything else you'd like to add to your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">DS: No.</span> <span id="s955">not really.</span> <span id="s956">I mean, we've gone over many things in a short period.</span> <span id="s957">The lesson I drew from that is that I wouldn't take anything like that laying down and I almost threw someone out of the subway in 1945 after the war who made antisemitic remarks.</span> <span id="s958">You know, it's just like a red flag.</span> <span id="s959">I jumped at the guy and said, "Get out of the train or I'll throw you out."</span></p> <p><span id="s960">JF: You felt the freedom to do it at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">DS: Yes, and all the good Germans stood around silently and didn't say a word, just as they stood around when the Nazis beat up the Jews.</span> <span id="s962">So, to me--I wouldn't take it lying down.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">JF: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">DS: Okay.</span> <span id="s965">Sure.</span></p></body></html>
