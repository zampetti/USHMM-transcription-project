when I was a child there in Romania.</span> <span id="s50">She was just a housewife, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: How do you remember your family life, when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Well, we were privileged, I think.</span> <span id="s53">I was privileged in many ways because the time of the Romania was, after first World War, and the economic situation was good, and my father business was good, so I didn’t have to work.</span> <span id="s54">So th-the only thing I had to do is to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: And what sort

<span id="s64">There was a lot of studying in the high school in Romania that time.</span> <span id="s65">And of course we had to learn lots of foreign languages.</span> <span id="s66">We learned French in school, then the Italian in school, and then privately I learned English.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: And why did you privately learn English?</span> <span id="s68">Why was – did your parents think this was an important thing to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Well, because if – the idea was – part of it was that when you – in Romania, if you leave there, and you are a s-specialist, either you are an engineer or an architect, or a doctor, you have to travel.</span> <span id="s70">So if you have to travel, you have to know languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: So did you become fluent in French and Italian –</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Now –</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: In French I had to become fluent, because there was an exam in French.</span> <span id="s75">You see, th – we have the – they had the high school in Romania is like in France, you have to pass the baccalaureate, you know.</span> <span id="s76">And there is an exam in French, and the French teacher is talking you in French.</span> <span id="s77">But th-the – talks about literature, and what else?</span> <span id="s78">And so I – I

examination in Italian, you know, just is a – I didn’t want to take German.</span> <span id="s81">Most students took Germans, but I – I didn’t like the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: And how come?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Because of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: I see, so you were very conscious –</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: – once you became a – a –</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Oh yeah, we were very conscious when I was in high school.</span> <span id="s88">Let me say this about this.</span> <span id="s89">In Romania, there were at least two political party that was very – that were very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s90">And when you were growing up in high school, and reading the newspaper, you were aware that there was a certain amount of anti-Semitism all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s92">Wer – did you have non-Jewish friends as well as Jewish friends in – in high school, or was this mainly a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No, I went to high school, a state high school, which was in – more or less in the Jewish district of town.</span> <span id="s94">And ma – ther – about half of the class was Jewish, half of the class was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s95">But we had Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s96">I had Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: You had Jewish friends, as well as –</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Not –</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: – not Jew – non-Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Well, we had one guy that we played soccer with, that was not Jewish, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: But mostly you had Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Jewish friends, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Were – were your parents religious?</span> <span id="s104">Was your home a religious home?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q:

for –</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Mm-hm, memorial.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: – for memorial things, yeah, for his mother and father or something.</span> <span id="s111">He used to go to a small synagogue, which he didn’t go to the high –</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: To [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: – high holidays, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: So you

parents were not very religious, or did that seem –</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Well, let me say this about it.</span> <span id="s119">According to the Romanian constitution, in high school – you see, the high school was not like here, everybody goes to the high school.</span> <span id="s120">You had to take an exam to get in the high school, it wasn’t compulsory high school.</span> <span id="s121">And according to the constitution, every student had to have religious education.</span> <span id="s122">There was a mark for religious education, you had to be in the class.</span> <span id="s123">And I took Jewish religion in the high school.</span> <span id="s124">We had the rabbi who came in and talked to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: So were you required to – to be the religion of your parents, or could you have decided to go to another class altogether?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: No, no, you –</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: You had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: You have to do a religion.</span> <span id="s129">Of course, I was Jewish, so I – so I-I – I went to the – to the special classes, the rabbi who came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: And then the rabbi was involved with the – I think it was – not an Orthodox, Reform –</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: The Reform movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: – Reform synagogue, and then I took the Bar Mitzvah in the Reform synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s135">But the Bar Mitzvah was not required, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: No, no, it was not required.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: No, you – did you decide you wanted to do it, or did your parents decide, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No.</span> <span id="s139">I don’t know, everybody was doing it, so I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: So you did it.</span> <span id="s141">Was there a party?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: No party.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: No party, you just did the Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Did you like it?</span> <span id="s146">Did y – was – were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Well, I took lessons again.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Some Hebrew lessons, some you ha – also in the Bar Mitzvah, you had to give a little talk, mostly to thank your parents for what they did for you and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: So I learned a – a Hebrew little talk</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s153">In Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: In Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Ah.</span> <span id="s156">And who translated it for you?</span> <span id="s157">Did you – did you write it in Romanian?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Oh no, no, I took Hebrew lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Oh, so you could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s161">Not only that, but during the Bar Mitzvah, we were four students, and you had to go to the Torah and I think that we read a little of the Torah aloud.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s163">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: So you had to learn the – how to read the script.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: The script from that Torah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: So what kind of a child were you?</span> <span id="s168">Were you very serious?</span> <span id="s169">Were you a problem for your parents, what were – look at that look on your face.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s171">I think that the influence of my mother was that – you see, my parents didn’t have an education.</span> <span id="s172">So I had to have an education and I had to be what they used to call the liberal profession.</span> <span id="s173">Which mean either a lawyer or a doctor or an engineer or something, you know.</span> <span id="s174">And there was a certain pressure to become a –</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: A professional.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: A professional, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Were – did you resent it?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: No, you didn’t.</span> <span id="s180">This was okay with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s182">Well, again, we were lucky, we didn’t have to work.</span> <span id="s183">And the only thing, when I was in high school, I did a fair amount of sports, and you had to pass an examination, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s185">So what sports did you like?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: We played soccer.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s188">And you liked that?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: We played soccer when we were 13 - 14, and then later on we played volleyball and basketball.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: And basketball?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: And your brother, your brother was younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Five years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Five years, oh, that’s a big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: So were you close with him at all, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Well, when he became older, we already had the problem with – with the Jews and he couldn’t go to the regular state school.</span> <span id="s198">And he had to go to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s199">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: This is even before high school, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: No, in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: In high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: In high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: He couldn’t go to the regular school, the ji – state school.</span> <span id="s206">You see, i-it was very important to go to state school, to be able to pass that – the examination, the baccalaureate, because that gives you rights to go to university and become an officer in the army and so on.</span> <span id="s207">The baccalaureate was very important in the – in the – with the – with the numerous [indecipherable] you know, and they started saying that the Jews cannot go to the state school, so the Jews formed their own high schools.</span> <span id="s208">Now, I understand from Radu that later on they recognized those schools, you see, after the war, you see, in the – they went back – my brother went back to the regular state school.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s210">But that was after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: After the war, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: So, in 1933, when Hitler takes over, you’re 11 years old, are you very conscious that – that – I mean, is there an affect in Romania at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: A li – a little – as I said again, there were all the time, I was very conscious that there was a certain amount of anti-Semitism in the – in the – Romania, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: So you grew up with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Oh yes, no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Did you join Jewish – any Jewish groups at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: I – I was – only for a short time when we – we used to play basketball and volleyball – well, that was later on, I was member of the Maccabee, that was a sports group, Jewish sports group.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: So you didn’t join a Zionist political party or anything –</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: – or a group.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Now I had friends, my friends that I used to play soccer in the street when I was young, later on they joined the Betar, and they were on Struma.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s223">And they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Killed, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s226">So you get your baccalaureate, is it 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: And your – so you’re 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s231">And – and by then there – there is a clear Nazi influence in Romania, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Well, it started – this is probably – you see, there was a lot of resentment in Romania in the – because Poland was divided in 1939, you know.</span> <span id="s233">And the western powers didn’t interfere.</span> <span id="s234">And the king felt that he cannot rely on the western power, so he made the compromise and let the Germans come in.</span> <span id="s235">And he also made another compromise, because he appointed the government wi-with these anti-Semitic groups.</span> <span id="s236">And the – the influence of Germans, and the influence of the government, they started this that the Jews cannot have business, the Jews cannot go to universities, and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Wa-Was there also some law against citizenship for Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: So did you lose your citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Now, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: No, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Now let me tell you about this.</span> <span id="s243">There were a number of laws in Romania that allowed the Jews to become citizens.</span> <span id="s244">In the – my father was a soldier in the World War I, and he got a citizenship because of that.</span> <span id="s245">But then they – they withdrew it, or they review it or something and he had to go to court again to get it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: And did he get it back?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: I think so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: So did that make you safer?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: It didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: No, because when they introduce this [indecipherable] and it seems that you could not be – have a business on your name, or you cannot go to state run school, or you cannot go to universities.</span> <span id="s252">Was a matter of religion, not of – of citizenship.</span> <span id="s253">See –</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: – because you see, when the things got bad, everybody got the passport, you see, and a – and wher – I got – I had a Romanian passport, my parents, especially my father, didn’t want to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Oh, he didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: No.</span> <span id="s258">He was not a [indecipherable] and he was in the war in Romania and he felt that his place is to stay in Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: But he couldn’t have his business any more, is that correct, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: He – I don’t remember what happened with that.</span> <span id="s261">Most Jews in business, what they did, they had the nom de plume, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s262">Just a Christian guy name, and they were running the business, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: But I don’t know whether he did that or not, I – I didn’t hear about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s266">Well, how – how did it come – it must have been awful in Romania at the time.</span> <span id="s267">Were you – were you, before you left, in some sort of a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: During – was this during the day, or you were sleeping there as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: No, I was during the day in a big camp called [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s271">Was a camp with thousands of Jewish adolescents, and we were building some target – you know, mounds of earth on both sides, so that the soldier can shoot targets, you see.</span> <span id="s272">And there is no equipment to bring the earth up to make this [indecipherable] you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: So you were digging.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: So you had two guys, a different level, moving earth.</span> <span id="s275">There was a tool – I don’t know what you call that in English, I don’t know what you call it in eng –</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Not a shovel?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Shovel, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: A shovel.</span> <span id="s279">There were – there were no girls in this –</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: – there was just adolescent boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: There were only [indecipherable] boys.</span> <span id="s283">This happened after I finished high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: So this was 1940? ’</span> <span id="s285">41?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: ‘41</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: I spend the whole summer in – in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Was that horrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Well, I got sick there twice.</span> <span id="s291">They had detachment, and the detachment was run by a lieutenant and the sergeant and I had – I had no trouble with them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s293">And did they feed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: No food at all during the whole day?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: You had to bring your own food, and – but you could go home in the evening, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s298">So – so did everybody eat at the same time when they brought food?</span> <span id="s299">Did – was there a break, or you just ate when you –</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: No, no, I – I – I don’t remember exactly, I think that there was a period of rest, so to speak, you know, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s302">And then you went home in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: And were you in two camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: I was in one camp, and they discharged us from the camp because the weather you know, snow and s – and then, during the winter, they called us back because they wanted the – the parks cleaned up of snow for traffic or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: So we went for short time, 10 days only.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s309">So let me – when – did you make the decision by yourself to leave, or did you talk with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: I wanted to leave, but I didn’t know how to leave.</span> <span id="s311">And so what happened was that my – one of my father associates had a son, and he was apparently in this group that they were organizing this trip.</span> <span id="s312">And so my father asked me if I want to go to those meetings, so I went to the meetings where they were organizing the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s314">We have to change tapes, so hold the story for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: So your f – your father asked whether you wanted to – to leave, or to go to these meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: So I went to these meeting, and he fel – you see, this – the son of [indecipherable] was an architect, and he was older than I was, you see, in the 30s, and I guess he felt that he is going to take care of me or help me, because I was just 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: – when the meeting started.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: So how long did it take – you – you had decided beforehand that you had wanted to leave somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s324">And your father knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Well, you see, there was a problem where are you going to go.</span> <span id="s326">And in – in those days in Romania there was a very strong French influence, you see, and – and you – actually, in the – I was supposed to go on summer vacation to one of those summer courses in – in France you see, but was cancelled because of the war, and you couldn’t go there.</span> <span id="s327">The only other place you could go was Switzerland, and the problem was with Switzerland was that you had to deposit money in advance that you are going to have enough money to finish your school.</span> <span id="s328">So, we didn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Were your – since your father didn’t want to go, was your mother and father upset that you wanted to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: My mother was – he – she felt that the – she was concerned that if I stay there, I’m going to go in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Because you were going to get into trouble, or because the Germans are gonna do something – cause th-the German –</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: No, no, I – I – I would – I – he wasn’t – in those days you are – you see, there was also something else that happened in Romania.</span> <span id="s333">When Antonescu became pri – pri – premier, he – and the king left, you see, there was – he brought in the Iron Guards, which was an extremely radical group who was also anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s334">And there were stories of the Iron Guards going in homes and picking up people in the streets and so on and so forth, and my mother was very c-concerned that I’m going to get in pogrom – in a pogrom, and she got – now, my father felt that if I leave, I’ll leave forever, you know that, he wasn’t really keen about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: But your – your mother was more protective of you in a certain way, so she wanted –</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: – so she wanted ans –</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: My mother was – if I went in the evening to – you know how boys are, they go out in the evening?</span> <span id="s339">She would stay at the window to watch me coming home.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Cause she was worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s343">So what – what were these meetings like, that you – when you went to these meetings?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Well, these meetings were primarily – my understanding about this was that these people, there were originally I think 10 or 11 or something, they decided to buy a boat from a Greek person who built this boat as a sailboat for races – racing.</span> <span id="s345">This was a racing sailboat.</span> <span id="s346">And I think he was in importing and export of grain, th-the Greek guy.</span> <span id="s347">And they decided, th-that they are going to – to buy it, and so they were organizing the – they were talking, where are we going to get the maps, the boat head, a small engine.</span> <span id="s348">One of the guys was supposed to be a knowledge of mechanic, and he was supposed to take care of the engine.</span> <span id="s349">And then where are we go – th-the – what kind of luggage we can take, you know, we’re not supposed to take luggage because there was no place, just socks, you see.</span> <span id="s350">And then there was a lot of talk about, if we leave in the winter or spring, the rail – you see, this boat – and this is why we had trouble with, had a big mast with sails.</span> <span id="s351">And to keep the mast up you have to have a keel under – under the boat.</span> <span id="s352">And the question was, how are you going to use the sail if in the winter when the rail where the sail goes up and down like a zipper is going to freeze, you see?</span> <span id="s353">So they were talking about all these things, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: And did you have a particular skill that they were going to use, or you were just going –</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: No, you had no skill?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: I – there – there – as I say, there was one guy, a mechanic, and there was another guy, I think, who had some experiences with – with boats.</span> <span id="s358">No, they made a decision right away that they are going to take captain and the sailor that na – as navigators and that’s what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Now, let me ask you something: did you know what was going on in terms of the actions against Jews in Romania at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: You did.</span> <span id="s362">And did y – did you want to leave just because you thought it was going to get bad, or did you – did you want to leave because you thought you actually could get killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: No, I wanted to leave because I wanted the different life, where – whe – where – let me – let me kind of give you an example.</span> <span id="s364">I-In Romania that time, if you were a Jew, and you needed some papers, you had to pay money to some intermediary and he will give you the paper, or he will give you a passport [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s365">He had connections, see?</span> <span id="s366">And – and he continuously was – for instance, to give you another example: the Jews were supposed to give money to the government, you know, some kind of a like a special income or something like this, income tax or something like this.</span> <span id="s367">My father didn’t want to go and argue with them, and I went with – with my mother in front of this – and this was Jewish people who were trying to get money from the Jews.</span> <span id="s368">Also, there was a question at that time about moving Jews to Transnistria.</span> <span id="s369">You know about Transnistria?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Ta-Talk about it a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: What?</span> <span id="s372">Transnistria – where the Germans were in – in Europe, you know, they controlled Europe, at one time in th – this was also the Romanian government, there was an area over the Dniester, you know, which is – actually, there is a small republic there called Moldavia during the – during the Russians – i-in the Russia before, and they wanted to move the Jews there in Transnistria, the rumors were that also.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: So all of these things, in-including the life even before the influence of the Nazis, and their [indecipherable] you – you wanted –</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Well, you see, it was a combination of the Romanian government, be-because they a – they accepted the German [indecipherable] without fighting, and these anti-Semitic groups like the Legionnaires, that they adopted the German policies against the Jews.</span> <span id="s375">Q: Did you talk to your brother about leaving, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: He was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: I thought about that, but he was 14 year old when I left, and I tell you frankly, I didn’t want to take the responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: So you didn’t want to take him.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: No, I felt that I can risk my life, but why should I risk his life?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: So, who bought the boat?</span> <span id="s382">Everybody who was going –</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Everybody contributed some money.</span> <span id="s384">There were some people who contributed a little more, a little less, I don’t know what was the – the deal.</span> <span id="s385">I don’t – my father never said something, but he paid some money for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: He paid some money.</span> <span id="s387">It’s expensive to buy a boat.</span> <span id="s388">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: I guess so, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s390">I don’t know how much it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: You’re not sure, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: He never mentioned how much it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: So you have to – you had a passport already, right?</span> <span id="s394">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: We had a passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: And we had the destination visa, you had to have that too.</span> <span id="s398">And so there was a consul from some South American – honorary consul from South America, and again for some fee he will give you a visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: So you had a visa to some South American country.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yeah, yeah, and the passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: How did you get to Constanţa?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: By train.</span> <span id="s404">Did you all go together?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: No.</span> <span id="s407">You went by yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Was that difficult to leave everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I don’t know, I just went by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: You just went.</span> <span id="s412">Do you recall the day that you ha – left and said goodbye?</span> <span id="s413">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: My – my father and my brother took me to the train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s416">So you don’t remember what your emotions were at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: The only thing that I remember is that when we came to the quay, you know, in Constanţa and I was looking for the boat, I ha – I had to go to look down on the way because the boat w-was a race boat, was very, very low.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: You see, the boat didn’t – didn’t have a rim or anything else, was very, very low.</span> <span id="s422">So I remember seeing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Were you concerned about getting seasick or anything on this boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: No.</span> <span id="s425">I – I was a little seasick, but not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: There were other people much sicker than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: And the boat is pretty small, I guess, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: And so there were 12 of you, or – do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Actually, I think there were – I think there were cert – y-you know, the whole – there were 11 originally and they – there were two guys that appeared on the boat that were not at the meetings, they came in later.</span> <span id="s432">And there were also the two – the captain and the sailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Now, were all there boys, men?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: No, there were two couples – three couples.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Three couples?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Three couples, and one of the ladies was pregnant.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: And the rest were – were m-men?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Men.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: The rest were men.</span> <span id="s442">So where did you all stay on this boat?</span> <span id="s443">On the top?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: There were – there were two cabins i-in front, and the married people took the cabins.</span> <span id="s445">And the – then there was some kind of a storage area in the back, with boards and all the others were just staying there.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: So you just stayed on top of the boards and slept?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Did you get sunburned?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Did you get sunburned?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: No, no, this were inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Oh, it was inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: And what about food?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: They had food.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: They had food for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: But this was going to be a very long trip, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Well, there – at the meeting all the time their question – things that – oh, they are going to stop in Turkey, in Istanbul and get maps – we didn’t have maps –</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: You didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: And they’re going to get food and stuff and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: So they figured that they would stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: But it didn’t work that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: I bet.</span> <span id="s467">So, you start sailing and you have a captain and a navigator?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: The captain and the sailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: The captain and the sailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: The captain was the navigator.</span> <span id="s471">I think he had a compass, but I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: I hope he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: I think yeah.</span> <span id="s476">He – you see, the way he navigated by he knew where the lighthouses are.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: On the coast of the Black Sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: And he knew from the lighthouses also how he navigated the – towards the Bosphorus.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: And I remember waking up the next day and the lighthouse from the Bosphorus was there.</span> <span id="s483">You see, Turkey was neutral, so they had the lighthouses, but I think there were lighthouses also o – in – on the Bulgarian coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s485">And – and you traveled close to the coast –</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: – as you were going down to the Bosphorus, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Would – did you feel safe in th – the Romanians didn’t try to stop you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No, no, but let me say this: when we went in Constanţa before going on the boat, we have custom house – custom i-inspection.</span> <span id="s491">And there was one or two Germans who took pictures of the boat.</span> <span id="s492">Soldiers, I mean, German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: You see, by that time – that’s another thing about – before I left, when the – I told you the government decided to let the Germans in, there were Germans in the streets of Bucharest.</span> <span id="s495">And they were living in one of the – those hotels.</span> <span id="s496">And also Italian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: But it wasn’t an occupation at that time.</span> <span id="s498">They were just there.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: They were just walking in the streets, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: And I must say, the German had very good clothes, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Cause was winter, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: So what did you take with you when you got on this little boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Just a few clothes, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Clothes.</span> <span id="s507">A-Any books?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: What’d you take?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: – I had th-the dictionary of – English-French dictionary.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Did you have anything to read?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Newspaper, French.</span> <span id="s515">That’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: That you purchased right before you got on the ship – on the little boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Well, you see, we used to read the “Journal de Genève.”</span> <span id="s518">You know about “Journal de Genève?”</span> <span id="s519">It’s a Swiss paper in French and it used to come to Bucharest and I used to go downtown and buy it, and I used to read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: So you took that with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: I took some wi-with me.</span> <span id="s522">I still read newspaper now.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: So you went through the Bosphorus, then you went to the Marmara Ereğlisi, yes, and then the Dardanelles.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: So you’re going down the coast of –</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Turkey, I told you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Turkey, yes.</span> <span id="s528">And then you – there’s an accident that happens in Çeşme, or near Çeşme – Çeşme.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: In Çeşme, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Well, I think probably I can relate this.</span> <span id="s532">First, before [indecipherable] Çeşme, the sailor didn’t want to go down south.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Oh, just – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: He decided he was afraid that he being Romanian, he’s going to be interned, you know, being an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s535">And he took the little dinghy boat that we had, we had a little dinghy boat, and he went to the Chios Island.</span> <span id="s536">Those islands –</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: – were occupied by the Germans, they were Greek islands, you know?</span> <span id="s539">And I think that one of the thing that he was supposed to do, because of the keel, was to throw in a gadget that it’s like a string with a weight, by which, before the boat goes in the harbor, he finds out the depths of the water.</span> <span id="s540">And we d – he wasn’t there to do that any more.</span> <span id="s541">I think that’s what he was doing –</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: – before.</span> <span id="s544">And the captain should have asked one of the guys to do that, you see.</span> <span id="s545">And what happened is that the keel, which was about three or – feet or four feet deep, went between rocks in the por – Çeşme, and then the boat started shaking like this, and everybody got scared and we left the boat and we went on the Turkish coast.</span> <span id="s546">And then we stayed there for, oh, I don’t know, maybe 10 hours or something like this.</span> <span id="s547">And then there was a Turkish boat that rescue it.</span> <span id="s548">I mean, they were – they had some long sticks and pushing the sticks to the bottom and at the same time the boat, pulling it, you know?</span> <span id="s549">So they got it out from the ro – between the rocks and inflated it, and put it back on the water, you know [indecipherable] water.</span> <span id="s550">Then we went back on the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: So how did you get off the boat?</span> <span id="s552">The dinghy wasn’t there any more.</span> <span id="s553">Was there another one?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: I think that the Turks – the Turks had – had a dinghy.</span> <span id="s555">Some people from the harbor came in with a dinghy.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s557">So then you were just s-sitting on the coast there.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Was there a town or were you on the – just on the beach waiting?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yeah, just – just on the coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: On the coast, just waiting.</span> <span id="s562">So then you go back to the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Well then what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Then the saving – the saving boat took out the mast as a guarantee that they’re going to be paid for their saving – salvage.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: You mean this th – because they save you –</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: – they took the mast so you can’t move.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: So we stayed there for about four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: On the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: On the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Was that horrible?</span> <span id="s575">Was that horrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Well, you know, it was – some of it, you know, wasn’t so bad, you know.</span> <span id="s577">And there was a man from that area who used to come every day with a sack of food.</span> <span id="s578">I don’t know who paid for the food.</span> <span id="s579">This was near Smyrna, you know.</span> <span id="s580">Now, there is a British consul in Smy-Smyrna, there was a – an American consul in Smyrna.</span> <span id="s581">Either the – there – I read somewhere that the Britisher took care of these boats.</span> <span id="s582">I don’t know who paid, but somebody p-paid for the food.</span> <span id="s583">Also –</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Wait, you ha – we’re going to have to hold it just one moment, cause we have to change the tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Oh, I wanted to say, one of the things that affected my mother particularly was that when Antonescu became prime minister, he had the Iron Guards with him, and then there was the revolt of the Iron Guards against Antonescu, and the army took control, and arrested the – the Iron Guards.</span> <span id="s589">And we lived on a boulevard not far away from the security – the country security offices, and there were machine guns in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: So your mother was very nervous about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s594">Th-Th-There are machine guns in the street [indecipherable] you know, like maybe hundred meters, 200 meters from the building, you know, they had machine guns in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Did it bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: No, but it – it makes you –</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: A little nervous.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: [indecipherable] it, you know.</span> <span id="s599">The machine guns were, of course, the army.</span> <span id="s600">You know, the army took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Against the Iron Guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s603">See, the Iron Guards, it was originally a group of [indecipherable] wrote a little book about these Iron Guards, with the – they were students and they’re terrorists and they killed a few of the prime minister of Romania.</span> <span id="s604">And of course, the-their leader was killed and buried, and th-the place where he was buried was covered with concrete, so that nobody can take his body out.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: So this was clearly not a good time in Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: No, i-i – not when we were adolescent, this happened after 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s608">So, let’s go back to – you want to go back to the boat –</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: – a little bit.</span> <span id="s611">You don’t know who provided the food for you, you just got food every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s613">Also, there were boats coming from Cairo to take Greek – Greek men to form a Greek legion in Alexandria, you see.</span> <span id="s614">This is during the war.</span> <span id="s615">And all this trip was during the war, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yeah, and one of our men was a very good swimmer, and he used to swim to these boats and get cans of food, put them under his trunks and bring them over.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Sounds difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: How did you wash on this boat?</span> <span id="s621">Did you wash during these four months?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: No, you wash in the sea, in the water, in the sea, everybody –</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Including your body?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Yeah, everybody was going in the water, including me, I di – wasn’t a swimmer –</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: – but you put the – what you call the –</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: The – the safety –</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: – safety belt –</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: – and then you go in the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: And you – and you washed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Well, not too – soap was something that this –</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s634">So you didn’t mind this.</span> <span id="s635">Did – did you like the people who were on the boat?</span> <span id="s636">I mean, did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Well, I never had any problem with, there were other people who had problems.</span> <span id="s638">I never had problems.</span> <span id="s639">No, I – I never had problem with anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: What – what other sorts of problems, people had personality conflicts, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Personality conflict.</span> <span id="s642">One of my – there was another student there, and he had some kind of a problem with one of the men – men in there, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: So did – did the captain intervene?</span> <span id="s644">Did somebody intervene and try to make people –</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No, the captain – the ca – y-y-you see, the – while th-the – there was danger and so on, everybody was quiet, you see, there wasn’t much problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s647">It was just when it got quiet that people started –</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s650">Did you think that these conflicts were silly?</span> <span id="s651">Or y – or you didn’t pay much attention to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: I didn’t pay attention to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s654">Okay.</span> <span id="s655">So, you’re on this – the – boat for about four months?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Yeah, and then somebody paid the money to this rescue boat, you know, to the salvage boat.</span> <span id="s657">Now, there were rumors then that there was a collection of money from between – in the Jewish community in Istanbul, there – that contributed.</span> <span id="s658">Some people said that the money came from Romania.</span> <span id="s659">Some people – some places it’s written that again the Britisher apparently contributed.</span> <span id="s660">I don’t know, I do – I never found out th – I don’t know who contributed.</span> <span id="s661">But the money was paid to the salvage boat, and they gave us back the mast.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: So once you got the mast you could – you could go again?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s664">Then the captain left, because he was afraid again to go down south, said he’s going to be interned, so he remained in Turkey, the captain.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: So then who becomes your captain?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: They got an Arab, an Arab c-captain who knew the coast, and he took us all the way down the coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Did this surprise you, I mean, the captain and this other – the sailor knew that – where they were going before they left Constanţa, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: You see, there was a bad time in Romania, and these guys had families, and they wanted to get money for their families, so they –</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: – th-they take a chance you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: And the idea was that they may get out in Istanbul and so on.</span> <span id="s673">Now, the rumor which I heard was that they – the boat came Istanbul, or in – near the coast in the Bosphorus there.</span> <span id="s674">And the – the Turks told them, just keep sailing, we don’t want you here.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s676">Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: That’s the way I was told, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s679">So then you get this new captain, and you’re going around the coast of Turkey –</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: – and Syria?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: And then you’re supposed to stop in – in Lebanon and Beirut?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: The – we stopped in Beirut.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: You stopped in Beirut.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: And then, when we stopped in Beirut, the – a British security officer came, and the – the people on the boat asks did they want to go to Palestine, you see?</span> <span id="s687">And he came the next day and said the British government decided you people have to go to Cyprus.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Not to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: No, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Was the intention to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: It was.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Now, at the meetings that we had in Romania, the meetings, there was one lady there who had some connection with the Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s694">And she – either she worked for the Zionist, I don’t know, but she was talking about Palestine, that she wanted to go to p – and everybody agreed with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s696">Including you?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Yeah, well –</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: I-I – I just wanted to get out, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s701">So you go to Cyprus?</span> <span id="s702">And how –</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: So we – now, the boat was towed, it was hooked up to another boat, and then we went – it’s not far away, it’s about 60 miles, you see, we went to Cyprus in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s704">And then everybody was put in some kind of a quarantine center, because they were afraid of diseases or something.</span> <span id="s705">And we stayed in quarantine there, I don’t know, for a week or 10 days, or maybe a little longer, maybe longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: And then they moved us to a hotel in Pedolas(ph).</span> <span id="s708">Pedolas(ph), it’s in the mountains, it’s a resort, and they have hotels there and we moved in the hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: And how are people reacting to – to this?</span> <span id="s710">Are people okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: So people are not complaining or yelling, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: No.</span> <span id="s715">So how long are you in Cyprus then?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: I was in Cyprus – ’42, ’43 – maybe a year, or 10 months or something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: And what are you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Well, we – first of all, the British sent a – a teacher.</span> <span id="s719">There was a British teacher to teach English.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: So we had English lessons.</span> <span id="s722">And believe it or not, we had a play, in English of course, “The Barretts of Whimple Street.”</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: You’re kidding me.</span> <span id="s724">Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: And did you – you played a role?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yeah, I played the role of a doctor there.</span> <span id="s728">So, it was a very active English teaching thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s730">Well, that’s interesting that the British would send a teacher, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: The British – the British have – I knew this before, because the British have the – I can’t remember the name of it, it’s called the British council or something.</span> <span id="s732">They had an organization of teachers that were sent all over the world to teach English.</span> <span id="s733">This is before the war.</span> <span id="s734">I ge – I can’t reme – there was a lord involved in this, Lord Cecil(ph), I think.</span> <span id="s735">I think this young man probably had something that he couldn’t be a soldier, or he couldn’t be an officer or something.</span> <span id="s736">And he was sent in to this [indecipherable] he was teaching English.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: So you were – you were occupied?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: So it wasn’t boring for you, just to be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Well, also we wrote letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: I tried to get in the British army, I wrote one letter.</span> <span id="s743">Then I wrote a letter to the American university in Beirut.</span> <span id="s744">Then to my surprise, the health officer – oh, wait, we – there was a Cyprus health officer around also.</span> <span id="s745">He came to tell me that you are going to leave the colony.</span> <span id="s746">And that I was admitted to – as a student in the American university in Beirut, you see, and I left on the airplane, a small airplane.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: On an airplane?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: It was a small airplane –</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: – that came from [indecipherable] to Cyprus and to Beirut, it was going around like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: And one engine aira – airplane, you know, and that’s the –</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: So all because you wrote one letter?</span> <span id="s754">Did nobody else –</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: I wrote – I wrote a letter and I sent copies of my grades from the baccalaureate from Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: You had those with you?</span> <span id="s757">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s759">And where did you copy them?</span> <span id="s760">There were no co –</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: I didn’t – I didn’t copy them, but I had – I had the copies with me, so I send them over.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s763">I see.</span> <span id="s764">Did you also write to your parents and your brother?</span> <span id="s765">Or you didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: You couldn’t write.</span> <span id="s767">The only thing that I – I received through the war were certain letters from – small letters, really simple letters; we are well, and so on, from the Catholic – the Catholic – the [indecipherable] organization, you see, they were doing this, they were sending let-letters, but I never answered them because I didn’t know how to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: So you didn’t hear from your parents and you didn’t – you – I mean, there was no way to communicate with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Oh, they send me these little notes.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: The – the little ones, but you don’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s773">Were you worried about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: You weren’t.</span> <span id="s776">You didn’t think things would happen in Bucharest?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s778">I think the reaction, it’s some kind of a psychological reaction that you worry about yourself, so you don’t have that much worry about other people.</span> <span id="s779">I don’t know, I think it’s some kind of a selfish way to react.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: But you must have been really happy to get the news that you were going to go to the university, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s783">But you didn’t know anybody there.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: In Beirut?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: So you took this plane, with your little sack of clothes and your dictionary –</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: – and you went to the university and what were you going to study there?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Well, I wrote them that I want to go to medical school, and they have a medical school with very few students, you know, like 40 students a year or something like this.</span> <span id="s791">And they wrote me that I – because of my – the baccalaureate exam, you know, that I’ll be admitted to sophomore science.</span> <span id="s792">So I stayed there and took sophomore science.</span> <span id="s793">And then I went to junior, and in junior you have to take a major, major in biology and a minor in chemistry to be able to go to medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: And I was sick that year.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: With what?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Yellow jaundice.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s800">Everybody got jaundice that year.</span> <span id="s801">The rumor was that the Indian troops from, you remember Rommel, and the Indian troops from Africa?</span> <span id="s802">Came in for reha – or rehab or something, and they brought with them hepatitis and everybody got hepatitis including me.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Well, that wasn’t very pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Oh no, they put me in the hospital for a few days.</span> <span id="s805">They used to treat you with I.V. with sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: So did you get better in a few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: I got a little better, yes, but then I had to go and find out food outside there, and I found a family and the lady used to cook spaghetti.</span> <span id="s810">And again, you couldn’t eat any proteins, you know, you had to eat only carbohydrate.</span> <span id="s811">That’s the way they used to treat the –</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Is that still true?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: I mean, I don’t know, the idea was behind that, if you eat proteins, the liver has to work harder, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: So they – they eat – eat only sugar [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: So you had a lot of spaghetti, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Oh, I had spaghetti for a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s823">And you liked it?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Was that – that wasn’t the first time you had spaghetti?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s828">So were you out of school now for a f – for a few weeks or a few months, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Well, a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: For a few weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: So you were able to catch up?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s834">It was not easy because in those days they used to give a big embryology course in the junior year.</span> <span id="s835">You know now, it depends, nowadays they give them sometimes in medical school, you know, first year.</span> <span id="s836">But this teacher was, I think, from John Hopkins.</span> <span id="s837">He gave the course in embryology, and it’s a tough course because they give you boxes of slides, and microscopes and you just have to – to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: It’s tedious.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: So you went back to school, and you didn’t have to go to the first year of college, you went to the second year in the – in these courses, right?</span> <span id="s841">Is that correct?</span> <span id="s842">The sophomore –</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: No, I took sophomore, then I got promoted to junior.</span> <span id="s844">And in junior – from junior you can go to medical school –</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Oh, you can?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: – if you make the grades, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: You don’t have to wait until you’re a senior?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: No.</span> <span id="s849">But I’ll tell you how they do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Okay, how do they do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Was accelerated program.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: So from the junior you go to first year medicine, and at the end of first year medicine, they give you a college degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Oh, I see, that’s clever.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Colle – college degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Arts – college of arts in medicine, it’s called, college degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: So you got your baccalaureate in Romania.</span> <span id="s859">And then you got your college degree in Beirut.</span> <span id="s860">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: So you start medical school, what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: I continue medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Second year and first semester of the third year.</span> <span id="s866">But that time it’s 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Oh, so it’s late.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: It’s late.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: By that time, things are bad in Middle East.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: In January 19 – sometimes in January 1948, the president of the university called the Jewish students in his office.</span> <span id="s873">There were seven Jewish students, and told them that he cannot guarantee their safety in the school, and that we should leave.</span> <span id="s874">Now, he gave us a piece of paper, which is in the file of the museum, you know, where he said that the [indecipherable] government requested the school to get rid of the foreign Jewish students.</span> <span id="s875">Not the Jewish students from Arab countries, but s – the foreign Jewish students.</span> <span id="s876">And – but he told us about the safety.</span> <span id="s877">Now, what happened was that when this happened, most of the Jews that we had in school came from Palestine, and so they went back to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s879">So y – when the war ends in 1945, did you think about going back to Romania, or you didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: I’ll tell you about that.</span> <span id="s881">The – I had, of course, problem with money [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s882">And they couldn’t help me from – my family couldn’t help me.</span> <span id="s883">My father wanted me to go back to Romania: he – he wrote me a letter.</span> <span id="s884">And I didn’t want to go back in Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: And did your mother write to you also, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: My mother was saying always, live your own life, you know.</span> <span id="s887">Do whatever you – don’t worry about us, and so on and so forth, you see?</span> <span id="s888">But when this thing happened with the meeting with the president of the American University of Beirut.</span> <span id="s889">Now, you have to know something about this also.</span> <span id="s890">This originally was a Presbyterian Missionary school, and then later on they made it an international college.</span> <span id="s891">And the teachers, they were Americans that came [indecipherable] to Presbyterian institutions from Columbia University and from John Hopkins, you see?</span> <span id="s892">And they were very sympathetic to my problem.</span> <span id="s893">And they wrote letters to John Hopkins, and to people from John Hopkins, and that’s the way I got admitted to University of Utah.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: I think we have to change the tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: You know, I never asked you the name of this little boat that you were on, the sailboat, what was the name of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Euxin.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Euxin?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yeah, is the name of the Black Sea in the Latin, called Euxin.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s902">So that’s e-u-x-i-n?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: I see, okay.</span> <span id="s905">Tell me something, di – were you, when you were in Beirut, going to school, were you also a translator on the radio?</span> <span id="s906">Or did you do that separately?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: I did translator and speaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: And you were going to school at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Well, this I did it only in the evenings, about three times a week.</span> <span id="s912">Let me tell you the background of that.</span> <span id="s913">In Beirut there was a commercial attaché.</span> <span id="s914">I think his name was Berkovitz(ph), or something like this.</span> <span id="s915">And when the war started, he started this program on Radio [indecipherable] which is the radio in Beirut.</span> <span id="s916">And you see, at that time, beru – Lebanon was a French protectorate.</span> <span id="s917">And when the – after the [indecipherable] collapsed, these people in – in French colonies, the protectorates, bec – affidavit to de Gaulle, so it became France Libre.</span> <span id="s918">And Dr. Berkovitz(ph), who was [indecipherable] embassy was running a program in Romania from the Radio [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s919">And he had another gentlemen then that I don’t know what happened, he got sick or something, and then he asked me to do this three times a week, or something like this.</span> <span id="s920">So I used to go there and get the news, translate them, and deliver it.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Before this, when you were going and getting your – your essentially the Bachelor’s degree, when you were going to college in Beirut, before you started your medical school; the war is still going on, so are you hearing a lot of news, or there’s not – there’s not much news?</span> <span id="s922">What is it like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Oh –</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: So, from ’44 to ’45, I think, right?</span> <span id="s925">Or from ’43 to ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: We – we had – I mean, in – as far as telegrams that came into the radio station, is that what you –</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: No, I’m talking about before, so y-your – your – you’re doing the translation from 1944 to 1945?</span> <span id="s928">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Well, I had this job, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s931">So, you are getting all – are you getting a lot of news about the war at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: And you – do you know what’s happening in Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: No, I didn’t know exactly what – Romania and I didn’t have – there were – there were once – there were not many Romanians – the Berkovitz(ph) family was – there was the doctor, the wife.</span> <span id="s935">He was a doctor in business or something, you know, he wasn’t a medical doctor.</span> <span id="s936">And he – and there was a son there who was a student in medicine at the French school.</span> <span id="s937">See, in Beirut there was a Jesuit French university also, and they had a medical school.</span> <span id="s938">So this guy, his name was Zaporta(ph), he went to that school.</span> <span id="s939">So I knew him, I – I – we’re kind of friendly.</span> <span id="s940">But there were not that many Romanians there.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Did you find out about the Nazis killing so many Jews in concentration camps and death camps?</span> <span id="s942">Did you find that out during the war or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: No.</span> <span id="s944">After.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: After.</span> <span id="s946">Was that extremely shocking to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Yes, to some extent.</span> <span id="s948">I – I never liked that culture.</span> <span id="s949">I didn’t take German in high school, and I didn’t like Germans, I never buy a German car or – ye – I – I – I – I – I was influenced by these things, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: So what – what happened made a big impact on you in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s953">When – when you couldn’t stay in Beirut, and these professors wrote, these American professors wrote –</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: – to Johns Hopkins, did Johns Hopkins have a division in Utah?</span> <span id="s956">Is that why you went to Utah, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Tell you the relation.</span> <span id="s960">You see, the – the people from – one of the people from teaching neuro-anatomy in – in Beirut, which I think he was from John Hopkins, I did some translations for him from Italian to English.</span> <span id="s961">Some research – he was interested in the pituitary gland, and I did some resear – some translations for him, and I think maybe – maybe he was the guy who wrote the letters, I don’t know who wrote the letters.</span> <span id="s962">But the way this happen is that one of the John Hopkins professor, by the name of Maxwell Winthrop – he was a hematologist, you know, at John Hopkins, became chairman of the department of medicine in Utah.</span> <span id="s963">Now why – how that happened was that Utah before the war had a two year medical school.</span> <span id="s964">And then after two years, they had to go usually to Chicago to finish medical school.</span> <span id="s965">Now, because of the war, they decided to make a four year medical school, and then they had to get chairmen – you know, professors.</span> <span id="s966">And they got this, the Maxwell Winthrop from John Hopkins as a professor of medicine.</span> <span id="s967">And I think that he was Jewish, and I think that they approach him, and Maxwell Winthrop had relation with the Jewish community in – in Salt Lake City, and the Jewish community there had a fund that was left by somebody from Colorado, a Jewish businessman or something, for scholarships or something like this, and they decided to give me a scholarship.</span> <span id="s968">And this is the way this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s969">But that’s not only what happened.</span> <span id="s970">It’s – to come as a student in those days to this country, not only that you had to have some kind of a scholarship, but there had to be a guarantee from somebody, that if you run out of money, they will contribute for your expenses in school and so on, so that you don’t remain penniless.</span> <span id="s971">And they c – this was done by a family of eye doctors in – in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s972">They did the guarantee, but they didn’t give me any money or something.</span> <span id="s973">The money was from that scholarship from the Jewish community in – in Salt Lake City.</span> <span id="s974">And I paid it back when I – after – later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Had you wanted to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Yes, I wanted to come to finish medical school.</span> <span id="s977">You see, this is something – it’s something that – once you start something, you have to finish it, and I – I – I started this and I had to finish medical school, you see, so it was very important for me to finish medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: But you – if they hadn’t said that you – they couldn’t guarantee your safety and you had to leave Beirut, you would have stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Probably, and perhaps made a life there.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: You don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: I was never interested in Middle East culture.</span> <span id="s984">You see, this goes back to the background in high school.</span> <span id="s985">As I told you, there was a very strong French influence, and western – western interest [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s986">I probably would have taken the medical degree there and gone somewhere in France, or somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: I see, right.</span> <span id="s988">But you –</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: See, na – tha – that Middle East culture never attracted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: But it was okay to go to Utah.</span> <span id="s991">That was –</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s994">Did that –</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s996">You know, it’s very funny, but when I left Paris, you see, because I went first to Paris, my friends there, Romanian friends said, how in the hell are you leaving Paris, which is a metropolis of the world, that you go out in the western United States where there is nothing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: But the situation in Paris there was not good.</span> <span id="s999">After the war, in 1948, the situation in France was bad.</span> <span id="s1000">First of all, there were not – not much food, not – they were depleted.</span> <span id="s1001">And their feeling, a lot of European refugees, including Romanian refugees, they all bring that is going to be another war between the United States and Russia, you see?</span> <span id="s1002">It wasn’t a very good situation to stay there and study.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: So you went from Beirut to Paris in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: As a – as a way to go to Utah?</span> <span id="s1006">I mean, that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: No –</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: You were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: I don’t know, I – I – I wasn’t sure whether I am going to go to school –</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: – in Paris, or if I ga – am going to get admitted to – to a school in United States –</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: I see, I see –</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: – I didn’t know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: – you didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1015">So you went to Paris to wait to see what was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1018">And how long were you in Utah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: I was in Utah from 1948 to 1950, two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Two years.</span> <span id="s1021">And you – and you met your wife there, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: That’s another story.</span> <span id="s1025">Where I was in – when I was a student in Utah, they have an intern there, an American guy from Montana or from some other western states, and we got – we got friendly.</span> <span id="s1026">And he went in psychiatry, and came to New York, the New York hospital, Cornell Medical School, you know, to study psychiatry.</span> <span id="s1027">So when I was in Saint Louis, an intern, and I came to New York, I came to visit him.</span> <span id="s1028">And who was there as a resident in psychiatry was my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1030">So that’s when you met.</span> <span id="s1031">And did – did – did you get engaged and married very quickly, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: No?</span> <span id="s1034">Took a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: About a year or more, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: And did she come to Saint Louis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: You see, I left Saint Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s1041">And where did you go after Saint Louis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: I came to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Now – now why did I come to New York?</span> <span id="s1045">The reason was, while I was in Saint Louis, I had a problem with immigration.</span> <span id="s1046">I had a problem with immigration before –</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: – because I was a medical student, have [indecipherable] a student visa, you know here, and they were very tough then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: And I was advised by people in Saint Louis that came from New York that I should go to New York because in New York they are me – there is more help with immigration, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: – there are people that can help you, so – and I was trying to get a job in New York.</span> <span id="s1053">So I came in New York and I went to Cornell Medical School to see this friend of mine, and there was this girl, you see, my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: So you met in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1057">So you were in New York for how long?</span> <span id="s1058">For a few years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: I was in New York for 15 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: 15 years, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1061">Where did you live in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: I was practicing – well, I was a resident – I was a resident in – I took a year in just medicine, then I was a resident in surgery, and then I was in practice for 15 years in New York.</span> <span id="s1063">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1065">So when did you go to Houston?</span> <span id="s1066">After New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Then the things change in the profession you see, in New York.</span> <span id="s1068">And it became the – the individual practice of medicine like we used to do became group practice.</span> <span id="s1069">And I decided that I’m going to go to Houston to take a post-graduate training in heart surgery, you see, because thoracic surgery have changed from the lung, to heart surgery.</span> <span id="s1070">And so I took this job in Houston for two years, a fellowship in the Texas Heart Institute.</span> <span id="s1071">And my wife, again, the practice – she was in practice of psychiatry, became to such an extent that she didn’t want to join a group, or something like this.</span> <span id="s1072">And she decided to get the training in psychiatric administration.</span> <span id="s1073">So she took a two year, went back to school, to a Master degree in public health, with emphasis on administration.</span> <span id="s1074">And then she took the exams to be an administrator.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: And where did she do that work?</span> <span id="s1076">She did that in Houston?</span> <span id="s1077">Or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: At the University of Houston.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Houston, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: You never saw your parents again –</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: – although they survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: And – and you wrote to each other after the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: – you spoke on the phone, or what?</span> <span id="s1088">Did you also speak on the phone, eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: But you did see your brother –</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: – in Europe a number of times.</span> <span id="s1095">But you never went back to Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Do you think that the – the war affected you in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Of course I think that this – sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: How do you think it affected you?</span> <span id="s1100">I mean, besides the fact that you – you ended up leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: First of all affected us, I think, that we went in medicine, you know?</span> <span id="s1102">I think my wife the same way, you see that we went in medicine, it affected us in that way.</span> <span id="s1103">And also, the fact that you had to do a lot of [indecipherable] changing and shifts, gears, so to speak, you know?</span> <span id="s1104">There was a lot of that during the war, and you had to be very persistent to – to be ab – to – to get out of school with a degree, you know?</span> <span id="s1105">And a lot of people advise me, why do you have to go up to medical school for so many years?</span> <span id="s1106">Why don’t you become a – a bacteriologist or a physiologist, or something and so on and so forth, you see?</span> <span id="s1107">You had to be very persistent to get through medical school, and that took a lot of energy, no question about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Was it awful for you to be so alone?</span> <span id="s1109">Or did you just make friends and – and accommodate them that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: I don’t know, maybe – I had friends, and I had a very good relation – see, I been married for 52 years, and I had a very good relation with my wife.</span> <span id="s1111">And being both doctors [indecipherable] understand the profession and so on.</span> <span id="s1112">And that, they are very helpful, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: But before that, it had to be very difficult for you, to leave as such a young person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Well, again – again, it was just very persistent to get through medicine and specialties and [indecipherable] examination, and so on.</span> <span id="s1115">There are a lot of exams in medicine, continuously you know, and traveling to – to get the knowhow, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1117">You – but you s – you did say something, that you thought the war influenced you even to become a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: And is that because you’ve – well, why – why – why di – why would you say that?</span> <span id="s1120">Cause you seem to have wanted to become a doctor for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1122">I think that maybe the idea was that seeing – you know, there was another thing also that was when I was the – as I say, when I went the – to Paris, you know, waiting to come to this country, there were a lot of refugee camps in Europe, you know.</span> <span id="s1123">And a friend of mine, a dentist who was – his family was in Palestine was going around these camps trying to convince Jewish people in the camps to come to Marseilles, so that they can emigrate to – to Israel, because by that time, the state was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: And there – I don’t know, there are a lot of bad situations around and I don’t know, maybe I had the feeling that being a doctor you can help some people, or you can help to change some of the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1127">Did you practice – when you practiced medicine, did you meet people who called themselves survivors, who went through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: You see, in – no, most of those people concentrated around the Jewish hospital in New York, you know, like Mount Sinai, Beth Israel –</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: – and – and later on I had the relation with Beth Israel, but by the time I came to Beth Israel, it was late in th – it was a kind of a religious situation, it wasn’t the – th-the situation of a war, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: But the one thing which – which remains, and this has been said before by other people, now that this Nazi Germany produced a tremendous amount of shifting of people and population all around Europe, a tremendous amount of damage, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: We do have to change the tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Harry, did – did you think of working in the DP camps at all when you – when you went –</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: You didn’t, when you came to Europe –</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: – when you went to Paris, you didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: No.</span> <span id="s1146">This friend of mine, the dentist, he went to some of those camps, and – trying to bring people to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: To Israel, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: – go to Israel, right.</span> <span id="s1149">Yeah, but I didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: But s – so you didn’t even think of whether you could work, even with the minimal amount of knowledge that you had as a two years doctors – medical student?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: You see, this is th – is another thing that, probably now that you ask those question, I think that one of the reason I was persistent to get a medical degree in th – work as a doctor, was to give some stability, internal stability that you were somebody that has a purpose, and so on, instead of floating.</span> <span id="s1154">Now, there were a lot of young men floating around Paris and floating around Israel in those days, you see?</span> <span id="s1155">And being a doctor and having a definite profession, it gives you ce – a certain amount of inner stability, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: And this was clearly a big concern for you, that you have something that was yours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: And something that this was, and something that you can concentrate on, and get some results.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1159">So was – was the profession of being a doctor very satisfying for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: It was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1163">I – I – in spite of all this talk you know, with Obamacare, you know, all this talk about medicine and so on, I said well, I mean, if I had to do it again, I’ll do it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: When – when did you retire from medicine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: After the Katrina.</span> <span id="s1166">Well, let me – you see, after the Katrina, they closed the – I used to work in a clinic in Charity Hospital for many years, you know.</span> <span id="s1167">I worked in the clinic and you see, I had the two appointments.</span> <span id="s1168">I had – I was clinical associate professor in surgery at Tulane Medical School.</span> <span id="s1169">I’m still there, I’m emeritus now.</span> <span id="s1170">And I had, at the same time, a position in the cli – different clinics in Charity Hospital, because that’s where I go – I was getting paid to, you see?</span> <span id="s1171">But the work in Charity Hospital, you have to belong to the medical school, you know, it’s one of those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: I see, right.</span> <span id="s1173">So you went to New Orleans after you’d been in New York, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: After I was in Houston.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Houston, Houston, I’m sorry, right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: So you were – you were in New Orleans for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Oh yes, from 1978 or something – I – I worked in Charity Hospital for 28 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: [indecipherable] I was teaching surgery for a time – for a time.</span> <span id="s1181">Then I worked in a walk-in clinic, then I worked in an anesthesia clinic.</span> <span id="s1182">Last thing in the 2005, I was in anesthesia clinic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: So you were still working in 2005?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: That’s a very long [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: And then they wrote a letter saying that the hospital is going to close, and if – it – my situation, after all these years, that I can retire, so I retire.</span> <span id="s1187">Most of us who worked in that situation retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Did that make you feel terrible that you didn’t – you didn’t want to retire, or did – were you glad to finally be free in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: No, I like to work, you know, and I’m still interested in medicine, and I like to work.</span> <span id="s1190">But it was again one of those situations where my – once – one of the reason that I left, of course w-were, you see, I had two – two hits, you know.</span> <span id="s1191">A hit was in 2004 when my wife died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: That must have been difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: That was one hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: And then the second hit was Katrina, you see?</span> <span id="s1196">And I had the impression in my age that I have to – to wait for a long time in New Orleans to change the situation.</span> <span id="s1197">So then I decided I’m just going to come here, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: To Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Because was again a very bad situation in New Orleans after Katrina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: So are you connected with medical societies, or with –</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: – here in the area, in Washington, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Oh I – I go once in a while to the [indecipherable] at Washington – George Washington University.</span> <span id="s1204">I go to the library there also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Well, you’ve had quite a long career and history, and I thank you very much for being willing to speak with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Well, I don’t know, this may help somebody maybe, or maybe the – somebody gets some use for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Well, it’s certainly an interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: This is what Radu said, if I had an interesting life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Yes, and he’s right, absolutely right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: And the Radu you’re talking about works at the Holocaust Museum, for people who don’t know, Radu Ioanid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: His name is Radu Ioanid, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: And he’s your nephew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: He is my nephew, he – yes.</span> <span id="s1217">He is the son of my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1219">Well, I thank you very much for being willing to come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Well, you’re welcome for – for – as I say, he felt that I’m an interesting life, and that I should talk about it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1222">Well, I’ll have to thank him as well as you.</span> <span id="s1223">So thank you again.</span> <span id="s1224">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span
