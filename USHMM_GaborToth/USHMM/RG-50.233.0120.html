Charlene Schiff.</span> <span id="s5">I was born in Horochow, Poland, December 16, 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: Can you tell me your name then?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Yeah, my Hebrew name was Sulamit Perlmutter and my nickname was Musia.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Musch?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: No, Musia.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Oh, Musia, okay.</span> <span id="s11">And Horochow?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Horochow.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Horochow.</span> <span id="s14">That’s right outside Lvov?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: It’s about an hour’s drive from Lvov.</span> <span id="s16">It’s a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about growing up in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Yes, I can tell you all my wonderful memories.</span> <span id="s19">I had an idyllic childhood.</span> <span id="s20">I was surrounded by love.</span> <span id="s21">I had two wonderful parents and one older sister.</span> <span id="s22">She was four years older than I.</span> <span id="s23">We had a very good relationship.</span> <span id="s24">My parents were both educators.</span> <span id="s25">My father was a university professor in Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Simeon.</span> <span id="s28">Simcha, Simeon, Simeon Perlmutter, Simeon.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: And he was a university professor in Lvov?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s31">That was a state university.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: What did he teach?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Philosophy.</span> <span id="s34">My mother did mot teach but both of them were civic leaders in town and I would like to bring out the fact that they were leaders not just for the Jewish community but for the entire town as well.</span> <span id="s35">What hurts so now in retrospect is that when we needed help no one extended a helping hand to us.</span> <span id="s36">Our neighbors and former so-called friends turned against us.</span> <span id="s37">My childhood was very, very happy.</span> <span id="s38">I know my father had five sisters and a mother who emigrated to America and he was in I guess, in the process of arranging for us to join them in the United States when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s39">I don’t know why he was the last one to emigrate but I understand from -- also in retrospect that it was because these were women, sisters, and he decided he would take care of them first even though he was somehow in the middle.</span> <span id="s40">I don’t know the actual chronological years but unfortunately we never made it.</span> <span id="s41">Ironically in 1939 he was offered two tickets, two invitations to the World’s Fair in New York and he refused.</span> <span id="s42">He asked for four and of course they didn’t give him four so we never did make it or he never made it.</span> <span id="s43">My childhood was very, very happy.</span> <span id="s44">I remember a big house.</span> <span id="s45">Our house was always filled with people.</span> <span id="s46">In those days or at that time we’d have like meetings and concerts, poetry reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: At your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yeah and all these many students of his would come and it was a very happy house, home, and I think that’s what gave me strength to survive in a way because I did have a very solid background of love and security.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: When did you start going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Well, my father was a believer in education, obviously, and we had tutors from the time I was four years of age and that’s when we started and then I guess to regular school I started at around six.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: You went to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yes, I went to public school but we still had private tutors for Latin and for German and piano music.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: So you knew four languages then?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: No I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s55">I was not a student.</span> <span id="s56">I was more of a tomboy.</span> <span id="s57">My sister was very musically inclined.</span> <span id="s58">She played the piano, she played the violin beautifully and she continued.</span> <span id="s59">I played the piano but I really didn’t give it any of my soul or anything.</span> <span id="s60">I liked to play and run around and just do the normal things.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: You said you were a tomboy.</span> <span id="s62">What did you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Oh I would climb trees and do that sort of stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Around the town was there a lot of lakes and streams and things to play with?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: No, there was a river and I remember once, as a matter of fact on my fourth birthday there was a party and at that time, it’s very hazy, but we did not live in a big house on the fashionable street.</span> <span id="s66">My father and I walked along the river, on the banks of the river and that river played a very important role in my life.</span> <span id="s67">I looked over to the other side and I said, Papa is that America on the other side and he tried to explain that it was not.</span> <span id="s68">There was one river.</span> <span id="s69">There were two ponds and there was a great big, it’s not a forest -- what do you call -- like a park but filled with trees and all and that park or on the edge of the park lived a lady who owned an awful lot of land and she was the, like the (I don’t know what you would call it -- the word escapes me now) but she was from nobility, Polish nobility and she was like a princess.</span> <span id="s70">And she lived, she was an old lady at that time; she only had some servants and all who tended her.</span> <span id="s71">But she lived right on the edge of that great big park and it was like a palace.</span> <span id="s72">And then we had like a mayor’s house, the Starosta and all these people used to come to our house, the mayor, the Polish priest and the Ukrainian priest because our town was partly Polish and partly Ukrainian and partly Jewish.</span> <span id="s73">In our house everyone met on an even status and it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s74">I mean I took it for granted.</span> <span id="s75">My friends were Polish, Ukrainian, Jewish, and I really even though you’re not asking me, I never felt any anti-Semitism in my childhood.</span> <span id="s76">There probably was some but I never felt it personally.</span> <span id="s77">And when I think of it now it was probably no small achievement that my father was a professor at a state university as a Jew and to me it was a given.</span> <span id="s78">That’s the way it went on.</span> <span id="s79">My mother did an awful lot of philanthropic work in our town and I remember they organized camps in the summer time for needy children, Polish, Jewish, Ukrainian and there was always an awful lot of activity and it was a very happy home.</span> <span id="s80">I mean there were many things.</span> <span id="s81">You talk about being a tomboy.</span> <span id="s82">I was the bane of my sister’s existence.</span> <span id="s83">She was four years older and I always wanted to do what she did.</span> <span id="s84">Of course she resented it.</span> <span id="s85">One time we had they call it a fretepian so it’s not really a piano I guess but something like a piano in a salon, in the living room.</span> <span id="s86">One time I got hold of some paint and I painted the keys.</span> <span id="s87">I was punished for that but I did it so she wouldn’t be able to play.</span> <span id="s88">Those are the things I remember from my childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: How large was the town approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Twenty, thirty thousand, just about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: So it was a good size town.</span> <span id="s92">It wasn’t a small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: It was a small town, yeah, but it was a very typical shtetl as they call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Was there a large Jewish community there?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yes very large and very active, large, I don’t know probably several thousand Jews and there was a Jewish day school they called `Tarbut and there was a society, I guess, the Kahila that governed the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s96">There were several different synagogues.</span> <span id="s97">There was a rabbi and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Were your parents religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: They were traditional but they were quote emancipated unquote.</span> <span id="s100">They were not very religious, they were traditional.</span> <span id="s101">I knew who I was, I knew my identity.</span> <span id="s102">We observed all the holidays and that’s another thing I remember.</span> <span id="s103">Once before Passover I was given a little Star of David and a gold chain and I lost the Star of David and there were about twenty people at the table and this is like a big dinner at Passover and everybody was made to crawl on the floor to find my little Star of David which they found.</span> <span id="s104">But I don’t remember going to synagogue every Saturday.</span> <span id="s105">No, we didn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about -- you know as much as you can remember -- about the invasion of Poland by the Germans in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Well before the Germans invaded my town the Soviet Union took over because Poland was partitioned in two.</span> <span id="s108">The eastern part of Poland became the property of the Soviet Union and we fell into that category.</span> <span id="s109">So in 1939 when the war started September 1, 1939, the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s110">They came in with their tanks and with their soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Did they come in on the first or did they come in a few weeks later?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: They came in maybe a week or so later and I remember long, long processions.</span> <span id="s113">At that time we lived in a big, big house on the main fashionable street.</span> <span id="s114">Litsa Miskawicha and I remember long hordes of refugees coming from the other part of Poland trying to get away from the Germans and we didn’t understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s115">They came in with tanks and with soldiers but very little bloodshed.</span> <span id="s116">There was a lot of chaos but pretty soon things became again sort of normal.</span> <span id="s117">I personally did not realize what was going on.</span> <span id="s118">I knew there was a change of government.</span> <span id="s119">The emphasis in my life was that the language, the formal language became Russian instead of Polish.</span> <span id="s120">But again that was not much of a problem because in our area everyone was either bi or tri-lingual.</span> <span id="s121">It was a little difficult in the beginning.</span> <span id="s122">A lot of people lost their jobs and all.</span> <span id="s123">My father did not.</span> <span id="s124">They kept him on and he continued in Lvov.</span> <span id="s125">There was one change which I just realized a few days ago.</span> <span id="s126">He used to also teach in Kracow, I don’t what do you call it, as a visiting professor and that stopped.</span> <span id="s127">Well it stopped obviously because the Germans took over.</span> <span id="s128">But other than that our life did not change that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: You stayed in the same house?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: We stayed in the same house.</span> <span id="s131">You see we were not materialistically, we were not rich or we were not -- I guess my family was part of the intellectual group in the town so our life has not changed much.</span> <span id="s132">This went on for not quite two years.</span> <span id="s133">Our schools didn’t lose a beat.</span> <span id="s134">The only thing is that the official language changed into Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Were you taught Russian in the schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And were the businesses in the town nationalized, that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Well you know what was happening and again this is all in retrospect which I didn’t realize.</span> <span id="s139">Some people would disappear in the middle of the night and not be heard from again.</span> <span id="s140">And these were probably the people that they considered capitalists.</span> <span id="s141">These were business people who owned businesses.</span> <span id="s142">Yes, I guess the businesses changed hands so to speak and all of a sudden there was a shortage of one item, two items, three items.</span> <span id="s143">Yes, definitely, the whole picture of the town did change.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Can I back up just a little bit before the invasion?</span> <span id="s145">Do you remember your father, your family in general being concerned about the Germans coming to power, the Nazis coming to power and becoming more powerful?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s147">This was not discussed in front of me but I know my father had a fantastic library in his little office in our house and now and again they would have meetings and they closed the door.</span> <span id="s148">A lot of people would come, a lot of his students and they would talk and then I would never see them again.</span> <span id="s149">And then I found that a lot of them emigrated in a clandestine way illegally.</span> <span id="s150">And a lot of them ended up, many as a matter of fact, ended up in what is now Israel and some of them ended up in the United States.</span> <span id="s151">And some of them we never heard of again.</span> <span id="s152">But yes, there were many discussions and there were concerns.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Now you said something about earlier when we spoke about trying to get out and go to the United States your father….</span> <span id="s154">.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Yes, my father….</span> <span id="s156">.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: When did he try to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Well, it seems like all my life there was talk about it but I know that at one point, I don’t know exactly, I think it was 1938, we all had to go to Warsaw and be interviewed or something and this was part of the process of getting ready to emigrate to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: But the papers just didn’t come through before the invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: I don’t know what happened but apparently so, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Was there anything, you know you talked about your life under the Soviets when they came in, I there anything else that strikes you about the Soviet rule about anything that you could remember that was very striking to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Well, I guess going to synagogue was a little more -- I mean it became less frequent.</span> <span id="s163">It didn’t affect any of my immediate friends so I am very hazy about it and I know that it was difficult and I know that they probably nationalized the businesses and all but from my own personal point of view I cannot relate to it too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: You made mention about the synagogue.</span> <span id="s165">Was there a conscious effort by the authorities to discourage religious practices?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: I don’t know, I’m sure it was but it was done in a very subtle way and I think my father was conscious of it and probably cognizant of it that he is not supposed to go to synagogue too often.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: You said he was allowed to go to Lvov.</span> <span id="s168">Do you remember if he was allowed to travel freely in that way back or forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yeah, he was traveling back and forth but I don’t think we traveled anyplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Why don’t you tell me a little bit about when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Well, that happened in the summer of ’41.</span> <span id="s172">Again I guess Hitler and Stalin, or Hitler decided to break his agreement with Stalin and he started pursuing his evil plans by occupying the territories first of Poland and then going on to Russia.</span> <span id="s173">The Germans came, again it’s almost like out of nowhere, again with tanks and their soldiers were much -- they were dressed sharp, they looked sharp.</span> <span id="s174">To me it was an event of change, but in a way exciting.</span> <span id="s175">It’s hard to say that but it was.</span> <span id="s176">They came in and we didn’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s177">I know my parents were very depressed but they did not share these feelings with us openly.</span> <span id="s178">Again we saw a lot of refugees, as we call them now, people going with the Russians.</span> <span id="s179">Why we didn’t do it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s180">I’m sure it’s very difficult to make decisions like these when you have a family, when you’re on your own.</span> <span id="s181">I want to track back and I think that my father was an ardent Zionist and I think that we didn’t go to America for two reasons and this is my conjecture.</span> <span id="s182">One, the authorities and the red tape was absolutely awful and took a long time and secondly my father’s heart really didn’t belong there and yet being a family man with two kids it was difficult for him to make a decision to do what he told his students to do and a lot of them did then.</span> <span id="s183">They went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Do you think he was advocating for many of them to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Oh, I know he did because we made a trip to Israel in 1985 (decade is unclear) or so and I met some of his students.</span> <span id="s186">They organized an evening to honor the memory of my parents, especially my father, their mentor, and they told me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Did they remember you?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Yes, they remembered me as a little pain in the neck.</span> <span id="s189">Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s190">And I remembered some of them.</span> <span id="s191">Yes, my father was really an ardent Zionist.</span> <span id="s192">I didn’t realize then, I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Did you know much of his activities in that vein?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: No, I know he was preoccupied with education and all.</span> <span id="s195">He had a number of doctorates from different places and that was his life.</span> <span id="s196">But the rest of it, no, I did not know.</span> <span id="s197">He was a wonderful father, he was very stern.</span> <span id="s198">There was discipline.</span> <span id="s199">We did not speak at the table until he spoke.</span> <span id="s200">But that was all right, we didn’t know any different so that was okay.</span> <span id="s201">I think I digressed from something that you asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: No, that’s okay.</span> <span id="s203">We can get back to it.</span> <span id="s204">I’ve got a couple of other questions but I wanted to step back just a little bit.</span> <span id="s205">I asked you about the invasion, the German invasion, but I wanted to step back just a little bit if I could.</span> <span id="s206">Before when we talked about how your father had discussions with students and other people about Germans, the Nazis coming to power and that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Yes, I think so because there were all sorts of newspapers and the radios and the political situation was discussed constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Do you, now this is an interesting question because many people at the time especially historians speculate that some people in the Soviet Union may not have known or tried to play down the fact that the Germans were going to invade.</span> <span id="s209">Do you remember if your father was concerned about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s211">I think he was always concerned with the world situation and they always, I mean at these discussions and these gatherings political situations were always discussed whether it was a concert or poetry reading or so but yes it was always discussed.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: When the invasion happened in June of ’41 do you remember how long it was after the invasion started that the Germans came into your town or arrive in the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I would say within a week, not any longer than that.</span> <span id="s214">There was no bloodshed or anything.</span> <span id="s215">They just came in.</span> <span id="s216">In the very beginning, I don’t know if it was the same day they marched in or the next day, all the Jews, right away they zeroed in on the Jews, we had to meet at the marketplace and right away they started with their decrees to strip us of all material possessions slowly but very systematically.</span> <span id="s217">The first request was for the Jews to give all the gold, maybe all the silver, all the radios, everything that had any material value, carpets, Persian carpets, you wouldn’t imagine, furs, fur coats, all sorts of things we had to bring to the marketplace, or whatever, I think it was the marketplace, the Germans took that.</span> <span id="s218">And that went on for about a week.</span> <span id="s219">Then they went around with a list of people which tells me that the local inhabitants had to give them that list.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Somebody had to give them that list.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s222">They didn’t know the names and they went for specific men.</span> <span id="s223">These men were all the leaders, the Jewish leaders in the community.</span> <span id="s224">And of course my father was one of them and they took him away.</span> <span id="s225">Just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: And that was within the first week of them being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Within the first week or maybe the very beginning of the second week, that’s it.</span> <span id="s228">There was so much chaos and so much confusion.</span> <span id="s229">I don’t recall but every day since the Germans came in was just like a nightmare in the beginning and that was not even the real nightmare.</span> <span id="s230">But that’s the way I lost my father.</span> <span id="s231">They came in.</span> <span id="s232">He saw them; he tried to run out through the kitchen, through the back way and they were in the back there with the Ukrainians and they grabbed him and that was that.</span> <span id="s233">The rumor had it that these people, the leaders of our community were taken away and sent to Dachau.</span> <span id="s234">Now I find out that there was a big question mark.</span> <span id="s235">Some people told me that it’s probable that they were all executed right there and there’s supposed to be a mass grave which I never got to see upon my return trip in 1988.</span> <span id="s236">Or some of them did go to Dachau.</span> <span id="s237">I searched in Dachau for any sign, lists and all.</span> <span id="s238">I could not find anything and I still to this day, I do not know how or when my father died.</span> <span id="s239">After they took away the leaders of our town which was a very organized plan to just cause chaos and confusion once the leaders were gone.</span> <span id="s240">Then they, I don’t know the sequence, the chronological sequence, but they burnt all our synagogues and they gathered, we had to be there to watch it, every Jewish person.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: …was taken out to watch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: .</span> <span id="s243">.</span> <span id="s244">to watch it.</span> <span id="s245">They burned all our books of prayer, our Torahs, everything.</span> <span id="s246">And they did that in one day.</span> <span id="s247">Then we went home.</span> <span id="s248">Everyone who was fourteen years or older was ordered to work.</span> <span id="s249">In the morning they would gather in a certain place, my sister and my mother.</span> <span id="s250">I mean it was such a stupid, useless….</span> <span id="s251">most of the work was useless.</span> <span id="s252">My mother was digging ditches and things like that.</span> <span id="s253">My sister at that point was also digging ditches.</span> <span id="s254">Then, after a little while, every day there were different decrees and different orders, loudspeakers.</span> <span id="s255">Before the ghetto was organized, one day a van pulled up in front of our house and several Germans came out and they came up to the house and asked where my father’s library was and my father had a rare collection of first edition books and I mean that was his life’s hobby (all the little money we had I think he spent on the rare books) and they knew about it.</span> <span id="s256">How did they know about it?</span> <span id="s257">Somebody told them.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And these were Germans who came?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Germans, yes.</span> <span id="s260">And they cleaned out his library which was stacked.</span> <span id="s261">My father’s library was a place where we had to wash our hands to go in.</span> <span id="s262">We were not allowed to touch the books without his permission.</span> <span id="s263">He really had a fantastic collection.</span> <span id="s264">But anyway they took it all, packed it in boxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: This was after he had been taken way?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes, that was after he had been taken away.</span> <span id="s267">And they gave my mother a receipt.</span> <span id="s268">They thanked the gnaidika frau.</span> <span id="s269">They thanked her yet and they drive off.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: At this point in time not long after the invasion do you remember if there was a differentiation between what we might call like German soldiers and maybe Nazi troops, that kind of thing?</span> <span id="s271">Do you remember that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: They were just German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: They were just Germans to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Do you remember when the Germans actually came into the town, were there people who were happy to see them and not just because they were fascists but maybe against the communists or that kind.</span> <span id="s276">.</span> <span id="s277">?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Oh yes, they were greeting them with flowers, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: There were a lot of people in town doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Oh yes, they were lining the streets with flowers and applauding, yes.</span> <span id="s281">Then after another few days there was an announcement in the middle of the day.</span> <span id="s282">That day nobody went to work because every day my sister and my mother were told to meet at six o’clock in the morning to go to work and they would be herded back in the evening.</span> <span id="s283">That day no work.</span> <span id="s284">I don’t remember but in the morning, maybe ten or eleven o’clock there were loudspeakers going around and announcing the fact that we have to meet in the marketplace within an hour and we can take with us what we want to take, what we can carry with us and that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s285">We grabbed whatever we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Do you remember what you took?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yes, I remember what I took.</span> <span id="s288">I also remember that my mother had enough foresight that we had some gold coins and a few rings.</span> <span id="s289">I mean not much because we were not a family that was very materialistic.</span> <span id="s290">But she sewed into our clothing and to each my sister and myself and her own clothing some of the jewelry into the linings.</span> <span id="s291">She said you never know.</span> <span id="s292">This is for a rainy day.</span> <span id="s293">And so we grabbed the clothing, the coats and whatever.</span> <span id="s294">I don’t remember what else we grabbed but some pillows and blankets and we went to the marketplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: And that was in the center of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yes, and there we were marched into a very poor section of the city, of the little town and we were assigned a place to live.</span> <span id="s297">Our place was one room and we shared it with three other families.</span> <span id="s298">Mostly there were women and older men because the leaders were taken away, about three hundred of them or so.</span> <span id="s299">And that’s the way the ghetto was formed.</span> <span id="s300">The ghetto was surrounded by a high fence that was finished off with barbed wire and there were two gates, one in the front and one in the back.</span> <span id="s301">Everyone who entered had to have a written permit.</span> <span id="s302">In the morning the people who worked were marched out and they were marched back in in the evening.</span> <span id="s303">The place was guarded by Ukrainian militia.</span> <span id="s304">There were very few Germans in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s305">They were on the outside mostly.</span> <span id="s306">That’s when our nightmare really began.</span> <span id="s307">The rations were very meager but if on didn’t work, there was no ration.</span> <span id="s308">So I did not receive a ration and my mother and my sister had to share.</span> <span id="s309">I mean they didn’t have to but they shared their rations with me.</span> <span id="s310">In the beginning people still managed not to give all their material possessions to the Germans so there were some opportunities to barter on the outside and bring in some milk and bread and what have you.</span> <span id="s311">And that’s the way we survived.</span> <span id="s312">My mother and a few other of the women organized a clandestine school for children like myself because we were really left with no supervision and nothing to do and they managed to get some school supplies from the outside by trading rings or gold or whatever people had.</span> <span id="s313">So for a while we had a wonderful school in the evening in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s314">We, I mean kids, really looked forward to it.</span> <span id="s315">They read books and we sang songs and we colored and did all sorts of little stupid things just to occupy our minds but it was very good for us.</span> <span id="s316">But it did not last very long.</span> <span id="s317">After a few months that sort of dissipated and it disappeared because people didn’t have any more to trade for supplies plus the fact that winter set in and there was a lot of cold and illness and starvation and mostly everyone was just concentrating on being able to survive.</span> <span id="s318">In the ghetto we were ordered to wear a Star of David, a yellow patch, on the front of our clothing and on the back of our clothing.</span> <span id="s319">Even within the ghetto you couldn’t move without having that patch.</span> <span id="s320">It was a very difficult thing and even as young as I was I realized that we were separated from the rest of humankind because we were different.</span> <span id="s321">We were not as good as anybody else.</span> <span id="s322">And that’s a very demoralizing thing to live with.</span> <span id="s323">Most of all I think we were preoccupied with being hungry.</span> <span id="s324">Hunger is something very hard to describe.</span> <span id="s325">It’s so paradoxical now.</span> <span id="s326">Everyone is on diets and we say we mustn’t eat so much, cholesterol, what have you.</span> <span id="s327">But real hunger is so painful.</span> <span id="s328">It absorbs or it takes over your entire being.</span> <span id="s329">I don’t remember what I ate yesterday but those years are etched in my memory.</span> <span id="s330">They were indelible.</span> <span id="s331">I remember I was so hungry that I would do anything to get something to eat.</span> <span id="s332">So many times even though I promised my mother I wouldn’t do it, I would sneak out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Did a lot of people do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Many of the children did it because my age or even younger, the ones who didn’t work, there was nothing to do all day long and all you could think of is how hungry you were.</span> <span id="s335">And so we did.</span> <span id="s336">We had an ingenious, as a matter of fact two places in the ghetto where we dug holes and camouflaged them and that was not through the gates so we would go out, sneak out and try and beg or barter for some food and then we’d go back the same way.</span> <span id="s337">It was difficult and we were very obvious.</span> <span id="s338">We were recognized that we were not the same as the people on the outside because our clothing and we were dirty and we were unkempt and all that but we didn’t care, we were so hungry.</span> <span id="s339">And some people on the outside, I say the outside, the Ukrainians and the Poles were good to us.</span> <span id="s340">Others were not.</span> <span id="s341">If you were caught on the outside it was punishable by death.</span> <span id="s342">I did it a lot of times and I was not caught.</span> <span id="s343">I’d bring an egg home to share with my family.</span> <span id="s344">I would bring a slice of bread or something like that.</span> <span id="s345">One time I did go out and I managed to get two eggs for a little ring and I got it out of my clothing and I was getting back and I was almost at the place where I would crawl in the hole and get back and this Ukrainian militia man caught me.</span> <span id="s346">He started yelling at me and he searched me.</span> <span id="s347">I had a dress with puff sleeves and I put one here and one in here.</span> <span id="s348">He found the eggs and he threw them on the sidewalk and made me kneel down and rub my face in the eggs and screamed at me and said get back where you belong and I don’t want to hear from you anymore, I don’t want to see you anymore.</span> <span id="s349">So I guess he was a gentle person because he could have killed me.</span> <span id="s350">He didn’t.</span> <span id="s351">But I didn’t give away the hiding place either.</span> <span id="s352">He marched me to the gate and pushed me in and that was it.</span> <span id="s353">I had scrapes on my face and whatever but that didn’t count.</span> <span id="s354">A few days later as a matter of fact a dear friend of mine, she was about eleven a little older than I at that point, and she went out and she got a loaf of bread and she never made it back to the ghetto and they shot her right on the spot and they dragged her body right into the ghetto and they wouldn’t allow the burial committee, because they had a committee for that, they wouldn’t allow them to bury her for a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: As a warning?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yes, there were so many not warnings but I mean sadistic things.</span> <span id="s357">One time, I mean I could go on for days, one time there were three fellows who made their way from work, young fellows as a matter of fact, and they tried to escape.</span> <span id="s358">And they caught them, three young fellows, I knew one of them, I didn’t know the other two and they gathered us, the market wasn’t part of the ghetto, and they made us watch when they hung them, three and then they let them hang there for several days.</span> <span id="s359">And each day the people who would go out to work had to march around.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Pass by them.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yes, to watch.</span> <span id="s362">These guys would stand with whips and if your face was down they would smack you so you would look up and watch the hangings, kids, everyone.</span> <span id="s363">When we got to the ghetto my mother still continued digging ditches but my sister managed….</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: That was the work that she was doing outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yes, supposedly building roads.</span> <span id="s366">All she was doing was digging ditches, covering one ditch and then digging another ditch and covering the second ditch.</span> <span id="s367">That’s all they would do.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: They were keeping them busy, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s370">But my sister managed to get into an old warehouse.</span> <span id="s371">These were mostly young women who were knitting and crocheting clothing articles for the soldiers on the front.</span> <span id="s372">That was a very good job because it was indoors so that was good.</span> <span id="s373">But I remember one day she was not feeling well.</span> <span id="s374">She couldn’t go to work so it was decided that I would take her place.</span> <span id="s375">So I took her card.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: How old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: About eleven.</span> <span id="s378">But people didn’t care as long as I had the papers.</span> <span id="s379">All the Jewish people knew but nobody would say anything.</span> <span id="s380">So I went there and they showed me where her seat was, the bench and I don’t even remember what she was knitting.</span> <span id="s381">It wasn’t crocheting, it was knitting, a scarf or a sweater.</span> <span id="s382">No, it couldn’t have been a sweater because I wouldn’t know how to do that but a scarf I did know and that was it.</span> <span id="s383">And I started knitting and all of a sudden I felt someone was looking at me, watching me and there was this mean looking German going around and just looking.</span> <span id="s384">And he stood behind me for a while and observed me and apparently I wasn’t doing it fast enough or whatever and he got very angry with me.</span> <span id="s385">He started screaming dunner vetter and started cursing.</span> <span id="s386">And I didn’t answer.</span> <span id="s387">I kept doing what I was doing.</span> <span id="s388">Finally I didn’t please him obviously.</span> <span id="s389">He grabbed the needles out of my hand and stuck one of them in my finger and this is what it is now.</span> <span id="s390">I passed out and that was my experience taking my sister’s place.</span> <span id="s391">In the beginning of the ghetto there was like a little hospital.</span> <span id="s392">And there was still one doctor left.</span> <span id="s393">And I remember his name, Dr. Grossfeld.</span> <span id="s394">He tried to do his best to help people but that again didn’t last long.</span> <span id="s395">Pretty soon there was no more hospital, there were no more supplies and he disappeared.</span> <span id="s396">That’s another thing that was happening in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s397">Every now and then at no specific time for no reason obviously a van would come or a big truck and they would grab people just….</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Just indiscriminately.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Indiscriminately, babies, little kids, old people, anybody.</span> <span id="s400">They would just grab them, put them in the truck.</span> <span id="s401">And you never heard from them again.</span> <span id="s402">Dr, Grossfeld disappeared in one of those actions where they would come and just grab people indiscriminately.</span> <span id="s403">That’s why there was also such a demoralizing feeling.</span> <span id="s404">One never knew, I never knew if I would see my mother and my sister again because these actions could occur during work or after work or before work or anytime.</span> <span id="s405">And that uncertainty too was very, very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: If you weren’t going out and trying to get food or something how did you spend your days in the ghetto while they were at work?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Just sitting or walking with my friends and talking about food.</span> <span id="s408">That was all we talked about.</span> <span id="s409">At that point somebody asked me, well didn’t you talk about your Dad.</span> <span id="s410">He was taken.</span> <span id="s411">Well, my mother was really in retrospect when I think of it a phenomenal person.</span> <span id="s412">She never let us give up hope.</span> <span id="s413">She would always talk about plans -- how we would celebrate when Daddy came home.</span> <span id="s414">I didn’t think it was that unusual but she turned gray overnight when they took my father away.</span> <span id="s415">Overnight.</span> <span id="s416">She woke up -- she was completely gray.</span> <span id="s417">I guess she knew deep in her soul that my father never would come back.</span> <span id="s418">Yet she wouldn’t let us give up hope.</span> <span id="s419">It was a very difficult time.</span> <span id="s420">But again when I look at it from today’s perspective it wasn’t so bad for me because I still had my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s421">At that point their love and our caring for each other compensated for all the physical atrocities, and they were atrocities.</span> <span id="s422">We were cold; we were hungry; we were not well; we were uncertain of out tomorrow.</span> <span id="s423">It was almost as if you lived in suspension from day to day.</span> <span id="s424">And that’s the way we coped.</span> <span id="s425">It was really terrible when you think of coming from a fairly advanced civilized life to living in one room with three other families, sharing the whole house, that was a big -- I think a three story house, we share one bathroom and one kitchen for the entire house.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Do you remember how many people were in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: I would say at least a hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: And you had one bathroom and one kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s430">But anyway life went on.</span> <span id="s431">Winter came and that was very difficult.</span> <span id="s432">There was no heat; there was no warm water.</span> <span id="s433">There was as a matter of fact very little water, even cold water.</span> <span id="s434">People started dying, people disappeared in the actions and in early spring we got a new decree.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: This would be in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yes, early spring of ’42.</span> <span id="s437">We were ordered to move again.</span> <span id="s438">Grab what you can whatever you have and meet in the central place.</span> <span id="s439">That was not the marketplace but in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s440">What happened was that they decided our numbers had dwindled and they didn’t need such a spacious place as we had there and they moved us to a smaller ghetto and that was really one of the shabbiest parts of town.</span> <span id="s441">Nobody lived there for years.</span> <span id="s442">However there was one redeeming feature in that new ghetto.</span> <span id="s443">It was again surrounded by high fence and barbed wire and all these goodies.</span> <span id="s444">But one side of the ghetto was right next to the river and our assigned place to live was in the little shack right on the river and that was not fenced in.</span> <span id="s445">It was really even worse and smaller than the place we lived before but it was on the river and it was important to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Why was that important?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Because it was open and it wasn’t guarded.</span> <span id="s448">My mother was rather happy with that.</span> <span id="s449">When we moved we were again with different people and again there wasn’t enough room to sleep us all on the floor so we had to build like bunks so there were three in a row stacked up.</span> <span id="s450">And then life went on again the way it was before except that there was much more chaos and people became more panicky and even though we had no outside knowledge of what was going on, no radio, no newspaper, no mail, we were completely cut off from the world, the people who were going out to work would gather some information, rumors from the outside.</span> <span id="s451">Somehow rumors begin to float in the ghetto that they were going to kill us all soon.</span> <span id="s452">There were also visible signs.</span> <span id="s453">There were more Ukrainian militia in the ghetto and there were more Germans within the ghetto, too.</span> <span id="s454">They would just march around with their high boots, all dressed up and spit when they’d see you and make you walk on the road not on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s455">And then my mother apparently, I don’t know if she started earlier, but that’s when she shared it with my sister and me, that she started looking for some places where we could hide.</span> <span id="s456">For a long time she said she couldn’t find, make any connection on the outside.</span> <span id="s457">Finally one day in the spring she came back and she was very excited.</span> <span id="s458">And she said she found two places.</span> <span id="s459">She couldn’t find one hiding place for three but she found two.</span> <span id="s460">One farmer was willing to take two people, obviously for money and another one was willing to take one.</span> <span id="s461">And there was her Solomon’s decision -- who will go where.</span> <span id="s462">Well my mother decided since my sister was four years older than I she could manage by herself and my mother and I would go to the second place.</span> <span id="s463">The farmer who agreed to hide my mother and me was known to us.</span> <span id="s464">He was on the other side of the river and before the war my mother would get, many times she would get dairy products, milk and cheese and butter from this farmer’s place and it sounded very logical to me.</span> <span id="s465">How she did connect with them I don’t know but she did.</span> <span id="s466">She was not happy but she was satisfied that she was able to accomplish that.</span> <span id="s467">And we just waited for the time that she would say when we should do it.</span> <span id="s468">And that time came in early August.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Of 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s471">One day in the morning or the night before my sister packed her little bundle.</span> <span id="s472">My mother helped her.</span> <span id="s473">In the morning we said our goodbyes and we were making plans how we’ll meet after this horrible time was over.</span> <span id="s474">I never saw my sister.</span> <span id="s475">She went to work in the morning and that was the last time I saw her.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Was the plan for her to go from work?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: From work to the hiding place, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Do you know where her hiding place was supposed to be where she was going to?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: I know it was right on the outside of our town and then the farmer was supposed to come and pick her up from work.</span> <span id="s480">It was not in Skbelka which was the place my mother and I were going to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Now Skbelka is a different town from….</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Skbelka is a little village.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Across the river from your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Across the river from my town, yeah.</span> <span id="s485">She left.</span> <span id="s486">There were several days my mother didn’t hear anything.</span> <span id="s487">She was satisfied that everything went well.</span> <span id="s488">Then she said the time she’ll let me know when it’s time for us to go.</span> <span id="s489">Meanwhile there was a lot of commotion in the ghetto, many more Germans.</span> <span id="s490">They were coming and going and it was evident that something was going on.</span> <span id="s491">So about a week, I don’t know exactly, but about a week after my sister left she came home one day from work and we ate our meager supper and she told me to put on two of everything that I had the best which wasn’t that much left.</span> <span id="s492">I remember I had some high top shoes that you don’t wear in the summertime but she said put them on.</span> <span id="s493">She packed a little bundle of stuff for herself and a bundle for me.</span> <span id="s494">She kept repeating giving me directions of how to get to the farmer’s place on the other side of the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Were you going to go together or separately?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Together.</span> <span id="s497">At night when it got dark.</span> <span id="s498">You see there were no guards or anything so that was very good.</span> <span id="s499">Otherwise we couldn’t have gotten out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s500">So when it got real dark she took my hand.</span> <span id="s501">We just walked out.</span> <span id="s502">We didn’t say anything to the other people.</span> <span id="s503">But everybody had different plans.</span> <span id="s504">Whoever was left was going their own way and everybody was confused.</span> <span id="s505">There was not a good relationship.</span> <span id="s506">It seemed that nobody knew what to do and everybody wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s507">They tried to hang on to life whatever it cost.</span> <span id="s508">And so we left and we walked into the underbrush, the bulrushes and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Now did you have to climb out of your window or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: You just walked right out and right to the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Walked right out.</span> <span id="s513">That little shack was right on the river.</span> <span id="s514">I guess the Germans felt very secure.</span> <span id="s515">Where would we go?</span> <span id="s516">Into the river?</span> <span id="s517">And so we started walking towards the river and all of a sudden shots rang out.</span> <span id="s518">It was so still.</span> <span id="s519">It was very, very quiet and so we couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s520">The shots were sporadic but it lasted almost all night.</span> <span id="s521">And so we were stuck.</span> <span id="s522">By morning many other people had the same idea as we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: To get down to the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: That’s right, so every….</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: You were still in the underbrush at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: We were in the river but it was it was shallow.</span> <span id="s527">We were covered.</span> <span id="s528">It was thick underbrush, these bulrushes I guess and all sorts of things where you could hide.</span> <span id="s529">But by morning a lot of other people kept going into the river and by that time machine guns were going full blast all the time.</span> <span id="s530">There were these screams and shouts by the Ukrainian militiamen and this is something I can’t get rid of that sound and of that phrase and they kept screaming; village ????</span> <span id="s531">Meaning crawl out Jew, I can see you.</span> <span id="s532">Most of the people came out.</span> <span id="s533">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s534">We stayed there.</span> <span id="s535">That lasted a whole day and by night when night fell the machine guns were going full blast.</span> <span id="s536">We couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s537">And so we stayed there.</span> <span id="s538">I remember my mother gave me that soggy bread that she packed and it tasted awful and she made me eat it.</span> <span id="s539">She said I needed the strength.</span> <span id="s540">We spent another night in the water and the next morning there was fire and there were screams and I heard babies crying and I guess the time they were liquidating the ghetto.</span> <span id="s541">I can’t say the water turned red but it should have because the machine guns were going again full blast all the time and we stayed in that river.</span> <span id="s542">I kept dozing off and I know we stayed in the river for a number of days but I don’t know exactly how many days.</span> <span id="s543">But one moment I opened my eyes and my mother was gone and I really became panic stricken and I tried to rationalize that I probably fell asleep and she had to make her way to the farmer’s place and I would have to find my way there by myself to join her.</span> <span id="s544">And then all of a sudden everything got quiet.</span> <span id="s545">There was no movement, nothing.</span> <span id="s546">And I stayed until dark and then I made my way across the river and I walked.</span> <span id="s547">I remember walking, walking for so long until I came to the farmer’s place, to the barn.</span> <span id="s548">I’m sure I must have been a sight, dirty and wet and the dogs started barking and the farmer came out.</span> <span id="s549">It was just beginning to -- daylight wasn’t -- I mean it was dawn and he came out in his coveralls and I asked him if my mother was there, He said no.</span> <span id="s550">I said well I’ll wait until she comes.</span> <span id="s551">He said what do you mean you’ll wait, you will not wait here.</span> <span id="s552">I said you did agree to keep us here for a time, I didn’t know for how long.</span> <span id="s553">He said well, I changed my mind.</span> <span id="s554">It’s too dangerous.</span> <span id="s555">I said well, just let me stay until my mother comes.</span> <span id="s556">He said you can stay the day, I’ll give you something to eat and at night when it gets dark you better leave or I’ll report you to the authorities.</span> <span id="s557">And I was just bewildered at that point but it was very ironic because I noticed he wore my father’s gold pocket watch with the coveralls</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: That’s what your mother probably paid him….</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: I’m sure that was part of it, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s560">But his wife gave me some soup and some food.</span> <span id="s561">I wasn’t even hungry at that point.</span> <span id="s562">I stayed in the barn until it got dark and they gave me some bread and an apple.</span> <span id="s563">I remember and they told me to leave.</span> <span id="s564">And I was so I guess bewildered and really panic stricken.</span> <span id="s565">I didn’t think straight and I walked on the main street of that village.</span> <span id="s566">Anybody could have seen me or caught me but I was lucky.</span> <span id="s567">God was with me I guess if there is a God.</span> <span id="s568">And I walked all the way on the main street of that village until I came to an open field where we lived.</span> <span id="s569">It’s agrarian, it’s the breadbasket actually of Ukraine so there were these lush wheat fields and I spent the next two days in a field just sitting there like in a stupor.</span> <span id="s570">By that time the bread was gone and the apple was gone and I just didn’t know what to do and my mind refused to give up.</span> <span id="s571">I felt, I don’t know how to say it, but I felt as if I had let my mother down, that I dozed off if she had to leave me and now he’s looking for someplace for me because he refused to give us protection.</span> <span id="s572">And so I decided then that my only way to live or to survive is to find my mother and I felt that I have to go and look for her.</span> <span id="s573">Our area has many forests so I decided then and there -- it was still early fall -- that I have to go from forest to forest until I find her.</span> <span id="s574">And that’s where my odyssey really starts.</span> <span id="s575">I started going from forest to forest and I walked and walked and the illusion when you look at something -- I mean my geography wasn’t any good but I soon learned south and north and east and west.</span> <span id="s576">You look at a forest and it seems it’s so close and you walk and you walk and it’s not there.</span> <span id="s577">I walked all night and I tried to rest in the daytime.</span> <span id="s578">But meanwhile I needed to eat, too.</span> <span id="s579">So I would try to go to little villages in the outskirts and grab something from a garden or something and that’s the way I survived the first months.</span> <span id="s580">The first months were also -- several things happened that were horrible.</span> <span id="s581">In the very beginning I would come across stragglers like myself from different ghettos because apparently Hitler liquidated all the ghettos in our area about the same time.</span> <span id="s582">I would find other people in the forests who were in similar situations.</span> <span id="s583">They were looking for their loved ones, they were looking for friends or whatever.</span> <span id="s584">And so I tried to get information about my family.</span> <span id="s585">Nobody knew anything and I didn’t know anything about theirs.</span> <span id="s586">One time we were on the edge of a forest and there were seven of us from different places.</span> <span id="s587">There was a mother and a baby and two boys and two women.</span> <span id="s588">Anyway there were six other people and we were sitting and trying to get information from one another.</span> <span id="s589">And all of a sudden a bunch of kids from the neighboring village spotted us and they started yelling at us.</span> <span id="s590">“Jews, Jews.”</span> <span id="s591">There was remuneration for reporting a Jew, however small it was.</span> <span id="s592">And they ran back to the village and we realized that soon somebody’s going to come after us.</span> <span id="s593">We were sitting on the edge of a forest.</span> <span id="s594">This was -- there are different kinds of forest -- this one had very little underbrush.</span> <span id="s595">There was no place to hide except climbing up a tree which wasn’t the smartest thing to do.</span> <span id="s596">But there were huge haystacks in the field so we ran to hide in the haystacks and somehow for an unexplainable reason we all ended up in the same haystack, all seven of us.</span> <span id="s597">I don’t know what the haystack looked like on the outside but I’m sure it wasn’t very difficult for them to realize where we were.</span> <span id="s598">Pretty soon we heard voices of the villagers and the kids and they came back, they came there with pitchforks.</span> <span id="s599">They just made a game of it and they kept pushing the pitchforks into the haystacks.</span> <span id="s600">That went on for hours it seems like.</span> <span id="s601">It was in the afternoon, late afternoon.</span> <span id="s602">And pretty soon it was quiet and I heard a lot of commotion around me.</span> <span id="s603">And when it got real quiet I waited, I think it was the middle of the night when I crawled out.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Were there people still in there with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: You were alone at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s608">It was quiet; it was completely quiet and I crawled out and there were six bodies lined up, their clothes gone, their shoes gone, mutilated; couldn’t recognize them except the baby because of the size.</span> <span id="s609">Baby was on the chest of the mother and I was the only one who survived that massacre.</span> <span id="s610">I don’t know why or how.</span> <span id="s611">I don’t know, maybe I was in the middle, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s612">And I stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s613">I didn’t even cover them with leaves or anything.</span> <span id="s614">I just walked away.</span> <span id="s615">There were many incidents like these.</span> <span id="s616">And this went on for three years.</span> <span id="s617">The winters were very difficult because it was not only hunger and thirst, it was cold.</span> <span id="s618">And the snow, footprints would show in the snow.</span> <span id="s619">Dogs would give you away if you go close to a village or to a barn.</span> <span id="s620">I tried, in the winter I tried to go from barn to barn and to keep warm or I would crawl in, they have these, they were not haystacks but where they kept, where the peasants keep the potatoes.</span> <span id="s621">It’s like….</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Potato cellars.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Something like that.</span> <span id="s624">It was just awful.</span> <span id="s625">It was not only the hunger and the cold.</span> <span id="s626">It was being alone and sometimes not hearing a human voice for weeks at a time.</span> <span id="s627">It got so many times where I just didn’t even care but I kept getting my strength from the fact that I had to find my mother.</span> <span id="s628">I never found her.</span> <span id="s629">And then apparently I got very sick and I was like in a little grave covered with leaves in the forest and the Russian soldiers found me there.</span> <span id="s630">I don’t know how long I was there and they took me to some hospitals and they nursed me back to health.</span> <span id="s631">My quest, my search for my mother continued and when the war was over I went back to my home town.</span> <span id="s632">I found that there was one other person who survived.</span> <span id="s633">She was an older woman.</span> <span id="s634">As a matter of fact she is here in America.</span> <span id="s635">She lives in Duluth, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s636">And other than that there were no other survivors.</span> <span id="s637">I mean there were people who made their way illegally during the war but the survivors from the ghetto were just myself and this other woman.</span> <span id="s638">And when I got back to my hometown I didn’t learn much except that somebody denounced my sister and they tortured her and they humiliated her.</span> <span id="s639">They paraded her on the main street in the nude and then they murdered her.</span> <span id="s640">And that must have happened very shortly after she left.</span> <span id="s641">I never found out what happened to my mother and I don’t know for sure what happened to my father.</span> <span id="s642">You know the horrible feeling -- there is nothing tangible for me to mourn.</span> <span id="s643">When someone dies you have a cemetery, you can go and put some flowers and say a prayer.</span> <span id="s644">I have nothing.</span> <span id="s645">And to this day it seems, I know it’s ridiculous but when I walk and when I see someone -- my father was about 6’4” and my mother was almost 6 foot tall --and when I see someone of the build and height, people remind me of my parents.</span> <span id="s646">I have to run in front of them ad look back to see it’s not them.</span> <span id="s647">And then I made my way.</span> <span id="s648">I kept still looking for my mother and everybody said all survivors or people who survived are going to Germany.</span> <span id="s649">So illegally from what became the Soviet Union again I went through Bratislava and Vienna to Germany.</span> <span id="s650">That’s the way all the survivors went.</span> <span id="s651">When we came to Germany there were lots of people, all sorts of people there.</span> <span id="s652">The ironic thing was that these people were survivors like myself, the remnants.</span> <span id="s653">And there were people who were running from the consequences of their collaborating with the Germans and so we all ended up in the same DP camps and that was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s654">But finally they did separate us.</span> <span id="s655">And then even though we, as a survivor and as an orphan at that point, I still had to wait three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: You were about sixteen, seventeen years old at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: About fifteen, yeah and I still had to wait three years to be able to go to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: So you lived in one of these camps for three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: I lived in different camps, yeah.</span> <span id="s660">And the last camp I lived is in Benzheim which is near Stuutgart near Darmstadt and I managed to go to the University of Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s661">How they accepted me is beyond me because I didn’t have any formal education.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Past when the war started, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yeah, but I took some tests and I think they felt sorry for me so they admitted me.</span> <span id="s664">And I went there for two reasons: one, I wanted to get some education and number two, I thought I could get a student’s visa to get to America.</span> <span id="s665">Well, the visa that I did get, the permanent visa came earlier.</span> <span id="s666">But it was three years that I had to wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: So you came to the United States in ’48?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: 1948, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Did you have relatives?</span> <span id="s670">You did, that’s right, your aunts?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s672">There was one aunt, the one in Columbus, Ohio and my father’s sister.</span> <span id="s673">She’s the only one who’s still alive now.</span> <span id="s674">And she took me in.</span> <span id="s675">I came in like on June 25th and I think June 26th she sent me to Central High.</span> <span id="s676">I didn’t speak a word of English and I hated the world and I hated myself but it was the best thing they did, tried to give me some education.</span> <span id="s677">And then I met my husband.</span> <span id="s678">He was called back into the service and guess where his first assignment is?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: That’s right, you’re right.</span> <span id="s681">And I refused to go until I became a citizen, an American citizen.</span> <span id="s682">And then I went back and it was difficult.</span> <span id="s683">That’s my life in a nutshell.</span> <span id="s684">For many years I didn’t speak out.</span> <span id="s685">I told my husband, I told my son but my family, the few who were still alive didn’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s686">And it was difficult for me to talk about it so I didn’t.</span> <span id="s687">But then in 1983 there was a gathering here in Washington and I went to that gathering and something in me, I just sort of awoke and I said I’m ready; I have to tell my story.</span> <span id="s688">I have a mandate.</span> <span id="s689">I felt as if I have a mandate to speak for all these and I call them martyrs not victims who never had a chance.</span> <span id="s690">And I’m their spokesperson.</span> <span id="s691">I have to speak out and tell the story because I don’t want the world to forget.</span> <span id="s692">And yet I sometimes, I haven’t done it in recent months, but I was speaking at the Capital Children’s Museum about a year ago and there was a class of -- I think -- fourth graders which is quite young and you speak in not very severe terms to children that age.</span> <span id="s693">But they came with several chaperones and one of the fathers who was a chaperone came over to me after my presentation and he says Mrs. Skiff….</span> <span id="s694">I says Schiff -- yes, Mrs. Schiff come on, admit, it’s all a figment of your imagination.</span> <span id="s695">So that’s where we are today.</span> <span id="s696">And I feel, I mean that I do have a mission and I try.</span> <span id="s697">It’s not getting any easier for me but I feel that I do have to do it.</span> <span id="s698">I have to tell people what happened and maybe we’ll learn something from our past.</span> <span id="s699">But apparently we haven’t learned very much.</span> <span id="s700">Look what’s going on in Bosnia.</span> <span id="s701">Look what’s going on in Somalia, Sudan, the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s702">People are hungry for power and there’s so much hate in this world.</span> <span id="s703">I don’t know how we can get rid of it -- intolerance, hate, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s704">So this is my dilemma, what I have to live with.</span> <span id="s705">Do you have any questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: No, I think I’m done.</span> <span id="s707">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s709">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">(The tape then resumed)</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Your father was….</span> <span id="s712">?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: One of six and he had five sisters who ended up emigrating to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: All of them emigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s716">I’m not sure if they married here or they married in the old country.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: And moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s719">I think they all came either with getting ready to marry or already married.</span> <span id="s720">He also had a mother.</span> <span id="s721">My grandmother on my father’s side died in 1942 I’m told literally of a broken heart because her baby boy never made it out of Poland.</span> <span id="s722">I know that my father had several doctorates from Switzerland, from the Sorbonne and I’m not sure about Heidelberg but I mean I know he had several advanced degrees from different places.</span> <span id="s723">What was puzzling to me then I understand now.</span> <span id="s724">None of them were from Poland.</span> <span id="s725">In Poland apparently there was a quota and he had to go elsewhere to get his education.</span> <span id="s726">My mother I know was a teacher but she never actively taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: She was trained as a teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yes but I don’t remember her being a full-time teacher.</span> <span id="s729">She was always involved in other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Do you remember how old they were in 1939 or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: My father would have been in his late thirties and my mother would have been in her mid-thirties.</span> <span id="s732">I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: The reason I ask is because one of the few parts of key information that we do need for the ID is a picture and the date of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: I’ll have that and I don’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: We can approximate.</span> <span id="s736">We can say circa a certain time.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: I see, yeah but they were youthful.</span> <span id="s738">My mother came from a village.</span> <span id="s739">She was not from Horochow.</span> <span id="s740">The name of the village was Luczyce.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Luczyce and that’s in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s743">It wasn’t very far from Horochow apparently.</span> <span id="s744">And my grandparents on my mother’s side had a huge farm and we used to go there sometimes in the summer, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Did she have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yes, my mother had two brothers and one sister.</span> <span id="s747">I also remember my great-grandmother on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s748">Miriam was her name, Grandma Miriam.</span> <span id="s749">She was 113 years old when she died.</span> <span id="s750">And I said she had long blond hair.</span> <span id="s751">I’m sure it was long gray hair, but she still had her own hair, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Do you remember where your father was born or where his family was from?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s754">I think they were from that place, from Horochow, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: But they were definitely from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Yes, definitely Poland, yeah.</span> <span id="s757">And his father whom I never met, I never met my father’s parents, but his father apparently died early when my father was young and he was a Hebrew teacher to the Jewish kids in Horochow.</span> <span id="s758">You want to hear something funny?</span> <span id="s759">When I came back in 1988 my husband and I talked what would I find and he tried to warn me not to be disappointed and what have you.</span> <span id="s760">And then it was sort of like an afterthought he said well whatever they did to the town, the ghettos were erased apparently I don’t know I haven’t seen it now, but he said at least the river, you’ll show me the river which was so important in your life.</span> <span id="s761">Guess what?</span> <span id="s762">They diverted the river.</span> <span id="s763">When I asked I said I want to show my husband the river they said no more river, no more river.</span> <span id="s764">The river’s name was Bezimyenna and Bezimyenna in Polish means no name.</span> <span id="s765">And I mean no name and they did away with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: No place either.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: No place, that’s right, yeah.</span> <span id="s768">And another thing was when I told the story of the haystacks to my son and husband they didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s769">Then when we drove to my hometown from Lvov all of a sudden my son gets so excited.</span> <span id="s770">He says, oh look what is that?</span> <span id="s771">I said it’s a haystack.</span> <span id="s772">He said that’s a haystack it looks like a house.</span> <span id="s773">They never had the heart to ask me because here haystacks are pretty small and there they do different kinds but these haystacks were so huge they were almost like a barn, so big.</span> <span id="s774">He says now I understand.</span> <span id="s775">I never had the heart to ask you how could seven people hide in a haystack.</span> <span id="s776">That’s about it.</span></p></body></html>
