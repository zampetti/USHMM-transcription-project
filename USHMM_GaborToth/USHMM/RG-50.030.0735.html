id="s732">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: But if you have a Bürgschaft, that somebody vouches for me that's what it amounts to I could immigrate</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: And

Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: And Belgium and Luxembourg and France eventually.</span> <span id="s746">And he wanted me to come to work for him.</span> <span id="s747">And I came went to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: So you left Germany to help your uncle out in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: What was your uncle's

Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: You went from a very small Jewish community to a city that had a large Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Yeah, correct.</span> <span id="s761">And I was there for, let's say, about a year in all.</span> <span id="s762">But they never gave me a permit to work there in Holland.</span> <span id="s763">Not like you come here and you get a job and that's it.</span> <span id="s764">Because they have to make sure they have no unemployment</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: because too many people came and takes jobs away.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: So you were in Holland for a year and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: They wouldn't let me stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: So were you going to have to go back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: I had to report every week to the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: To the Dutch police?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: The Dutch police.</span> <span id="s773">They were nice people, I mean, not the German people.</span> <span id="s774">And I had to report to them.</span> <span id="s775">And they wanted me to get out, period.</span> <span id="s776">So I said, I don't have an affidavit.</span> <span id="s777">So finally I got an affidavit, I don't know who gave me the affidavit, from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: So what was this affidavit?</span> <span id="s779">What kind of a document was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: To vouch for me, for the person.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: So you had to find somebody else from another country to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s784">Who did you find?</span> <span id="s785">Was it another relative?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: No.</span> <span id="s787">I don't know how that worked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: But you didn't want to go back to Germany after that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Never, never.</span> <span id="s790">I wouldn't have been here today if I would have gone back.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Did you try to convince your parents and others to come with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Well, my parents, I don't think they would have come so easily.</span> <span id="s794">They were born there, you know, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: So you never had this discussion to stay or to go or anything</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Matter of fact, to make it easier for you to understand, when I was 12 years old when I was ten years old, I left my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s799">Ten years old.</span> <span id="s800">I went to high school, the equivalent to high school, in Germany.</span> <span id="s801">By the way, I didn't have that school where I come from.</span> <span id="s802">It was a little village.</span> <span id="s803">So I had to go to the next town to get that education.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: And so you it was kind of already taken as something normal that a child would live away from home?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Many children, many parents who could afford to send them to a better school, that's what it amounts to.</span> <span id="s806">So in a better school, it's the equivalent, I learned English and French at that time, chemistry.</span> <span id="s807">We had all the subjects in that school, but not the school in Luelsfeld.</span> <span id="s808">We were in the school just for four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Did you like studying?</span> <span id="s810">Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: I wasn't crazy about it.</span> <span id="s812">I was not a bad student, but I didn't study enough, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: So it didn't it was okay, but nothing special?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Nothing special.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: I didn't want to make a career out of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Well, that's kind of young to have to make a mind up about what kind of career.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: I went to that school when I was ten years old already.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: The Realschule?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Yeah, from from public school.</span> <span id="s821">That's what you do in Germany, in Europe I guess.</span> <span id="s822">You go up to go to public school for four years and then you go to a high school.</span> <span id="s823">But little villages where I come from, they didn't have that high school</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: which is the equivalent to a Realschule, what we called them.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: So when you were in Holland now and it's 1938 and 1939</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Not '39.</span> <span id="s828">I was in Holland only less than a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Less than a year?</span> <span id="s830">So</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: They wouldn't give me permission to work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: So how were you successful in leaving Holland?</span> <span id="s833">How did you manage to go from Holland, the Netherlands to I take it you came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: How did you manage that?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Well, I number one, I had to get an affidavit.</span> <span id="s837">You couldn't come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: I see, that's where you got the affidavit?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: You could come here as visitor, but you cannot come here and stay for for a year or two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">So someone gave me an affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: And where did you come?</span> <span id="s842">To which place did you come?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: When you left Holland where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: To New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Did the person who gave you the affidavit live in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: I never met that person.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: You never met them?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s850">But somebody gave me I really, I don't know how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: So when you</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: I had relatives here, but they wouldn't give me an affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s855">I had sorry to say, my mother had two brothers here and a sister.</span> <span id="s856">They didn't do anything for the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Sadly.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Well, it's kind of bitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: So did they help you when you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Nothing, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A:

that.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: And in November '38, I came here to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: So where did you live when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: In New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: I mean, but</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Yeah, but who did you live with?</span> <span id="s875">Did you live with a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: With a family.</span> <span id="s877">Fortunately, I got a job after a week.</span></p> <p><span

my thought here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">The German family that wrote to you, did they describe how your parents disappeared?</span> <span id="s1022">I mean</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: did they describe the circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: I didn't ask them, okay, because I knew.</span> <span id="s1026">They didn't have to write

not know what happens to people, to realize that your family has been taken away and you are so far away.</span> <span id="s1046">I can't imagine what kind of a feeling that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: The sad part is, I had family here and they wouldn't give me an affidavit to bring them out.</span> <span id="s1048">Terrible.</span> <span id="s1049">That's the terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Did someone give your brother an affidavit eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: My brother, he he went to Holland.</span> <span id="s1052">How he got

id="s1065">A: Well, I don't know too much about it, but we corresponded.</span> <span id="s1066">But he went to Sweden then later on.</span> <span id="s1067">He was in a kibbutz, like.</span> <span id="s1068">Do you know what a kibbutz is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s1070">So he went to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: No, he didn't go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1072">But the last time I I heard or I know about, he went from Holland to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: And then what happened with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: He died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: During the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: No later, later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s1078">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: He was in the kibbutz like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: In Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: In Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: There was a kibbutz in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: It's like a kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Like a kibbutz?</span> <span id="s1085">And then</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: An organization, a Jewish organization let's call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: And</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: And they probably sent him to Sweden to save the children</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1092">And in Sweden when after did he survive the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1095">Did he ever come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Did

was in Sweden.</span> <span id="s1101">But that's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1103">I see.</span> <span id="s1104">So he didn't die in the Holocaust, but he nevertheless died after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1106">I imagine.</span> <span id="s1107">Because he was in Sweden, he was not in Germany anymore.</span> <span id="s1108">But my sister died in Germany.</span> <span id="s1109">She never got out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1110">But the fact is that, I'm sorry I have to say that, I personally couldn't do very much.</span> <span id="s1111">And I depended on my family.</span> <span id="s1112">I had uncles and aunts.</span> <span id="s1113">They didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1114">That's the sad part.</span> <span id="s1115">That's the sad part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">I have an uncle here he came here, let's say, about 1880.</span> <span id="s1117">He was at that time maybe 70 years old.</span> <span id="s1118">And he could have give me an affidavit for my family.</span> <span id="s1119">They didn't do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: That's very bitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: That's the sad part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: That's very sad, very sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1125">Hang on just a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">(Brief pause.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Absolute sense.</span> <span id="s1128">I want to talk about your army service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: So were you drafted or did you</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Drafted.</span></p> <p><span

in the 28th Infantry.</span> <span id="s1136">First I was drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: I don't know exactly I can tell you what year when I think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: And I had my basic training.</span> <span id="s1141">And after three, four months I wents to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: In 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Way before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Way before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1146">Before the invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: So where did you go, to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: First to England, yeah, then Scotland and then to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Tell me what was your what was your job within within</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: I was actually in the infantry.</span> <span id="s1151">I was trained to be in the infantry and also trained to be an interrogator, because I speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: I was going to ask about that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: So what happened is, one day they needed German speaking interrogators.</span> <span id="s1154">And I ended up in the military government.</span> <span id="s1155">That was my luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: And this is</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Otherwise I wouldn't be here today.</span> <span id="s1158">In the division.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Still in front.</span> <span id="s1161">And I interrogated mostly civilians at that time.</span> <span id="s1162">It's it's I was with the 28th Infantry Division.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: So the 28th Infantry, did that did they take part of the invasion of Normandy</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: No, not them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: or did they come later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: I personally came in like I can tell you about it, but just let me think like five days after the invasion, I came in already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: The American army just had the beachhead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: And I was like, what do you call it, ready to be assigned to a unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Got it, okay.</span> <span id="s1172">You were in some ways in reserve?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: A replacement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: But I had a lot of training in this country before I went overseas.</span> <span id="s1176">I went to army school, intelligence school and in Camp Ritchie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Oh, you went to Camp Ritchie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: You heard about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Of course I've heard about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: How do you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Because I have interviewed some people who are Ritchie boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: So you're a Ritchie boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Yeah, the 13th class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: The 13th class?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: So when the army realized that you spoke German like a native</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: That's why I went to Ritchie, because I spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1190">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: I was inducted into the army and had my basic training and then they saw I speak German, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: So they gave me different training.</span> <span id="s1194">After after my</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Basic training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: basic training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: What was that different training?</span> <span id="s1198">What did it consist of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: In Ritchie what kind of</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Training it was, uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Army of occupation.</span> <span id="s1202">They called it intelligence camp.</span> <span id="s1203">I don't know how intelligent you had to be.</span> <span id="s1204">But it's different from from the usually the usual training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1206">But then you met probably with lots of other people</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: who were in the same situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: It was mostly Europeans in Ritchie at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: We had to speak German otherwise they wouldn't send you there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: They had in mind that I would be used in the army of occupation, being either interrogator or being intelligence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1215">And you ended up being an interrogator?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: An interrogator.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: I would say an interrogator, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Do you remember the very first person you interrogated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Not the first very not the very first well, I had mostly to do with civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: It's not I was also trained to interrogate prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1223">That actually that was the first thing they taught me, how to interrogate there was a special code Camp Ritchie, you heard about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: That was strictly for German speaking people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: So tell me, how do you have to what are some of the rules in interrogating a prisoner of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: There are no rules.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: What kind of training did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Get the information that you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: All a solder had to do, like I was told, in case we get captured, name, rank and serial number.</span> <span id="s1232">That's all you have to give, no other information.</span> <span id="s1233">Name, rank and serial number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: And when you captured a German solder, he also just had to give name, rank and serial number and your job was to find out more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1236">So you tried to get information.</span> <span id="s1237">But I didn't do that very long.</span> <span id="s1238">Because when I was with the 28th Infantry division</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: who came in, in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Yes, that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: You know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: When we hit Germany, they needed very badly German speaking people.</span> <span id="s1247">And I was with the military government then in the division.</span> <span id="s1248">I dealt mostly with civilians then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: And do you ever have do you have any memories of some of the interrogations that you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Yeah, I still remember the German people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: I tried to get information from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: Were you successful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Sometimes.</span> <span id="s1255">Well, most of the time, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: If you talk right they answered you, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: What is the right way to talk?</span> <span id="s1259">I'm trying to find out your method.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Well, the method is I was trained for that.</span> <span id="s1261">I was in Camp Ritchie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: How to interrogate people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: I mean, are you pleasant or are you distant?</span> <span id="s1265">Do you act with authority and fear or do you use sweetness?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Well, the way I look at it now, the experience I had, they were glad when the war was over.</span> <span id="s1267">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: The people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: The people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: So that helped.</span> <span id="s1272">So if you talk right, you got some information out of them.</span> <span id="s1273">But there were two ways there was interrogating prisoners of war or civilians.</span> <span id="s1274">I had experience with both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: How were they different?</span> <span id="s1276">How did how were they different from each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: You have no __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: At one time sent some soldiers.</span> <span id="s1280">They were arrogant.</span> <span id="s1281">And some were glad the war was over and they gave you information.</span> <span id="s1282">And then you interrogate civilians is a different story.</span> <span id="s1283">Because I worked first with the infantry intelligence department and later I was with the I dealt with civilians.</span> <span id="s1284">You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1286">Were civilians easier to interrogate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1289">Did you go when you were part of the military government, where were you based, in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Where I was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Where were you based?</span> <span id="s1292">Where did they take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: I was with the division.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1295">Where did the division go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: Division through Normandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Um hum.</span> <span id="s1298">And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Through France, through Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: What part?</span> <span id="s1301">What parts of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Central Germany I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: So it would be like Frankfurt and Cologne</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1305">Not far from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1306">Near Mannheim.</span> <span id="s1307">Ever head of Mannheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Oh, yeah, Mannheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: You're not German, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: No, but I have been there.</span> <span id="s1311">I lived there.</span> <span id="s1312">So I know Mannheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: You've been in Mannheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Um hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: I stayed near Mannheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Near Mannheim, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: The town was I have it written down, but I can't think of it right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Did you get to Luelsfeld when you were there as part of the military government?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Not at that time.</span> <span id="s1320">But after the war, my wife and I, we took a trip to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: But that's many years later, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: So at that time</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: I would have liked to go and I didn't want to like to go.</span> <span id="s1325">Because what would I do
