id="s11">October 11, 1994</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Abstract Saul Sorrin, born on New York’s Lower East Side in 1919, had a physical exemption from World War II military service, and worked instead in the Treasury Department’s Procurement Division.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">In early 1946, the fluent Yiddish-speaker began working as a supply officer for UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) in German DP camps, beginning with Neu Freimann where the health conditions were “desperate.”</span> <span id="s14">When Eisenhower visited, the 25-year-old Sorrin told him, “General, the situation's tragic.”</span> <span id="s15">Soon Sorrin helped create health programs, feeding programs, and schools.</span> <span id="s16">“Right away, the Jews were energetic.</span> <span id="s17">They set up everything they needed…” Sorrin became director of Neu Freimann in 1947, when it had 3,000-3,500 residents.</span> <span id="s18">Later he became director of Foehrenwald, one of the biggest DP camps in Germany, designed for about 3,000 people, but housing perhaps 4,000.</span> <span id="s19">He left Foehrenwald in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">He discusses the many difficulties Jewish refugees faced in emigrating, including General Patton’s declaration that to emigrate to the U.S. from the American zones of Germany and Austria, refugees had to prove that they had arrived before December 22, 1945; and the national origin quotas for Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians; in addition to the restrictive quotas for United States and Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">He divulges that in some cases, documents were destroyed and new ones were fabricated to surmount such barriers.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">He says he still is troubled by some decisions he made, like not turning in a survivor who had bought a car illegally and crashed into people, possibly killing one.</span> <span id="s23">Sorrin helped the man escape to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Sorrin did not intervene in the thriving black markets because he felt Jews’ participation was justified as the only way to provide the means for their survival and support.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">He calls the refugees “the phoenix rising out of the ashes of European Jewry.</span> <span id="s26">And they have gone on to produce great things, both here and in Israel.”</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s28">01:00:11 Q: Saul, can you tell me your full name, where you were born and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: My name is Saul, S-a-u-l, Sorrin, S-o-r-r-I-n.</span> <span id="s30">I was born in New York in 1919.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: What month?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: July 6.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: 1919.</span> <span id="s34">Where in New York, in Manhattan?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Born in Manhattan, the Lower East Side of Manhattan.</span> <span id="s36">And we moved to the Bronx, up the socio-economic scale.</span> <span id="s37">And I went to school in the Bronx, DeWitt Clinton High School, and I went to City College.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Anything which did not equip me to make a living.</span> <span id="s40">And then toward the end of the depression, I got out of school and I had to get a job.</span> <span id="s41">And the federal government was then in the process of expanding its operations that were -- Roosevelt was seeing, you know, trouble in Europe.</span> <span id="s42">And I got a job in the Treasury Department.</span> <span id="s43">This is a long time ago.</span> <span id="s44">I recall that I was in the Procurement Division, that is, they were buying paper and supplies and other materials to be used by the federal government and by the military.</span> <span id="s45">And it was an important job.</span> <span id="s46">I mean, we kept -- I remember going to the White House even, in about 1942 or something to talk to them about some paper they had ordered, etc.</span> <span id="s47">I did have a sense that I was doing something important, you know.</span> <span id="s48">But I was exempted from the military because I had some physical problem which I've never really gotten through.</span> <span id="s49">It's not life threatening, but it was enough to get me exempted.</span> <span id="s50">And then, you know, when the war was over</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Let me interrupt for a moment.</span> <span id="s52">What did you know about what was going on in Europe in terms of national security?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Not very much, really.</span> <span id="s54">We knew that the Jews were being mistreated and there were massacres.</span> <span id="s55">That information reached us through the mass media.</span> <span id="s56">And we knew it was a war for democracy to survive.</span> <span id="s57">And it had this Jewish component, which I felt very strongly about.</span> <span id="s58">And so at the end of the war -- and I don't remember the name of the people -- it was somebody who worked for a congressman in Washington who approached me and said, you know, UNRRA is looking for people to work in their program.</span> <span id="s59">UNRRA had two programs after the war.</span> <span id="s60">They had a program for refugees, and they had a program for countries which had suffered at the hands of the Axis.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">01:03:22 There the country programs were designed to ship goods, needed goods, to strengthen -- to begin the pouring of life blood into the economy.</span> <span id="s62">There was a big program in Poland.</span> <span id="s63">Some in Italy.</span> <span id="s64">None in Germany, and, of course, the very big one in the Far East, China.</span> <span id="s65">Which really attracted me, you know.</span> <span id="s66">I wanted to go someplace, and I asked for China.</span> <span id="s67">And then, one day, I was at the University of Maryland after I had been accepted -- and it was sort of touch and go, because of my health problems with the military, but I made it.</span> <span id="s68">And I was now at the University of Maryland getting briefed, educated on the whole program.</span> <span id="s69">And somebody from UNRRA headquarters came over to speak to us.</span> <span id="s70">And he said to me, "Why are you going to China?"</span> <span id="s71">I really didn't have a good reason, you know, except I wanted to see that part of the world.</span> <span id="s72">And he said, "You come from New York.</span> <span id="s73">Do you speak Yiddish?"</span> <span id="s74">and I said, "Yes, I do speak Yiddish."</span> <span id="s75">And he said, “You must go -- our people -- he was Jewish, too -- are in desperate trouble over there.”</span> <span id="s76">And they were, you know, after the war.</span> <span id="s77">And we need Yiddish speaking staff.</span> <span id="s78">And I want you to go."</span> <span id="s79">And I went.</span> <span id="s80">And I was trained for just about a month.</span> <span id="s81">We had seminars and all the rest, and I took off.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: What was the preparation like?</span> <span id="s83">What was the training like?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Well, first of all, they told us structurally what the program was about, who supplied what, and what was the chain of responsibility.</span> <span id="s85">In Germany, the principal responsibility for refugee programs lay with the military.</span> <span id="s86">And they were very unwilling participants in the program.</span> <span id="s87">They didn’t want -- "We're not welfare workers.</span> <span id="s88">And we’re not --” You know, some of the things which were being said.</span> <span id="s89">They had no taste for it.</span> <span id="s90">Refugees are a terrible pain in the behind in getting in the way of the movement of troops and materiel, and they just distract the military from its principal mission.</span> <span id="s91">And so now UNRRA was designated to work as the agency of the occupation forces in Germany, Italy, Austria, running these camps.</span> <span id="s92">Staffed UNRRA by international personnel, people -- United Nations agency, therefore, the people were drawn from Western powers, you know, France, the Benelux countries.</span> <span id="s93">We had a Swiss on my team, and Americans.</span> <span id="s94">And so we learned about that chain of command and some of the problems.</span> <span id="s95">By the way, they really didn't know too much about the problems.</span> <span id="s96">There was a great dissociation between what was happening in the field and what these people knew in the national headquarters.</span> <span id="s97">And that’s a constant difficulty.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">01:06:26 And then we took off.</span> <span id="s99">And we -- I remember I went on the Gripsholm.</span> <span id="s100">I was put aboard with a group of UNRRA people.</span> <span id="s101">Gripsholm, which had been during the war, an exchange ship for diplomats.</span> <span id="s102">It is not the present-day Gripsholm.</span> <span id="s103">There are new Gripsholms.</span> <span id="s104">And this Gripsholm was a real rat trap.</span> <span id="s105">During the war, it had exchanged diplomatic people, Japanese from the United States to Japan, etc., and reverse.</span> <span id="s106">And I spent ten seasick days on the Gripsholm.</span> <span id="s107">And I think we came into Cherbourg, and from Cherbourg by train to Paris.</span> <span id="s108">And there we stayed in Paris for two or three weeks getting more briefings.</span> <span id="s109">And then came the day they say, "You are off.”</span> <span id="s110">And I was sent by train to Munich on the Orient-Express, but it was not that fabulous Orient-Express.</span> <span id="s111">And in Munich, I was immediately whisked as the supply officer for UNRRA team, I think it was 560 if I am not mistaken, outside of Munich.</span> <span id="s112">Shall I go on?</span> <span id="s113">There was a camp there which had just been established, I think in December of '45.</span> <span id="s114">I arrived about February, something like that.</span> <span id="s115">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s116">In the early part of the year.</span> <span id="s117">It was the winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: '46.</span> <span id="s120">And a camp had been established by General McNarney, who was Eisenhower's successor as the SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allies Expeditionary Force) commander or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">01:08:06 And they had evacuated a whole zedlum (ph) silek?</span> <span id="s122">of settlements of small bungalows, I think about 250 such houses, which had been sold by the Nazis, built by the Nazis, for German workers, defense industry workers and their families.</span> <span id="s123">Two or three, bed -- two bedrooms apiece, and downstairs was a kitchen.</span> <span id="s124">It was in the 1930s style.</span> <span id="s125">There was no gas in these stoves.</span> <span id="s126">For example, the stoves were fed with, and the heat was created by, use of firewood.</span> <span id="s127">But it was nice.</span> <span id="s128">I mean, until we began to stuff the people who were coming in, into these places.</span> <span id="s129">More than -- you would say in each house, if you had 250 houses, you had four or five people.</span> <span id="s130">That would have been maybe 1200 people, but we had as much as 3,000 at one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">01:09:05 And it was beyond its capacity.</span> <span id="s132">When I arrived, and the Jews who came into that camp were infiltrees (infiltrators?)</span> <span id="s133">.</span> <span id="s134">They were not, by and large, survivors of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s135">It is estimated, I have read estimates, figures -- accurate figures are very, very difficult to come by.</span> <span id="s136">There was so much disorganization.</span> <span id="s137">-- that there were no more than 35,000 Jewish concentration camp survivors in Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s138">And this camp in Munich was very close to Dachau.</span> <span id="s139">And most, many of the survivors that we got were Dachau survivors.</span> <span id="s140">The Germans had tried to destroy -- there was a plan to march all of the haftling, the concentration camp people from Dachau to a quarry, a big quarry, down south near the Austrian border, which, I understand, had been prepared with explosives.</span> <span id="s141">And to march them into this quarry and then blow the whole thing up.</span> <span id="s142">But the 3rd Army was approaching and at a certain critical moment, the Germans decided they weren't going to risk the arrival of the Americans, and they simply dropped the whole project.</span> <span id="s143">Left the Jews where they were standing and took off.</span> <span id="s144">And, Dachau had also what is described as “aussencommandos” that is, branches of Dachau where Jews were sent in various villages and towns in what’s called Oberbayern, that is Southern Bavaria, to work as farmers on farmland under the supervision of the owners.</span> <span id="s145">Or in some cases, in factories, or some cases, directly in Dachau.</span> <span id="s146">But, so we had a lot of Jews scattered over the landscape between Munich and the Austrian border.</span> <span id="s147">Little towns like Mittenwalde, which is a famous violin town, had Jews working there in various jobs.</span> <span id="s148">And they suffered, you know, they were not fed well.</span> <span id="s149">They were beaten, whatever.</span> <span id="s150">But it was not an extermination center.</span> <span id="s151">So, those people came into Munich, a lot of them, and many of them, stayed in those towns.</span> <span id="s152">And we would reach out to them from our headquarters in Munich.</span> <span id="s153">Anyway, this camp was just recently set up, and most of the people who were infiltrees who came in from Poland, from eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s154">Jews who may have, who were mostly in the Soviet Union during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">01:12:00 And I think Jewish agencies, important Jewish agencies, like the JDC (Joint Distribution Committee) and HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), and the Jewish Agency for Palestine became voluntary agencies under the supervision of UNRRA, who were to assign some of their people, welfare workers and others to our teams, to help the international personnel administer the camp and to provide services.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Were there non‑Jews when you arrived in these areas?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: In your camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Not in our camps.</span> <span id="s160">There were a tremendous number of Polish nationals, Ukrainian nationals, Balts, and other, Yugoslavs.</span> <span id="s161">And their place, origins in Germany are in a shadow.</span> <span id="s162">Nobody is quite sure what they came from, but we suspect that many of them came voluntarily.</span> <span id="s163">Many of the Ukrainians, for example, had fought in Vlasov's army, that is a Ukrainian army which had deserted Angren and totally deserted.</span> <span id="s164">The Russians threw off the uniforms and fought in SS uniforms against the Soviet Union, against Soviet military.</span> <span id="s165">But a lot of war criminals, we suspect, people who had some culpability, who were involved in concentration camps and extermination camps, who came, and many who were not.</span> <span id="s166">Many who were simple farm workers or whatever.</span> <span id="s167">There were many Russian -- former Russian POWs in there.</span> <span id="s168">And they had suffered, also, very badly at the hands of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s169">I attended a Dachau trial of SS who were accused of exterminating literally thousands of Russian prisoners of war in Dachau, and in other places.</span> <span id="s170">Well, anyway, they all came.</span> <span id="s171">We're faced with the problem of integrating these people into a camp, setting up a camp.</span> <span id="s172">That was a big problem.</span> <span id="s173">We had emptied all these houses.</span> <span id="s174">The Germans had taken everything they could carry, I think, in the line of bedding and other personal supplies, but they had to leave their furniture.</span> <span id="s175">They were taken out, I think, in 24 hours in the winter.</span> <span id="s176">So it was a tough time for them.</span> <span id="s177">And we had a staff, we had to find people among the Jews to staff the camp.</span> <span id="s178">There were some school‑age children brought in.</span> <span id="s179">We had to find doctors, nurses, cooks, stores, office people, who would distribute food and clothing, blankets.</span> <span id="s180">And we had to assign, we had to create a system of assigning a lot of people to rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">01:15:01 And nobody was satisfied because it was so packed and so jammed.</span> <span id="s182">We had really violated health standards and all of the rest to get them in, but the situation was desperate.</span> <span id="s183">Snow on the ground, and people starving, very hungry, but we got them all in.</span> <span id="s184">We staffed the camp.</span> <span id="s185">We had very devoted international personnel.</span> <span id="s186">We had a number of women who worked as welfare workers, Jewish women.</span> <span id="s187">We had a big problem with Jewish women because they became so emotional -- so emotionally involved with the problems in their interviews with Jews, what had happened to them, and where had they been, and what had happened, what they had seen -- that we were rotating people.</span> <span id="s188">Sometimes people couldn't stay more than a couple of months.</span> <span id="s189">It was a very, very difficult time emotionally for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Were there men who were coming in doing the same thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yeah, we had men, also, but I remember that the welfare workers were women.</span> <span id="s192">I told you, I recall one was Rose Wasserman, a wonderful lady who came from Cleveland.</span> <span id="s193">And she was with, I think, it’s Cuyahoga County Courts.</span> <span id="s194">She was the chief welfare officer in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s195">And she did a wonderful job with UNRRA -- UNRRA , yeah.</span> <span id="s196">And then we had to provide food.</span> <span id="s197">Now food, under an agreement made with the military, was a responsibility of the Germans to provide food, and also to provide money, marks, to pay workers.</span> <span id="s198">We had salaried workers.</span> <span id="s199">The problem with the marks was that they were worthless.</span> <span id="s200">I think, from a nominal value, I think of four to the dollar before the war.</span> <span id="s201">A few years later, they were selling for 400 a dollar, and they went up to 4000 a dollar.</span> <span id="s202">They were really worthless.</span> <span id="s203">But it was important to get them on the worker's list because you did get better -- more calories.</span> <span id="s204">We had a specific, specified calorie count that we fed the families.</span> <span id="s205">And so you got more calories.</span> <span id="s206">And then there were some other privileges for people who were working.</span> <span id="s207">We had a limited number of jobs, you know, a place like Neu Freimann, with about 2,500 people.</span> <span id="s208">We maybe had 200 or 300, maybe 400 people.</span> <span id="s209">There were people who would load wood for firewood, cooks, stores of various sorts.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Who got most of the jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Jews in the camps.</span> <span id="s212">The people who applied for them.</span> <span id="s213">There were many Jews who didn't want to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Also, I’m talking about -- were men primarily given the jobs?</span> <span id="s215">Older men, younger men –</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yeah no, yeah, well, the jobs went based on the gender attached to the job.</span> <span id="s217">That is, a krankenschwester was a kranken nurse, you know, was a woman.</span> <span id="s218">We had some nurses.</span> <span id="s219">You know, you'd never see a man who was a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">01:18:07 All of the doctors were men, the dentists were men, one or two exceptions.</span> <span id="s221">And the women were clerks.</span> <span id="s222">They helped people fill out their DP documents.</span> <span id="s223">I will talk about those in a moment.</span> <span id="s224">And there were people who did various clerical tasks, and that was where women could produce, could contribute.</span> <span id="s225">We also had a relegazerampt we called it, a religious office, and some of these houses were reserved for synagogues in the camp.</span> <span id="s226">They're small houses, and so we had Rusisha shul, Russian shul, and a Poylissha shul, a Polish synagogue.</span> <span id="s227">There were two or three, four maybe different branches, and they were separate.</span> <span id="s228">And people knew where they wanted to go.</span> <span id="s229">We had to find rabbis, by the way.</span> <span id="s230">I had an American assistant who went around looking for people with beards, and they were designated rabbis.</span> <span id="s231">These Jews, by the way, the Hasidic Jewish community, and we had some that came, were clearly identifiable.</span> <span id="s232">We wondered, you know, how they’d made it through the war, but they were in the Soviet Union during the war.</span> <span id="s233">And then we began the distribution of food.</span> <span id="s234">We set up community kitchens.</span> <span id="s235">Now, these houses had stoves so that people could cook, take their food and cook as they pleased.</span> <span id="s236">And then we had a community kitchen where we had people come who were single, who had no family, to eat their three meals a day.</span> <span id="s237">We had to supply the military with a Table of Organization for the camp for the purpose of salaries.</span> <span id="s238">We had to justify all the salaries.</span> <span id="s239">And the religious ampt I remember, gave us a problem because they needed people to erect an eruv -- this wire around, you know about it, around the town during the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s240">I remember this colonel saying, "What is that?</span> <span id="s241">What kind of wire around the town?</span> <span id="s242">What are you talking about?"</span> <span id="s243">Ultimately, when we built a mikvah in that camp.</span> <span id="s244">I remember I had to explain the meaning of a mikvah and why they had people who did certain personal -- I am not sure what happens in a mikvah, but they rendered personal service, clipping toenails.</span> <span id="s245">Someone was kidding me, he said, takes lint out of the navels, whatever.</span> <span id="s246">They were all paid for.</span> <span id="s247">And, then, we had some special food habits, you know, for the Hassidim needed kosher food.</span> <span id="s248">And we had a real problem with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">01:21:01 I don't remember how we solved it.</span> <span id="s250">I think we went to a butcher, a German place where meat was slaughtered, and we had a -- what do you call the guy who does the slaughtering?</span> <span id="s251">I am forgetting my Yiddish, you know -- who slaughters the animals.</span> <span id="s252">And he was a hasid.</span> <span id="s253">And the meat was taken, carefully handled.</span> <span id="s254">Milk for lactating mothers, those women who were pregnant, the cows had to be milked under supervision by a rabbi.</span> <span id="s255">They assigned somebody to go and sit in the barn with the -- we had to provide transportation.</span> <span id="s256">It was a very complex thing.</span> <span id="s257">We had a lot of illness.</span> <span id="s258">We had a lot of people with tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s259">They were taken out, weaned out, and we sent them to -- we had a tuberculosis center in Bad Reichenhall, nearby.</span> <span id="s260">We had medical examinations.</span> <span id="s261">There was a big problem with bad teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Now, we issued DP cards, identity cards.</span> <span id="s263">So they had an identity card from the United Nations with a thumb print, no pictures, a finger print.</span> <span id="s264">There was also a DP card kept in our files.</span> <span id="s265">Now these people arrived mostly after December and when they arrived, they were not aware that the Truman Directive, signed in early December, I think, which allocated a large number of visa numbers.</span> <span id="s266">The military was very wary about infiltrees, about the increasing number of people coming from eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s267">And the British also understood that the larger the number of Jewish displaced persons in the American zones, that the greater the pressure would be on them in the United Nations and in other forums to relinquish the mandate in Palestine or part of the mandate for the Jews, or to admit more Jews into Palestine.</span> <span id="s268">Something they did not wish to do.</span> <span id="s269">So the Americans, who didn't want DPs generally, General Patton was in command in that area, and he was not terribly sympathetic to the Jews, tried to shut them off from coming by, declaring that in order to emigrate from the American zones of Germany and Austria to the United States, you had to show that you had arrived in the zone prior to December 22, 1945.</span> <span id="s270">And so, these people who came in January, they were not aware of this, you know.</span> <span id="s271">And they gave accurately that they had arrived in January or early February and that their place of birth was in Poland, a place not favored by the realities of the quota system, the national origins quota system.</span> <span id="s272">They would have to sit in Europe for years before they got out.</span> <span id="s273">But they were being truthful, and they said who they were and when they came and all of the rest.</span> <span id="s274">Later on, they found to their unhappiness, that disqualified them.</span> <span id="s275">They said, "Had I known, I would have told them I came here earlier."</span> <span id="s276">We thought about it, by the way I’ve used the metaphor, you know, it was December 22 which they made the cutoff date, that on the 25th where Christmas was celebrated, there was no room in the inn, our inn, for Jews.</span> <span id="s277">And anyway, we got them all into the camp and we created our own health programs, under the supervision of international medical people, and our own feeding programs, our own schools.</span> <span id="s278">Right away, the Jews were energetic.</span> <span id="s279">They set up everything they needed, cultural programs, newspapers began to sprout.</span> <span id="s280">Now, prior to that time, there was a question early on at the end of the war, how would these people be housed, the refugees.</span> <span id="s281">They were, after all, multi‑national – Poles and Ukrainians and Jews.</span> <span id="s282">And a Jew was nominally -- most of them were nominally Polish, Polish nationals.</span> <span id="s283">And so therefore, they would take a whole bunch of Poles, Polish speaking people, and put them, try to put them into one camp, into one area, under one administration.</span> <span id="s284">But, you know, the Jews did not consider themselves Polish anymore.</span> <span id="s285">They would not opt in a legal sense, for that identity.</span> <span id="s286">And so, they -- I am not quite sure how it happened -- but they all declared themselves, I think maybe for immigration purposes, as staatenlos that is, stateless, or as Jews.</span> <span id="s287">Now, there was a great deal of jockeying around over how the Jews would be housed, whether they would be housed among the people, as I say, of the countries in which they were born, which they didn't want.</span> <span id="s288">American‑Jewish leaders were also, I think, playing a role in that thing.</span> <span id="s289">And they wanted all of the Jews together, which was a wise thing to happen.</span> <span id="s290">And ultimately, the military gave in.</span> <span id="s291">For them, you know, looking directly at it, or for the United Nations looking directly at it, these were Poles or Latvians or Lithuanians.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">01:27:05 But, no, they did not consider themselves that.</span> <span id="s293">And so they all became of one national group.</span> <span id="s294">And in all of the DP camps in which Jews lived after the war, they lived together, surrounded by a fence, whose perimeter was often patrolled by Jewish police.</span> <span id="s295">We organized the police force.</span> <span id="s296">We had a police force in that camp alone of over 100 people.</span> <span id="s297">They were not armed police, but they were Jews who wore armbands declaring that they were policemen, and they patrolled the perimeters of the camp.</span> <span id="s298">Conditions were so bad in the camps.</span> <span id="s299">At this time, I was the supply officer for Neu Freimann camp and all of the small little camps I mentioned before, which had sprung loose from the Dachau concentration camp.</span> <span id="s300">And also for all “free living” Jews in the city of Munich.</span> <span id="s301">In effect, I became ultimately sort of the mayor of the Jewish community of Munich.</span> <span id="s302">And they would come to our camp.</span> <span id="s303">They were Polish Jews, mostly.</span> <span id="s304">There were very few German Jews remaining in -- just a very few that I ran across, who would come to us for food, identity papers certifying that they were stateless, or that they had been persecutees, and therefore, entitled to certain privileges as to immigration, food, medical care, clothing, whatever.</span> <span id="s305">And as I say, conditions were so bad that in the United States, the White House was hearing about it.</span> <span id="s306">There was a lot of anguish, a lot of anger, and so Eisenhower was sent by Truman to Europe to investigate.</span> <span id="s307">There had been a report by the Harrison Committee which had stressed some of these inadequacies, but Eisenhower went over to look, he said, for himself.</span> <span id="s308">And what happened was, a week before he arrived in Munich, the director of our camps quit.</span> <span id="s309">He wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s310">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s311">Anyway, and so I was called by UNRRA saying would I make myself ready to receive the General and to brief him on whatever questions he wanted to be raised.</span> <span id="s312">And sure enough, two or three days before the arrival of the General, all of the security people, military security people, came and checked the whole road running down to the city of Munich out to this camp.</span> <span id="s313">For security purposes, they emptied buildings with windows overlooking the road, the whole business.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">01:30:05 I was very impressed, of course.</span> <span id="s315">And on that day, we were laid on and out came the General, riding in -- it had to be either Goering or Hitler's car -- a great big Mercedes.</span> <span id="s316">And he was accompanied, of course, by six or eight general officers.</span> <span id="s317">You were going to ask something?</span> <span id="s318">McNarney was among them, Huebner.</span> <span id="s319">I remember those names.</span> <span id="s320">And they came into the camp and they spent -- I greeted them as he stepped out of the car.</span> <span id="s321">He spent about three or four hours, I guess, in the camp.</span> <span id="s322">And we talked about supplies.</span> <span id="s323">He went and looked at it.</span> <span id="s324">We talked about housing; he went and looked at the housing.</span> <span id="s325">He talked to the people.</span> <span id="s326">A great big sign had been hung by the Jews over the entry to the camp, "Welcome General Eisenhower."</span> <span id="s327">And I was impressed.</span> <span id="s328">He’s a very stern‑looking guy, very impressive you know, with all of those stars.</span> <span id="s329">And some of his staff took notes on what I was saying.</span> <span id="s330">And I think it had an impact, my own contribution to that, because within a matter of maybe a month, things began to improve.</span> <span id="s331">We were getting things that we were not getting before.</span> <span id="s332">Of course, the White House had played its role, but Eisenhower coming over there was the basis for making whatever changes were necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: How honestly could you talk to him?</span> <span id="s334">I mean, here you are, a 25‑year‑old young man?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Well, I could talk pretty honestly.</span> <span id="s336">I just told him, “General, the situation's tragic.</span> <span id="s337">We have people, you know, stuffed into a room together in such numbers -- the people are sick, their ability to resist disease is down.</span> <span id="s338">And so, we are going to have typhus.</span> <span id="s339">We are going to have this, and we’re going to have that.</span> <span id="s340">They are not getting adequate food.”</span> <span id="s341">And he listened carefully.</span> <span id="s342">I remember, though, some funny scenes.</span> <span id="s343">We took him into a school, a Yiddish school.</span> <span id="s344">And the guy who was the director of that school was a fellow who then went to Baltimore.</span> <span id="s345">His name was Spector.</span> <span id="s346">Mr. Spector was a teacher, and both he and his wife were dedicated.</span> <span id="s347">He and his wife were wonderfully dedicated people.</span> <span id="s348">They set up the school with teachers, and the children, they got paper and they got pencils.</span> <span id="s349">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s350">I told you “IMCA” YMCA supplied us with writing pads for the Jewish children.</span> <span id="s351">And he had coached the children to sing “The Star Spangled Banner”, in just learning the lines.</span> <span id="s352">They didn't know what they were saying.</span> <span id="s353">And Eisenhower stood there, you know, his hat under his arm, and he listened as they sang.</span> <span id="s354">And when it was finished, I was stunned.</span> <span id="s355">I didn't tell Spector until much later.</span> <span id="s356">He said to me, "What are they singing?"</span> <span id="s357">He didn't recognize it at all.</span> <span id="s358">I wouldn't spoil what these children had done.</span> <span id="s359">There was also some confusion.</span> <span id="s360">He walked into a synagogue, I remember, and he took his hat off, you know.</span> <span id="s361">And McNarney leaned over him and says, "General, put your hat on.</span> <span id="s362">You're in a synagogue."</span> <span id="s363">It was a pleasant visit.</span> <span id="s364">The Jews were extremely welcoming to him, applauded.</span> <span id="s365">He was the great hero who had liberated them.</span> <span id="s366">And it was a wonderful day.</span> <span id="s367">He is a stern‑looking guy, you know.</span> <span id="s368">He has his dignity, very little joking around with him, my impression.</span> <span id="s369">I wouldn't want to cross him, based on what I saw.</span> <span id="s370">Anyway, the visit went well.</span> <span id="s371">And as a result, as a matter of fact, in about a couple of weeks, I was notified that I had been appointed director to replace the departed director.</span> <span id="s372">And, that situation went on for, I think, until 1947 when we learned that UNRRA was going to be terminated, go out of business.</span> <span id="s373">And that it was to be replaced by an agency known as the PCIRO, Preparatory Committee or Commission for the International Refugee Organization.</span> <span id="s374">And that a new modus operandi was to take place.</span> <span id="s375">That is, many of the international personnel on our team were to be terminated.</span> <span id="s376">And their responsibilities were to be turned over to indigenous staff-people, essentially, the Jews themselves, in the camps.</span> <span id="s377">And there would be no camp director for a given camp; he would be replaced by a camp chairman.</span> <span id="s378">And he had a sort of a cabinet with him for food, and welfare and housing and security and whatever.</span> <span id="s379">And that the Jews were to pick their own people.</span> <span id="s380">And they did so with elections in the camps.</span> <span id="s381">And it was marvelously organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Can we not get to 1947 first, can we stay …</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: What happened to you when you became director?</span> <span id="s385">You became director of this camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Of this camp and --</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: -- and the subsidiaries?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: -- the subsidiaries and the Jews of Munich.</span> <span id="s389">That is, I was responsible for meeting their needs.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: How many people, then, are you responsible for?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: I think at that point it got to be about 3,000, 3,500, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">01:36:02 And what I would do is move around through the various installations under my supervision and meet with their chairman and find out what their problems were.</span> <span id="s393">Maybe once a week, I would be in this place, drive around.</span> <span id="s394">I would drive a car, go around and meet with them.</span> <span id="s395">But my office was in the Zedlum, (ph) in the Neu Freimann.</span> <span id="s396">I supervised all of the programs and saw how they went and people reported to me.</span> <span id="s397">And I reported to my superiors.</span> <span id="s398">Life was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s399">People were trying to get out, and they soon found that the national origins quota defeated that.</span> <span id="s400">There was illegal immigration to Palestine.</span> <span id="s401">And by the way, I recall now that I had very good part of the people on the Exodus who came from the Neu Freimann camp and from nearby camps.</span> <span id="s402">You know, the Exodus was caught and returned to Ger -- Bremerhaven and the Jews were forced off, you know, by British, I think it was British soldiers, with the water hoses.</span> <span id="s403">I got, and I lost -- a lot of things happened to me -- a little book written by children who had been on the Exodus and describing their experiences.</span> <span id="s404">And they dedicated it to me, to undzer khaver director.</span> <span id="s405">I don't know what happened to it.</span> <span id="s406">There are things I have lost I regret so.</span> <span id="s407">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s408">And we had to receive other people all the time.</span> <span id="s409">There was constant tension.</span> <span id="s410">The camps had been closed to infiltrees, and we were taking them in.</span> <span id="s411">One of the ways we were able to take them in was when a group of people went illegally to Palestine, their DP cards were left behind.</span> <span id="s412">When you leave the camp, you are supposed to turn them in or to do something.</span> <span id="s413">They were turned over to the camp committee, who used them for the purpose of supplying other infiltrees coming to the camp.</span> <span id="s414">The UNRRA people told me that apparently we have a very low death rate in our camps because the population remained fairly static.</span> <span id="s415">Actually, they were leaving, but they were being exchanged with other people.</span> <span id="s416">And then other ways had to be found to avoid the restrictive immigration policies of the United States and also of the Canadians.</span> <span id="s417">And the documentation, which was on file in our offices, on each of the Jews, prevented them if they had to get their DP records to present to the consul generals.</span> <span id="s418">(?)</span></p> <p><span id="s419">01:39:08 They would reveal that they had arrived in the zone after December ‘45, or that they were born in Poland or in Latvia or Lithuania, and therefore they had to wait for a long time for their quota numbers.</span> <span id="s420">Some people had a lot of scars on their lungs, lesions which were healed, but it was not known exactly when the tuberculosis had been active, and they were prevented.</span> <span id="s421">So, if you presented an accurate x‑ray, you could be out of luck.</span> <span id="s422">It was a desperate struggle because everything militated against them -- people who had suffered so.</span> <span id="s423">I remember this was said to me, very often, I am going to say it in Yiddish, “Mir haben gemeynt az zey velen uns trogen oyf de pletzes.”</span> <span id="s424">We thought that when we got out that we would be carried around on the shoulders of the Allies, of the United States, that we would be heroes for having made it through this terrible experience.</span> <span id="s425">Instead, they’re finding all kinds of ways to keep us out.</span> <span id="s426">It was a terrible disillusion.</span> <span id="s427">And while there was a division in the Jewish community of survivors about where they would go, some said they would go nowhere but to Palestine.</span> <span id="s428">And of course, they knew what was in Palestine.</span> <span id="s429">It was illegal, first of all.</span> <span id="s430">If you managed to get in, you would be housed in a tent city on some mud flat someplace.</span> <span id="s431">No jobs.</span> <span id="s432">It was a terrible scene.</span> <span id="s433">Nevertheless, they wished to go there.</span> <span id="s434">But others wished to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s435">They had family in the United States.</span> <span id="s436">People who would make space for them and had jobs for them.</span> <span id="s437">And they saw their future there.</span> <span id="s438">So there was a constant tension within the DP, Jewish DP community on that score.</span> <span id="s439">They tried to invest the Jews with the kind of Zionist patriotism, but they were all patriotic about the establishment of the state.</span> <span id="s440">But many of them wished to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s441">A commission was sent over by the United Nations.</span> <span id="s442">And they came to our camp to talk to Jews about where they wished to go.</span> <span id="s443">The committee was made up of five diplomats, one of whom was from India before it was divided.</span> <span id="s444">I am trying to remember which country became a Muslim country, maybe Pakistan.</span> <span id="s445">And he was very hostile.</span> <span id="s446">And he tried to probe, you know, "Where do wish to go?"</span> <span id="s447">And they picked some people at random from in the camp to come before them.</span> <span id="s448">There was a big audience in the room listening to this procedure.</span> <span id="s449">And I was the interpreter.</span> <span id="s450">And the first guy they picked to be examined was the brother of a business associate of my own father, who asked me to get him out.</span> <span id="s451">He had arrived with his wife and two children.</span> <span id="s452">They had been in the Soviet Union, and he was desperate to get to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">01:42:16 I didn't know what would happen, but they took care of it themselves.</span> <span id="s454">That is, the guy asked, after checking his personal history, said to him, "Now, where do you wish to go?"</span> <span id="s455">And he proudly spoke up, “Vu alle yiddin forn” he said "Where all Jews wish to go, to Eretz Yisrael.”</span> <span id="s456">And a great cheer broke out.</span> <span id="s457">Now, he left a week later for the United States, so there was a solidarity in support of the claim of Jews for Palestine, for Eretz Yisrael, and for the right of Jews to be allowed to emigrate there.</span> <span id="s458">There was 100 percent solidarity, but a lot of people had made decisions about their lives, about where they wished to go.</span> <span id="s459">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Was there pressure on these people to not go to the United States, not only to not say it --</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Well, there was some pressure.</span> <span id="s462">Yeah, the Jewish Agency was working in the camps, and they did a valuable job.</span> <span id="s463">And the whole leadership of the Jewish community was Zionist in its orientation.</span> <span id="s464">So that when, for example, camp administrations were made up, as I’ve indicated, they were elected on Zionist lists.</span> <span id="s465">Liste eyns, or tsvey – list one, two.</span> <span id="s466">And on that basis, these represented various Zionist political parties.</span> <span id="s467">There was a strong, and I think the Jewish Agency and the leaders, Ben Gurion and the rest understood, the value of the DP, Jewish DP community and the experience which the Jews had had -- if you want to call it a value.</span> <span id="s468">But they understood the meaning of it, for bringing pressure against the British and the United States to partition Palestine or to create a Jewish entity, and to allow the Jews to leave.</span> <span id="s469">And for the United Nations, by the way, ultimately when they did go legally, the UN paid all fares for transportation costs for Jewish refugees travelling to whatever destination they were going to.</span> <span id="s470">So there was a unity within the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s471">And they would never allow it to be understood outside of our community.</span> <span id="s472">There was a unity that Israel or the Jewish state would have to be created.</span> <span id="s473">It would have to be supported.</span> <span id="s474">And those Jews, and there were many who wished to go to Palestine, and no place else, would be permitted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">01:45:03 And there were efforts made.</span> <span id="s476">You know there was by the way, also a mobilization effort on the part of the Zionist community, that is, to mobilize Jews, young men and women to serve in the Haganah.</span> <span id="s477">They were trained in our camps.</span> <span id="s478">They would be marching around and training with broomsticks as bayonets, rifles.</span> <span id="s479">So they were preparing themselves.</span> <span id="s480">But as I say, you had this tension in the community which is, I think, something which happens today, again, you have in the Soviet Union some of the same things, that is, Israel accuses HIAS, Jewish agencies, of talking Jews into not going to Israel, which is absolutely untrue.</span> <span id="s481">Jews know where they wish to go.</span> <span id="s482">And my own feeling is they should go where they wish to go, where they will be happy.</span> <span id="s483">So we had that immigration.</span> <span id="s484">Then we had the illegal immigration.</span> <span id="s485">I was, I think, the only Jewish camp director I know of in Munich.</span> <span id="s486">There was one or two before me in these camps, but they had left.</span> <span id="s487">So a lot of efforts by the Jewish Agency or by the JDC centered on me.</span> <span id="s488">They knew they could come to me and they could speak frankly, and that I was part of the whole apparatus.</span> <span id="s489">So I remember supplying blankets and gasoline and other things, illegally -- to people on the move illegally, to France or to Italy.</span> <span id="s490">Mostly I knew about France, to go to Marseille for immigration.</span> <span id="s491">I think the Exodus people took that route, they went to Marseille.</span> <span id="s492">And I was asked by them, by the Sochnut or by the Brichah to accompany a transport of, I don't remember, maybe 500 Jews who had been gathered up to go to Marseille and to board boats there, and to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s493">And so I sat there in the uniform in the lead car.</span> <span id="s494">And I had some phony document saying that these people are authorized to travel, in transit, through France, to Marseille on their way, I think, to Uruguay or Peru, one of those South American countries.</span> <span id="s495">And I carried a group visa with me.</span> <span id="s496">It was done also on onion skin paper, which had names listed and birth dates and they absolutely did not conform to the birth dates or to the people in this transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">01:48:00 And we drove through the French zone, me in the front, and we got to Mulhouse -- Muehlhausen, that’s in Alsace.</span> <span id="s498">And we presented this transit visa.</span> <span id="s499">Well, first of all, the visa from the Uruguayans or one of those Latin American -- they were all fraudulent, provided by some consul, vice consul in Paris, maybe.</span> <span id="s500">And he had been paid something to do that, I think.</span> <span id="s501">And we presented the visas and the transit letter to the French gendarmes at the border.</span> <span id="s502">In the meantime, two of these guys working from Palestine Brichah, I could see them going around the back of the booth, with two big cartons, and I knew there were cigarettes in those cartons.</span> <span id="s503">The French, also, were badly in need of cigarettes, and deposited it there.</span> <span id="s504">And then, we were saluted through, and we came into Mulhouse, and we went to the town square, and by God, I was stunned.</span> <span id="s505">There was the mayor of Mulhouse, all dressed up with his red sash across his chest, and women, volunteers, greeted us and provided hot coffee, cocoa or something, and some bread.</span> <span id="s506">Some other food for the people to eat.</span> <span id="s507">We were treated to a speech by the mayor.</span> <span id="s508">Wishing us, wishing our people, a good life in Uruguay or Paraguay or whatever.</span> <span id="s509">It was a very nice ceremony.</span> <span id="s510">And I got back in my car, drove back over the border to Munich.</span> <span id="s511">It's a very -- I did that twice, but only once did the Muehlhausen mayor come out for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Did you have any hesitancy doing this?</span> <span id="s513">You were after all….</span> <span id="s514">.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: No.</span> <span id="s516">I - I did have -- first of all, I am trying to remember whether there were some restrictions on my movement into the French zone.</span> <span id="s517">I was crossing a zone line.</span> <span id="s518">But I remember that if – if -- somebody had picked this up, they would ask me where did they get the gasoline and the blankets which were military.</span> <span id="s519">The trucks were military.</span> <span id="s520">They were UNRRA trucks.</span> <span id="s521">They had it on the front.</span> <span id="s522">So there was a risk.</span> <span id="s523">They were my trucks in my motor pool.</span> <span id="s524">Yes, there was a risk.</span> <span id="s525">I could have -- I don't know what would have happened.</span> <span id="s526">I imagine, based on some other things I have seen over there, they would have cut me.</span> <span id="s527">I would have been dismissed from UNRRA, and they would have sent me immediately home.</span> <span id="s528">I don't know whether there would have been any criminal charges, because the military is very leery about getting themselves involved.</span> <span id="s529">It's a public relations problem.</span> <span id="s530">So, it would have been tough on me.</span> <span id="s531">I would have been shipped back home, and in some disgrace, not with Jews, I guess.</span> <span id="s532">So there was some risk.</span> <span id="s533">But it's one of my fondest memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">01:51:17 Q: What made you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Well, I was Jewish, and my sense of solidarity with my people, with the people, you know, around me.</span> <span id="s536">I was profoundly sympathetic.</span> <span id="s537">Then, well, there was also the question of how do you get around the Americans.</span> <span id="s538">Now, Jews would apply for immigration to the United States, and when they would come in there, with their documentation, there was a consul general in Munich, with their DP cards and their records.</span> <span id="s539">It would show they had arrived after December 22nd of '45, and they were automatically eliminated.</span> <span id="s540">I am a little unclear about the immigration laws at the time.</span> <span id="s541">Eventually, a new law was passed in '48, I guess, also very controversial, and very stacked against Jewish DPs and the countries where they came from.</span> <span id="s542">But it still remained that they had to be in the zone before December 22, 1945 in order to be eligible.</span> <span id="s543">So what would happen was, Jews would come in and say, in effect, to one of my staff people, “I came here after, and Poland is no good for me.</span> <span id="s544">Here I have this paper saying that I was born in Dresden or Breslau.”</span> <span id="s545">German cities were favored, because during the four, five years of the war, Germans were prohibited from emigrating to the United States, or after, as ex‑enemy nationals.</span> <span id="s546">And so all of these unused numbers -- and Germans had a very big quota for the United States under that national origins quota.</span> <span id="s547">These numbers -- Germans who could not use these quota numbers had to stay, and the numbers were saved up and they were turned over to the DPs by the Truman Directive to be used.</span> <span id="s548">All of these used up numbers going back to 1939, or thereabouts.</span> <span id="s549">So that relieved some of the problems.</span> <span id="s550">But the point was, they still operated under the national origins quota, very restrictive.</span> <span id="s551">And under the requirement that they be in a zone December 22nd of 1945.</span> <span id="s552">So what happened was such people, if they came and asked for help -- I am going to be very candid here -- we would take out their documents and tear up the document.</span> <span id="s553">Nobody knew the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">01:54:07 I was in control of these things.</span> <span id="s555">And put a new DP card in the file.</span> <span id="s556">And I remember in one office, we had a guy who was an expert at aging these documents.</span> <span id="s557">Of course, they had to be about two or three years old, you know, so if you saw a fresh, the paper was lousy, if you saw a fresh white paper, you knew it was fresh.</span> <span id="s558">So we had them stacked on radiators to age them a little bit.</span> <span id="s559">And then they would bring these papers in, and it didn't take long before the consul generals, they are pretty bright people, understood that there was something not kosher about these.</span> <span id="s560">A lot of people came in, declared they were born in Germany, but had no German accent.</span> <span id="s561">You know, they spoke strong Yiddish, and there was some cockamamie story made up to cover that.</span> <span id="s562">And then they were asked finally to find some document that you told somebody, and it was true, if you were in a concentration camp, and you didn't keep your birth certificate in Auschwitz or Buchenwald or whatever.</span> <span id="s563">They would say write away to the city in which you were born.</span> <span id="s564">And many of them said they were born in German cities, East Germany where it could not be checked.</span> <span id="s565">Russians were occupying East Germany.</span> <span id="s566">And well, first, they would say “Look, I didn't have any papers.</span> <span id="s567">And I have written, here is a copy of a registered letter which I sent to some East German city.”</span> <span id="s568">There were all sorts of means to get out, to get around these restrictive laws or regulations.</span> <span id="s569">The German quota was an important one.</span> <span id="s570">Sometimes they would go up to some small town someplace, where it was learned there were some birth certificates or birth documents for people who had died already.</span> <span id="s571">And they would get these, maybe having to bribe an official.</span> <span id="s572">But it was a survival struggle.</span> <span id="s573">And we countenanced it all.</span> <span id="s574">Some years ago, I met a guy had been the U.S. Ambassador to Cairo in the State Department.</span> <span id="s575">He came to Milwaukee to make a speech, and I sat next to him at a lunch.</span> <span id="s576">I recognized his name, and when his bio was read, I remembered he was vice consul in Munich, way back when I was there.</span> <span id="s577">I told him, "I don't know whether you remember me, but I used to come in and plead the case that the people were unjustly denied.</span> <span id="s578">I would come down to see them."</span> <span id="s579">And he said he remembered me.</span> <span id="s580">He said, “I know that you had” -- what he called “a document factory” out there, near one of these camps nearby.’</span> <span id="s581">I said, "We probably did."</span> <span id="s582">I mean, they were good people, but they were operating according to the regulations.</span> <span id="s583">By the way, when I spoke to him, he was an Assistant Secretary of State, yeah, Assistant Secretary of State.</span> <span id="s584">Very well known man.</span> <span id="s585">I don't recall his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s587">02:00:13 Well, we went through a very difficult year 1946 and to 1947, when UNRRA decided to go out of business, and be replaced by the IRO (International Refugee Organization).</span> <span id="s588">At the same time, the decision was made to evacuate Neu Freimann, and that became one of the most difficult parts of my whole year, my whole stay in this job.</span> <span id="s589">Neu Freimann was considered a privileged camp because it was right on the border of Munich, and therefore, easily accessible to Jewish agencies which had to visit, dealing with various problems, a lot with immigration.</span> <span id="s590">We had the USNA, the United Service for New Americans, which, I think, was like a JDC operation, which processed applications.</span> <span id="s591">We did, too, but they did, I think, a lot of the processing of applications to the United States.</span> <span id="s592">The HIAS was there.</span> <span id="s593">There was the Jewish Agency, JAFP, Jewish Agency for Palestine, with Chaim Hoffman as its director.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">And there was an extensive black market in the city.</span> <span id="s595">I want to speak about the black market because that played a very important role, not only in assuring the Jews a way of sustaining themselves -- not only Jews, but anybody.</span> <span id="s596">I mean, it was open to all.</span> <span id="s597">The black market was not a Jewish making, it was a creation of the German merchants who were backed up with merchandise, which they were beginning to produce.</span> <span id="s598">And they could not sell and make anything unless they sold it on the black market, because the controlled price in German marks, what you would get would be zero.</span> <span id="s599">I could get four opera seats for two cigarettes.</span> <span id="s600">Opera seats had a nominal value of, let’s say, 20 marks apiece.</span> <span id="s601">So the black market was really a creation of the economic system.</span> <span id="s602">That has to be understood.</span> <span id="s603">And Jews could not live on the 2,000 calories a person, especially what those calories were made of.</span> <span id="s604">They were made of potatoes and starchy haferflocken, which was a German term for a wheat, a cereal of some sort, dried eggs, dried skim milk.</span> <span id="s605">Jews could not eat dried eggs.</span> <span id="s606">That stuff used to lie and rot in warehouses.</span> <span id="s607">One day we discovered, by the way, that a couple of tons of dried skim milk had disappeared from one of the camps.</span> <span id="s608">It didn't bother us a bit -- except we wanted to know what happened to it -- because the Jews did not enjoy, or take, or drink dried skimmed milk.</span> <span id="s609">But what happened was, about two or three weeks or thereabouts later, we saw wandering around the camps Jews carrying a box slung over shoulder shouting "Lody!</span> <span id="s610">Lody!"</span> <span id="s611">Lody is ice cream in Polish.</span> <span id="s612">They had used this milk to manufacture ice cream pops, or something, and they were selling them on the streets.</span> <span id="s613">I recall that.</span> <span id="s614">That's very funny, the creativity of our folk.</span> <span id="s615">But, as I say, the packages which came from the JDC, the Jewish relief agencies, were the real waluta, the real currency, of the DP camps.</span> <span id="s616">The cigarettes in them, which sold for, I think, a dollar a package -- I mean, in the United States were 15 cents or something, or maybe more.</span> <span id="s617">I mean, $10 a carton, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">02:04:09 Coffee, marmalade, jam, fat in cans, other things which were priceless.</span> <span id="s619">They became the basis upon which many Jews -- they could trade them for meat, for bread, for other things to sustain their family.</span> <span id="s620">And so going into Munich became very important.</span> <span id="s621">People had access either by the few buses which were running, or by trucks which they could hitch a ride on to go and do their business.</span> <span id="s622">There was a famous street in Munich.</span> <span id="s623">I want to mention it, called Mohl Strasse, M‑o‑h‑l.</span> <span id="s624">I’ve been back there, by the way.</span> <span id="s625">I once went back some years later to buy some Meissen Rosenthal china for my mother‑in‑law.</span> <span id="s626">But it was a great center of black market currency dealings.</span> <span id="s627">Jews were carrying currency during the war.</span> <span id="s628">Those who were not in concentrations camps, those who were in hiding, sewed into the linings of their clothing.</span> <span id="s629">They were carrying many things in order to enable themselves to live, if they ever made it through.</span> <span id="s630">And they went to exchange these dollars for various things, whatever, or to trade them up, in some way to change them.</span> <span id="s631">All currencies into national hard currencies were being traded there.</span> <span id="s632">Not German marks, but Swiss francs and British pounds and American dollars.</span> <span id="s633">And they were subject to raids all the time.</span> <span id="s634">The military would come pouncing down on them because the military declared its intention to protect the German economy or to rebuild the German economy, and these black market operations were, they felt, destructive of the economy.</span> <span id="s635">I think that’s subject to some doubt, but that’s what they said.</span> <span id="s636">But in any case, when the announcement was made that there would be an evacuation, there were great protests, and it took a long, long time for us to move these people out to other camps.</span> <span id="s637">Some attrition, some people went away to Palestine, others emigrated.</span> <span id="s638">Nevertheless, we were accused of using all of the terminology of the wartime period of deportations, of Aus Zeslac (?)</span> <span id="s639">or whatever they used.</span> <span id="s640">Just like, about the ghettos, Jews were being forced, against their will, out of these camps.</span> <span id="s641">Neu Freimann, as I say, was a favored camp in that setting.</span> <span id="s642">And ultimately, it was closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">And I was then asked to take over Foehrenwald, which was one of the biggest DP camps in Germany at the time.</span> <span id="s644">I think, well, it was designed for about 3,000 people.</span> <span id="s645">There must have been more, I don't recall the figures, 4,000.</span> <span id="s646">And Foehrenwald was actually two or three installations.</span> <span id="s647">One was about 30 miles south of Munich toward the Austrian border where Innsbruck was situated.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">02:07:30 There was Foehrenwald itself, which had been a work camp for German labor.</span> <span id="s649">And then there was a place called Geretsried, a small camp which housed about 1,000 people.</span> <span id="s650">It became, ultimately, by the way, I believe the first legal exit point for immigration to Israel when it became legal.</span> <span id="s651">People were processed there for health, their teeth, and the rest, for our paperwork.</span> <span id="s652">And they would move from Geretsried, whose name was changed to Camp Negev, because it looked like it was in the Negev, a really forsaken area in the woods someplace.</span> <span id="s653">That’s where a lot of military training took place.</span> <span id="s654">We were, by the way, being watched by air, by airplane by the intelligence people trying to find evidence that military training was going on in these camps, and it was.</span> <span id="s655">And then there was a children's center nearby which brought children, picked up in various ways by khappers, grabbers, who went around Czechoslovakia and Poland finding Jewish children that they had heard about.</span> <span id="s656">I am sure that in some cases in their haste to get out, there were some non‑Jewish orphans among them, who are now living someplace in Israel.</span> <span id="s657">But finally, we closed it down, and we moved all of our operations to Foehrenwald and to other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">The great movement of Jews I forgot to mention.</span> <span id="s659">You know, after the war, through maybe about March of '46, there was movement of Jews, but it was on a small, relatively small scale, infiltration.</span> <span id="s660">But as you know, I don't remember the precise month, maybe May, I think, or thereabouts in 1946, a pogrom took place in Kielce, where there was a trumped‑up charge that Jews were baking the blood of a Polish kid who had disappeared into the matzahs, which were being consumed for Passover.</span> <span id="s661">I think that was it.</span> <span id="s662">Ultimately, the Polish government -- this is not known -- punished very severely those people responsible for this.</span> <span id="s663">There were 46 Jews killed.</span> <span id="s664">Right wing anti-Semitic movements in Poland were accused of having fomented this thing, and there may be something to that.</span> <span id="s665">But the Kielce program came like an enormous shock over the whole of the Eastern European community, such as it was at the time after the war, especially in Poland.</span> <span id="s666">And then we, in the west, in Germany and in Austria, mostly in Germany, experienced a strong wave, I don't know how many thousands.</span> <span id="s667">They say, I have heard 80,000 or so people came, all of a sudden, into West Germany into camps which had been declared closed by the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">02:10:46 And we had to accommodate them in some way.</span> <span id="s669">And it was done contrary to regulations and the rest of it.</span> <span id="s670">And I received, I remember, trainloads of people -- no, no.</span> <span id="s671">In Munich, we got a lot of these people at Neu Freimann, then in Foehrenwald.</span> <span id="s672">And then there was a constant movement of Jews.</span> <span id="s673">I think the next relatively major movement was as a result of the Berlin airlift.</span> <span id="s674">That was in 1947, I think.</span> <span id="s675">(Berlin Airlift was June 24, 1948-May 12, 1949).</span> <span id="s676">We got Jews, they had cleared the DP camps, Jewish DP camps in Berlin.</span> <span id="s677">And each time that happened, it was a tremendous amount of effort, how to fit them in.</span> <span id="s678">We would have to put them in among others and maybe among other families.</span> <span id="s679">A terrible crisis was precipitated anytime that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">I have to speak about this children's center which we had.</span> <span id="s681">I remember the man's name was Merrin (ph).</span> <span id="s682">I have a picture of that Jewish center.</span> <span id="s683">And he wrote me a message on the back of the picture when I left, I guess.</span> <span id="s684">It was a beautiful place, an installation.</span> <span id="s685">I am not sure what it was for before, but we kept kids in there.</span> <span id="s686">And the Brichah would bring in a load of kids, children maybe six, eight years old, something like that, who had been concealed.</span> <span id="s687">I don't know where they had been, but they would bring them in.</span> <span id="s688">And maybe 30 or 40 at a time would come.</span> <span id="s689">And then, a quarrel broke out within the Jewish community between the Jewish Agency, I guess, and the various elements in the Jewish Agency and the central committee.</span> <span id="s690">They were all going to Palestine, these kids, it was decided.</span> <span id="s691">But what was very important, under whose auspices?</span> <span id="s692">And so a rotating system was set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">02:13:00 This is very funny.</span> <span id="s694">I think I am remembering it carefully.</span> <span id="s695">We agreed to it.</span> <span id="s696">We just wanted to get the kids out.</span> <span id="s697">They would stay in this place, this group, let's say 20 or 30 kids, would stay for a month or six weeks.</span> <span id="s698">And during that six weeks, the camp would be run by, let us say, the Mapai socialist party, Ben-Gurion’s party, or Mapam, the more leftist.</span> <span id="s699">And they were being taught and trained according to the philosophy of that branch of Zionism.</span> <span id="s700">And they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s701">I mean, these kids absorbed it like water.</span> <span id="s702">And we had the right wingers, the ‘revisionistim’ they were called, and they were singing revisionist songs and marching up and down in the military style of the revisionists.</span> <span id="s703">And that's the way we finally dealt with the problem, just rotating a whole group, a new group of people came in to take over the training of these children.</span> <span id="s704">They were wonderful-looking children, looking at some of them.</span> <span id="s705">Some of them spoke some Yiddish.</span> <span id="s706">I remember asking ‘vu forst du?’</span> <span id="s707">"Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s708">And this kid, ‘for ken Eretz Yisrael’ He was from the right wing.</span> <span id="s709">“Ich for hargenen ale,” ("I am going there to kill Arabs,”) he said.</span> <span id="s710">It was not funny to me.</span> <span id="s711">I said, "Is that what you’re training these kids to do?"</span> <span id="s712">Anyway, so we had these three installations, and there were others in towns.</span> <span id="s713">Waltershausen, the city nearby, had some people.</span> <span id="s714">And constantly, again, circuit riding.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">We also had people who were struck down.</span> <span id="s716">We had a lot of people with tuberculosis, and we would send them to Bad Reichenhall, where there was a big sanatorium.</span> <span id="s717">Later on, we even sent people to Sweden, I think, Malmo.</span> <span id="s718">There were a number of Jewish survivors recovering from tuberculosis, patients.</span> <span id="s719">Do you know about that?</span> <span id="s720">I had a number of people, one of my assistants, I sent a woman, a girl, from Hungary, to Malmo.</span> <span id="s721">And now I worked under IRO’s auspices in Foehrenwald.</span> <span id="s722">Subsequently, they asked me also to give some attention to Feldafing.</span> <span id="s723">It was quite a ride, on the other side of the lake, there was a big installation.</span> <span id="s724">And I’d come in and meet with the people and talk about their problems, see what could be done.</span> <span id="s725">So that's -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: When you went and visited the different camps, whether it was under UNRRA or, when it was IRO, did you meet with the people who were sort of the camp functionaries?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Or did you also go in the street and just meet with the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">02:16:16A: Well, they knew.</span> <span id="s730">There would be an office that I had in each of these places or a room that I would sit in.</span> <span id="s731">So first, I would meet with the functionaries, that is, the man in charge of food, housing, immigration, various aspects -- health care.</span> <span id="s732">And discuss their problems, shortages, what they needed.</span> <span id="s733">A guy in charge of education would complain about the absence of school materials.</span> <span id="s734">Supply questions, and also internal problems, political problems.</span> <span id="s735">In the broad sense, political problems.</span> <span id="s736">Having problems putting people in there, they don't want to go there, and people are making trouble about this or that or whatever.</span> <span id="s737">So, I tried to handle all of that, write them down, and see what could be done.</span> <span id="s738">We had limited resources.</span> <span id="s739">I would do whatever I could.</span> <span id="s740">But then came a time for what we call ‘bittes’, that is, requests or complaints.</span> <span id="s741">I would sit in an office.</span> <span id="s742">People would line up outside 20 or 30 or40, whatever.</span> <span id="s743">If it was a busy time, there would be more, and they were admitted one‑by‑one.</span> <span id="s744">And I would talk with them about what they needed.</span> <span id="s745">Very frequently, it had to do with immigration, that is, “mir hut mir upgesugt”: “I was refused by the consul general" and "What do I do?"</span> <span id="s746">I would offer some advice.</span> <span id="s747">I can't tell you what I offered, but sometimes I offered, and this was pretty frequently the case, that they tear up their documents, get new documents, go to Stuttgart to the north, where there was a consul general and reapply all over again.</span> <span id="s748">And it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: What other things did people come, when they came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Immigration, illness, “Can you find a relative of mine in the United States?”</span> <span id="s751">I am looking for somebody in Cleveland or Chicago,” or whatever.</span> <span id="s752">Police, problems of the law.</span> <span id="s753">Jews frequently ran afoul of the laws, that is, they were caught.</span> <span id="s754">“My son has been arrested.</span> <span id="s755">He was carrying illegal currency or black market, other operation, caught selling cigarettes or whatever.</span> <span id="s756">And his trial will be so and so.</span> <span id="s757">And it will destroy us if he is convicted.</span> <span id="s758">He may not be able to get to the United States or to emigrate.</span> <span id="s759">Can you help me?”</span> <span id="s760">And I spent a lot of my time in the courts, in the summary courts, that is, the military summary courts in Munich where I had cultivated -- because I saw it as my responsibility -- cultivated acquaintances with the judges, who were American military officers.</span> <span id="s761">One was my neighbor, lived down the street from me in Munich.</span> <span id="s762">And we would have parties.</span> <span id="s763">He would come over, I would go to his place, to parties.</span> <span id="s764">It was a very good contact.</span> <span id="s765">Not that he would simply let people off when I asked, but he would understand better what their cases were, and very frequently gave them a very light sentence or let them off or suspended a sentence, or did whatever.</span> <span id="s766">And that was a very, very significant part of my responsibility.</span> <span id="s767">I don't think it would have been the responsibility of another, somebody who was an UNRRA who didn't have the same sort of commitment that I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Yes, because I felt a responsibility to these people.</span> <span id="s770">I grew very expert at explaining all of the problems faced by Jews after the war, what they had experienced during the war.</span> <span id="s771">We had a lot of pathologies, I say, people who were sick.</span> <span id="s772">And we tried in our own primitive ways to deal with them.</span> <span id="s773">I remember a very extreme case of a man who had survived by eating the flesh of his fellow haftlinger in the concentration camp, some bad place he had been.</span> <span id="s774">This was on his mind, his head -- every once in a while he had a breakdown, ‘Ich hab gegesen’ because I ate, you know.</span> <span id="s775">He was in the camp.</span> <span id="s776">He'd come to see me.</span> <span id="s777">There was a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">One day Sam Haber, the director of the JDC came on a visit to a camp.</span> <span id="s779">And he drove up in a nice‑looking station wagon.</span> <span id="s780">They have jeep‑looking station wagons.</span> <span id="s781">And on the side it was written, American Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s782">And we were talking.</span> <span id="s783">Whenever I met him here in the states, he would remind me: I saw a man who had been in a katzet someplace come up behind him.</span> <span id="s784">The guy held up a lead pipe, and was going to smash Haber over the head.</span> <span id="s785">I jumped in front of the guy and grabbed his arm.</span> <span id="s786">He was shouting, ‘ganovim’, calling everybody thieves.</span> <span id="s787">They are stealing.</span> <span id="s788">My family is sending me from America.</span> <span id="s789">I mean, we had really an impossible situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: What did you do with people who were really out of control?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: We tried to hospitalize them.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: In psychiatric hospitals?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Yeah, wherever we could find it.</span> <span id="s794">They were in short supply.</span> <span id="s795">At the very end, as the camps began in 1950 to draw down and to a close, we were left with a group of people who were described as hard core, who would not move.</span> <span id="s796">Many of them would not, and some who could not.</span> <span id="s797">Many of these people were people with that kind of a problem, mental illness.</span> <span id="s798">And the Israelis were not too anxious to receive them.</span> <span id="s799">They had enough problems of their own.</span> <span id="s800">And so these people remained.</span> <span id="s801">I was shocked to learn from somebody somewhere that Foehrenwald, which I left in 1950 and I thought was well on its way to being closed, didn't close until 1957.</span> <span id="s802">The Germans were running the camps in the later years.</span> <span id="s803">Of course, there was a JDC in Germany, too, with some help.</span> <span id="s804">But these people were people, as I say, with criminal records, with pathology of various sorts.</span> <span id="s805">It was a tragic sort of thing -- the refuse of our people there.</span> <span id="s806">But they fought us tooth and nail about the evacuation of the camps, premature evacuation, which meant that they could have been thrown onto the German economy, fend for themselves.</span> <span id="s807">And that’s something they didn't want to do.</span> <span id="s808">Our people were shielded from the German economy, that is, German police, the German criminal justice system did not apply to them.</span> <span id="s809">They went to Jewish-run hospitals or United Nations hospitals of various sorts, and they were cared for.</span> <span id="s810">But ultimately, I remember walking in on people and saying ‘far vos fohrt du nisht avec’.</span> <span id="s811">We tried to convince them to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s812">It was not as great a problem as the United States was.</span> <span id="s813">And they felt guilt about sitting there.</span> <span id="s814">“Mir zizten oyf undser primadanas,” (“We are sitting on our suitcases here.”)</span> <span id="s815">I said, "Don't sit on them.</span> <span id="s816">Pick them up and und fohrt in Eretz Yisrael.”</span></p> <p><span id="s817">02:23:37 The rabbis who worked for the JDC were enlisted in this effort of trying to talk Jews into going to Israel, getting out.</span> <span id="s818">It was inconceivable, I think, to many of them, and to me, that Jews would remain in Germany.</span> <span id="s819">That some would even make a life there, and as a matter of fact, many did.</span> <span id="s820">There were people -- I have gone back on a number of occasions to Germany, and have met and talked with, and have been entertained by Jews, Jewish businessmen, professionals, doctors.</span> <span id="s821">I think I told you that the head of the Munich krankenhaus, the hospital, was a survivor I knew very, very well.</span> <span id="s822">And by the way, he became ultimately the president of the Jewish communities of Neider Oberbayern, that is, Southern Bavaria.</span> <span id="s823">They had a confederation of small Jewish communities including Munich.</span> <span id="s824">And he became the president of that organization.</span> <span id="s825">So that’s the way it was ultimately settled.</span> <span id="s826">I don't know whether any of the people are anywhere under UN care still, but I sort of doubt it.</span> <span id="s827">But it leaves a long and laborious problem where we were faced with all kinds of demonstrations and small riots and whatever.</span> <span id="s828">People didn't want to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Let's go back over some of the details -- the legal situation, the problems that people would get into trouble with the law or violate something.</span> <span id="s830">Can you tell us about the situation with the stolen car -- not stolen, but the car that was bought, on the – accident, and what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: There was a tendency -- I want to say as background, in the very beginning, when the Americans occupied Germany, they thought in the American way that all of the people living in Germany would be subject to German police and the German courts.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">02:26:06 And if a DP was arrested for smuggling cigarettes or beating somebody, whatever, that he would be put into a jail, which was a German jail, and arrested by the German police, and tried under German law.</span> <span id="s833">Well, it was an abuse of that.</span> <span id="s834">There were a lot of hard feelings, as you can understand.</span> <span id="s835">And there was violence, and German police did some things which were vicious, and protests were raised by various people, including the American Jewish community.</span> <span id="s836">And then a decision was taken, it was a very important decision, that no Jew could be arrested by German police.</span> <span id="s837">They had no power over Jews, except they could detain them until military police came by and got them.</span> <span id="s838">And if Jews were sentenced to jail, they were sentenced to jail in stockades, a military term for jail, where American soldiers were sentenced for various offenses.</span> <span id="s839">They did their time in stockades, and when they were tried, they were tried in a military court.</span> <span id="s840">We had two or three levels, it was a summary court.</span> <span id="s841">I mean, depending on the seriousness of the offense.</span> <span id="s842">And there would be a military prosecutor and a military judge sitting in judgment on them.</span> <span id="s843">And this protected them, insulated them.</span> <span id="s844">This was for criminal acts, of course, smuggling mostly, black market, whatever, but also occasionally, for some more serious offenses.</span> <span id="s845">But mostly, it was sort of a black market thing.</span> <span id="s846">I was constantly running down their pleas.</span> <span id="s847">You know, Joe or John, whatever the judge's name was, please think about this guy, what he had been through, and all of the rest.</span> <span id="s848">It very frequently worked.</span> <span id="s849">But then there were offenses of Jews, one Jew against another Jew, in the camps.</span> <span id="s850">Thefts took place.</span> <span id="s851">Fights took place over such thing as housing or some deal which they had made with each other and didn't work out.</span> <span id="s852">And there was an embarrassment, I think that's the best word I can think of, for the goyim, for the non‑Jews, that these things were happening, that after the war, Jews were beating each other up or doing things to each other.</span> <span id="s853">And so these things we tried to settle internally in the camps.</span> <span id="s854">And a kind of primitive justice system was set up.</span> <span id="s855">And for want of a better one, I remember, I served for about a year in Neu Freimann, I think, yeah, as a judge.</span> <span id="s856">I would hold court as a guy sitting there, listening to the evidence, and deciding whether to dismiss the case or get together and settle the thing, or whether there was some penalty.</span> <span id="s857">I had no jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">02:29:02 I had no way of doing that, but the penalty was deprivation of some privilege or something.</span> <span id="s859">But at least there would be a statement, a verdict, some finding.</span> <span id="s860">And we also had a problem, I think I mentioned this, occasionally when a kapo would be found, or a ghettopolizei who was accused of cooperating with the Germans in the ghettoes or in the concentration camps, resulting in the suffering of Jews maybe the death of Jews.</span> <span id="s861">After we pried him loose from an angry mob, all bloodied and I tell you, terrible, we would try to listen to what this man had to say for himself.</span> <span id="s862">And he would try to produce witnesses.</span> <span id="s863">Of course, there were accusers, people who found them in the camp, and came and told how he extracted money from them in a ghetto somewhere, and then sent their son off for deportation.</span> <span id="s864">But so often, we would find that where a group of people told stories on one side, another group of people who knew him from that town would line up and say he was wonderful.</span> <span id="s865">“He saved my life” or “He saved my father.”</span> <span id="s866">It was a very, very difficult area to try to be a judge.</span> <span id="s867">And, I was not trained to be a judge.</span> <span id="s868">I just used whatever common sense I had.</span> <span id="s869">People seemed to be satisfied with that.</span> <span id="s870">Now, what did we do with those Jews?</span> <span id="s871">We had no way of dealing with them.</span> <span id="s872">We were embarrassed to turn them over on a war crimes charge, can you imagine, to an American judge or American prosecutor who would have been unheard (?)</span> <span id="s873">of Jews, you know.</span> <span id="s874">And I am trying to remember -- I am not clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">What we would sometimes do, we would call in the people who were from Palestine, working in the Brichah.</span> <span id="s876">And they were young, strong guys.</span> <span id="s877">I don't know what they did with them.</span> <span id="s878">We would give them to take them away.</span> <span id="s879">They must have questioned him, in the Sochnut offices.</span> <span id="s880">And some people told me they were drugged and taken away on illegal transports to Palestine where they were again tried.</span> <span id="s881">And if there were really serious offenses, I don't know what would happen.</span> <span id="s882">Shame played a big role in the punishment, that his name would be published in Israel.</span> <span id="s883">He is a man who, in this and this ghetto, Lodz or whatever, did the following.</span> <span id="s884">And so he would be sort of a marked man in Palestine.</span> <span id="s885">I think, my recollection is that this played a powerful part -- people didn't want that attached to them.</span> <span id="s886">It was almost as bad as, maybe, as a jail sentence.</span> <span id="s887">So that’s the way these things were resolved.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">02:32:03 Then there was the civil justice.</span> <span id="s889">There were questions of civil justice, where agreements had been breached, mainly in the area of black market, where a load of cigarettes or coffee or something had been paid for, and on the way to delivery, were stopped by military police and confiscated, the whole load, including the truck.</span> <span id="s890">And the driver was thrown into jail.</span> <span id="s891">So now the guy who supplied these cigarettes, for example, came to the guy he sold them to and said, “Give me my money.”</span> <span id="s892">In the case where there was no prior payment, the guy had to get some money out of it or something.</span> <span id="s893">Then there would be an argument about who was responsible.</span> <span id="s894">In that case, these things were submitted to a deen torah, that is, a rabbinic court.</span> <span id="s895">And we had a rabbi, a number of rabbis in the camp, but there were a number of rabbis around who would hold court on this.</span> <span id="s896">And there was agreement that the verdicts they reached would be obeyed, would be complied with.</span> <span id="s897">So generally, that was the sort of justice system.</span> <span id="s898">We tried to avoid, and I tried to avoid, any reference to any access to the general criminal justice system which, for Jews, was by and large was the military authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: You told me about a situation in which a car was bought, and in an accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s901">Well, we had our attitudes.</span> <span id="s902">Speaking of "ours," I mean Jews in Germany immediately after the war, knowing of the unbelievable horror under which these people had suffered, we had the same hatred towards Germans that the Jewish DPs had.</span> <span id="s903">Not quite the same, but it was there.</span> <span id="s904">And very often, it skewed our sense of equity.</span> <span id="s905">So one night, I was asleep.</span> <span id="s906">It was about midnight, and suddenly in this graphone (ph), in this big house, somebody's banging at the front door downstairs.</span> <span id="s907">I heard the girl go down and open the door, ask him in.</span> <span id="s908">He said, “Ikh muz mit dem director sprechen, redn, sprechen,” whatever.</span> <span id="s909">Speaking Yiddish.</span> <span id="s910">And I came down.</span> <span id="s911">There was this guy panting.</span> <span id="s912">I asked him what happened.</span> <span id="s913">He said he had bought a car illegally, and he was riding the car around, and he lost control of the car.</span> <span id="s914">And the car ran up on a loading platform for street cars, where there were a lot of people.</span> <span id="s915">There was massive use of street cars.</span> <span id="s916">No cars on the streets at all, hardly any.</span> <span id="s917">And he struck a number of people, but I don't know what he said.</span> <span id="s918">I think he may have killed a woman.</span> <span id="s919">And he said to me – “I don't know whether I killed her.</span> <span id="s920">I don't know.</span> <span id="s921">Ir muz mir rateven,” he said, “You have to save me!”</span> <span id="s922">Well, I didn't think very much about it.</span> <span id="s923">Here was a man, probably with a number on his arm or something.</span> <span id="s924">And I said, “Come inside and in the morning, I will take you to one of the camps, and we will see that you are placed on a transport bound for Palestine, illegal transport.”</span></p> <p><span id="s925">02:35:50 And we did that the next morning.</span> <span id="s926">About three or four days later, I was told he was gone.</span> <span id="s927">Now, whether he was picked up in Cyprus by the British on a ship, I don't know, but he was certainly not in Munich anymore.</span> <span id="s928">I have thought about that for many, many years.</span> <span id="s929">Was that a proper exercise of my values?</span> <span id="s930">I don't know.</span> <span id="s931">I am deeply troubled even to this very day.</span> <span id="s932">That is, I think we have to avoid situations where Jews, because of the sufferings they experienced, are exempt from the best human standards of mankind.</span> <span id="s933">And what I did to him was, I said to him, “You’re exempt.”</span> <span id="s934">And I think that was wrong.</span> <span id="s935">I have lived with that ever since.</span> <span id="s936">I was wrong.</span> <span id="s937">I wouldn't do it in the States.</span> <span id="s938">But it didn't take me 30 seconds to say come on in.</span> <span id="s939">And when I have discussed it with friends of mine who are survivors, and said “What would you do?”</span> <span id="s940">They say, “I would take him in.”</span> <span id="s941">They would have condemned me had I handed him over.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Tell me, in these court situations that you set up, inside the camp, were there ever abuses of children or violence against women?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: No.</span> <span id="s944">I never heard of any of that.</span> <span id="s945">Or children.</span> <span id="s946">Now, it could be.</span> <span id="s947">I don't know.</span> <span id="s948">I just want to tell you, Henry Cohen is a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s949">I haven't seen him for many years.</span> <span id="s950">I gave a party for some military people in my house one day.</span> <span id="s951">And there were some military and UNRRA people.</span> <span id="s952">And here was a guy who I knew.</span> <span id="s953">I looked at him.</span> <span id="s954">I saw it was Henry Cohen's brother, Sidney Cohen, who was a physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">02:38:06 I don't know where he is now.</span> <span id="s956">They were dear friends of ours.</span> <span id="s957">My mother and their mother would take us all to the mountains together.</span> <span id="s958">We used to go up.</span> <span id="s959">And I said, "My God, what are you doing here, Sidney?"</span> <span id="s960">He was stationed in a hospital nearby, and said, “But you know who else is here, Henry is here.”</span> <span id="s961">I said, “You’re kidding.</span> <span id="s962">Where is Henry?”</span> <span id="s963">Well, Henry was in Foehrenwald.</span> <span id="s964">He was in charge of Foehrenwald.</span> <span id="s965">Henry had been a soldier.</span> <span id="s966">And he had taken this job in Foehrenwald, and he stayed there for about six months, but he got fired.</span> <span id="s967">I am telling this on Henry.</span> <span id="s968">The reason he got fired is, he had courts in Foehrenwald.</span> <span id="s969">And some Jewish DP had done something wrong, and Henry locked him up in a jail, sentenced him to, I think, seven days in this little lock-up he had.</span> <span id="s970">Well, the UNRRA regulations precluded him from locking up people, holding people like that for more than, let’s say, two days, or something, or a day.</span> <span id="s971">Just long enough, if the guy was dangerous, until somebody could come.</span> <span id="s972">But he decided he would impose the whole sentence so there would be no recourse to any military jails.</span> <span id="s973">And he held him for seven days.</span> <span id="s974">They came, and it got him into deep dutch, and ultimately, he left.</span> <span id="s975">He lives, now, I think, in New York.</span> <span id="s976">I used to see him.</span> <span id="s977">He went to England.</span> <span id="s978">He was an urban planner.</span> <span id="s979">And he eventually became a professor of urban planning at The New School in New York.</span> <span id="s980">And he went to Coventry, I think, as a volunteer after the war, and helped to redesign the town of Coventry, which had been destroyed by the Nazis, including their cathedral, the famous cathedral in Coventry.</span> <span id="s981">But I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s982">Well, Henry and I had a wonderful time there together with his brother.</span> <span id="s983">We were deep, good friends.</span> <span id="s984">And I would drive the 40, 50 miles to Foehrenwald occasionally to see him and have dinner with him, or he would come to Munich.</span> <span id="s985">Ultimately, when he left, I was given control of his operations.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: You described lots of babies being born after -- was there a lot of freedom in terms of sexual relations?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Yeah, well, we had a problem with that, because when families came, and we had to house them in public, big spaces, the only walls we had for them were blankets strung on strings, on rope.</span> <span id="s988">And these people were conducting their family relations.</span> <span id="s989">And you could hear everything going on under the blankets.</span> <span id="s990">And I remember, I always have this impression about Bulgarians.</span> <span id="s991">There was one Bulgarian couple that arrived in that camp.</span> <span id="s992">And he was a magician.</span> <span id="s993">He claimed he was a circus performer.</span> <span id="s994">They looked a little bit freaky to me, and it was confirmed by their neighbors.</span> <span id="s995">They said ,“Chaver director, you’d never believe what is going on there sexually with his wife.”</span> <span id="s996">I think there was some leather going on, something like that.</span> <span id="s997">They were embarrassed.</span> <span id="s998">“Get them out of here.”</span> <span id="s999">And I had the welfare worker talk to them, move them someplace where they could be more private.</span> <span id="s1000">But you had the shards of the Jewish community in these camps.</span> <span id="s1001">In many cases, except whole families who came from the Soviet Union, you had single people drifting, they’d lost their families, lost their wives, lost their husbands, fathers, mothers, whatever.</span> <span id="s1002">And so there was a tremendous drive to try to recreate the family.</span> <span id="s1003">And so we had a tracing service, and people would apply.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">02:41:59 Can you find so and so?</span> <span id="s1005">But very few.</span> <span id="s1006">There was some good, but most of these people were gone, had died in some way, had been killed in Auschwitz or Treblinka, whatever.</span> <span id="s1007">And so there was a thrust to rebuild families.</span> <span id="s1008">And people were getting married in great numbers.</span> <span id="s1009">And they were having babies in about a year.</span> <span id="s1010">We had small hospitals in Foehrenwald, and, I think, in Freimann there was a clinic.</span> <span id="s1011">But we had to use the Munich municipal hospitals for the OB‑GYN, and people having babies right in that setting.</span> <span id="s1012">I used to say to myself, if I ever got married and had children, there was a question after what I had seen whether I would want to be Jewish or not, maybe go through the same kind of -- but they had some faith in their futures.</span> <span id="s1013">And they didn't know where they were going, and they began to rebuild the families.</span> <span id="s1014">And we had lots of babies.</span> <span id="s1015">We had to clear, I remember, a clinic floor in the German hospital in Munich.</span> <span id="s1016">Hospital space was very scarce, because the towns had been bombed.</span> <span id="s1017">So there was the thrust to rebuild your family, to recreate.</span> <span id="s1018">I mean, you had people -- a woman who had three kids, and a guy who had four kids -- everybody is gone, just the two of them.</span> <span id="s1019">And now, they marry, and they begin the process, building all over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Was it generally -- did the people got married or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: They got married.</span> <span id="s1022">Well, we had sex.</span> <span id="s1023">There was a lot of romancing going on.</span> <span id="s1024">It's best I didn't probe too deeply into that.</span> <span id="s1025">That was their own business.</span> <span id="s1026">But we knew what was going on, and we knew people wanted privacy.</span> <span id="s1027">And we knew they were being married, and we knew they were producing babies.</span> <span id="s1028">There's a scene, you have a picture showing women in the park, sort of a public area, with the baby carriages.</span> <span id="s1029">There must have had hundreds of baby carriages.</span> <span id="s1030">I don't know where they got all the baby carriages, but they had them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: How were people adjusting when the children came?</span> <span id="s1032">It also had to be a trauma in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: They had lived, you know, for five years under these unbelievable circumstances.</span> <span id="s1034">Some had lived in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1035">Some had lived in hiding or lived in Russia.</span> <span id="s1036">And somehow or other, I don't know how they did it, they managed.</span> <span id="s1037">You know that accounts for the enormous resourcefulness of Jews in Israel and the Jews that came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1038">I know hundreds and hundreds of Jewish survivors in various parts of the country who have come here, and their history is an incredible one.</span> <span id="s1039">They have built themselves up.</span> <span id="s1040">They built businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">02:45:01 They engage themselves in the charitable undertakings of their communities.</span> <span id="s1042">I find they are one of the most productive groups of people you could ever find.</span> <span id="s1043">Russian Jews are doing a lot of that.</span> <span id="s1044">In my experience, you see the same sort of impulse, the drive to survive and to prosper and to bring children forth and to see these children succeed -- it’s just incredible.</span> <span id="s1045">So that in Germany, the black market, if you had to feed your kids, I mean, that was the only way of doing it.</span> <span id="s1046">It was nonsense to go tell them, “Look, you are destroying the German economy.”</span> <span id="s1047">That, I would not do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: But when these babies were born, you did say, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s1049">I would imagine the years of male and female, sometimes quite young, having lost their -- not the older folks …</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: It was very difficult, but we tried.</span> <span id="s1051">The JDC did a great job in supplying the kinds of things -- diapers, and we got them milk you know, evaporated milk, to feed…</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Did you train the women to know what to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: I think there were some training programs being done by the nurses and the medical people.</span> <span id="s1054">Lactating mothers.</span> <span id="s1055">We had orthodox people who came in.</span> <span id="s1056">And they had to have -- well, we had to have special milk for all pregnant women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Because they couldn't nurse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: No, I am trying to remember why that was.</span> <span id="s1059">But there was a big demand for milk for lactating mothers.</span> <span id="s1060">But the orthodox had a special problem, it had to be kosher.</span> <span id="s1061">We would have some farmers that we contracted with who milk cows, fresh milk for these families.</span> <span id="s1062">And a rabbi, a hasid would sit in the barn to observe, look at the pails and look at the way the cows were being milked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Did you notice in the camps that there -- it -- was more male than female in terms of the survivor population that you could tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: I could not tell.</span> <span id="s1065">I guess there are some statistics on it, but I don't know what they were.</span> <span id="s1066">I have a feeling there were more men than women.</span> <span id="s1067">You know, I want to say something else: I wish I had these pictures here.</span> <span id="s1068">People came from various directions.</span> <span id="s1069">You know, you had people who came out of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1070">And, by God, I had a feeling as I looked at them, that they bore the scars of that experience on their faces, on their bodies.</span> <span id="s1071">And then there was another group of people, who were mainly single, who had fought in the Soviet army, or who had been in the partisan underground in the valder, they used to say, in the woods.</span> <span id="s1072">And they comported themselves differently.</span> <span id="s1073">After a number of years with these people, I knew -- I could tell so many things.</span> <span id="s1074">I was almost -- had become like, I think, I stayed the longest of anybody in working in that field.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">02:48:11 For some reason or other, I was drawn to it.</span> <span id="s1076">And you see guys walk with this kind of an attitude, and you knew this was a guy -- there is a picture there, and I don't know whether you have a chance to see it.</span> <span id="s1077">They were standing on the hood of a truck, on the hood and on the fenders of the truck, dressed in ledermantel, these leather coats which, I think, were taken from Nazis officers.</span> <span id="s1078">And the shtivl, the boots, taken from Nazis.</span> <span id="s1079">Many Jews came dressed in Nazi clothing with the buttons removed, you know, all of the decorations.</span> <span id="s1080">They simply, in a fight someplace or battle, had taken this clothing.</span> <span id="s1081">Clothing was very valuable.</span> <span id="s1082">And they are just standing there, saying, “In your face”.</span> <span id="s1083">And that was their attitude.</span> <span id="s1084">They were difficult for me to control, these people.</span> <span id="s1085">They were constantly in fist fights.</span> <span id="s1086">Whereas, I think, there was a kind of a -- I don't want to call it submissive, that’s not what it was -- but these were people who had suffered deeply, who had been gepiniket is the Yiddish term.</span> <span id="s1087">They were pinikt, they were tortured in some way physically and deprived of food, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1088">Living on the brink.</span> <span id="s1089">Not knowing, you know, that any day somebody would say “Out”.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: When you arrived in Europe you didn't really know very much.</span> <span id="s1091">Didn’t know what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Not a bit.</span> <span id="s1093">Well, I knew something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Did your knowledge through these years come from spending time with these particular survivors, and them telling you the story, or from the reading about the reports from the newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Well, they were very anxious to talk to me, that is, survivors, especially concentration camp survivors.</span> <span id="s1096">This is what was done to me.</span> <span id="s1097">They had to speak.</span> <span id="s1098">They were anxious to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1099">And the people who were in the woods would also speak about it.</span> <span id="s1100">I learned a lot from them.</span> <span id="s1101">But what I have learned has been modified, or enriched, by what I got from my reading.</span> <span id="s1102">That is, I was really dealing with a sort of macro at the very local level where great events were, like when Jews moved by the hundreds of thousands out of the Soviet Union in 1946, as a result of the Mikolajczyk ohpmacht.</span> <span id="s1103">Mikolajczyk was the president of the London government of the Poles, who had reached an agreement with the Russians to allow the Polish nationals to leave the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">02:51:03 I learned that from somewhere else, or I learned the real truth.</span> <span id="s1105">That is, these people also had a very limited view of their universe, which was very small.</span> <span id="s1106">And lead to some miscalculations on their part, or misunderstanding, so it's a combination of both.</span> <span id="s1107">But I think the human feelings, the sense of what these people experienced, I seemed to get from my personal encounter with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Can you give us some instances of what people told you and what effect that had on you.</span> <span id="s1109">Because it couldn't have been easy, either, to be in that situation for so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Well, they told me the horror, what they experienced people, being assassinated before their very eyes, shot down, babies being smashed against walls.</span> <span id="s1111">I mean, it was really unbelievable for me.</span> <span id="s1112">I learned, also, something about the almost accidental way in which things happened to these people.</span> <span id="s1113">That is, they are sitting in a ghetto and the mother said, “Moishe, go get me a loaf of bread or something.</span> <span id="s1114">See if you can find something.”</span> <span id="s1115">He goes out -- I know this happened to somebody I know -- looks for the bread, comes back, and there is nobody there.</span> <span id="s1116">In the meantime, while he was gone, just accidentally -- she could have said it to another brother of his -- they were all taken out and deported, dead.</span> <span id="s1117">Can you imagine this guy surviving this way?</span> <span id="s1118">Concentration camp experiences dealing with kapos, dealing with the violence in the camps, and it wasn't a pretty picture.</span> <span id="s1119">Survival meant, very often, set one Jew against the next.</span> <span id="s1120">In some cases, stories of some kindness, some act of kindness, even by an SS officer – “Get away from here,” something like that.</span> <span id="s1121">Or by other ethnics, you know.</span> <span id="s1122">They hated the Ukrainians and the Balts because they were the principal accessories.</span> <span id="s1123">All of the gruesome details.</span> <span id="s1124">They had this man telling me about having to eat somebody's flesh in order to survive.</span> <span id="s1125">No food there.</span> <span id="s1126">They just were ready to starve you to death.</span> <span id="s1127">How they were arrested, you know.</span> <span id="s1128">What happened in their towns, how the Germans came and suddenly they were -- they reported to the apelplutzs (ph) .</span> <span id="s1129">When they were asked to report, they went.</span> <span id="s1130">And that was their mistake.</span> <span id="s1131">If a cop comes and says “You go down and appear at the police station tomorrow morning at 8:00 o'clock,” don't go.</span> <span id="s1132">That was their philosophy.</span> <span id="s1133">It was all melding into one big mass remembrance.</span> <span id="s1134">But there was a tremendous amount of conversation and talk about it, until I had it up to here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Did you go away did you go on a small vacations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Well, we would go occasionally on vacations.</span> <span id="s1137">But the only place that I could go with some regularity -- we’d get away maybe once every couple of months.</span> <span id="s1138">If you look at your map, you could see we were about three or four hours from Switzerland, from the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s1139">And we’d drive down to Konstanz, which is the border town on the Swiss German border.</span> <span id="s1140">And from there, about another 30 miles to Zurich.</span> <span id="s1141">And there was just an incredible change, you know.</span> <span id="s1142">Schlagsaahner, that’s whipped cream and cookies and cakes and chocolate and night clubs and all of the rest.</span> <span id="s1143">And you’d spend three or four days.</span> <span id="s1144">You thought you were refreshed.</span> <span id="s1145">And then, you would come back to the grimness of the horrors.</span> <span id="s1146">Occasionally, I would accompany a group of Jews who were being, again, treated for tuberculosis in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1147">I remember that Davos was the place, the site.</span> <span id="s1148">Have you heard of Davos, D-a-v-o-s?</span> <span id="s1149">Now I hear about it in ski contests.</span> <span id="s1150">It's a resort city and they hold ski meets there.</span> <span id="s1151">But Davos was a place with a number of sanitoriums, and the Jews stayed there to recover.</span> <span id="s1152">And then they were sent back.</span> <span id="s1153">UNRRA paid the bill in Davos and Malmo.</span> <span id="s1154">You have heard of Malmo?</span> <span id="s1155">Where is that, Norway or Sweden?</span> <span id="s1156">Sweden.</span> <span id="s1157">I have to say something about the international organization.</span> <span id="s1158">Malmo -- I mean, all of the processing of Jews, that is, was paid for, the welfare and their migration, their tickets were bought, to Israel when it was established, to the United States, to Canada.</span> <span id="s1159">Their medical care in foreign countries when that became vital, when people were thought to be able to be helped.</span> <span id="s1160">So it was a great humanitarian service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">02:56:22 I know that many of our people here, UNRRA, think of the Arab states and the refugee problem and there is a negative feeling about the U.N., generally.</span> <span id="s1162">You know, the U.N. intrudes -- especially on the basis of the U.N. -- the Middle Eastern situation.</span> <span id="s1163">But they can be eternally grateful to the United Nations to UNRRA, for the great service which they rendered to the Jewish people as well as other refugees.</span> <span id="s1164">But the Jews especially.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">03:00:07 Q: Can you talk a little bit more about the black market, both looked like a solution to a lot of problems, but I suspect it also generated its own problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s1168">I think the black market, more than anything else I can think of, generated hostility towards the Jewish community as it then existed in the camps, among the military and among, I think, Germans, generally.</span> <span id="s1169">And the newspaper people would come over from the United States and want to know about “the black market” because I think it was publicized here in the United States, as well.</span> <span id="s1170">And we were very sensitive about it.</span> <span id="s1171">UNRRA was told that a number one priority of the occupation immediately after the end of the war was the reconstruction of Germany's economy, which was smashed.</span> <span id="s1172">And Eisenhower and the people that came after him, and in particular, John McCloy, General Clay, all made that a number one priority.</span> <span id="s1173">And therefore, the diversion of goods, of manufactured goods, and food from the regular market was considered a very great threat to the economy.</span> <span id="s1174">And measures were to be taken against it, police measures.</span> <span id="s1175">At the same time, the people who were withholding these goods -- if you walked into a German shop, camera store, for example -- until the currency was reformed, that store lay absolutely empty of any merchandise.</span> <span id="s1176">You couldn't buy food.</span> <span id="s1177">You couldn't buy clothing because the clothing had to be sold at regulated prices, and the mark, the reichsmark, which was still the old reich before the d-mark, was practically worthless.</span> <span id="s1178">I mean, it went to like 800 to a dollar at one point, so that the Germans would not sell their goods on the open market.</span> <span id="s1179">That is, on the regular market under controlled prices, because they would be losing their shirts.</span> <span id="s1180">And it was only to be bought with hard currencies: dollars, or Swiss francs, or British pounds, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1181">Now, for the Jews, the black market was the only place.</span> <span id="s1182">These were people who had come out of the most terrible conditions, in eastern Europe, either concentration camps or in hiding, or in the Soviet Union where there was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1183">And there was a thrust to rebuild themselves, to rebuild their families.</span> <span id="s1184">They were producing children, doing all of these things, and the black market became the only way in which they could meet that need.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">03:02:57 And, also, to produce some income for them, so that when they went overseas to the country in which they would settle, they would have a few dollars in their pockets.</span> <span id="s1186">And so this black market developed.</span> <span id="s1187">It took the form very frequently of little shops in the DP camps, thriving in Feldafing, Foehrenwald, Neu Freimann also.</span> <span id="s1188">You could buy most anything you needed or wanted.</span> <span id="s1189">Food, cloth for making clothing.</span> <span id="s1190">The joke was, you could get anything you want -- You couldn't get anything you want, but you could get a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1191">And it thrived.</span> <span id="s1192">Now, the military authorities knew about it, and they would launch raids on the camps to grab these people in the act.</span> <span id="s1193">And early in the morning, maybe about 5:00, 6:00, or 7:00 o'clock in the morning, they would surround the DP camp with armed vehicles, and they would go marching in there looking for contraband: cigarettes, coffee, all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1194">I remember a funny story about how this stuff got into the camp at Foehrenwald.</span> <span id="s1195">There's a big meat market.</span> <span id="s1196">The question is, where do you get meat in a market?</span> <span id="s1197">Now, we discovered the meat was gotten in this way: garbage was collected by German firms.</span> <span id="s1198">And they didn't use trucks, they used sort of sledges, which were dragged along the ground, no wheels, just like sleighs.</span> <span id="s1199">And they were pulled by two oxen; they would come into the camp with two oxen.</span> <span id="s1200">And then, the same sledge would emerge with one ox.</span> <span id="s1201">Then for a few days, there would be meat, kosher meat in the camp.</span> <span id="s1202">But in any case, in the event of a raid in a camp, the United Nations had to receive prior notice from the military.</span> <span id="s1203">No military people could enter a United Nations Displaced Persons Camp without prior clearance from UNRRA, from the responsible United Nations official.</span> <span id="s1204">So, when any of the camps over which I had any kind of supervising relationships were about to be raided, I would receive a call from the colonel in Munich saying, “Mr. Sorrin, tomorrow morning at 7:00 o'clock, we are going to be entering your camp.”</span> <span id="s1205">And of course, now, 40 or 50 years later, I am free to say it -- I would call up and tell Haim Yankel or the president of the camp, tomorrow is going to be a razzia, a raid.</span> <span id="s1206">You know, I could not abide these -- I mean, I was sympathetic with what the Jews were trying to do.</span> <span id="s1207">I had no participation in it, but I would just tell them, if you don't want to be raided, put your stuff out of sight.</span> <span id="s1208">And that thrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">03:06:04 And I understood it.</span> <span id="s1210">And the military did not, from their vantage point, nor did the United Nations authorities.</span> <span id="s1211">They were simply obeying the mandate of the military government.</span> <span id="s1212">But without that, it would have been tragic for Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: What happened between Jews, because obviously, some people were more entrepreneurial and others were not so entrepreneurial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s1215">Some people made a lot of money, but most people made a little money, enough to get along.</span> <span id="s1216">But we used to hear that some people made big deals.</span> <span id="s1217">Now, I want to also mention that very often, involved in these big deals were members of the armed forces themselves.</span> <span id="s1218">That is, some of the P.X. people who had access to cigarettes and coffee from the P.X.</span> <span id="s1219">They didn't have to steal it.</span> <span id="s1220">It was charged out as purchased in some way, and it ended up in a black market operation.</span> <span id="s1221">And these black market operations were not of course only Jewish -- everybody was participating in them because Germany was vulnerable, its economic system was vulnerable, because of the war, to that kind of activity.</span> <span id="s1222">What happened here in the United States, if you went to go buy a camera, let’s say, for $400, and each dollar is worth a tenth of what its value is, so that you’re really buying it for $40 dollars, or maybe even $4 when the mark really went down, the people producing these cameras are going to take them off the shelves and wait for someone to come in with another currency.</span> <span id="s1223">But then a real act of genius occurred, a genius on the part of the United States and their economic planners.</span> <span id="s1224">When the war was over, the currency which was in use was reichsmarks.</span> <span id="s1225">And a lot of their currency had pictures of German emperors on them, whatever.</span> <span id="s1226">But some of them, many of them had Hitler and Goering and Goebbels and people like that.</span> <span id="s1227">That money was discarded.</span> <span id="s1228">But the other currency, the old currency was still in circulation, and it was subject to extraordinary fluctuation because of the black market situation.</span> <span id="s1229">Now, a decision was taken by the military government in connection with the finance leaders of West Germany at the time -- Conrad Adenauer was the chancellor of Germany -- to change the currency, to completely abandon the reichsmarks, and to substitute d‑marks for them.</span> <span id="s1230">And this had to be done secretly, because if it got out, there would be all kinds of dislocations.</span> <span id="s1231">All kinds of things would happen if this was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">03:09:02 It was no secret, by the way.</span> <span id="s1233">You can't do something that massive without somebody knowing.</span> <span id="s1234">But what happened was that for a couple of weeks before the day of the currency reform, which I think took place in '48, black market goods disappeared.</span> <span id="s1235">You couldn't buy, because nobody knew what the price would be.</span> <span id="s1236">And the people were withholding it, waiting for the new currency to come on line.</span> <span id="s1237">And that was a period of enormous restlessness in the Jewish DP camps at the time.</span> <span id="s1238">I guess it must have been out in the general society, but in the camps, I could -- we could see the tension rising.</span> <span id="s1239">There were fights.</span> <span id="s1240">There was a small riot in some camp, I remember.</span> <span id="s1241">They had all kinds of problems, because you couldn't get anything to eat.</span> <span id="s1242">And people had to feed themselves and their families.</span> <span id="s1243">And then on a given day, an announcement was put up, broadcast through the camps, and the currency reform began.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Now, what they did was -- I am trying to remember -- everybody got, I think, 10 marks, or maybe it was 100 marks.</span> <span id="s1245">If you had 10 million dollars stashed in old currency, it was worthless to you.</span> <span id="s1246">You could just burn it in the furnace because you got the same thing.</span> <span id="s1247">Every individual got the same amount in d‑marks.</span> <span id="s1248">And it was a miracle.</span> <span id="s1249">By the way, the Germans had a word for it, wirtschaft wunder, economic wonder, economic miracle.</span> <span id="s1250">Within days, the shops filled with merchandise, cameras, food, cakes, meat, cookies.</span> <span id="s1251">You could buy whatever you wanted, clothing, just in a matter of weeks, because the d‑marks were around, and people suddenly had lots of d‑marks, even though they were distributed in this democratic way.</span> <span id="s1252">And that began Germany's real economic recovery, and changed entirely the nature of the black market – it disappeared.</span> <span id="s1253">It was no longer a viable instrument, you know, for doing business in Germany.</span> <span id="s1254">Before, during the days of the black market, it was necessary.</span> <span id="s1255">Otherwise, you would not move anything.</span> <span id="s1256">So I remember that day.</span> <span id="s1257">We had to supervise.</span> <span id="s1258">We went camp to camp, saw people lined up.</span> <span id="s1259">And there were German treasury officials, handing out -- taking -- you had to bring a certain amount of reichsmarks.</span> <span id="s1260">There was an exchange for the old marks to the new marks, but you had a limited amount that you could get.</span> <span id="s1261">And I tell you, I remember, it was an absolute wonder.</span> <span id="s1262">And that was done by the American people, the American economists who were working over there, together with the Germans and the Jews.</span> <span id="s1263">It changed the life of the Jews in the camps at that time, very much so.</span> <span id="s1264">And the people living in the cities as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">03:12:02 Q: Tell me about the situation with the Greek Jews who were trying to open up a shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Now, this is an interesting story.</span> <span id="s1267">In Feldafing, there was a street, I don't remember its name, on which Jewish DPs lived.</span> <span id="s1268">They had built small -- in Yiddish it’s called geveldelach, little shops, little stands, one after the other.</span> <span id="s1269">On these stands, you could buy almost anything.</span> <span id="s1270">Fruit, oranges, apples, meat, bread, booze, and cloth.</span> <span id="s1271">Whatever you needed, for to live.</span> <span id="s1272">And it thrived.</span> <span id="s1273">I mean, the market was busy.</span> <span id="s1274">In this camp, most of the Jews, I would say like 97 percent of the Jews or 95 percent of the Jews were Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1275">And they controlled -- they were the big merchants in these geveldelach, these little stores.</span> <span id="s1276">But there was a little corner where the Greeks had established themselves.</span> <span id="s1277">Now, Greek Jews had a hard time, and many of them were deported, and lived and died in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1278">They were a rough and ready group of people.</span> <span id="s1279">These Jews that I met there, were from Salonika.</span> <span id="s1280">They lived on the waterfront and worked the waterfront.</span> <span id="s1281">They were people known for their roughness, you know, their occupations, and all of the rest.</span> <span id="s1282">And they ran these businesses and competed with the Poles, and the Poles didn't like these Greek Jews taking some of their business away.</span> <span id="s1283">There was an ethnic competition.</span> <span id="s1284">And fights would break out.</span> <span id="s1285">And they were bloody.</span> <span id="s1286">I mean, they were fighting with clubs and knives, you name it.</span> <span id="s1287">And we decided that we had to do something about it.</span> <span id="s1288">We had to get these Greeks out of there, otherwise there would be deaths.</span> <span id="s1289">But I do recall that in one fight between the Greek Jews and the Polish Jews that the Greek Jews went to Munich, where there was a colony of Greeks, who had also suffered in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1290">They had been dragged in as forced labor, and called on them to come to Feldafing to fight the Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1291">In other words, there was a Greek ethnic solidarity.</span> <span id="s1292">It was unprecedented in a sense, solidarity against the Polish ethnic group.</span> <span id="s1293">Well, the end was, we reached a decision that they would have to leave.</span> <span id="s1294">We would find space for them in another camp.</span> <span id="s1295">But then began a great problem because they had established businesses.</span> <span id="s1296">They liked it in Feldafing, and they didn't want to leave.</span> <span id="s1297">And then the cry went up from them.</span> <span id="s1298">They had a rabbi there, by the way, a Greek Sephardic rabbi, who was a survivor himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">03:15:16 He came and charged us, charged me right in my office, with doing, for the second time, what had been done to the Greek Jews, that is, a deportation.</span> <span id="s1300">It wasn't a deport -- but it was for dramatic effect.</span> <span id="s1301">And we were very sensitive to that.</span> <span id="s1302">We were trying to save these people.</span> <span id="s1303">There would have undoubtedly been a death, or something.</span> <span id="s1304">But you know what they did?</span> <span id="s1305">They were in touch with a famous Sephardic rabbi in New York -- he was a very close friend of Franklin Roosevelt, by the way.</span> <span id="s1306">His name was Rabbi de Sola Pool.</span> <span id="s1307">I think he had a big synagogue on 5th Avenue in New York.</span> <span id="s1308">And he sent us a message, telegram, which read “You are deporting my people.”</span> <span id="s1309">You know, whatever, some charge.</span> <span id="s1310">And he came over.</span> <span id="s1311">He flew over.</span> <span id="s1312">He got permission to enter the zone.</span> <span id="s1313">He met with us and made the same charge.</span> <span id="s1314">But we explained to him what was involved here, that it was a lifesaving venture, that the Jews were not being deported.</span> <span id="s1315">They would have the same privileges they had in other camps.</span> <span id="s1316">They may not be able to run those black market operations, but their rights were being protected.</span> <span id="s1317">The thing settled down after a while.</span> <span id="s1318">Then, I think, the Greeks drifted away, and maybe the Poles were initially involved.</span> <span id="s1319">I don't remember how it was ultimately settled, but it was quieted down.</span> <span id="s1320">But that was a very strange sort of an incident for us in these camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Was this an uncommon kind of thing, or were there lots of different kinds of fights?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: There were lots of fights, but as I say, none of them on this ethnic basis.</span> <span id="s1323">There would be fights about “you aced me out of this”, or “you swindled me”.</span> <span id="s1324">And we would try to settle those things ourselves, or they would settle them themselves, that is, through a deen Torah, through a rabbinic court.</span> <span id="s1325">The decisions of that rabbinic court were obeyed to the letter.</span> <span id="s1326">And there were some very big sums of money involved, I heard.</span> <span id="s1327">So the black market, as I say, played a powerful -- I hear it to this very day -- a powerful role in defining the Jewish survivor community in that way.</span> <span id="s1328">And it was an unjust one.</span> <span id="s1329">I was once in a bus with a group of American officials going someplace, some meeting and somebody sitting next to me, some army officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">03:18:01 And we passed a Jewish DP camp, and we could see the big sign, a Magen David outside.</span> <span id="s1331">He said to me, “You know, I wouldn't go in there if my life depended on it.”</span> <span id="s1332">I said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s1333">He didn't know I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1334">He expressed great fear.</span> <span id="s1335">He had heard about the black market, you know, a bunch of cut throats, and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1336">It was so stupid.</span> <span id="s1337">But that attitude was very strongly held in the military.</span> <span id="s1338">Patton himself spoke in the most anti-Semitic terms about Jews.</span> <span id="s1339">Couldn't stand Jews.</span> <span id="s1340">Hated Jews.</span> <span id="s1341">Called them sub-humans, I think, at one point he is quoted.</span> <span id="s1342">You know, he was killed about 25 or 30 miles from Foehrenwald in an automobile accident.</span> <span id="s1343">I saw a documentary on Patton the other day, a couple of weeks ago, in which Eisenhower comes to his office in Germany to give him the bad news, that because of various comments he had made, you know – Patton had organized an S.S. military unit after the war, which was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1344">And these troopers, he explained, were getting ready to fight the Russians.</span> <span id="s1345">And of course, he retained Nazi officials in the Bavarian government.</span> <span id="s1346">So when it got to be too much, they ordered him transferred or downgraded, so he was appointed the commanding officer of the 15th Army or something, which was an army which only kept a history.</span> <span id="s1347">It had about 150 troops or something.</span> <span id="s1348">But Eisenhower is portrayed in this documentary, coming in to talk to Patton, to explain to him why he is being transferred.</span> <span id="s1349">And Patton says now one more thing, he said, “I am here by order of the president,” he said, “to check into conditions in the DP camps.”</span> <span id="s1350">And that was the time, I saw it on the film, that he had come to see us in Neu Freimann.</span> <span id="s1351">So it was an important visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Why do you think there was such a reputation about Jews since lots of people were involved in the black market?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: Well, anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1354">It was a stereotype of the Jew that had existed prior to World War II.</span> <span id="s1355">Anti-Semitism was very great.</span> <span id="s1356">People who study anti-Semitism in America say it reached a peak precisely at the end of World War II, after the Nazis were destroyed.</span> <span id="s1357">That’s when it rose here.</span> <span id="s1358">There was strong anti-Semitism, and the black market seemed to fit the stereotype, those notions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Were you bothered by behaviors of DPs, whether they were Jewish or not?</span> <span id="s1360">You can't come out of a situation like this into so‑called peace with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Was I bothered in what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Well, there was a lot of lying, there had to be a lot of lying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Well, incessant.</span> <span id="s1364">The lying was a response to unreasonable situations for these Jews.</span> <span id="s1365">They were going to be locked up in Germany for years to come because McCarren, the senator from Nevada, decided he didn't want any Jews in America, and some others along with him.</span> <span id="s1366">I mean, it was an intolerable situation, so that anything you did to frustrate that or get around that made sense, and made ethical sense.</span> <span id="s1367">But there were some things which were very questionable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Do you think that was a function of having gone through such an inhuman situation that one came --</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: You mean for the DPs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1372">That was the only way you could survive.</span> <span id="s1373">Otherwise, I would say most would be dead, would be gone.</span> <span id="s1374">If they all obeyed what the existing law was, and didn't steal food or change documents, they’d be gone.</span> <span id="s1375">It was clear.</span> <span id="s1376">That was a way of coping.</span> <span id="s1377">And to the degree that I could, I helped them cope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: You described the visage of the partisan, of the fighter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Did that express itself in how they were able to organize, to get things happening?</span> <span id="s1381">Was there a difference in the camps between these two groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">03:22:44 A: You mean the nonpartisan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Yeah, the nonpartisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Yeah, I felt the people who were the most aggressive and most active were people who -- had been -- had not been in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1385">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1386">That's just an instinctive feeling.</span> <span id="s1387">I know that if somebody listens to that, they are going to get angry about it.</span> <span id="s1388">But that was my sense as I saw these two groups of people.</span> <span id="s1389">There was a kind of -- among the people, especially who had been soldiers or who had been partisans just by chance -- you didn't get to be a partisan because you went up and volunteered and the others would not.</span> <span id="s1390">It was just where you happened to be at a given moment.</span> <span id="s1391">They had a kind of "in your face" attitude.</span> <span id="s1392">You know, screw you.</span> <span id="s1393">Fool around with me and you are going to get it.</span> <span id="s1394">Something like that.</span> <span id="s1395">I had a problem coping with it.</span> <span id="s1396">There was one guy I remember.</span> <span id="s1397">He was in my court.</span> <span id="s1398">I used to sit as a judge.</span> <span id="s1399">And he went and took firewood, from the guy next door.</span> <span id="s1400">I said to him, when he was caught at it, I said, "What did you do?</span> <span id="s1401">Why do you steal from your fellow Jews?"</span> <span id="s1402">He said to me, “That’s not stealing.”</span> <span id="s1403">This is in Yiddish, he said, “Ich hob nohr organiziert.”</span> <span id="s1404">He said he “organized” it, you know.</span> <span id="s1405">But there was a defiance there.</span> <span id="s1406">I could tell.</span> <span id="s1407">It was sort of hands on -- you have seen that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1408">I have to show you that picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Did you notice a difference between the female deportees and the male deportees in terms of being able to be aggressive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1411">The women, I found the women aggressive.</span> <span id="s1412">They were tough-minded.</span> <span id="s1413">They looked tough-minded.</span> <span id="s1414">They dressed in whatever they could, whatever you could find, and the women were very practical.</span> <span id="s1415">They wore schtivl, boots.</span> <span id="s1416">In the muck, in the mire and holes in the ground, whatever.</span> <span id="s1417">That was very practical.</span> <span id="s1418">And they really looked very able and very tough.</span> <span id="s1419">I remember the women who went to make aliyah knew what they were going into and they were strong.</span> <span id="s1420">I remember a couple, Feigher was the name.</span> <span id="s1421">They went to Palestine, and she dragged him along.</span> <span id="s1422">And I knew she would cope with anything.</span> <span id="s1423">So they were tough, I mean, they were all tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: When the change came, when the I.R.O. came in and UNRRA left, and the organization of the camp changes so that now there’s elected officials --</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: All men, no women.</span> <span id="s1426">I don't think they would have ever dreamed of it.</span> <span id="s1427">As I think about it now, the thing was so, what’s the term, so male‑oriented.</span> <span id="s1428">By the way, in Israel, I am also told while women served in the military, this and that, that the country was very macho and that men controlled everything.</span> <span id="s1429">And that’s what existed in the camps, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Was there ever any dispute about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: No.</span> <span id="s1432">Nobody ever came to me and said, I was done out of a job, or done out of this because I’m a woman.</span> <span id="s1433">That may have been, but I knew nothing at all about that.</span> <span id="s1434">That's part after later age, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Now the slates of those who were running are all Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: All Zionists slates.</span> <span id="s1437">Bundists were out.</span> <span id="s1438">There was another Jewish agency.</span> <span id="s1439">And I have to mention them, not really Jewish, which did a very effective job.</span> <span id="s1440">And that was the Jewish Labor Committee.</span> <span id="s1441">But they were not a visible presence.</span> <span id="s1442">That is, the Jewish Labor Committee worked with the I.R.C., the International Rescue Committee.</span> <span id="s1443">The leader was Leo Churn.</span> <span id="s1444">Do you know that name?</span> <span id="s1445">Has he been around, involved here?</span> <span id="s1446">He did a great job.</span> <span id="s1447">They were a rescue operation.</span> <span id="s1448">And Makusha Fischer.</span> <span id="s1449">I don't know whether you know that name.</span> <span id="s1450">Louie Fischer was her husband.</span> <span id="s1451">He was an historian on the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1452">Makusha ran the I.R.C. office in Munich, and they did a lot of rescue work.</span> <span id="s1453">They had a woman working for them, for the Jewish Labor Committee.</span> <span id="s1454">She came over from New York.</span> <span id="s1455">The name escapes me at the moment.</span> <span id="s1456">They did a lot of work.</span> <span id="s1457">Now, the work they did had almost a total emphasis, the Jewish Labor Committee, on in some way getting around the restrictive regulations which prevented Jews from marching, from leaving.</span> <span id="s1458">I remember that the I.R.C. itself, which had Makusha Fischer, she was Jewish, and Leo Churn, the head of it, was Jewish, but they had a strong orientation to finding people who had suffered, non‑Jews, Germans who had suffered persecution under Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">03:28:08 For example, the head of this German socialist, Shoemacher -- do you know that name -- he was a crippled guy, lost an eye or something, suffered terribly under the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1460">He was sent by, I think, the International Rescue Committee before the war to Istanbul, where he lived as a refugee.</span> <span id="s1461">After the war, he came back to Germany and the I.R.C. got him out of Germany to the United States, where, I think, he passed away here.</span> <span id="s1462">He was a magnificent figure of a guy.</span> <span id="s1463">And there was great criticism in the Jewish DP camps about that act by the Jewish Labor Committee, Yiddishe Arbiter Comitet.</span> <span id="s1464">But the Jewish Labor Committee, which had a strong anti‑Zionist position before the war, that is, I wouldn’t call it anti– , they were non‑Zionist.</span> <span id="s1465">And my father and everybody who was in the Workmen's Circle, for example, was part of that socialist, Jewish socialists, were not Zionists.</span> <span id="s1466">But when the war came, and the results of the tragedy of the Jewish people were felt, the Jewish Labor Committee abandoned that.</span> <span id="s1467">And I remember receiving into a camp, for an inspection, David Dubinsky came with his wife and deeply affected by what he learned there and what he saw.</span> <span id="s1468">I asked him about it.</span> <span id="s1469">He said, "Bundism is dead."</span> <span id="s1470">You know, the Bund, Arbeiter Ring -- the Arbeiter Ring is not dead, but the anti‑Zionist impulse disappeared with the war's end.</span> <span id="s1471">Now, how much time have we got?</span> <span id="s1472">Now, there were a couple of other –</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: I want to ask you about this just for a second.</span> <span id="s1474">Does this mean that the Jews that you knew in the DP camps were hard put to recognize that there were other victim groups like social democrats, like communists --</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: I think they probably -- those people had been in the DP, in the concentration camps, of course -- knew because they were cheek and jowl beside the people with the different markers on their concentration camp clothing.</span> <span id="s1476">That is, marker for gays, for gypsies, for political opponents, criminals, and various categories.</span> <span id="s1477">So they knew about it.</span> <span id="s1478">But there was very little patience.</span> <span id="s1479">I mean, there was very little time to call a meeting, or whatever, or to meet with them, or to express some protests.</span> <span id="s1480">I think there was some embarrassment about gays, if I am not mistaken, put in the same category.</span> <span id="s1481">I think now, in later years, that survivors have matured on that score.</span> <span id="s1482">I hear it in my own community.</span> <span id="s1483">But there was really no time for that.</span> <span id="s1484">No particular access, no way to make it manifest.</span> <span id="s1485">Now, we talked also about entertainment and culture.</span> <span id="s1486">That became an unbelievable frenzy of activity in the DP camps, all of them, all over Germany.</span> <span id="s1487">Newspapers were organized -- numbers of them representing different aspects, different movements within Zionism or different views or different thoughts.</span> <span id="s1488">And the publishing business was tremendous.</span> <span id="s1489">We also had very active theater in all the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1491">How did they publish these papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s1493">German printing firms.</span> <span id="s1494">I think they found, I think, somewhere through the help of Jewish agencies, what do you call it, not linotype, typesetting kits in the Yiddishe buchstaben, Yiddish Hebrew letters, was sent to Germany to printers, and they were contracted with by the newspaper publishers.</span> <span id="s1495">And pamphlets were being published.</span> <span id="s1496">People began immediately to write about their experiences.</span> <span id="s1497">I remember people bringing me books, small books were published.</span> <span id="s1498">As I say, there was an unbelievable, I would call it a frenzy.</span> <span id="s1499">And then there was theater, all sorts of theaters, dramas, a little hammy, you know, not too great, but they were there.</span> <span id="s1500">I had a theater built out of lumber that we got with cigarettes in Neu Freimann.</span> <span id="s1501">And plays were presented.</span> <span id="s1502">Many of them were traditional plays with the Jewish problems, with the children, and with marriage, and with going away, and all of the rest.</span> <span id="s1503">I don't recall anything that had any political themes -- but I didn't go to the theater too often.</span> <span id="s1504">But as I say, concerts were being played all the time.</span> <span id="s1505">Musicians would come from the United States.</span> <span id="s1506">I am trying to remember, a number of concert violinists came over to entertain in various camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">03:33:23Q: Bernstein?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: No, he is a pianist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Leonard Bernstein?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1511">He came, but he came initially to conduct the Munich Symphony Orchestra.</span> <span id="s1512">Shall I tell you about that?</span> <span id="s1513">That is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1514">And he performed in the Bavarian Opera House.</span> <span id="s1515">The regular concert hall had been destroyed.</span> <span id="s1516">This opera house, I remember, was on Prince Ragetin Strasse.</span> <span id="s1517">By the way, it was right next door to the apartment building which had Hitler's apartment with his lover Eva Braun.</span> <span id="s1518">But anyway, Bernstein came.</span> <span id="s1519">There was a lot of anger on the part of Jews: “Vos kumt er?”</span> <span id="s1520">Why is he coming here to entertain the Germans?</span> <span id="s1521">I went to hear him, I went to see the concert.</span> <span id="s1522">We were seated pretty close.</span> <span id="s1523">With cigarettes, you can get all kinds of better seats.</span> <span id="s1524">It was wintertime.</span> <span id="s1525">I am trying to remember, I think it was the spring of ’46 and it was still pretty cold.</span> <span id="s1526">There was a shortage of soap in Germany.</span> <span id="s1527">And whenever you went into a crowd where Germans were crowding into a room or German Jews the body odors were just horrendous.</span> <span id="s1528">Anyway, we sat down.</span> <span id="s1529">The theater was packed just up to the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">I had never seen Bernstein before, except maybe a picture.</span> <span id="s1531">When he came out, the orchestra was seated.</span> <span id="s1532">Now he comes out – in Germany that was just destroyed -- in his white full dress suit and in that darkness, this dark‑looking, handsome, very handsome‑looking fellow.</span> <span id="s1533">It was like a thunderbolt in that theater.</span> <span id="s1534">There was a moment of silence.</span> <span id="s1535">People were not quite sure how to respond.</span> <span id="s1536">And suddenly, applause, which I thought would tear the roof off the theater.</span> <span id="s1537">They were so enthusiastic.</span> <span id="s1538">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1539">I subsequently felt that his appearance there, this Jewish guy, just so soon after this tremendous raining down, death, and all that they had experienced, and everything else, was some sign they were still part of the world, you know.</span> <span id="s1540">They were still, in a sense, human.</span> <span id="s1541">He has said that himself.</span> <span id="s1542">I read it in a statement he made about the concert he gave in Vienna, where there was also criticism of him.</span> <span id="s1543">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1544">Just swell.</span> <span id="s1545">Then he began the concert and, of course, it was dramatic and magnificent.</span> <span id="s1546">I am not a musical fiend, but I think he chose Mendelssohn.</span> <span id="s1547">He chose music that first was modern, post‑modern or something.</span> <span id="s1548">And then he played some things which had been forbidden.</span> <span id="s1549">Mendelssohn, and I’m trying to remember, one or two things otherwise.</span> <span id="s1550">I am telling you, I will never forget that concert.</span> <span id="s1551">The Jews did not participate in that, and they frowned upon it.</span> <span id="s1552">Subsequently, in later years, he went to Berlin, and there was another problem.</span> <span id="s1553">Again, there was a riot outside the concert hall on the part of Jews in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">03:36:52 You know who is the director of Wahnse, the big Jewish DP camps in Berlin was Dr. Fischer.</span> <span id="s1555">There was a famous Jewish doctor who was the head of the American Medical Association in the United States.</span> <span id="s1556">His name was very famous in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1557">His brother was the UNRRA director in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1558">Anyway, because of the riot, he decided that whenever he made another appearance, he would go to a Jewish DP camp nearby.</span> <span id="s1559">And Bernstein came to Feldafing to perform when he appeared again.</span> <span id="s1560">And in Feldafing, Bernstein led a Jewish orchestra, which had been all Dachau inmates, prisoners of Dachau.</span> <span id="s1561">The Germans had caused that little orchestra to be created, and they used it to confuse the Red Cross officials that used to come occasionally, very, from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1562">There was an orchestra, about eight pieces or something.</span> <span id="s1563">(Abram, Avraham, Abrasha) Stupel was a Lithuanian Jew.</span> <span id="s1564">He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s1565">And he would conduct -- I don't know what happened to him -- where he went.</span> <span id="s1566">And then he conducted it.</span> <span id="s1567">I provided the piano, by the way, which was destroyed immediately after, I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1568">It was just an act on the part of the Jewish people carrying it, of revenge.</span> <span id="s1569">You know, they tossed it off the truck it was being carried on.</span> <span id="s1570">And oh, he played the piano.</span> <span id="s1571">And they asked him to play Gershwin.</span> <span id="s1572">The Jews loved Gershwin.</span> <span id="s1573">He played a concerto about Paris (“An American in Paris”).</span> <span id="s1574">And he played from “Porgy and Bess”, and just tore the house down.</span> <span id="s1575">And I saw Stupel present Bernstein with a Dachau striped haftling shirt, prisoner shirt, with the Jewish star on it.</span> <span id="s1576">And he wept.</span> <span id="s1577">He was so profoundly affected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">So that was it.</span> <span id="s1579">The culture played an extremely important life.</span> <span id="s1580">Jews were just clinging to life in every way.</span> <span id="s1581">And they would have dances.</span> <span id="s1582">I think I told you they danced to American music.</span> <span id="s1583">And a very popular song, because everybody could say the words, and they would all yell it out and sing it, "Open de Door, Richard," which was a big hit, I think, in 1946 or '7.</span> <span id="s1584">And I’d go there occasionally to dance with some of the girls.</span> <span id="s1585">It was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Were there poetry readings also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: No, not poetry, but there were readings, declaamatzias, we used to call them, declamations.</span> <span id="s1588">Some of them had to do with the DP experience.</span> <span id="s1589">Some of them were old.</span> <span id="s1590">I remember some of the declamations which were read were declamations, which my father read to us here in New York.</span> <span id="s1591">That played a very important -- and the Jews were very dramatic and very much involved in that.</span> <span id="s1592">But I know there was poetry written about the Holocaust period.</span> <span id="s1593">There was a guy, he was in my DP camp for a brief time, and he went off to Paris.</span> <span id="s1594">Somebody got him out to France.</span> <span id="s1595">His name begins with a "K", and he wrote songs which have become known as the ghetto songs, concentration camp songs.</span> <span id="s1596">“Zag nisht keinmal az du gehst dem letzten veg”.</span> <span id="s1597">Have you heard that one?</span> <span id="s1598">“Never say that this is your last way to go.”</span> <span id="s1599">There were some other songs he had written, which were sung very emotionally by Jews.</span> <span id="s1600">And he was a Polish Jew.</span> <span id="s1601">And he composed that song.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: You mentioned in passing, when you were in the theater watching Bernstein, and you would be in a room packed with people, because of the lack of soap, it smelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: What were the sanitation conditions in the camp?</span> <span id="s1605">What were the toilet facilities --</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: It depended on the camp.</span> <span id="s1607">In the beginning, when casernes -- caserne is a military building.</span> <span id="s1608">Flunt caserne, loch caserne, various places where soldiers were housed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">03:41:52 It was very bad.</span> <span id="s1610">I mean the conditions were very bad.</span> <span id="s1611">There were no sinks.</span> <span id="s1612">There were these troughs which they used.</span> <span id="s1613">There was no private housing, you know, primitive.</span> <span id="s1614">As time went on, things began to change.</span> <span id="s1615">Neu Freimann came in.</span> <span id="s1616">These were houses, and you had sinks.</span> <span id="s1617">We distributed soap.</span> <span id="s1618">We distributed sanitary materials, toilet paper, towels, and things of that sort.</span> <span id="s1619">Otherwise, people had to go out and organize it for themselves if they needed something.</span> <span id="s1620">But they worked out their own way.</span> <span id="s1621">In places where there was community housing, people used basins.</span> <span id="s1622">They would go to a place.</span> <span id="s1623">It was worked out.</span> <span id="s1624">It was very difficult, but it was worked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Were sanitary napkins brought in for women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Yes, we had sanitary napkins for women.</span> <span id="s1627">We had all of that.</span> <span id="s1628">It was a massive job of organization, of distributing the meats, you know, which were cut.</span> <span id="s1629">We had to weigh them up, as we gave them out in a community kitchen, you would cook up a big bowl of meat, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1630">But in a home where people were cooking by themselves, it had to be weighed out.</span> <span id="s1631">We tried to be as equitable as possible.</span> <span id="s1632">We had hospitals.</span> <span id="s1633">In Foehrenwald, there was a good size hospital which contained operating rooms, and I think about 60 beds.</span> <span id="s1634">It had been used by the Germans for the troops who were living in those casernes.</span> <span id="s1635">We found out later on that the equipment, including a pretty wellequipped surgical suite with the beds and the lights on top, was taken by the Germans, as they were wont to do, from the Romanians, who were their sort of partial allies.</span> <span id="s1636">The Germans just packed up this hospital from Romania and just shipped it right off to Germany.</span> <span id="s1637">Now, we were using that hospital.</span> <span id="s1638">It was very, very important to us.</span> <span id="s1639">We had people operating in there.</span> <span id="s1640">We had all of the equipment, surgical tools, and all of the rest, pretty well-equipped.</span> <span id="s1641">One day, I got a letter from General Clarence Huebner, who was by then the commandant of the American zone, I think.</span> <span id="s1642">The letter said that the hospital is going to be returned, as of such and such a date, to the Romanian government, and that the United States had agreed that this hospital, which had been taken by the Germans, would now be returned.</span> <span id="s1643">Well, I was stunned.</span> <span id="s1644">The doctors came and saw me, and we discussed what to do.</span> <span id="s1645">So I went down to Frankfurt to see Huebner.</span> <span id="s1646">I am trying to remember where he was.</span> <span id="s1647">By the way, he ended up, ultimately, as the Director of Civil Defense for the State of New York.</span> <span id="s1648">He was a decent man.</span> <span id="s1649">I said to him, you know, “These are people who have all sorts of illnesses and problems which they received as a result of the years in the concentration camps and the years of their treatment, and if you take it away, people are going to die.”</span> <span id="s1650">He said he agreed.</span> <span id="s1651">He said, “I am going to appeal this decision.”</span> <span id="s1652">And we won it.</span> <span id="s1653">We kept the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">There was also a railroad, a trunk line going into Foehrenwald, and we shipped foodstuffs, coal, wood, and other supplies on it.</span> <span id="s1655">A locomotive and two or three freight cars ran along the short line, about two miles.</span> <span id="s1656">And they wanted that back, too.</span> <span id="s1657">That also came from Romania.</span> <span id="s1658">And we beat them on that one, too.</span> <span id="s1659">Because if they had done that, if we didn't have that short spur, I don't know how we would have gotten tons of potatoes and fuel and other stuff into the camp.</span> <span id="s1660">All kinds of problems.</span> <span id="s1661">Germans said we were holding their stuff, and we had to fight them.</span> <span id="s1662">We had all kinds of difficulties.</span> <span id="s1663">Now the Israelis came, people checking on immigration to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1664">Dentists came to check the teeth of people going to Palestine because they did not want to have an enormous dental burden at the time that the state was being established.</span> <span id="s1665">And they had all kinds of problems.</span> <span id="s1666">So we had a dental clinic, which was equipped by the military.</span> <span id="s1667">They gave us about 15 or so chairs, which were run, not by electricity, but by a foot pedal.</span> <span id="s1668">And we had 15 or so dentists, zahnarzt in there, doing dental work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">03:47:10 But now something interesting happened.</span> <span id="s1670">Some of these dentists had been in the Soviet Union during the war.</span> <span id="s1671">And they’d learned the Soviet system.</span> <span id="s1672">So what would happen was, a Jew would come in a DP and he’d get free dental care.</span> <span id="s1673">He would present himself and the dentist would say “Look, my friend, I can't take you now.</span> <span id="s1674">It’s very busy.</span> <span id="s1675">It will be about a month.</span> <span id="s1676">Come back.”</span> <span id="s1677">And this guy has a toothache.</span> <span id="s1678">He says, “I can't come back in a month.”</span> <span id="s1679">So then the dentist would say -- and this is exactly a duplicate of Soviet system corruption in plumbing or anything -- “Look, I will tell you what.</span> <span id="s1680">If you want fast service, you come to my house.</span> <span id="s1681">I have a dental chair and I will take you right away.”</span> <span id="s1682">You understand there was a competition between UNRRA and this guy's private interests.</span> <span id="s1683">And I can't tell you what happened, what used to happen.</span> <span id="s1684">Then they were competing among themselves for the business, and they were doing things to patients of other people.</span> <span id="s1685">We had a big scandal.</span> <span id="s1686">I am not going to tell you all, because it is too horrible to remember.</span> <span id="s1687">But we had to reform that.</span> <span id="s1688">We had to kick some people out.</span> <span id="s1689">It was “Nellie Bar the Door.”</span> <span id="s1690">But imagine, altogether, we did get out.</span> <span id="s1691">When Gehretzreid was open, this Israeli departure center we had, suddenly thousands of people began to show up from all over, Jews, to be processed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">03:48:37 We had a dental problem of enormous proportions in this place, Gehretzreid.</span> <span id="s1693">But as I say, everything, I guess, seemed to work.</span> <span id="s1694">Sometimes you turned your head away.</span> <span id="s1695">I don't want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1696">And when you turn back, it was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Were a lot of the dental problems a function of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Of the war.</span> <span id="s1699">Lack of diet and the rest.</span> <span id="s1700">You see people with occluded, badly occluded, teeth falling out, rotting gums, and all of the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: And you actually had facilities to give people dentures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1703">I forgot to mention, the chairs and some of the instrumentation came from the army.</span> <span id="s1704">But teeth and drugs and other things came from the JDC.</span> <span id="s1705">They did a fantastic job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: What other effects, physical effects did you see?</span> <span id="s1707">Were there people with -- I don't know -- broken legs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: We had all of that.</span> <span id="s1709">One of the most visible effects was the distended stomachs.</span> <span id="s1710">Women, you could see a lot on women.</span> <span id="s1711">I don't know whether it occurs more on women than on men, but I don't know what produces that but when you are underfed for a long time, children, babies you see that.</span> <span id="s1712">You have distention of the stomachs.</span> <span id="s1713">I remember there was a Hungarian woman, who was a clerk, a brilliant, intellectual woman.</span> <span id="s1714">I sent her to the United States.</span> <span id="s1715">And she was to marry a guy from her town who was a doctor here.</span> <span id="s1716">When I came over, I met them.</span> <span id="s1717">And he met me, took me aside.</span> <span id="s1718">And he said, "Look at her stomach."</span> <span id="s1719">He spoke about her distention.</span> <span id="s1720">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1721">Eventually, she ended up in the New York Public Library as the curator of the Hungarian collection -- they have a big Hungarian collection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: How long did you see the effects?</span> <span id="s1723">The physical kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1725">I think I saw them all of the time.</span> <span id="s1726">They always looked bad to me.</span> <span id="s1727">I could tell.</span> <span id="s1728">Until they really came over here and stayed here for a couple of years, I could see, I could just look, pass somebody in the street, and say that's a Jewish DP.</span> <span id="s1729">There was something about them physically.</span> <span id="s1730">Of course, they had scars of various sorts, the numbers and -- it's tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: What about education?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: Now -- yeah, education.</span> <span id="s1733">There was adult education.</span> <span id="s1734">And there was ORT, trade schools, fachshul.</span> <span id="s1735">We had a problem getting, especially men, not the women, men into these trades schools.</span> <span id="s1736">I don't know, they were not interested.</span> <span id="s1737">They didn't see their future as working as watchmakers or tooth technicians.</span> <span id="s1738">We had to convince them by giving them Joint packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">03:51:38 Not we, the ORT did.</span> <span id="s1740">Rabbi Max Braude, who had been a chaplain in the military, did some work with DPs.</span> <span id="s1741">And when he came back here, he was named World ORT Director.</span> <span id="s1742">Anyway, they had to give them special inducements which were packages, a supplementary packet, to get them into these schools.</span> <span id="s1743">This happened while Eisenhower was there, and looked in at a school.</span> <span id="s1744">We took him to another school and a guy had gone to two schools, he got two packages, and he really didn't attend either one.</span> <span id="s1745">We had a problem with that.</span> <span id="s1746">That was one of the unattractive things.</span> <span id="s1747">I remember, Jews were very good working in places where they had some authority.</span> <span id="s1748">They were clerks, assigning people to houses, or doing whatever.</span> <span id="s1749">But when it came to some of the physical things, stacking wood, clearing away garbage, forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">03:52:47 We could not get any volunteers.</span> <span id="s1751">So one day, a group of American Jews came through one of the camps, and they passed by.</span> <span id="s1752">They saw it looked like maybe a ghetto, you know.</span> <span id="s1753">A guy sitting in the sun smoking cigarettes, and nearby a German is working, cleaning up the street.</span> <span id="s1754">So the American, applying his standards, called the guy over and said in Yiddish, "Why aren't you working?</span> <span id="s1755">This is your town, this is where you live.</span> <span id="s1756">Why aren't you cleaning up?"</span> <span id="s1757">The man replied, "I worked for them for five years.</span> <span id="s1758">Now they will work for me."</span> <span id="s1759">That's what he said.</span> <span id="s1760">I don't know whether it was a rationalization, but, you know, that kind of work is not attractive.</span> <span id="s1761">We see it in Israel today.</span> <span id="s1762">Even Russians who come, or even the Jews who came, they don't clean up.</span> <span id="s1763">The Palestinians, Arabs were cleaning up.</span> <span id="s1764">And that is still happening today.</span> <span id="s1765">And we had a problem.</span> <span id="s1766">We were trying to convince the people because it is an American tradition that you work in your own community.</span> <span id="s1767">It's your wood.</span> <span id="s1768">We had a lot of vandalism, for example, within the houses.</span> <span id="s1769">And it was irresponsible, sometimes done in anger.</span> <span id="s1770">They would tear banisters off the steps.</span> <span id="s1771">Now, the houses were German-owned, and they were saying, “To hell with them.”</span> <span id="s1772">But they didn't realize that other Jews, when they left, had to come in there.</span> <span id="s1773">And then, ultimately, Uncle Sam picked up the bill.</span> <span id="s1774">All these places were brought back spanking new by the United States.</span> <span id="s1775">They had that commitment.</span> <span id="s1776">That included the house I lived in, by the way.</span> <span id="s1777">We would have some wild parties there, and they would tear down pictures from the wall and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: You lived in a villa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: I lived in a big house, yeah, big villa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: With a maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: Two maids.</span> <span id="s1782">A cook and a maid.</span> <span id="s1783">“Vas felt er?”</span> <span id="s1784">my mother would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Did they teach languages there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1787">Now most were English classes, given by people who spoke English.</span> <span id="s1788">They were very good and very useful.</span> <span id="s1789">There was elementary school education for small children.</span> <span id="s1790">Schools were organized and they were quite good.</span> <span id="s1791">And there was confusion as to what language -- should they learn Hebrew?</span> <span id="s1792">Where were you going?</span> <span id="s1793">If you're going to Palestine, you had to learn some Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1794">If you were going to America, you learned English.</span> <span id="s1795">But they were very assiduous.</span> <span id="s1796">We suffered shortages of supplies, mainly, but we made do.</span> <span id="s1797">In Foehrenwald, I have to talk about, there were streets.</span> <span id="s1798">All of the streets were named after Nazis when the camp was taken.</span> <span id="s1799">You had Adolph Hitler Platz, Goebbels Strasse, Goering Strasse.</span> <span id="s1800">And of course, no Jew is going to say he lives on Goering Strasse or on Adolph Hitler Platz.</span> <span id="s1801">So they tore all these signs down, and they named these streets after American states.</span> <span id="s1802">And that was constantly a source of humor.</span> <span id="s1803">“Vu voynt er?</span> <span id="s1804">Where do you live?</span> <span id="s1805">On the Michiganiga Gass.</span> <span id="s1806">They added a syllable, so Michigan became Michiganiga.</span> <span id="s1807">“Ich voyn oyf dem kantuzki” because the "C" in Polish is a sibilant like an "S." That's the way they named their streets.</span> <span id="s1808">It was so funny.</span> <span id="s1809">It was very serious.</span> <span id="s1810">An American would come in and ask him where do you live, he would say Ochyo.</span> <span id="s1811">What?</span> <span id="s1812">Ochyo -- Ohio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Ok, let’s cut the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Well, I want to say a few words about the meaning, the significance for the Jewish community, for Jewish history, of the whole DP experience.</span> <span id="s1815">We are commanded to communicate to the world what it is Jews experienced during this period of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1816">And the principal vehicle for that is the DP survivor community.</span> <span id="s1817">Both those survivors who survived the horrors, and they are a smaller number of the concentration camps and the extermination camps, and those who survived by fleeing into the woods, or fighting in the Soviet army, or living as refugees within the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1818">Without them, the world would not know anything at all about these experiences.</span> <span id="s1819">So I think, to the degree that we are commanded to tell the story and retell it to generations which follow us, they serve this vital purpose.</span> <span id="s1820">They are also an indication of the vitality, the will to life, and to survival of the Jewish community, both the survivors and the rest of us, who face formidable challenges to our survival.</span> <span id="s1821">These people were so grimly determined.</span> <span id="s1822">It used to seem to me that if I had children, I would say to them maybe I don't want them to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s1823">Who needs that kind of threat hanging over our lives?</span> <span id="s1824">Yet, these people produced children, recreated their families.</span> <span id="s1825">We could not provide the beds, to birth these children that they needed.</span> <span id="s1826">A great will, a great desire, even to be found in the so-called black market, to provide the means for survival and the means to support whatever families they would create.</span> <span id="s1827">They were really the phoenix rising out of the ashes of European Jewry.</span> <span id="s1828">And they have gone on to produce great things, both here and in Israel.</span> <span id="s1829">All over the United States, I know Jews who are survivors and are wonderfully contributing members of society.</span> <span id="s1830">There is so much talk about immigrants coming in, and the threats which are posed by immigrants to the American economy and the American people.</span> <span id="s1831">The Jews of Europe who came here did nothing but produce life and energy and things that we need in order to maintain the richness of our society.</span> <span id="s1832">So it's an important thing.</span> <span id="s1833">We have to be truly thankful to these people and understanding of who they were, what motivated them, and the dangers which they lived through.</span> <span id="s1834">Even after the Holocaust appeared to have ended came this period.</span> <span id="s1835">We know so much about the sufferings, but now we ought to know more about the work which they did, the sacrifices which they have made.</span> <span id="s1836">Do you agree with me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: That was very well put.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">End of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0284 PAGE 2</span></p></body></html>
