Snyderman and M. Hirsch (Isaac, we're going to back to go back to your earliest memories.</span> <span id="s17">You were born in Kiev?)</span> <span id="s18">Yes.</span> <span id="s19">(So in Kiev or nearby?)</span> <span id="s20">Exactly in Kiev.</span> <span id="s21">(The years just preceding the war.)</span> <span id="s22">In 1936, so just before the war.</span> <span id="s23">Here it was three years, in the Soviet Union five.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">(In your home, you were living with your mother and father and who else?)</span> <span id="s25">It's a big family.</span> <span id="s26">We have a room, as I know - not remember, but know - there lived my mother's parents and some of our relatives.</span> <span id="s27">(Which relatives?)</span> <span id="s28">From my father's side.</span> <span id="s29">Maybe his aunt and her son.</span> <span id="s30">(Your father's cousin...) Maybe, but it's not very close.</span> <span id="s31">I don't know how many,-- the aunt lives in one room, the cousin lives in another room, my parents live in a third room with my mother's parents.</span> <span id="s32">(Was it pleasant?</span> <span id="s33">Did people get along?)</span> <span id="s34">Yes.</span> <span id="s35">What I know.</span> <span id="s36">I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s37">I was little, maybe one year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Because after that we moved to a place where my father began to work.</span> <span id="s39">It was in the little village, like a station, (a small town?)</span> <span id="s40">No, it's not that big.</span> <span id="s41">Like a station.</span> <span id="s42">It's near Stary Oskol'.</span> <span id="s43">It's not far from Voronezh, which is a city in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s44">You can find it.</span> <span id="s45">[looking on map] In this place we lived some time.</span> <span id="s46">I don't remember how long.</span> <span id="s47">After that we came back to Kiev, approximately in 1940, where father began to work on his Ph.D.</span> <span id="s48">I don't remember exactly what year this was, but we lived in Kiev before the beginning of the war, until 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">(Your father was working...) In Kiev he was working on his Ph.D. (And your mother...) I think she worked in that time like a doctor, too, because she graduated from medical institute, in some hospital.</span> <span id="s50">(So it's your grandparents who are taking care of you.)</span> <span id="s51">Yes, my grandmother, my mother's mother, she took care of me all life.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">(Did you ever hear Yiddish spoken in the home?)</span> <span id="s53">Yes, I heard this because my grandfather very often spoke with my grandmother in Yiddish, and I think he was religious, because he not only spoke Yiddish, he goes to... I don't know about synagogue because I don't remember... maybe before the war, but what I remember after the war, he prayed at home some days and I think that he goes to some house sometimes.</span> <span id="s54">(Somebody may have had a Torah hidden away...) Yes.</span> <span id="s55">So that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">(So even if in the home you weren't able, for example, to get matzos for Passover--) Yes, because there are some places, not legal, illegal, but people in these places can buy.</span> <span id="s57">I don't remember in Kiev because I was too young for that, but I remember that much later we buy in some places, in Baltic republics, or from Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">(When did you first realize you were Jewish?)</span> <span id="s59">I think that it happened when I graduated from high school and wanted to go to the institute.</span> <span id="s60">In our family most of our relatives were doctors, so special atmosphere.</span> <span id="s61">And of course I wanted to go to medical school.</span> <span id="s62">Maybe not "of course," but I want this, I know it exactly.</span> <span id="s63">(It was expected of you, but at the same time you wanted to do it?)</span> <span id="s64">Yes, but I cannot do it because at that time in the Soviet Union, the anti-semitism had a very high level.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">In 1952 there are doctor's process, if you remember.</span> <span id="s66">(The Doctors' Trials...) Yes.</span> <span id="s67">In that time doctors were free, but the attitude toward the Jewish people, toward medical Jewish people was not very good.</span> <span id="s68">In medical school, in the Ukraine especially, Jewish students cannot be admitted.</span> <span id="s69">So my parents decided that I didn't have the chance to go to medical school.</span> <span id="s70">And because I was not a bad student in math, I went to the polytechnic institute, but I cannot be admitted in the polytechnic institute in Kiev, so I moved to another city, Dneipropetrovsk, where my father worked at that time, and I became a student in the engineering college.</span> <span id="s71">After that I moved to Khar'kov with my father.</span> <span id="s72">I began to study there in the polytechnic institute.</span> <span id="s73">So this is the first time when I understand what it means to be Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">(That means that you were pretty well protected during the terrible war years from feeling the anti-semitism around you...) I think maybe.</span> <span id="s75">But maybe I don't remember because during the war I was about six or seven years old when I started first grade in school in 1943.</span> <span id="s76">I cannot remember exactly how I felt at that time.</span> <span id="s77">For me these years - I don't remember these years very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">(Is it because there's a lot of moving around and a lot of turmoil?</span> <span id="s79">Maybe because there was some unpleasantness that you don't wish to remember?</span> <span id="s80">These war years weren't easy years.</span> <span id="s81">I remember your mother saying she was sick, too, your father was away and she was worried about him.</span> <span id="s82">So you were too young to be aware of those things...) I think maybe.</span> <span id="s83">I don't know why, but these years go from my memory.</span> <span id="s84">(So you really don't remember much from the war years...) No, I remember that this was a hard time.</span> <span id="s85">It was not enough to eat.</span> <span id="s86">But I don't remember what is my relations with other children.</span> <span id="s87">I know that I was good in school because I have these papers, and my mother tells me I was.</span> <span id="s88">I remember, but maybe from my mother, how I felt when I met my father in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">(Your father surprised you one day, - He came to the school and looked for you...) Yes.</span> <span id="s90">(And you don't remember that moment?)</span> <span id="s91">I remember, but I think it happened because my mother many times told me about this moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">(What do you remember?)</span> <span id="s93">For me, when he came to school, for me it was very surprising.</span> <span id="s94">I cannot remember exactly his face and he was in a military uniform.</span> <span id="s95">It was after three years.</span> <span id="s96">(You hadn't seen him for three years, and at this point you're about eight years old?)</span> <span id="s97">I was eight.</span> <span id="s98">(What city are you in now?)</span> <span id="s99">Boguruslan.</span> <span id="s100">It's in the East part, near the Ural mountains.</span> <span id="s101">(He went to the home of your aunt, I guess...) No, my mother was not at home.</span> <span id="s102">She moved to her sister's.</span> <span id="s103">My father took me and we went in the direction in which my mother was going.</span> <span id="s104">He met her in Kuibyshev train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">(When you saw him, were you frightened?</span> <span id="s106">What was the reaction that you know you had?)</span> <span id="s107">I jumped into his arms and I think I was happy.</span> <span id="s108">Also I wanted to go with him so he could see what I can do, how I am skiing.</span> <span id="s109">I think that in this place it's dangerous for children, maybe for Jewish children, too, to go skiing alone.</span> <span id="s110">So any time my grandfather go with me.</span> <span id="s111">He had great patience with me while I was skiing.</span> <span id="s112">This place is very cold in winter.</span> <span id="s113">When my father came, he went with me.</span> <span id="s114">It's some mountain from which I ski.</span> <span id="s115">(You actually had skis that you rented there?)</span> <span id="s116">Little skis which are made.</span> <span id="s117">Not the same kind of skis.</span> <span id="s118">Made from wood, but they're made not in the shops.</span> <span id="s119">They're made by hand.</span> <span id="s120">He stayed and I went from the mountain.</span> <span id="s121">But it was very cold.</span> <span id="s122">At that time he came from Poland, I think.</span> <span id="s123">He didn't like when it's cold.</span> <span id="s124">So he cannot stay.</span> <span id="s125">He is very frozen.</span> <span id="s126">I remember that after very little time, he said he is very frozen and we need to go back.</span> <span id="s127">It's what I remember from this time.</span> <span id="s128">(So that happened the day your father came back for you?)</span> <span id="s129">Yes.</span> <span id="s130">(He was actually willing to watch you ski, but he couldn't stay too long...) Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">(So that was a brief opportunity to be with your father.</span> <span id="s132">And then the war continued.</span> <span id="s133">Do you remember when you returned home after that, to Kiev?)</span> <span id="s134">I remember that my father came a second time, and we all, my mother, her parents, moved to Kiev.</span> <span id="s135">It was a long trip, I don't remember how many days.</span> <span id="s136">It was on the train.</span> <span id="s137">(Would this be 1944 or 1945?)</span> <span id="s138">1945.</span> <span id="s139">(So has the war officially ended?)</span> <span id="s140">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">We came to Kiev and it was very surprising, to see a big city.</span> <span id="s142">I forgot what it was before.</span> <span id="s143">So these beautiful streets, some of the buildings are destroyed.</span> <span id="s144">But for me it all seems new.</span> <span id="s145">So it was very surprising for me.</span> <span id="s146">Except that I remember that in the shops there is food that I don't see before.</span> <span id="s147">(Was that because food was purchased in a marketplace?)</span> <span id="s148">No, there are in the shops food, but it was very expensive, maybe.</span> <span id="s149">I don't remember exactly why, but it was expensive.</span> <span id="s150">Not everyone could buy it.</span> <span id="s151">(And even with your mother working and your father sending money, even so it was hard for you to get enough food?)</span> <span id="s152">Of course, but in the place where we lived before there is not enough food for anybody.</span> <span id="s153">But here in some shops, I think there were special shops - I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s154">I think like cooperative shops, not exactly.</span> <span id="s155">So the prices were much more, people who work couldn't buy in these shops regularly.</span> <span id="s156">It does not matter what job.</span> <span id="s157">If it's government job, it's a small salary.</span> <span id="s158">People cannot afford.</span> <span id="s159">Sometimes they can, on some holidays maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">But when I see this, especially ice cream - I had never seen it before.</span> <span id="s161">So for me it was all new.</span> <span id="s162">But I remember that we lived with father.</span> <span id="s163">He was on vacation some days, so it's not a long time, and he moved to his place in Germany and we stayed.</span> <span id="s164">And I begin to study in his school.</span> <span id="s165">I was in fourth grade.</span> <span id="s166">After I graduated from fourth grade we went with my mother to my father's place in Weimar, Germany.</span> <span id="s167">And I studied there in fifth grade.</span> <span id="s168">(There was a Russian school there?)</span> <span id="s169">Yes, for the children whose parents were in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">(What was the difference between the schools in Kiev and Weimar?</span> <span id="s171">Was one better than the other?)</span> <span id="s172">No, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s173">I think I don't feel it.</span> <span id="s174">(From what your mother described, there was a big change in your way of living...) But it's not what I remember.</span> <span id="s175">It was a big change because in Kiev we lived in a little room with a big family.</span> <span id="s176">We didn't have a living room.</span> <span id="s177">It cannot be compared.</span> <span id="s178">And we come to Germany and get - I don't remember - it's the first time we lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s179">It was for me, ...I think it was a change which was bigger than the change now from our apartment in Khar'kov and our apartment here.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">(What did that do for your spirits?</span> <span id="s181">Did it make you feel more cheerful and happy about life, or was it not important to you?)</span> <span id="s182">I think in these years it was not important.</span> <span id="s183">Maybe for me it was important that I was with my father.</span> <span id="s184">Of course I liked him and he can spend some time with me.</span> <span id="s185">What I remember, most of the time he works very hard.</span> <span id="s186">But sometimes he'd go with me to cinema or to theater when a performance comes.</span> <span id="s187">Sometimes from Moscow come performances and we go and see them.</span> <span id="s188">I remember that most time my father worked.</span> <span id="s189">But when he went for his job to another city, he takes me and I go with him in car.</span> <span id="s190">So for me, I liked it.</span> <span id="s191">Here I began to learn how to drive.</span> <span id="s192">(You were pretty young, weren't you?)</span> <span id="s193">Yes, but I sit near him.</span> <span id="s194">(So it was an opportunity to get to know your father after being apart for so long...) Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">(At this point were you aware of any worries in the family.</span> <span id="s196">It was after the war, we are told, that more anti-semitism became more obvious after the initial Communist slogans of equality prior to the war, this seemed to change.</span> <span id="s197">Did you know if your parents were concerned about this?)</span> <span id="s198">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s199">I begin to understand something when I came back to Kiev and I was in the high school.</span> <span id="s200">At that time in the Soviet Union, begins the time of cosmopolitanism against Jewish people.</span> <span id="s201">Some of the people about what I saw the articles that they were bad.</span> <span id="s202">I know these people.</span> <span id="s203">They are our friends or they're in our family.</span> <span id="s204">So I begin to understand that something is wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">As I began to understand later, my uncle, my father has a sister, her husband is a very great scientist in the Soviet Union, and not only in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s206">He is known in the world, I think, because it's really very big person in biochemistry.</span> <span id="s207">(His name?)</span> <span id="s208">Boris Goldstein.</span> <span id="s209">He was not an ordinary person.</span> <span id="s210">He was very intelligent, and he thinks not like others.</span> <span id="s211">So sometimes he said his opinion about something.</span> <span id="s212">Maybe the first time I don't understand him, but when I became older, I began to understand.</span> <span id="s213">When I compare what has happened and what he says, I begin to understand that there are many bad things in the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">In the Soviet Union, in school, all people are learning that all is going Okay, that the government is the best in the world.</span> <span id="s215">And if something is not best, then it's better than someplace else in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">So students learned that only one way is right, the way which is given by Lenin.</span> <span id="s217">It's right - all others are wrong.</span> <span id="s218">All other people are bad.</span> <span id="s219">If something happened in other places of the world, so it's very hard for children who are in the school or in some other institute, to understand what is happening.</span> <span id="s220">Because any time when you listen to the radio, when you watch TV - oh, you cannot watch TV at that time in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s221">We have in 1953 only.</span> <span id="s222">But from newspapers, the radio, any people, only one kind of slogans can be heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">(So your thoughts were imposed upon you.</span> <span id="s224">This Boris Goldstein was outspoken apparently in saying this is not the way to educate people.)</span> <span id="s225">Yes.</span> <span id="s226">But we met not too frequently and he said not too much because it was very dangerous in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s227">(So this was in private gatherings...) Of course.</span> <span id="s228">(And then something happened to him?)</span> <span id="s229">To him nothing happened.</span> <span id="s230">(He was never detained or questioned?)</span> <span id="s231">No.</span> <span id="s232">(He opened your eyes.)</span> <span id="s233">Yes.</span> <span id="s234">(But when others like him were captured and imprisoned for those comments, you knew that was not a good reason...) Of course.</span> <span id="s235">Especially when this happened with the doctors.</span> <span id="s236">Because we lived in this doctors' neighborhood, so you know that these people are very good.</span> <span id="s237">They cannot do anything bad for others.</span> <span id="s238">We just know what the government said about these people is not right.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">(So here you've been back from Weimar since 1947.</span> <span id="s240">You're studying.</span> <span id="s241">At this point you're in your teens.</span> <span id="s242">You're starting to really be aware of the broader world.)</span> <span id="s243">Yes.</span> <span id="s244">(Did this worry you, what was happening?</span> <span id="s245">Were you frightened now because of your Jewishness?)</span> <span id="s246">Of course.</span> <span id="s247">(So this is the first time you're afraid even though you've lived through a terrible war...) Maybe I wasn't afraid because I was very young.</span> <span id="s248">But now I began to understand that for Jewish people in the country is no freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">(When you're about 16, did you actually apply to medical school?)</span> <span id="s250">No, because my mother didn't think I had any chance to get into school.</span> <span id="s251">Because if the student who graduated from high school didn't go to the institute, he must go to the army.</span> <span id="s252">So she was afraid, if I cannot be in the institute, I can be in the army.</span> <span id="s253">So she want that I go only to the institute.</span> <span id="s254">So I take exams in the polytechnic institute.</span> <span id="s255">(This had to be a strategy for many Jewish parents to try to keep their sons out of the army...) Yes.</span> <span id="s256">(And the reason for that was what?)</span> <span id="s257">I think that there are several reasons.</span> <span id="s258">The army in the Soviet Union is so hard for any young man, but for Jews especially, to be in the army in the level of soldiers, there is a lot of anti-semitism, a lot of crime in the army.</span> <span id="s259">The oldest are beating the youngest.</span> <span id="s260">Some of them can be killed.</span> <span id="s261">I know some Jewish people who were killed in the army.</span> <span id="s262">(They just died from the severe beatings...) Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Especially we have a not very far relative who died, but it was in the 1970s.</span> <span id="s264">(But this is a tradition that goes back even to the tsarist army...) And the conditions for living in the army are, in my opinion, like in jail, the bad jail.</span> <span id="s265">I feel it when I was one month in the army.</span> <span id="s266">All students in the Soviet Union, in most institutes at the time when I studied, there is a military department.</span> <span id="s267">All male students have to do some military service.</span> <span id="s268">I was lucky because I must only one month be in the army.</span> <span id="s269">Before, it was more.</span> <span id="s270">This time for me was the most difficult, I think, in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">(Can you describe it for us?)</span> <span id="s272">The first thing which I hate is that the man who is not very educated and is very violent.</span> <span id="s273">(This is an officer?)</span> <span id="s274">No, like sergeant.</span> <span id="s275">The students are divided into tens.</span> <span id="s276">They especially for students find the sergeant who is not educated, he hates educated people, and is very violent.</span> <span id="s277">So he gave orders that didn't have any sense.</span> <span id="s278">We have forty minutes for rest.</span> <span id="s279">And we are in the forest.</span> <span id="s280">There are a lot of pine cones.</span> <span id="s281">He begins to pick them up and put them in the place.</span> <span id="s282">After hard work, the same thing.</span> <span id="s283">He wanted to make slaves of us, I think.</span> <span id="s284">That is the first thing that is very hard for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Another thing, the tent where we have to live.</span> <span id="s286">It's a little tent for the sergeant and the students.</span> <span id="s287">So what is this tent?</span> <span id="s288">A bed is made of wood, and all one next to the other.</span> <span id="s289">It's terrible to describe, how you can sleep in this.</span> <span id="s290">(How wide is this bed?)</span> <span id="s291">Ten people.</span> <span id="s292">If you need to turn, the person next to you must turn too.</span> <span id="s293">Maybe like the size of half the wall.</span> <span id="s294">(So ten bodies had less than a foot...) Yes.</span> <span id="s295">Maybe fifteen feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Then other living conditions - the food that they give.</span> <span id="s297">Maybe it's harder for me, but what I see, most of the students who are not so choosy in their food.</span> <span id="s298">The food was terrible.</span> <span id="s299">For me it's not hard physically, because my physical condition is good.</span> <span id="s300">For most students physically, because we stayed early at night and must run about three kilometers, about two miles, and then we go to the gym and must do some exercises.</span> <span id="s301">Early in the morning.</span> <span id="s302">(Before sunrise?)</span> <span id="s303">At about 6:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s304">After that we go and have breakfast.</span> <span id="s305">And after breakfast, we must go to study.</span> <span id="s306">But the study is we have one class in one place and after the second, after fourteen minutes, but the distance is so far that this fourteen minutes we must run.</span> <span id="s307">So the people must be in very good physical condition.</span> <span id="s308">For me it's a very hard time.</span> <span id="s309">(So you did this before you entered institute?)</span> <span id="s310">Not before, when I studied in the institute, after four years.</span> <span id="s311">I studied five years.</span> <span id="s312">After four years, in the summertime, all males go.</span> <span id="s313">(That's a summer program then?)</span> <span id="s314">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">(Was there any anti-semitism there?)</span> <span id="s316">Oh, there is some, but we had not many Jewish students in this institute.</span> <span id="s317">(During the month of the army training...)

only one thing can happen - I can be fired.</span> <span id="s604">This happened in 1976.</span> <span id="s605">I was fired.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">(Why?)</span> <span id="s607">It was because

<span id="s610">In this academy there are a lot of Jewish professors.</span> <span id="s611">Why?</span> <span id="s612">Because the chairman who came to Khar'kov and established this academy was a smart man.</span> <span id="s613">He came from Moscow.</span> <span id="s614">And he understands that he can make a good college only if he has good professional teachers.</span> <span id="s615">It's a military academy.</span> <span id="s616">And he hired many good Jewish scientists who cannot find a job in another place.</span> <span id="s617">And for a few years, it became a very strong military academy.</span> <span id="s618">It's not exactly academy, maybe college.</span> <span id="s619">It works exactly like an academy.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">In Soviet military office, there are in

many places, in many cities.</span> <span id="s623">But what made the chairman of our military college - he very quickly lifted the level of our college so it seems like academy.</span> <span id="s624">Because not in all places, in all colleges, can you get a Ph.D.</span> <span id="s625">In Ph.D.s there are two levels in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s626">The first level is the Candidate of Ph.D., and the second level, which is higher, is Doctor of Science.</span> <span id="s627">So for Doctor of Science you have to have special scientists' union which has a lot of Doctors, so any of the colleges can accept this union.</span> <span id="s628">But our college has three of them.</span> <span id="s629">It's more than any other institutes in Khar'kov even.</span> <span id="s630">So it's a very good college for studying and working.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">But in 1969 or something like that, he was retired, and came in another person, and when the chairman is changing, he changed his helpers too, sometimes.</span> <span id="s632">So the atmosphere in this college became worse, and then came the third chairman, and with him came the, like commissar.</span>

Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">So, if you know, the government asked the president of Soviet academy, Keldish, how long does it take that he can fire all Jewish scientists, and he said he's need about ten years.</span> <span id="s646">So in this time they begin to fire good Jewish people from these places.</span> <span id="s647">And because we have this kind of person in our Party department, they decided to fire Jewish professors from the college, and they did their job very well.</span> <span id="s648">They fired most of Jewish professors.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">(This is the climate now that you're living in... How long did you remain unemployed?)</span> <span id="s650">But what I want to tell you is that I was not disappointed because I wanted to leave the Soviet Union, and I cannot do it because of my work in this department in the military academy.</span> <span id="s651">So I need to have more than five years after that.</span> <span id="s652">But you see, it's very hard for a Jewish scientist to leave his job because to find another job is very hard.</span> <span id="s653">But I was maybe lucky in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">[TAPE 2] When I was fired from the academy, at the same time I can find a job in like three months at Khar'kov State University.</span> <span id="s655">And my chairman from the department at the military engineering academy was not an ordinary person.</span> <span id="s656">He was a nice man, a Russian.</span> <span id="s657">And what he did, he went from the academy because the Jewish professors were fired.</span> <span id="s658">He was a good professor, well-known in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s659">His name is Brislavsky.</span> <span id="s660">He went to the civil engineering institute.</span> <span id="s661">At that time the mechanical department was very bad.</span> <span id="s662">They didn't have good teachers like in many Soviet institutes now.</span> <span id="s663">And he said that he can begin to work there if they give him the chance to hire the person he wants.</span> <span id="s664">And because they want the famous professor in their institute, and he was very strong, he talked with them several times, and after three months he can hire me in this department.</span> <span id="s665">So I continued to work with him in the civil engineering institute.</span> <span id="s666">And I worked in this department before I left the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s667">(Until your departure...)

Yes.</span> <span id="s696">(That was very hard for the typical individual to read between the lines...) These friends worked in this academy, I think somehow are separated from all others because the attitudes between professors in the academy and each other.</span> <span id="s697">They didn't have other troubles which Jews people, other people who worked in the offices or the companies and other places.</span> <span id="s698">Sometimes we have a special climate in this academy.</span> <span id="s699">After several years this climate was destroyed.</span> <span id="s700">But from the beginning, because of the chairman, we had a special climate.</span> <span id="s701">People worked hard and they're all in this work, and they didn't think about other kind of problems.</span> <span id="s702">Maybe they were separated from us and didn't realize what was happening in political life.</span> <span id="s703">They are not interested in this kind of life.</span> <span id="s704">Because I think that most intelligent people understand that what they have in the newspapers is a lie.</span> <span id="s705">Because after Khrushchev has a speech at the Communist meeting and they talked about what Stalin did, many people who had a brain understand that what they know before is a lie.</span> <span id="s706">So why do they need to believe in all what the newspapers tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">(In Kiev, did you know of any refuseniks?)</span> <span id="s708">No, I didn't know refuseniks.</span> <span id="s709">But one of my friends, his name is Schwartz - now he is here - he applied to leave at the same time as this Silverstein, but he didn't receive permission.</span> <span id="s710">He was late.</span> <span id="s711">They stopped.</span> <span id="s712">At that time he was fired from his job because he applied to leave.</span> <span id="s713">In Kiev they organized a committee for Jews who want to leave, and he was a member of this committee.</span> <span id="s714">So they did something for notifying people who want to leave.</span> <span id="s715">They wrote letters, they applied to the West, but what he told me is that maybe after one year, the KGB began to push them, and some of the people from their committee are in jail.</span> <span id="s716">So he stopped.</span> <span id="s717">And all years he wait for the time when he can leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">(Meanwhile, what kind of work is Lyuba doing?)</span> <span id="s719">Lyuba is an engineer.</span> <span id="s720">All the time she works for one company, like a mechanical engineer.</span> <span id="s721">She was a group leader.</span> <span id="s722">She is a very good project engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">(During this period, your little girl is growing up.</span> <span id="s724">Are you seeing her experience some of what you experienced as a young Jew.</span> <span id="s725">Is she having some of the same disappointments and difficulties, or other ones...) No, I don't think she did, because we did all that we could to help her.</span> <span id="s726">And she knew many things which I, for example, didn't know before, because I spent more time with her, and at home I say what I think.</span> <span id="s727">So she understands what it means to be a Jew, and the relation between Jews and Soviet government.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">I helped her study in school and when I saw that the school is not very good, she goes to another good school, a really good school where mostly Jews studied.</span> <span id="s729">The children are from good families, and all of them like to find an intelligent job.</span> <span id="s730">It's a mathematics school.</span> <span id="s731">But all subjects in this school are studied much better than in all others.</span> <span id="s732">So she has a good education, and then she goes to the university.</span> <span id="s733">I don't know, maybe if she has a chance to choose, she go in another place, but I think that for Jewish person, this is a good program.</span> <span id="s734">It's not hard to go to this place for Jewish people because it's very hard to study in this place, so not too many people go to this department of the university to study.</span> <span id="s735">In the Soviet Union, when students after high school go to university or institute, they have to pass special exams.</span> <span id="s736">And if there are more students than places, they play games.</span> <span id="s737">And they can give Jewish students a bad grade.</span> <span id="s738">Of course in the university, even in the mathematics department they can do that too.</span> <span id="s739">But in Khar'kov State University, in the mathematics department there are many good professors.</span> <span id="s740">The Jewish people who can study here, it's easier for them to go to the university than in another place.</span> <span id="s741">So she had not much trouble to be a student in the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">(During this period, we're going to see that Gorbachev and Reagan meet, and suddenly there's something called glasnost' and perestroika.</span> <span id="s743">This is in 1984.)</span> <span id="s744">I think 1985.</span> <span id="s745">But it didn't suddenly happen perestroika, because maybe after 1986.... (After the Chernobyl disaster...) Yes.</span> <span id="s746">(I've always wondered how much the Chernobyl disaster contributed to that meeting, whether that was a terrible blow, an embarrassment to the Soviet government when that happened...

No.</span> <span id="s759">(The government didn't make it seem like it was a problem for you... because the food... did you look at the labels to see where your food came from, or did you know where your food was coming from?)</span> <span id="s760">We have no labels on the food in the Soviet Union!</span> <span id="s761">[laughs] (But did you know where your vegetables or fruits were coming from?)</span> <span id="s762">We don't know, only when she goes to the market and can ask.</span> <span id="s763">I know that many people are afraid of the food, but I'm not afraid because I know that the food is bad.</span> <span id="s764">In the Soviet Union, the pollution is so bad, and it was for a long time.</span> <span id="s765">Many years they are testing bombs in the atmosphere, so the pollution is very bad, so of course Chernobyl makes trouble, but if you have a chance, come to any city in the Soviet Union, and compare the atmosphere with Chicago.</span> <span id="s766">You cannot compare it.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">(But the Chernobyl pollution was invisible...) Yes, but what I want to say is that for our family it was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">(Did you find your life change at all after glasnost' and perestroika?)</span> <span id="s769">It does not change anything.</span> <span id="s770">What I know now from letters from my friends, that even now when in other places new things happen in the Soviet Union, in Khar'kov there's not too much changing.</span> <span id="s771">Only the shelves in the shops are empty, but in other parts of life there is nothing changing.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">(When did you realize it was safe to apply to emigrate?)</span> <span id="s773">Okay.</span> <span id="s774">When we saw that in 1987 our friends who were refuseniks about ten years, they get a chance, a permit to leave.</span> <span id="s775">Some of them live in Khar'kov, and some others in Tblisi.</span> <span id="s776">We understand that we have a chance too.</span> <span id="s777">My daughter's girlfriend, her best friend, is a refusenik too, and her relatives, her brother lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s778">He lives in United States, but before he lives in Israel, so he can live in any place.</span> <span id="s779">She received permit to go to Israel and sent us an invitation.</span> <span id="s780">It was in the end of 1988.</span> <span id="s781">We received it in March of 1989 and we decided to go.</span> <span id="s782">We decided to take a chance to get a permit.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">So we applied to OVIR and received a permit.</span> <span id="s784">At that time we knew that it was easy to get permits.</span> <span id="s785">(So three-four months it took?)</span> <span id="s786">Faster.</span> <span id="s787">We applied on April 1, 1989 and received permission at the end of May.</span> <span id="s788">(When did you actually leave?)</span> <span id="s789">We left in August 9, 1989.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">(Was it difficult to get airplane reservations?)</span> <span id="s791">Of course it's difficult to get tickets.</span> <span id="s792">But we pay much more than the cost of the tickets and we get it.</span> <span id="s793">(How long was your passage?)</span> <span id="s794">We went to Vienna, to Rome, then on Sept. 28 we arrived here.</span> <span id="s795">It's very fast.</span> <span id="s796">(Did you stay in Ladispoli?)</span> <span id="s797">No, in Santa Marinella.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">(When you were packing up to go, what did you feel you had to take with you?)</span> <span id="s799">The most important thing is language, but there wasn't enough time to learn!</span> <span id="s800">I liked to take some books with me.</span> <span id="s801">We took some of them.</span> <span id="s802">I think I need to have my scientific books, but my friends tell me I don't need them here, that I can find what I need.</span> <span id="s803">So I left some books which I think are very good.</span> <span id="s804">There are all books.</span> <span id="s805">In Russian.</span> <span id="s806">So now I think it's a mistake, some of the books I need to take.</span> <span id="s807">(Who has them?)</span> <span id="s808">I left the books in my department.</span> <span id="s809">Some people worked with me on Ph.D.</span> <span id="s810">I gave them these books.</span> <span id="s811">It's not important because here now I have a lot of, but some of them... If I many times use this, it's like old friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">(Were there any surprises when you came here?)</span> <span id="s813">Two of them.</span> <span id="s814">Not too many because I read a lot of things and listen to the radio everyday, so most things which are here I know.</span> <span id="s815">But two things.</span> <span id="s816">First is the air.</span> <span id="s817">The air is so clear for me.</span> <span id="s818">I think that this is not of pollution.</span> <span id="s819">I hear from people who are in jobs... In the newspapers they write a lot of lies, I understand, but when they write about the pollution in the United States, I think that it's right because there are too many cars.</span> <span id="s820">So the air.</span> <span id="s821">And the next thing is the people who met me.</span> <span id="s822">I find new friends from Jewish family center.</span> <span id="s823">Volunteers.</span> <span id="s824">They are so friendly.</span> <span id="s825">You never can find this in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s826">People in the Soviet Union are mostly like enemies.</span> <span id="s827">Life is so hard that, I don't know, you can find a person who is friendly to some foreigners who came, but these people are like relatives who want to help us, to do what they can do.</span> <span id="s828">So the attitude from the Americans to me is very surprising.</span> <span id="s829">We didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s830">But with this family of volunteers, we have them from family and from Jewish vocation a lady - they are so friendly and so want to help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">(What were your disappointments?)</span> <span id="s832">Of course I was disappointed to not find a job.</span> <span id="s833">But I know that it's not easy for me to find a job because my English is not so good and because the years are... If I was ten or more years younger, it's easier to find a job.</span> <span id="s834">So sometimes... it's not that I'm disappointed that I came here.</span> <span id="s835">But it means that sometimes for me it's hard to understand... For me it's difficult to apply for public aid.</span> <span id="s836">For me it's hard because I can do a job, and I think that I can do even now some kind of job.</span> <span id="s837">(But do you have to take public aid?)</span> <span id="s838">Yes.</span> <span id="s839">I have medical assistance.</span> <span id="s840">They give food stamps.</span> <span id="s841">We don't use the medical assistance, but if something happened, we need to have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">(You do have part-time work?)</span> <span id="s843">Yes, but it's not real part-time because in Truman College, this kind of job is very... so people who take English classes can at the same time have work-study.</span> <span id="s844">Some of them work in libraries, but I work like tutor.</span> <span id="s845">So the supervisor, who is a very nice man, says that I can write that this is a part-time job.</span> <span id="s846">But really part-time job means another thing.</span> <span id="s847">But I don't.</span> <span id="s848">If I don't take the classes, I can't have this kind of job.</span> <span id="s849">But because I study English, I work like a tutor in mathematics.</span> <span id="s850">Twenty hours a week.</span> <span id="s851">But it pays very little.</span> <span id="s852">Like financial aid for students.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">(What are your hopes for your daughter and her husband and your grandson?)</span> <span id="s854">I think that my grandson has a choice here, many choices.</span> <span id="s855">I think he's smart and he can realize.</span> <span id="s856">He knows English I think better than all others in our family because he learned it in Soviet Union for about four years before, and he has a good teacher who now is here too.</span> <span id="s857">And he was very young, so he very fast.</span> <span id="s858">He has a good memory.</span> <span id="s859">And he studied in English school.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">(How important is it for all of you, and especially him, to be part of a Jewish community, to have a Jewish identity here?)</span> <span id="s861">I think this is important.</span> <span id="s862">You see, all Jewish, maybe not all, but most Jewish people in the Soviet Union cannot feel in the Soviet Union themselves like a person.</span> <span id="s863">All of them are with ["neglected minds"].</span> <span id="s864">They cannot look straight because they at any time feel that society pushes them to the ground.</span> <span id="s865">Even in school when little boys now go to school, they feel that they are Jewish because the people are very anti-semitic, and they teach their children in this way.</span> <span id="s866">So even in school there are incidents.</span> <span id="s867">Jewish boys are beaten because they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s868">(Even today...) Even today.</span> <span id="s869">But here, if you look at people who came from the Soviet Union and compare with people who live here, you can see that they are not similar.</span> <span id="s870">It's very easy, because they look not alike the people who come from Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s871">I think because they have support from Jewish community.</span> <span id="s872">They feel equal in this country.</span> <span id="s873">I think so.</span> <span id="s874">So I think that he can be part of Jewish community.</span> <span id="s875">(Does he go to Sunday School?)</span> <span id="s876">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">(You told me that you didn't see any of the rites of passage, marriages, funerals, the bris, circumcision.</span> <span id="s878">Some of the boys, when they come here, are circumcised.)</span> <span id="s879">Yes.</span> <span id="s880">(This is not something you chose for him?)</span> <span id="s881">I think that he's eleven years old.</span> <span id="s882">Maybe he needs to understand by himself what is important.</span> <span id="s883">We don't need to push.</span> <span id="s884">If he was a baby it's another thing.</span> <span id="s885">I think I don't need to push him or his parents.</span> <span id="s886">They have to understand...</span></p> <p><span id="s887">(Does he enjoy learning the history of the Jewish people?)</span> <span id="s888">I think so.</span> <span id="s889">They didn't pray.</span> <span id="s890">I think that all kinds of history that he can learn, he enjoys.</span> <span id="s891">And he learns very fast.</span> <span id="s892">Even Hebrew he learned.</span> <span id="s893">But I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s894">He doesn't like the religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">(How did you keep your family strong and together during these difficult times?</span> <span id="s896">...) I think that my daughter would hear from me or from people around, my friends who came to our house, she knows my opinion and opinion of my friends, and her friends are the same.</span> <span id="s897">Because I think that it's very important for growing young person is what area she grows.</span> <span id="s898">So she has the same kind of opinion about many things of our life, and she chose her friends in the same way.</span> <span id="s899">They have all left the Soviet Union now.</span> <span id="s900">And she knows that I wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s901">I was afraid my parents, especially my father, his health is very bad, so I'm afraid, but she knows that I wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s902">She asked me, do I want her to ask her friend for an invitation, and when I said yes, she's happy, and we do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">(Are there any questions I should have asked?)</span> <span id="s904">No, I think we talked about all kinds of life.</span> <span id="s905">I'm happy that I'm here.</span> <span id="s906">And I think that after five years I can do better than now because I can improve my English.</span> <span id="s907">This is what I need most of all.</span> <span id="s908">(The economic times are hard, too.)</span> <span id="s909">It's very interesting, but we live here better than in the Soviet Union even....
