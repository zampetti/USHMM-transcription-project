business.</span> <span id="s44">He would import oil tankers.</span> <span id="s45">He had a soap factory, we had a lot of property.</span> <span id="s46">And I grew up sort of with a silver spoon in my mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s48">What was the town that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Siauliai.</span> <span id="s50">Siauliai.</span> <span

was -- I think it was -- must have supported by the state or the county, but it was sets -- separated.</span> <span id="s57">Lithuanian people went to their schools, we went to our schools.</span> <span id="s58">And like on the holidays we would go to a tailor and have clothes made, you know, they would measure us and we’d have to pick out the fabric, all stuff.</span> <span id="s59">And summertime -- we always had a maid in our house.</span> <span id="s60">My mother -- my grandmother lived with us.</span> <span id="s61">In summertime we’d go to the lake, the cottage.</span> <span id="s62">Played basketball, had a bicycle.</span> <span id="s63">Til 1933, things start getting a little bit hairy.</span> <span id="s64">Hitler came in power.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Now, you were about eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: I-I was about eight, it was about 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Now before -- before 1933, you were going to the Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I -- I went to school all the way to 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Okay, but -- but when you were younger, when you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: I went to kindergarten --</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: -- eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: -- at five, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Yeah, and so all the children in your school were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: And were all of your playmates Jewish and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Right.</span> <span id="s77">We -- I didn’t have really any Gentile friends.</span> <span id="s78">Maybe a little bit.</span> <span id="s79">Really most of them were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Now -- imagine all of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s82">And why my parents didn’t leave, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s83">I know they were talking.</span> <span id="s84">My dad said he [indecipherable] to go to Australia.</span> <span id="s85">But what happened 1933 they -- the oceans were mined, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: The oceans were mined, you know, were mined.</span> <span id="s88">I mean, it was dangerous for boats to go because they would go in -- into a mine.</span> <span id="s89">And another thing happened that Lithuania restricted taking out money out of the country.</span> <span id="s90">So some people did, they would give the [indecipherable] money to deposit upon -- to deposit in a Swiss bank.</span> <span id="s91">And it was whether he did it or not.</span> <span id="s92">In fact one person in our town borrowed money and he disappeared.</span> <span id="s93">And everyone said gee, this guy is not really honest.</span> <span id="s94">But his wife stayed behind and then she sold the property and she paid back his debt.</span> <span id="s95">So that was a story.</span> <span id="s96">Now in 1933 we had another problems.</span> <span id="s97">Lithuania is very pro -- very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s98">Very much anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s99">Like, we had a big steeple in our town, Easter we would stay inside because the priest would tell them the Jews killed Jesus.</span> <span id="s100">You know that story still [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s101">We had -- soccer team was called Maccabee.</span> <span id="s102">And any time Maccabee would win, we would leave the soccer field much sooner because it would be big fights.</span> <span id="s103">But it was very much anti-Semitic and some signs were in Jewish and they start -- Lithuanians start breaking them.</span> <span id="s104">For instance my dad was going to a customer of his to collect money, but somebody [indecipherable] his front wheel and his shoulder got dislocated.</span> <span id="s105">He never fixed it up.</span> <span id="s106">But that happened.</span> <span id="s107">Then, in 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: So these were Lithuanian --</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Lithuanians, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: -- people who were doing these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Right.</span> <span id="s112">Actually it was -- the Lithuanians were Catholics and Jewish people, we had a few Russians -- Russian Orthodox, but that’s how it was.</span> <span id="s113">Our town was about 30,000 people, probably 8,000 Jewish people.</span> <span id="s114">We had eight synagogues.</span> <span id="s115">Frankel was a person who had a big leather factory with about 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s116">He would process leather.</span> <span id="s117">Was a really big factory.</span> <span id="s118">Our -- in the house we owned, Singer Sewing Machine, they were our tenants, and they were the headquarters for the three Baltic states, Lithuania and Latvia and Estonia.</span> <span id="s119">We lived well.</span> <span id="s120">We had in our house running water, plumbing.</span> <span id="s121">And that wa -- meant a lot because the wa -- the winters that time very severe like northern Canada.</span> <span id="s122">In fact the doctor said the rich people are smart because they didn’t get -- they get less colds because the other people have to go, during the night go to the outhouse and that’s the source of -- and my dad did a lot of building, he -- even til 1938, as a matter of fact, after Lithuania became independent, I [indecipherable] permits for po -- they had archives.</span> <span id="s123">All the building he had, he had -- we had a big house like [indecipherable] big house, two story house.</span> <span id="s124">We had -- he built -- we had -- one of the tenants was a printing office with what, maybe 20 or 30 people.</span> <span id="s125">And the other one that makes sweaters.</span> <span id="s126">He had storage tanks in different places on the railroad.</span> <span id="s127">St -- warehouses which he built.</span> <span id="s128">We weren’t -- not in American standards, but under European standards we were considered well-to-do.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: And in your home, what was the religious atmosphere?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Jewish, very much.</span> <span id="s131">My dad [indecipherable] being a rabbi here, you know, but that was a way of life.</span> <span id="s132">It was a way of life.</span> <span id="s133">We observed all the holidays, we kept kosher.</span> <span id="s134">We mo -- we wouldn’t cook on Saturday, we would go to synagogue.</span> <span id="s135">As [indecipherable] older, on Saturday we would sneak away, we’d got to court and I li-listened to civil cases.</span> <span id="s136">And my dad looked the other way around, he wasn’t so fanatic.</span> <span id="s137">But he would drop himself off.</span> <span id="s138">He’d pray every morning and Friday night we would go synagogue and Saturday we’d go.</span> <span id="s139">And Friday was sort of interesting, you know, in the wintertime the days are short and my mother had -- we had a maid, but she had to knock herself out to prepare everything for Sabbath.</span> <span id="s140">And everything was done by hand, she would bake bread and fish.</span> <span id="s141">Friday night was the biggest, you know, very large meal.</span> <span id="s142">So that was -- was -- you know, I -- what happened to us, at home we speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s143">In high school it was the Zionist movement, we speak -- we had to speak Hebrew, because the teacher from that in Lithuania was actually our language which we had to learn.</span> <span id="s144">So that was the language problems -- not problems, but that was the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Now, you had siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes, I had older sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Older sister, and what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Esther.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: And how much older was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: And I had a older brother, four years, Abraham.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: And we all survived.</span> <span id="s155">We all survived the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s156">My parents did not make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: So really, that’s the story.</span> <span id="s159">But it was -- it was -- what happened farther down the line, the Russians came in in 1940, in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s160">And we f --</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Now that was the first occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: The Russians --</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: The Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: -- in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: And what happened is really, people, Jewish people in Lithuania were very, very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s167">You couldn’t go in medical school, it was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s168">So people would go to Switzerland and come back and laws were very much restricted.</span> <span id="s169">I-I’m not sure accountants or engineers, but I don’ think --</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Now, in 1940 you were 15 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I was 15, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: And you were in high school --</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I was high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: -- Jewish high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Jewish high school.</span> <span id="s176">Actually they -- the Jewish high school was -- the Russians had a different program.</span> <span id="s177">I -- I would have been graduated about 17, but something happened, my dad finally [indecipherable] with high school and he took me out and then, you know, had private tutors [indecipherable] other thing.</span> <span id="s178">All my classmates was accelerated program, they got to graduate at 16, but I didn’t make the cut because I was just -- I was taken out [indecipherable] came back.</span> <span id="s179">But what happened then, being so anti-Semitic when they’re -- the Russians were very poor and they tried to impose quotas in the farmlands, they had to give so much bacon and bread.</span> <span id="s180">And o-of course farmer will rebel.</span> <span id="s181">And I don’t think Lithuanian people are too educated, it’s -- a big, large amount is really illiterate.</span> <span id="s182">And rumors were that the Jewish people are imposing on the farming, because the Russians would make raids and make sure that farmers meet their quota.</span> <span id="s183">So that went over like wildfire.</span> <span id="s184">And in ’41 --</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Now, how did it affect your life --</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: It’s affect my --</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: -- in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: -- it affect my life because our -- our -- our school wa -- my schooling system was interrupted.</span> <span id="s189">We had to comply with the Russian schooling system.</span> <span id="s190">Instead of going, I don’t know was [indecipherable] eight years, they -- I think they -- the Russians meaning, they had a 10 years program.</span> <span id="s191">It affected that they made us go to school in the holidays.</span> <span id="s192">S -- as a matter of fact, I think I was a fairly good student, out of a class of 40, I was number seven or six.</span> <span id="s193">And I remember one time in history, I knew the -- the subjects called, but the teacher called me to the board to make presentation and I re -- you know, I refused it.</span> <span id="s194">Another week I applied and got an A.</span> <span id="s195">So they made us go to school on Saturday.</span> <span id="s196">We stayed there but we are not participate, we are sitting there.</span> <span id="s197">That’s how it affect us.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Now, did you go to school a-at your same Jewish school, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: It was the same Jewish school, but different program.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Different program.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: A different program.</span> <span id="s204">Also --</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: So it was the same students --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Yeah, the sa --</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: -- the same --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: -- the same class.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: -- the same teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Same -- well, the sam -- they took in some other stu -- teachers who maybe -- you know, the high school I went, it was a very good high school, and I think most of the teachers were PhD., well qualified.</span> <span id="s211">When the Russians came in they sort of watered it down.</span> <span id="s212">Teachers came in who was less -- less qualified.</span> <span id="s213">We also had to study Russia -- Russian, and Yiddish before we spoke Hebrew, because what I was [indecipherable] was that Jewish or Yiddish is a jargon, it’s part of German, which is not true, but I mean in the -- and you have to learn Hebrew, which -- and that was the modern Hebrew, not the religious Hebrew like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s214">So it affected me that respect.</span> <span id="s215">On this other hand I start learning the Jewish literature which t -- and they had poets and writing it.</span> <span id="s216">I had to study Russia -- Russian, and how else did it affect me?</span> <span id="s217">Well, oh they confiscate our property, they confiscate our property, everything, the Russians.</span> <span id="s218">I don’t know how my dad survived, I remember leaving the house, but he was very energetic person and I’m sure it start hitting him hard.</span> <span id="s219">Prior to that, actually, when the Russians came in there was a big sack of money.</span> <span id="s220">And we were afr -- I don’t know how he made it and when he made it.</span> <span id="s221">And we burned it because it’s a raid, they feel we might be bourgeois, which is the upper class.</span> <span id="s222">And tears were in his eyes, I was a child, I didn’t realize it.</span> <span id="s223">But that’s how it affected me.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: So he burned the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: We burned the money, it was a lot of them, a big bag and crisp bills on a -- I -- we all encouraged him to do it because it’s a raid, hey, you’re part of -- part of the Czar or something like that.</span> <span id="s226">So it affected us also, it was confiscated -- I think being -- my dad was very well liked, but I think also confiscated because I had to go into a sort of a [indecipherable] had to strip naked and nurses were sitting there and boy at 15, I was sort of intimidated.</span> <span id="s227">And they decided that I should maybe not continue with -- with school, I should go some sort of a trade.</span> <span id="s228">And I think was also a -- also was because my dad was well-to-do.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: So the Russians decided this?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Yeah, I mean the Russians -- the Russians or the government installed a -- they installed like [indecipherable] government, it was a puppet government.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s232">And so did you then go to study a trade?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: No, no, because -- the reason I didn’t, because the Germans came in --</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: -- i-in -- in ’41, but if I would have been in the Russians, I don’t think, who have decided -- probably they would not let me continue with school.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: So how -- what happened when the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Well, before that another thing happened, very interesting.</span> <span id="s238">My dad was very well liked, was very well liked, I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s239">He got along with everyone.</span> <span id="s240">But the Russians tried to take away the management of the town.</span> <span id="s241">And they had freight cars with straw and [indecipherable] them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s242">Our family, somehow they didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s243">And one of the guys, by the name of Walpen was sort of -- he said, remember, he said, the rich people have the luck.</span> <span id="s244">And what really happened, after the war, those people, whoever fought in the war would s -- they got an education.</span> <span id="s245">You know, they send them Siberia, I am sure they were drafted in service, but they got educated.</span> <span id="s246">Several of them showed up in Israel with nice degrees.</span> <span id="s247">So I think even they were sent in Siberia they didn’t have the harsh treatment that we encountered later on by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: And wh-why did they send them to Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Because they were [indecipherable] and that was the method in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: So it was a punishment?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Punishment, uprooted -- uproo --</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Degradation.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: -- uproot them, outroo them.</span> <span id="s254">In fact, all system is like that.</span> <span id="s255">I tried to analyze why the Russian people are drinking so much, and they do a lot of drinking.</span> <span id="s256">And I think what happens there, once you start acquiring some property, that proved you -- you di -- you come in the middle of night, pack in two or three hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: And after awhile it in -- discouraged them to do anything because they have to leave it behind.</span> <span id="s259">Also, I sort of found out at that time -- the Russians, you know, any time, the system they had, the fear.</span> <span id="s260">Like we spoke -- a widow of some Russian person told us, she said -- her husband was sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s261">So what happened, she said well, he was [indecipherable] always claimed that Stalin was god -- Stalin was the leader of Russia -- and he said, in Russian he said he had a dream, he said before Stalin h-he [indecipherable] he couldn’t get a replacement.</span> <span id="s262">And he said in Russian, before Stalin came in, everything fine, but now Russian’s -- Stalin’s son came in and signed so much that his rear, his ass can see the sun.</span> <span id="s263">[indecipherable] just for that he’s sent away to Siberia.</span> <span id="s264">So then in ’41, it was like when the Russians came in their army was so dilapidated, so dilapidated and now he thought I didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s265">And [indecipherable] you know, baking bread and send to Russia, but when they were treated in, I think it was June, the middle of June I was on a picnic and all of a sudden we were bombed.</span> <span id="s266">It was surprise attack and the Russians were having a party on the border and -- and I think -- Tilsit was a border town, I think we were maybe a hundred kilometers or 60 miles from the border.</span> <span id="s267">They start retreating in a hurry.</span> <span id="s268">Now our house was a very big house and ver -- very enforced basement, you know, it’s reinforced concrete.</span> <span id="s269">And we fo -- we thought it’s a bomb shelter.</span> <span id="s270">So what happened then, my dad and his brother decide they’re not leaving the town, so they’ll stay there, and the corner of our house was bombed, but they survived.</span> <span id="s271">My brother, who was older, he wanted to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s272">So he and a few refugees from Poland went to the Russian border and they came back, said the border is closed, they wouldn’t let anyone in.</span> <span id="s273">My mother and my sister, we also walked out of town towards Russia.</span> <span id="s274">We didn't have any food.</span> <span id="s275">We stopped to some relatives, they abandoned their house.</span> <span id="s276">We had some sour, you know, yogurt, we find something to eat.</span> <span id="s277">But then we were bombed with machine guns by the Germans because that what’s army, I was laying in the trenches.</span> <span id="s278">And then after that we felt we didn’t have the chance, so we came back to our house.</span> <span id="s279">And another thing, sort of people asked me about it and myself --</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: No, so that -- you came back to the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: You were 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: You were with your mother and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: And the whole family.</span> <span id="s286">The whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: And your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: And my brother, all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: And your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: All of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: So everybody was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: And then -- then Germans came in.</span> <span id="s295">The Germans.</span> <span id="s296">It was -- Germans came in already in 19 -- in ’41, and it was raids.</span> <span id="s297">Before they even -- Germans came in, they took -- they raided people and put them in prison and never came back.</span> <span id="s298">They made them deep --</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: They put who in prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Just raids would come the middle of the night --</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: -- take away the men.</span> <span id="s303">And they would move them -- m-make them dig their own graves and shoot them.</span> <span id="s304">Thi-Thi -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Any particular men, or just random?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Leadership.</span> <span id="s307">The rabbi, lawyers, prominent people.</span> <span id="s308">Prominent people.</span> <span id="s309">Again [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Now this was just Jews, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Just Jews, absolutely --</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Just Jews, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: -- just Jews, just Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Prominent Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yeah, leadership.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: They’re afraid for seven to 80, we never heard about them.</span> <span id="s318">They -- we heard in our -- Lithuania had -- was known for being educated among the Jewish community, we had a lot of seminaries.</span> <span id="s319">They -- the seminary students were shot and what I heard, were shot by Lithuanians and the journalists took picture.</span> <span id="s320">And their reward was golden teeth, their clothing with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s321">And really, what happened in Lithuania, a funny thing, my dad told me that.</span> <span id="s322">When things were taken away, he say watch.</span> <span id="s323">Those people never made anything and they’ll be the same thing.</span> <span id="s324">They would drink.</span> <span id="s325">Maybe the Jewish people didn’t make any more money, but they tried to acquire like candelabras, a suit.</span> <span id="s326">They wouldn’t drink.</span> <span id="s327">Lithuanians did a lot of drinking.</span> <span id="s328">He said look, here they have all the property.</span> <span id="s329">In a couple of years they won’t have anything.</span> <span id="s330">And it was true.</span> <span id="s331">So that started off, in 1941 they start running out of people.</span> <span id="s332">And eventually they got us in ghetto.</span> <span id="s333">It was a dilapidated area next to a lake.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Now this was in the same town?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: The same town, Shavel, Shavel.</span> <span id="s336">They surrounded it with barbed wires.</span> <span id="s337">We sort of felt we couldn’t escape because I was dark-headed -- dark-haired and blue eye -- dark hair.</span> <span id="s338">My -- I had sort of an accent, my R was not sharp enough because I even knew the language, but people speak, they could recognize that I’m not a Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s339">Plus, I was circumcised.</span> <span id="s340">So we -- the escape thing wa-was not in our favor.</span> <span id="s341">The send away my dad, send away my brother to work in a farm, you know, as a farmhand?</span> <span id="s342">But they start rounding of people on the farm, but the farmer got word, and those guys were killed right away too.</span> <span id="s343">So the farmer got word of that, he put them back together.</span> <span id="s344">So we stayed intact and what happened, having a soap factory, my dad felt -- was self-employed.</span> <span id="s345">So even -- to make soap you need fat, but we didn’t have any fat.</span> <span id="s346">So we got under and barter and sell for food, and we’d get --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Now where -- where would you go to barter?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: If we -- in the same town, but we would leave the ghetto and go to our f -- f -- to our soap factory, so we’re employed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s350">So in the ghetto, were you free to move in and out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: No, wa -- sort of, sort of, I mean they -- people would work.</span> <span id="s352">They would take out people and work.</span> <span id="s353">For instance, my mother worked in the hospital, in the German hospital.</span> <span id="s354">In the beginning we all stay together and we supposed to work in the soap factory which my dad and if -- initially owned it, but he made it fictitiously gave some Lithuanian who was the owner, so we worked for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: I see, so you were allowed to go out to work in the soap factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s357">And -- but we couldn’t do much, you know, get a [indecipherable] but primarily we would barter.</span> <span id="s358">And then Lithuanian person decided to, rather than keeping our place -- I don’t think he was all right, I think he was like the F.B.I., he inherited a big house who was the -- the guy who does the slaughtering [indecipherable] and he moved the factory in his area down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Who was this that inherited the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: That -- thi-thi-thi -- that’s the person that my dad assigned the factory to.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s362">Now, he was Lithuanian, not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: He was a friend of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: -- he’d been a friend of your father’s, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Sort of, so my dad said, okay, you be the boss.</span> <span id="s368">Here, I signed you over, here’s the property, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: -- we’ll be running the show.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: But that didn’t last so long.</span> <span id="s373">I was in ghetto about four years, from ’41 to ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Now what were your living circumstances in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Very bad, very bad.</span> <span id="s376">We -- it was a small house, maybe smaller than this one, they put in five or six families.</span> <span id="s377">The problem was the stove.</span> <span id="s378">Everyone wants to cook a little bit on the stove.</span> <span id="s379">My mother stayed home --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: And each family cooked separately?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Well, what happened, we were one -- it was our family, it was a pharmacist who took away three girls and the mother -- the father took away.</span> <span id="s382">We had two people from Czechoslovakia who were son-in-laws and they lost their family, they stayed in the house.</span> <span id="s383">And two brothers [indecipherable] they were rabbis and they lost their families.</span> <span id="s384">So we all stayed in that ghetto.</span> <span id="s385">My mother was a very nice lady, but everyone tried to cook their one little pot, and there was no food, really was no food.</span> <span id="s386">We’d get frozen potatoes.</span> <span id="s387">My mother would make sort of a potato kugel, which is sort of potato pancake.</span> <span id="s388">We’d get horse and she wouldn’t eat because it wasn’t kosher, but she would make hamburgers for us.</span> <span id="s389">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: A-A -- she got -- she wouldn’t eat the horsemeat because it wasn’t kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Right, but she --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: -- right, but she would make it for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: I see, for the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: An-And it was okay for you to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Well, it was a matter you didn’t have any food.</span> <span id="s398">We ate it.</span> <span id="s399">We ate it.</span> <span id="s400">We ate it, you know, whatever.</span> <span id="s401">Tried to make a garden there, we had a little area.</span> <span id="s402">Was pretty rough.</span> <span id="s403">But then that didn’t last long and they took them away to build a German airport in -- not too far, you know, the observation towers.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: They took who?</span> <span id="s405">They took --</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: They took me.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: They -- and I was out of the ghetto and I walked in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: And when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Also during the period of the fr -- while I was in ghetto.</span> <span id="s411">In other words, after soap factory petered out, we were assigned to do labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s413">I see.</span> <span id="s414">So did you go out just during the day --</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: No, I stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Oh, you stayed out --</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: It was already [indecipherable] camp.</span> <span id="s418">My brother was working a sugar factory --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: -- which makes sugar.</span> <span id="s421">My mother worked in a hospital and my dad -- my dad worked in railroad, you know, loading cars or whatever it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Now, where was the factory where you worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Also in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s424">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: It was the same town?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: The wa -- the one we [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: No, no, you said you worked in --</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Oh no, that was on the airport.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: That was the airport --</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: The airport.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: -- airport.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: So the airport of your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: I think the airport of the town a -- they -- I didn’t walk, you know, I always [indecipherable] border.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: But you stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: I stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: But was it far away?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Well, that’s right, it wasn’t far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: It -- it’s true, it wasn’t far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: And -- and the Germans were in charge --</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: -- there.</span> <span id="s444">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Actually, very sad happened there.</span> <span id="s446">What happened, a girl from -- a friend of my brother, he said, why don’t you say you’re a carpenter?</span> <span id="s447">So they ask what are you doing, I said, I’m a Zimmerman, I’m a carpenter.</span> <span id="s448">So they assigned me to build observation towers, prefab homes.</span> <span id="s449">But the person in charge of it was a sergeant, German sergeant and he was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s450">He said I’m like a rabbit.</span> <span id="s451">I don’t see what you do, he said, I’m looking other way.</span> <span id="s452">You got a birdie?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: I thought I heard --</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: I heard a bird.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: I hope he didn’t fly inside.</span> <span id="s457">So what I did actually when I was in camp, I would risk my life and I would go in the farmers and then barter.</span> <span id="s458">I would get bread and some food.</span> <span id="s459">People gave me clothes, I would give it to them.</span> <span id="s460">And was very risky you know, they could shot me [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s461">And -- but I knew the people and they knew me so they didn’t want to be seen that I’m coming there, but somehow we [indecipherable] arrangement.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: And what did you have to barter with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: People would give me some clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Or bring some clothing pri -- to exchange for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Now who were the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: In camp.</span> <span id="s468">In this camp, the one [indecipherable] the people who build the airport observation</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: They were men and women.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: And they had -- they took clothes with them.</span> <span id="s473">And since w -- food was --</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Were they -- were these non-Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Not -- all Jewish, all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: They’re all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: All Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: And they had extra clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Well, when -- it were -- when we went to camp you could take your stuff --</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: -- it was not a tr -- concentration camp.</span> <span id="s482">So they have extra clothes and was no food.</span> <span id="s483">So would say okay, here is a blouse, here’s a pair of shoes, take it out, maybe you’ll bring me some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: So they would give some to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yeah, and a --</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Because they had more than you had, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Well, they had clothes and we didn't have any food.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: So we did that.</span> <span id="s490">Before that, I also risked my life, my -- we walked the railroad cleaning out sludge, and that was very rough, my brother, my sister.</span> <span id="s491">And she had already two years of commercial schooling.</span> <span id="s492">So I risked my life and I got -- managed to get out of this gate, and there was a young German fellow, I had a Bar Mitzvah watch, I bribed him.</span> <span id="s493">I said, take it.</span> <span id="s494">And then he took in my sister to work in an office as a -- whatever she did have, but she didn’t have -- allowed this -- this particular job.</span> <span id="s495">Also was very sad as I was going to exchange, it was a ch -- Russian camp and the Germans would patrol, of course, tried to avoid them.</span> <span id="s496">This was very, very sad.</span> <span id="s497">It was so sad, they had the Russian prisoners there.</span> <span id="s498">And the people -- again, they would starve them to death and then they would take people very weak, they call them musselmens, you know, just like skeletons, and they would make him go to Russian cemetery to bury them.</span> <span id="s499">But then the people -- and there was so many people buried there, the whole ground was soaking.</span> <span id="s500">Terrible.</span> <span id="s501">And then people -- they would shoot the guys who t -- who took them away.</span> <span id="s502">Fellow said, here’s my wife and kids, they would just shoot them.</span> <span id="s503">The Russians lost 30 million people during the war.</span> <span id="s504">You probably heard before.</span> <span id="s505">Was really, really sad.</span> <span id="s506">The Germans would come in and rape the girls, burn the farmers.</span> <span id="s507">So the Russians came back and took revenge to [indecipherable] I don’t think they did nothing, you know, just -- of course the Ukraines, the people who [indecipherable] and they participated with Germans.</span> <span id="s508">They would -- so that’s the story there.</span> <span id="s509">I was a carpenter in Lithuania also in Siauliai.</span> <span id="s510">Fix up steps, you know, I learned how to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Now, you -- you told them you were a carpenter.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Ye -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: And did you know carpentry?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: I didn’t know [indecipherable] we were high school kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: So how did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: They [indecipherable] carpenter, took my word for.</span> <span id="s517">And you’re not -- th-they didn’t give him a test anything else.</span> <span id="s518">And a carpenter, you know, I didn't have to be -- you start off with boards, and then, for instance, you pulled a big [indecipherable] you have 10 foot hammer so you knock it two or three sometimes [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s519">In fact, I think the fellow I was under [indecipherable] was Catholics priest.</span> <span id="s520">So -- and he would -- they have a little bit extra soup after they wouldn’t have enough, they would give us, and then we sit around.</span> <span id="s521">But we were not starving too bad in get -- in get -- in ghetto, we were okay food-wise.</span> <span id="s522">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Yeah, some of these people working at the airport were not Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: They -- the germ -- they were tradesmen, German carpenters, but we were their helpers.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: They were not in the army, they were sort of like a -- army engineers or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: So they were German --</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: -- but they were not in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Right, they were not in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: And did they have some Lithuanians --</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: -- who were not Jews [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: No, they -- they -- the Germans were there and we were there, we worked for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s536">So it wasn’t as bad --</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: -- there, as it was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: No, but -- but what happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Did you -- did you see your family while you were living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: We st -- yeah, w-we would -- no, at th-that time I didn’t, but it was about maybe five or six months.</span> <span id="s542">But what happened, the reason again, people got very jealous of us because we were one of few families who survived.</span> <span id="s543">But my mother also went -- but then we came back -- several times would be raids.</span> <span id="s544">You know, people in ghetto, and they would take children and women.</span> <span id="s545">In fact, the person who stayed in our house, his wife disappeared, you know, and his three kids disappeared because he sent them away to the farmer and the farmer didn’t bring them back, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: How do you think it was that your family was able to survive that?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: I think plain luck, plain luck --</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: My dad was very -- first of all we -- the Russian didn’t send them out.</span> <span id="s550">He got along, he was very well liked.</span> <span id="s551">But I think it was sheer luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Sheer luck and was really big jealousy because we were only one of a few.</span> <span id="s554">The family now, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s555">I really don’t know how we survived, but I know we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: An --</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: And -- and so you -- you could go back to visit your family in the ghetto occasionally, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No, but I was away for six months, eight months --</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: -- and my dad and my mother was there, I don’t know what they did.</span> <span id="s562">We couldn’t commute, we di -- couldn’t write.</span> <span id="s563">But I n -- I -- I did think about, but I knew they were there and then I came back, they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: And my brother was sent away, I don’t know what happened to my sister when she was sent away, but she worked in German office in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: But you -- so you came back when the job was done --</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: -- or they released you, or you escaped, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: -- somehow, somehow, somehow I got back, I don’t know what was [indecipherable] because we were then shipped to Stutthof, which is a concentration camp around Leipzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Okay, I have to turn over the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: So it will stop for a stop for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Well, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: -- of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Leonard Gordo, tape one, side B.</span> <span id="s576">Mr. Gordon, you were -- you started to say how you left the ghetto and were sent to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Right.</span> <span id="s578">They separated the men and women.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Now how did you know that you were -- what was the first note -- notice that something different was happening?</span> <span id="s580">What did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: I don’t really remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s584">I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s585">I know it must have -- well, during the raids my sister was about [indecipherable] the German officers would come in and I don’t know what happened [indecipherable] or not, but they -- not in the ghetto, we didn't go in th ghetto right away but we were living in the town.</span> <span id="s586">They came in and I don’t really know what happened, but sh-she was attractive girl and was not a [indecipherable] what happened [indecipherable] come over there, she never took the [indecipherable] I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Do you think they exploited her sexually?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: She -- she would ne-never tell me.</span> <span id="s589">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s590">She was --</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: So you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: -- she was very tight lipped about it.</span> <span id="s593">She never talked anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: At that time I was too young to think about it, but right now I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s596">I really don’t know what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Mm-hm, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: I really don’t know, it just -- she -- and my mother never talked to me about it.</span> <span id="s599">Of course I wouldn’t really want to be consulted.</span> <span id="s600">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s601">So you don’t remember how you were told --</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: We -- we were probably told that we’re being transported, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Okay, and that you’ll have to go to a central place?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Right, and there were freight cars, you know, like freight cars and we got in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s605">Stutthof was on Leipzig, a concentration camp, and we had to strip --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Now, di -- were you able to take any --</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: -- did you take anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: No, whatever we -- we didn’t take anything, and whatever we took we didn’t get a thing, I didn’t have a single syllable.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s611">And was it like a cattle car that you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Right, yeah, freight cars, cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: I -- I don’t know what they did for plumbing, whether there was a hole in the ground or not, you know, during the transporting.</span> <span id="s615">And we were separated and --</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Do -- do you know how long you were in --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Well, probably Leipzig f -- I -- I’d have to look at a map, I thought it was about 24 hours at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: And this was what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: That was 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: And we were separated.</span> <span id="s624">My -- I didn’t see my mother and sister, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Now, separated how?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Men and --</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: -- men and women.</span> <span id="s629">And then we had to strip and we went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Now, were you with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: I was, my father and my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: We were together.</span> <span id="s634">It was not gas chambers, obviously.</span> <span id="s635">And in camp we slept three or four in a bunk to --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Oh, you had to strip and then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: And then they -- they took away everything and I think they gave us the clothing which is striped, you saw the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s638">I think they also cut our hair and have a läusestrasse, as you know, he cut you like the Marine Corps, but the middle one is sort of a strip they call the läusestrasse, which is -- in German means the street for lice, but you -- like prisoners, you know, was just a big strip in -- in the middle and assigned us numbers.</span> <span id="s639">I-I lost my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Did they give you a tattoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s642">At that time they stopped tat -- stopped st -- tattooing.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: And I remember being people from Holland there in camp.</span> <span id="s645">Why did -- I liked them, they were very gentle.</span> <span id="s646">But we were starving to death, you know.</span> <span id="s647">The ration maybe was -- I don’t know how many calories, maybe 500, and so forth.</span> <span id="s648">And I don’t how long we were there.</span> <span id="s649">You know, we didn’t work.</span> <span id="s650">We were just -- we start -- we were still starving, you know, just -- and then from there --</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: So you were just there --</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Just as a try -- a tr -- temporary assignment, temporary quarters or something like that.</span> <span id="s653">And then from there they sent us to Bavaria.</span> <span id="s654">Dachau.</span> <span id="s655">But Dachau is a hub, we were in the [indecipherable] camp.</span> <span id="s656">I -- I was in a camp called Mildorf, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Now you went by train to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Yeah, I didn’t walk.</span> <span id="s659">So somehow -- probably by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: And do you know how long that was, on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Well, I don’t know, in Germany it’s probably a couple of days, at least.</span> <span id="s662">And there again, they stripped us, and they took away the shoes.</span> <span id="s663">Even before that they took away the shoes because I had a broken toe.</span> <span id="s664">A big broken toe.</span> <span id="s665">What happened while I was in Lithuania was you know, the snow and this -- the wooden soles and heels, but no rubber, so the snow would stick to it, so it formed like [indecipherable] corner, and we walked in the railroad and I lift up a rail beam and somehow my leg twisted and the -- the rail came on big toe and it broke it s -- dislocated it.</span> <span id="s666">They took me to camp, the doctor was drunk, and by the time he woke up, maybe three or four days, he said, well, it’s grown together.</span> <span id="s667">So that was it, I have a dislocated toe from account of that.</span> <span id="s668">But then we were in -- in Mildorf and -- terrible.</span> <span id="s669">We got paper clothes, no [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Paper clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Paper clothes.</span> <span id="s672">And it was cold, no clothing, you know, we were freezing to death.</span> <span id="s673">And was a lot of raids, U.S. raids.</span> <span id="s674">And I was so --</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: You mean bombing raids?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Bombing, right.</span> <span id="s677">And I was so miserable I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s678">I would just sit -- everyone would run for shelter, but I was so miserable I would just delouse myself.</span> <span id="s679">Really.</span> <span id="s680">And next to the border was a four engine German plane, but everywhere bombed by allies, but they left us alone, you know, they would raid, the sir -- excuse me -- the siren would -- is okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: The sirens would, right, but I just -- you know, I was just miserable.</span> <span id="s683">And then they separated us again.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Now, were you with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: I was with my father and my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: And your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: And brother.</span> <span id="s688">And we were working -- we were building actually Messerschmitt, which is the German underground airport.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Now, you -- you had been on the railroad before.</span> <span id="s690">Working on the railroads?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: No, we were -- repair the rail tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Yeah, you were repairing the rail tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: The rail tracks, but this time we were actually doing construction.</span> <span id="s694">We are building an underground airport for Messerschmitt, which is the --</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: So this was in the same work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: No, the railroad was in Lithuania, repairing.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Railroads are in Lithuania but in Germany -- after being in Stutthof they transported us to Mildorf --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: -- which is a part of work camp [indecipherable] Dachau, but was not really Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Okay, and that’s where you were working on the underground --</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Right, as a carpenter.</span> <span id="s705">And my dad and myself and my brother, we worked together and we had to walk in -- you know, back and forth and -- but we -- and there were a lot of conveyor belts and people would carry cement sacks on their back, but the conveyor -- conveyor belts were not used.</span> <span id="s706">Hungarian Jews -- and in fact I picked up to -- picked up a little Hungarian because they would always worry about what’s evening, and I couldn’t imagine why people had to peel potatoes, the potato shells taste so good.</span> <span id="s707">Or back home my brother and I would think, all the crumbs from Friday night, we could have had a meal.</span> <span id="s708">And my dad got very disappointed, said, let’s commit suicide.</span> <span id="s709">He really -- he felt it’s not making it.</span> <span id="s710">But the end they left him in the one camp and took my brother and me in another camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: When -- when your father said let’s commit suicide, what did -- how did you take that?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Well, he was just miserable, he just --</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Yeah, and how did you take that?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: I -- I -- it didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s715">I was young, I just -- I didn’t -- it’s just -- it -- it didn’t register.</span> <span id="s716">Didn’t register, but he already, because he lost from the Russians, you know, all his possessions, now they took everything away from him so he really was -- and he wasn’t an old man, he was probably in the 40’s, I just found out, he was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: But it didn’t affect you mentally --</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: -- as much --</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: -- no, it didn’t affect me.</span> <span id="s721">And I know -- I didn’t know how my father took it, but it didn’t affect me at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: You think because you were younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Yeah, absolutely.</span> <span id="s724">Right now probably would hit me.</span> <span id="s725">And we were carpenters, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: N-Now this is you and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: My and my brother, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: And you’re separated from your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: From my dad.</span> <span id="s730">And then what happened, we -- they moved us in the camp and they -- the housing was like bunkhouse, they dug a hole in the ground and they put a roof and put dirt on for insulation.</span> <span id="s731">So it was just like in the ground because it’s cold out.</span> <span id="s732">But I remember they had kapos, which was a leader of the camp, and he said that he needs electricity for his bunk.</span> <span id="s733">And I had tools, I had axes and so forth.</span> <span id="s734">And one time I went home and saw wires, so not thinking about, I took my axe and cut it.</span> <span id="s735">And the whole camp -- the construction site got dark.</span> <span id="s736">The Germans run around here, it must have been a power line, right now I thought about it.</span> <span id="s737">And I took the wire, [indecipherable] wrapped around all the wires and brought it to the camp.</span> <span id="s738">He never turned me in, they would have killed me right there.</span> <span id="s739">It was about -- they didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s740">And he got electricity and a -- and our reward was he would give us ex -- a little bit extra soup.</span> <span id="s741">The soup was really watery soup and there probably was a couple slices of bread.</span> <span id="s742">Another thing happened to me once.</span> <span id="s743">I came back -- I was 16 and very skinny, and used to have selection.</span> <span id="s744">Selection is you strip half naked and a gentleman says -- there’s left and right.</span> <span id="s745">Selections are very sensitive [indecipherable] among people who are in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s746">And somehow I sized up that he send me with the weaker ones.</span> <span id="s747">So I run away.</span> <span id="s748">I really run away in this particular camp.</span> <span id="s749">And the kapo ran after me.</span> <span id="s750">He beat me up, but I know how much, but in meantime he got somebody else, so to meet a quota.</span> <span id="s751">And we were with a lot of Hungarian people, Hungarians Jews, and they were very naïve, I thought.</span> <span id="s752">They -- I knew the people [indecipherable] crematorium, I knew that’s gas chambers there, I already knew about it but nothing you can d-do about it.</span> <span id="s753">And somebody said the Scharführer [indecipherable] big pope or rabbi, he said it’s too hard, the work is for hard, you’ll be sending more people -- and s -- oh yeah, the Scharführer said something like that, but anyway, I was spared, I really was spared.</span> <span id="s754">And so one time I fell down -- I walked the scaffolding and a four by four was there, the whole scaffold collapsed and I was underneath that but my brother pulled me out, I wasn’t hurt.</span> <span id="s755">And then became -- so I think we were there in camp maybe a year or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Now, did you know anything about your father’s whereabouts when you were separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Oh, I knew about my father’s whereabouts, we would try to send him some food with some other people.</span> <span id="s758">I don’t know how he got it.</span> <span id="s759">I knew it was November that he was beaten to death.</span> <span id="s760">I knew that.</span> <span id="s761">We got word and I start crying and the kapos give me a -- gave me a big kick in my rear, said look, you have to go on.</span> <span id="s762">He said, you can’t bring him back.</span> <span id="s763">We knew that, that he was separated.</span> <span id="s764">I didn’t know anything about my sister or my mother.</span> <span id="s765">Didn’t know anything about them.</span> <span id="s766">So it’s a story fact, when we were liberated we di -- we didn’t know the right day he died, so my brother and I decided -- arbitrarily we picked a day because in our religion once a year we say a -- services for the person who passed away.</span> <span id="s767">And just recently I got record from my ca -- from a nephew.</span> <span id="s768">Now I knew when he was born, knew when he passed away.</span> <span id="s769">Which I didn’t know before.</span> <span id="s770">And actually, in 1944 he was 46 years old.</span> <span id="s771">He was born ninete -- he was f -- he -- ’44, he was 45 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: So he was fairly young.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Very young.</span> <span id="s774">My mo -- okay, talking about I found out then I was -- I was -- you know, he pulled me out and then when the Germans retreated it was a famous march, you know, they tried to crew people together and we supposed to march.</span> <span id="s775">But nobody wanted to walk -- walk with me because they figured I would be a liability, I would collapse and they’d have to carry me.</span> <span id="s776">They put my brother in the former hospital and they beat him up and his whole leg was really cut up, you know, like a Y and they put him as sample patient.</span> <span id="s777">But luckily for us, I think it’s sixth or seventh or the Third Army, U.S. Army came in three days before the camp management and [indecipherable] us to come.</span> <span id="s778">That’s why we survi -- survived.</span> <span id="s779">And General Eisenhower --</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Now, so you never started the march?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: No, the march never took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: But you were scheduled to.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: We were scheduled -- we were scheduled to it.</span> <span id="s784">And general -- so -- and then we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Be -- before the liberation, before you knew you were going to be liberated, what kept you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Oh, it ha -- kept me going, two things.</span> <span id="s787">First of all, my brother and I were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: You were together the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s790">We were not separated.</span> <span id="s791">Then, a friend of his who was in the sugar factory, she became a hostess to the German -- you know, whoever the management they had at camp, and whether she liked him or not she would throw over the fence her ration of bread so we would have more than the rest of them.</span> <span id="s792">So, you know, we were -- whatever it is, we felt we have a little bit more.</span> <span id="s793">Another thing happened.</span> <span id="s794">Whatever the slice of bread is, we would divide it in three sections so we’d have three meals a day.</span> <span id="s795">Some people would eat right away.</span> <span id="s796">Some people smoked, so that they trade the bread for some cigarettes.</span> <span id="s797">A lot of people had the runs, dysenteria, and that kills you right away.</span> <span id="s798">We would drink the coffee beans, we felt it helps us.</span> <span id="s799">For instance, my arms swell up like that, and was a fellow said he was [indecipherable] must have been a surgeon, he cut me right here.</span> <span id="s800">He cut in, let a drainage go.</span> <span id="s801">I was frostbitten.</span> <span id="s802">But my brother had a good sense of humor, so guess what he said?</span> <span id="s803">Things are going good, now we’re being liberated.</span> <span id="s804">Meaning that we have bread and everything else.</span> <span id="s805">Kept us going because we were together, we have a little bit more and we’re carpenters.</span> <span id="s806">The people who were not carpenters, they would die by the droves, because they would work nights.</span> <span id="s807">In the morning you’ll see the whole -- just two eyes full of cement.</span> <span id="s808">They would run around the kitchen, maybe something leftover, so they wouldn’t get any sleep.</span> <span id="s809">And the Hungarian people are very naïve, it really would make them mad.</span> <span id="s810">Like, we didn’t have anything but probably shoes and a cup, and you see a person died, people were so -- see that all the teeth will move, you know, loose like.</span> <span id="s811">And [indecipherable] you don’t need this -- you don’t need the shoes, you didn’t -- you don’t need the -- the spoon, why don’t give it to me?</span> <span id="s812">And I would get mad, I said look, this guy is -- you don’t know how long he’s live, leave him alone.</span> <span id="s813">I mean, how rude can you be?</span> <span id="s814">But that kept me going because we had a little bit more.</span> <span id="s815">But after the war was other problems, too.</span> <span id="s816">It’s the [indecipherable] People -- we were starved to death so people ate so much and they died from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Now, let’s go back to when you were liberated.</span> <span id="s818">How -- how did that happen?</span> <span id="s819">What were you doing when you found out that --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: They -- what happened then -- our being transported in Feldafing, which is not that far from Munich --</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: No, this was after you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: After liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Yeah, but before you were liberated, how -- what was the first news you had that you were being liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Well, no -- the guards disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: The guards disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Disappeared, the gates opened up.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: That was the first thing you noticed?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Until then you didn’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: I didn’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: -- anything was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: But we did get word -- my brother did get word about invasion of Normandy.</span> <span id="s833">I don’t know how he got it, but he -- we knew that the allies are coming soon.</span> <span id="s834">We knew that.</span> <span id="s835">But that kept us going.</span> <span id="s836">But other than that, it was routine, you know, we’d work every day.</span> <span id="s837">Work in the morning and come back at night and stay, get a little bit soup and bread, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: So the guards disappeared and the gates were open --</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Open.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: And then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: And the American -- the -- the G.I.s came in and I took pictures and I’m sure I’m in a lot of them.</span> <span id="s842">Because I was, in 1945 I was 20 years old, I think my weight was about 90 pounds.</span> <span id="s843">And you know, we had a Sing Sing clothes with a läusestrasse.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: We di -- I mean they were very upset, very, very upset, but -- and they transported to this camp, which Feldafing initially --</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Yeah, well now before that, what -- what did they do for you when they came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: They -- they didn’t do much, but I think they started giving us more food.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: I’m sure that we -- I don’t know where the food came from, from the kitchen or something like that, we -- I really don’t remember the way that -- what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s851">So then you were transported how?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Again, I don’t know whether by cars or you know, the army trucks and we -- at that time we were taken care of by UNRRA, which is the American relief org -- an-and ORT, a Jewish organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: What was the Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: ORT.</span> <span id="s855">ORT, it’s -- I think was a trade organization which they -- and join -- Joint, which is Jewish something.</span> <span id="s856">Relief organization of United States.</span> <span id="s857">And actually, it was American G.I.s Jewish, just spoke Jewish and ask us [indecipherable] but were put in rooms.</span> <span id="s858">You know, maybe bunks, but we -- we got some clothes.</span> <span id="s859">Maybe army [indecipherable] but we didn’t have the uniforms.</span> <span id="s860">And we were free to move around.</span> <span id="s861">In fact my brother started University of Munich, continue his e-engineering degree.</span> <span id="s862">And we were moved on, in fact have a -- being in camp you don’t have any -- any documentation.</span> <span id="s863">I didn't -- I couldn’t prove anything because everything was taken away.</span> <span id="s864">But one thing I have right now that [indecipherable] who is the mayor of Feldafing wrote a letter for me to the railroad people for me and my brother to get free passed to go to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s865">In fact, I think we even rented a room in [indecipherable] because he had to study there.</span> <span id="s866">[indecipherable] I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s867">And [indecipherable] a train, we’d go -- min -- Feldafing is on Garmisch-Part-Partenkirchen, which is the German Olympics in the Alps.</span> <span id="s868">But that really happened.</span> <span id="s869">Really things were very bad, very, very bad, you know, we just … other than that, a lot of people -- we were one of the worst camps.</span> <span id="s870">We had the rate, people would just die by -- by the droves.</span> <span id="s871">Other camps, lager 10 was a little bit softer, but ours was one of the worst ones.</span> <span id="s872">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Now, when you were in the camp, what -- felt -- felton --</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Feldafing, tha -- after liberation, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s876">How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: I wa -- I couldn’t live in Germany.</span> <span id="s878">Somehow I felt I have to get out.</span> <span id="s879">I really had -- I sort of felt I -- I sort of felt that I have to get out.</span> <span id="s880">And what happened, I speak Hebrew, and my brother speak Hebrew, so they made me a leader in movement to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s881">They made me sort of a manager, and they gave me a card so we’d go there.</span> <span id="s882">But then the Israeli brigade -- a soldier disappear-appeared, name of Ithzak, I don’t know where from.</span> <span id="s883">And we had meetings and I think I was in Germany, must have been about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: In this same camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Same camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: For a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: And during that time you were recovering and --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Well, I was recovering, my brother started going to school.</span> <span id="s890">I start to read [indecipherable] you know, I probably had other people read, study a little bit.</span> <span id="s891">I’m not sure whether I start to study English or not.</span> <span id="s892">But I was involved in this organization and I was really free.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: And you were t-trying to get ready to go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Well, I really didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s895">I have a very rich uncle in Africa.</span> <span id="s896">My -- but here --</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Where -- where in Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Johannesburg, South Africa.</span> <span id="s899">And my brother wrote a letter to him, and he [indecipherable] and it wasn’t really nice.</span> <span id="s900">He said look, the war is over, I’m not making as much money, and we felt how dare you, here people are getting killed.</span> <span id="s901">Your brother got killed, your whole brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: This was your father’s brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Brother, in Johannesburg.</span> <span id="s904">And he sent us five pounds, which is -- you know.</span> <span id="s905">And he said go back to Lithuania, at least you have a bed to sleep in.</span> <span id="s906">We did not, we never sent him another letter.</span> <span id="s907">We felt we are really -- so we were free.</span> <span id="s908">I don’t know what I did really except being there.</span> <span id="s909">I remember getting skis, skiing, we got a sailboat and had a washing machine.</span> <span id="s910">We lived in a villa.</span> <span id="s911">In fact, we lived in a villa [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: And how many people were living in the villa with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: I’m not sure, but we weren't crowded.</span> <span id="s914">We weren’t crowded, we lived -- we had -- I remember having washing machine there and then we found a sailboat, but [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Was the villa within the camp, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: No, it was outs -- outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Outside, but related to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Right, in the area.</span> <span id="s919">In the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: And then -- then I think I was -- I was in th -- in Italy probably in March.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Now wait a minute, how did you get to Italy, you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: This [indecipherable] this very brigade I think the -- the [indecipherable] the German and the Italian guards and they smuggle us through the Alps.</span> <span id="s924">They had the British army cars and they took us over there.</span> <span id="s925">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Now this was when?</span> <span id="s927">This was --</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: That was probably spring ’66 -- ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: ’46, so the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: The war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: And you went to Italy on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: No, it -- organized.</span> <span id="s933">I mean we were sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: We were sort of -- we were organized to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: We were organized, and we would follow --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Oh, so this was the first leg of your trip to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Correct, it was a -- we were trained to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: And we were to follow -- end up in Cyprus, because you know, they intervened and people end up in Cyprus.</span> <span id="s942">And then in Italy, once I decided I didn’t want to go to i -- to united -- to Israel, or to --</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: This is at Castle Gondolfa?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Castle Gondolfa.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: And was that sort of a --</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: It was a hotel -- it was a hotel that we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: And I don’t know about UNRRA, ORT paid for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: In fact, [indecipherable] it’s next to [indecipherable] I remember it.</span> <span id="s951">Q: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: In fact, I have a picture.</span> <span id="s953">We had a kitchen on there.</span> <span id="s954">And ORT decided -- asked me I want to trade.</span> <span id="s955">So I was going to school learning how to be on the radios.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: To be a?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: A radio technician.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Radio technician, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: And we hired an English teacher, start reading English, but my English was lousy.</span> <span id="s960">[indecipherable] but then I would take newspaper, and I bought a -- a dictionary and try to interpret the letters.</span> <span id="s961">And we stayed there til I arrived in this country --</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Now, you stayed there and while you were staying there, waiting to go to Israel, you decided you didn’t want to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Right, so I sta --</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: And why was that that you decided you did not want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Because I got disappointed they -- their presentation of -- the Israeli who came over talk to us, I felt they’re not sincere.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: I just felt they are just -- they are just using the -- just -- I -- I -- it’s just -- just lost faith in them.</span> <span id="s968">I just felt that I just -- I just didn’t like them after awhile.</span> <span id="s969">I mean, I felt they shouldn’t be in the black market.</span> <span id="s970">I mean, I shouldn’t have seen it.</span> <span id="s971">You know whatever it is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s972">The American woman came in, they were all done with all make-up, I never was used to that.</span> <span id="s973">And now again a bad presentation, but -- so I was pretty busy and my brother was busy, he -- I th -- I’m not sure whether he was going to school [indecipherable] studied English and we st -- go to school, both of us went to be radio technicians or electronic technicians.</span> <span id="s974">And we stayed there til I came this country in November ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Now, how did you get to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: I have a cousin who lives in Washington and her mother -- I really don’t know to this day, but I think her mother died and my mother was very nice to her.</span> <span id="s977">She raised her.</span> <span id="s978">And her dad came to this country and remarried, so she -- and finally he sent her papers.</span> <span id="s979">So she came to this country when she 15, was very smart.</span> <span id="s980">She sent us pictures when she was 16, graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s981">And she kept ri -- writing us letters and send us 10 poun -- 10 dollars and said --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Now this was before the war, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: No, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: -- after?</span> <span id="s985">After.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: After the war, and said come to United States and I don’t have anyone, I don’t have a family, and she kept send us clothes and --</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: And how was she your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: She -- ma -- her -- I don’t really know, I think her mother wa -- and my mother were sisters.</span> <span id="s989">And her mother died --</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: -- so my mother raised her, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: In your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: No, I don’t remember it, but she must have been in our house because --</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: -- in our house, I remember, we’d always have guests for a month or two, from [indecipherable] Friday night, my dad would always pick up a guest from si -- from synagogue.</span> <span id="s996">Saturday morning we picked up a guest.</span> <span id="s997">We always had a lot of people staying in our house.</span> <span id="s998">I guess we were considered well-to-do in [indecipherable] small town.</span> <span id="s999">So she actually bombarded us to come this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: You and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Yeah, my sis -- she also took over my sister, but my sister was smart, Anna was smarter than that, she knew she didn’t want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1002">So she stayed in Germany and came from Germany directly to United States.</span> <span id="s1003">And she came the year -- she bo -- must have arrived in ’46 or ’45.</span> <span id="s1004">She came earlier.</span> <span id="s1005">So my sister already was in United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: And did this cousin help your sister get here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yeah, yeah, she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: So your sister was in touch with this cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: And how did you find out about your sister after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: I got word of her, she was somehow -- she was in Russia, but somehow the borders were not permanent and she managed to come to Czechoslovakia back in our camp.</span> <span id="s1012">In fact, I had a coat for her, you know, a nice coat which I gave to her then.</span> <span id="s1013">But she knew, my sister knew that she didn’t want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1014">She didn’t -- she didn’t want to, she -- she knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: And how did you learn about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: I never did.</span> <span id="s1017">I never did.</span> <span id="s1018">I learned through friends -- my sister never spoke about it, and -- but other -- you know, the march that never took place in our camp, took place in Poland, it was very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: And the story I got, that my mother and my sister were together, and they were walk -- and my mother was younger.</span> <span id="s1021">She -- she always -- anyway, what -- the story I got that my mother felt she couldn’t make it, and she had a sweater.</span> <span id="s1022">So she gave the sweater to my sister for protection and she probably fell back, and she froze to death.</span> <span id="s1023">But she could have been, if my dad was 45, she probably was two or three years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1025">So, you had this cousin in Washington, and she said come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Right, she sent us papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: What -- what did she spend -- I think we also had -- I have friends, not relatives who very, very much proud of my mother from a small town of -- I’m not sure who send the money, but my cousin was administrator, she went to embassies and everything else, sent us the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: And that was in ’46?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: So you came from Italy to Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: New York, was Staten Island -- Staten Island?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: And then they met me on a train, and I came to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1038">So you came through New York, but you came directly to Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1040">As a matter of fact, it was -- my cousin, she’s a nice person but she -- I never saw corned beef in my life, you know, I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1041">She gave me corned beef sandwiches, but right now she’s not telling me how expensive it is, I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s1042">And even in Italy we had -- we -- somehow we had a suit made there and they put in lining to your knees, you know, you -- and I had a suitcase and we dyed sheets -- they have a cover for the suitcase [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1043">So that was it, and so we stayed.</span> <span id="s1044">We didn’t stay wi-with my cousin at all, she had five kids.</span> <span id="s1045">She lived North Capital, you know, where the printing office is, here under Union station.</span> <span id="s1046">But we stayed with the friends of mine who had a small grocery store where Griffin [indecipherable] is, there where the [indecipherable] start, on Peace Street and Georgia Avenue, tiny little store.</span> <span id="s1047">And we stayed with them and they were so -- I don’t know, you know, we sleep -- slept there and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Now, were these people that you had known in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: No, they knew my mother.</span> <span id="s1050">I never knew them, they knew my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Okay, but they were from Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Yeah, they were from the same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: And then someone knew the owner of Giants, Greer Conn.</span> <span id="s1055">The rabbi of my cousin knew Conn and they need people.</span> <span id="s1056">So I got a job in Giants putting up stock.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: And did you continue to live with these people that you started with, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: No, I lived with them for a month, but then I lived with my sister for about -- til I got married.</span> <span id="s1059">I got married in 1950.</span> <span id="s1060">And my brother-in-law and my sister, she didn’t have children, I would give my whole salary to support her.</span> <span id="s1061">And my cousin Esther had a grocery store on the same street, so -- and after awhile I felt, I said I need a little bit more money for myself too, you know, I can’t give all that.</span> <span id="s1062">I started to working 54 hours a week for 27 and a half dollars [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Well now, when you came to this country did you know some English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: I thought I did, but I spoke very fast and I probably still do.</span> <span id="s1065">I thought I did, but obviously I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1066">And then I started going to Americanization school, yeah.</span> <span id="s1067">And I got [indecipherable] Central High.</span> <span id="s1068">And they liked me, they gave me a good recommendation, they told me [indecipherable] would take the streetcar [indecipherable] the streetcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: And how did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Youth Community Center, 16 [indecipherable] Street, it was a dance.</span> <span id="s1071">She liked my red cheeks.</span> <span id="s1072">And she was true American born, from the navy, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: American born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Yeah, very much, very patriotic.</span> <span id="s1075">Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s1076">She came in ’42, they drafted her to work for the navy, and we start dating and -- and I didn't -- I didn’t really like to leave my sister.</span> <span id="s1077">I didn’t like my brother-in-law, he -- he made me sort of uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1078">Any evening I would eat, he would tell me how much a meal like that would cost outside.</span> <span id="s1079">I just -- it’s just that I didn’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1080">And he got a good break, because -- but I didn't like it, he -- he would just go -- we didn’t have any money [indecipherable] washed and his nails done.</span> <span id="s1081">I said gee, something’s not right here neither.</span> <span id="s1082">So I stayed with them til 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: So you stayed with them til you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: And then we moved out to a rental apartment in southeast Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1088">Now you were working in the grocery store, and then what happened from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Well, what happened was there people liked me.</span> <span id="s1090">And what happened, I was putting up stock, but then I got wind if you be a cashier and if you worked a whole week and you come in within a dollar, you get five dollar bonuses.</span> <span id="s1091">So I became a cashier.</span> <span id="s1092">I liked that.</span> <span id="s1093">But then they promised me to make me assistant manager, or manager, but that never happened.</span> <span id="s1094">Once [indecipherable] from United States run out, people from Canada came in.</span> <span id="s1095">And I always was first fiddle, but I never could lead the band, you know, it always bothered me.</span> <span id="s1096">And the hours are terrible.</span> <span id="s1097">If they don’t like you -- first of all, leave money, you can’t -- if you have to go to the bathroom you can’t do it, because it’s money.</span> <span id="s1098">And the managers play games with you, they don’t like you.</span> <span id="s1099">Like you would work from nine to nine, with two breaks.</span> <span id="s1100">If they don’t like you, they send you for lunch half an hour at eleven and then three, from three til nine, it’s a long day.</span> <span id="s1101">So I complained to my wife and she never told me what to do, but I cannot complain because I was [indecipherable] and one time she said, you know what, she said, you’ll be gray and old and still be smiling to the womans down there.</span> <span id="s1102">Because now a young fellow would come the summertime with shorts two sizes too small and throw yourself at him.</span> <span id="s1103">So that’s the register.</span> <span id="s1104">So I went up at school in the Capital Radio Engineering Institute, on 16 and Columbia, and I said look, I have a high school diploma, I can’t prove it.</span> <span id="s1105">And I took the radio school, is there any chance for me to enroll in your night school?</span> <span id="s1106">They say oh, we’ll think about it.</span> <span id="s1107">And then they called me up, said we’ll you exam.</span> <span id="s1108">And apparently I did well on the math part, because I’m sure my [indecipherable] was lousy, and they accepted me.</span> <span id="s1109">So I told the manager I’m going to school.</span> <span id="s1110">He was a good guy, he said I hate you.</span> <span id="s1111">I said why do you hate me?</span> <span id="s1112">He said, I have to rearrange the whole -- everybody’s schedule to meet your school schedule, whole school -- oh -- and store [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1113">But he did it.</span> <span id="s1114">I mean, he complained, he did it.</span> <span id="s1115">And I started going to school but I found out I didn’t have the language, so I really was struggling the first two years, my grades were lousy.</span> <span id="s1116">C minus, barely made it, but they didn’t get mad.</span> <span id="s1117">They didn’t get mad, and after two years I got the nick of it, I picked up very nicely.</span> <span id="s1118">So I quit Giants and worked in various repair shops like Phillip’s and George’s and they fired me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: So what was -- what was your training in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: It’s sch -- o-official training?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Well, I think I’m equivalent to high school from back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: And well, i-i-it was a trade that you studied?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: I studied a trade in Italy, how to make radios.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: No, but at this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: No, that was a junior college, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: A junior college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Junior coll -- a technical.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Technical.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Technical college, very good with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: And so when you finished you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: You got associate degree [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: In?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: In electronics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: In electronics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: In electronics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1138">That’s what I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: And we had more electric --</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: -- wanted to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: -- more subject than you get from a B.S. in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: I mean, you got 80 credit hours.</span> <span id="s1144">Strictly, the school didn’t concentrate so much in math and -- but really to the point, you know, electronics lab, transmission, the whole nine yard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: So a lot of practical stuff --</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: A lot of very practi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: -- you could get a job with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: More than practical stuff.</span> <span id="s1149">Maybe not high powered math, but we could design th-the -- well.</span> <span id="s1150">In fact I was so naïve I thought I can buy a television station now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: We have to turn over the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Leonard Gordon.</span> <span id="s1155">This is tape number two, side two.</span> <span id="s1156">And did you have more schooling, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Yes, I had quite a bit more schooling after I went to Capital Radio Engineering Institute, which I thought was a very good practical electronics school.</span> <span id="s1158">I got a job in the navy, the David Taylor Model Basin, which is a resource organization.</span> <span id="s1159">And I went to GW University and I took courses in math and physics and I became a professional person, I became electronic engineer.</span> <span id="s1160">And during my third year I took awful lot of courses.</span> <span id="s1161">I took courses in acoustics in Catholic University, American University.</span> <span id="s1162">A lot of courses were given at our campus like speed reading, English, management.</span> <span id="s1163">I was a government representative for contracts.</span> <span id="s1164">Actually my career was very s -- very colorful, and I think I -- probably if I add -- add up all my courses, probably equivalent to a Masters degree in electronic engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: And what was your primary job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: In the navy I was a electronic engineer and my job was to design special equipment that we couldn’t purchase.</span> <span id="s1167">And it took quite a bit to do, I had to do some research development, because I was in acoustics and a lot of equipment was not available.</span> <span id="s1168">In fact, I dese -- developed a system which I applied for a patent, but tat -- it so happened with [indecipherable] I never received it.</span> <span id="s1169">When -- and I was in charge of abs -- obtaining the whole system for the scale model equipment which we performed at a lot of experience in the [indecipherable] which is a [indecipherable] pristine lake.</span> <span id="s1170">My -- I was charged with the work with the whole data acquisition system and analysis system.</span> <span id="s1171">And this project turned out to be a very big success for the navy.</span> <span id="s1172">As a matter of fact, they’re testing right now on the new submarines, the future submarines on the navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Could you talk about your religious life after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: Yes, my -- I grew up the religious family, but that was a way of life back home, my dad, we didn't work on Saturday, went to synagogue, my mother would prepare all the foods on Friday.</span> <span id="s1175">But when I came to this country, not that I was not religious -- religious, but we kept a kosher home, but we would eat out -- out, and I would not attend as much the religious services as I guess was expected of me.</span> <span id="s1176">Of course my son was Bar Mitzvah, my daughter was confirmed, we had a party.</span> <span id="s1177">But after my wife passed away -- also, my son was going to Hebrew school, and then after Hebrew school he was going to meet [indecipherable] which was part of Hebrew academy.</span> <span id="s1178">And I really never knew how much he knew as far as religion is concerned.</span> <span id="s1179">But when my wife passed away I stayed with him for about a month and he observed -- in the Jewish tradition if we -- someone loses a parent, he observe for a whole year and say special prayers.</span> <span id="s1180">And here our son, in Orthodox synagogue conducting services, and I was very much impressed by it.</span> <span id="s1181">And after that I thought, since my son can do it, I should be able to do it too.</span> <span id="s1182">And as a result of it, I’m training, I’m doing various parts of the religious services in our synagogue.</span> <span id="s1183">I’m conducting services in the evening.</span> <span id="s1184">I attend Friday night services.</span> <span id="s1185">I’m going in the morning for services, maybe not every day but I turned back to -- towards religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Have you been back to Europe since you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: No, I -- I went in 1950, it was our 25th anniversary, we went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1188">It was a very successful trip but in Europe I didn’t have desire to go back.</span> <span id="s1189">I was in business in England and one time, but I’ve -- really don’t have any desire to go to Germany or to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1190">Reason being, I somehow cannot -- feel very uncomfortable being in Germany.</span> <span id="s1191">In Lithuania I’m actually afraid of my life, because even wa -- even though I was very young, I know the town.</span> <span id="s1192">We were in a town about 30,000 people and I think about 8,000 Jewish people and I’m afraid that I’m living evidence that I’m alive and people might not be happy about it and I’m really afraid of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: And about your trip to Israel, how was that for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Well, I was in Israel twice.</span> <span id="s1195">The first time I was with my wife and we were th -- there I think a month, and we were in [indecipherable] which I was very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1196">We took tours.</span> <span id="s1197">Of course, I did not live with the Israelis, we lived in hotels.</span> <span id="s1198">But I was very comfortable, I could read a paper, I could understand the newspaper.</span> <span id="s1199">And I was very impressed that people, Jewish people are sweeping the streets, and are doing maintenance and building equipment.</span> <span id="s1200">Like the day we left, a person came in four in the morning and said, I’m a Jewish [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1201">And he brought us coffee, I was very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1202">Now, just last year, it’s I think ’98 I went to Israel, B’nai Brith for a month.</span> <span id="s1203">And something happened to me, I got sick, Marge got sick, so I could not -- I could see but not as well, but I thought that Israel changed quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1204">More competitive and I think I just -- it’s really different when I thought it should be.</span> <span id="s1205">People are more interested in what they can get out of you and which house do you live, they live in a villa.</span> <span id="s1206">It just did not impress me that -- that’s the country should be run like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: So would you say you were disappointed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Somewhat.</span> <span id="s1209">I really was -- what -- I was happy, I met a friend of mine who is a professor in Haifa University and he lives in Hallal, which is north of Haifa, which is a small farm.</span> <span id="s1210">He was very happy to see him.</span> <span id="s1211">Also, a friend of mine we see there, a lady friend, she gave me a picture from a high school, which I never had and she drove me around.</span> <span id="s1212">She was very nice, but generally the fabric of Israel, it’s, in my opinion it’s changed quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: People are more materialistic which you know the fir -- after two minutes, how much money do you make?</span> <span id="s1215">And I felt it’s not proper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1217">What about reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Well, being in concentration camp, the German government I think was Eidenhower, decided to pay back for the atr-atr-atrocities that they did to people being in camp.</span> <span id="s1219">But at that time I felt it’s bloody money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Wha -- I -- you said Eisenhower decided to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: And a -- a -- no, Eidenaur -- Edenauer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Oh, Adenauer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Adenauer, Adenauer.</span> <span id="s1224">And I felt that it’s bloody money, I didn’t want any part of it, therefore I didn’t apply.</span> <span id="s1225">But recently, after I retired I felt well, a little bit of money would help.</span> <span id="s1226">And I applied the commission, I wrote an essay, my experience in camp, and after several years it was accepted.</span> <span id="s1227">And the people ask me for income tax return, and I read in -- in the Washington Post that if your income for a single person 16,000 dollars and a family 21,000 dollars, that your claim will not be honored.</span> <span id="s1228">So even though I’m entitled to it, I doubt I’ll get any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1230">Do you have some feelings about that?</span> <span id="s1231">,,</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Yes, I felt my being in camp does not have anything to do with how much money I earned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: And I-I -- I don’t know wha-what’s the si -- situation is in New York, who is the executor and wh-who-who makes the policies, I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: In fact just recently I spoke to my accountant and he said well, your income, it’s old a -- old age pension and social security.</span> <span id="s1237">And I felt I meet a criteria but he send away my papers and I was rejected saying under my circumstances they cannot pay me any renumeration for -- because I was in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Can we go back to when you came to this country?</span> <span id="s1239">Did you speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: I thought I did.</span> <span id="s1241">After deciding that I didn’t want to go to Israel, I tried to learn English.</span> <span id="s1242">I was in Italy then.</span> <span id="s1243">I think my brother and I hired an English lady, which she gave us some le-lessons.</span> <span id="s1244">But I’m not sure how much I knew about it.</span> <span id="s1245">For instance, five [indecipherable] I spoke very fast.</span> <span id="s1246">But I tried to interpret it, I would buy a new -- an English newspaper and a dictionary and try to make sense out of it.</span> <span id="s1247">And then when I came to this country I si -- I thought I could speak quite well, but apparently people did not understand me too well.</span> <span id="s1248">And then I tried very much, I took Americanization school, I took college English.</span> <span id="s1249">I t -- I tried to learn as much as I can.</span> <span id="s1250">I also tried very much to lose my accent, but apparently after pu-puberty, y-you don’t have too much of a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: So you worked hard at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: I really did.</span> <span id="s1253">I married American -- person who was ma -- born in the United States, who spoke English at home.</span> <span id="s1254">And she was American as apple pie.</span> <span id="s1255">All her family are veterans.</span> <span id="s1256">But -- we didn't speak any other language at home but English.</span> <span id="s1257">And I didn’t speak as much Yiddish, which is Jewish, with my sister, you know, occasionally we would do it.</span> <span id="s1258">But I c-c -- I could not lose my accent, but I tried to be as American as -- as possibly I could be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Was it difficult for you to learn and adjust to American customs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1261">I think it’s -- I’m very appreciative towards the country.</span> <span id="s1262">I think they were very helpful to me.</span> <span id="s1263">I mean I -- they didn’t help me that much, but they didn’t hinder me neither.</span> <span id="s1264">For instance, I worked in Giant food stores and I told the manager that I’d like to go to school.</span> <span id="s1265">He had to rearrange the whole schedule, I don’t know whether 50 people, 100 people.</span> <span id="s1266">He said he hates me, but nevertheless it was just a matter of speech, he did it, and I had a chance to go to school at night, which I was very much appreciative of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Now that -- probably I would not r-remain an employee Giants.</span> <span id="s1269">So in general I think this country was very nice to me.</span> <span id="s1270">I became a citizen after being married, without any difficulty.</span> <span id="s1271">I didn’t have any -- I di -- I wasn’t -- I never felt I was being discriminated because of my belief, I worked for various jobs, on assembly line and never was mentioned that well, you’re Jewish or something.</span> <span id="s1272">I never felt discriminated, ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1274">Did you have friends who were survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Yes, in the beginning we had friends because we went to Americanization school and we sort of huddled together, but after awhile these sort of -- each one went their own ways and -- I had a friend that moved away to Boston and then he ended up to Israel, he -- and I -- each -- after we got married each one sort of [indecipherable] friendship dispersed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Did you talk about your experiences with your wife and other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1278">We -- it was not -- no secret, but we never dwelled on it at -- I was in camp there for [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1279">If I would not have been in camp I would have been this and that.</span> <span id="s1280">I was busy going to school and trying to do good on my job.</span> <span id="s1281">And my wife worked all the time, she also tried to -- we had -- we had a little bit money problems raising a family, our incomes were not as big and we t -- we tried to get a -- our children as much education we can.</span> <span id="s1282">For instance they went -- they took piano lessons, they took dancing, they do everything which kids are doing.</span> <span id="s1283">And we were involved into that but we never dwelled because we -- I was in camp, that -- that is just the past time and you just go on with life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Your wife worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Yes, she worked her whole life actually, she started off -- she was with Pittsburgh [indecipherable] and they recruited her in 1942 for the navy.</span> <span id="s1286">And she would work late hours to support the fleet, typing by hand, you know, three and four pages, before we had a word processor, for [indecipherable] make sure that the [indecipherable] fleet has all the parts.</span> <span id="s1287">She worked for, I think the air force -- I mean, the air -- the navy air in the temporary buildings [indecipherable] the Constitution.</span> <span id="s1288">And then she worked there, but at that time I think women were not considered equal.</span> <span id="s1289">And no matter what she did, all those people from the naval academy, or whoever they were s -- they took all the credit.</span> <span id="s1290">So she actually got mad and got a job at the labor department and they recognize her ability and she did very well.</span> <span id="s1291">She worked in personnel and she moved herself up very nicely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1293">Back to talking about your experiences.</span> <span id="s1294">Did you tell your children what you had been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: No, I ne -- I never -- I never shied away with it, but we never went to a lengthy discussion that I was in camp, or what happened.</span> <span id="s1296">I -- they knew they didn’t have grandparents and I’m sure they figured out, but it was never brought up.</span> <span id="s1297">I heard my son one time wrote a very nice paper about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1298">It was very -- I think he was a teenager, 13 or 14, I really don’t remember how old he was.</span> <span id="s1299">It was very thorough.</span> <span id="s1300">I don’t know where he got the information, but I wasn’t the one who supplied him with the information.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Have you been to the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Once.</span> <span id="s1303">I was in the Holocaust Museum because being a survivor I’m getting -- and occasionally I contribute a little bit when asked, for fundraising.</span> <span id="s1304">And oh -- I have sort of trouble, I get very emotional about it.</span> <span id="s1305">But I was just recently where it was made a film about the Jewish brigade.</span> <span id="s1306">People from Chicago and it was one soldier who was in the brigade.</span> <span id="s1307">The film was okay, but after there was commentary and I thought that they said that General Eisenhower said that he would send people back where they came from.</span> <span id="s1308">And I don’t think that was true because I feel that I’m -- my life I’m -- my life to General Eisenhower.</span> <span id="s1309">We were in camp, and we were li-liberated.</span> <span id="s1310">I’m not sure whether it was the third or Seventh Army, but three or four days prior, the time that it -- people -- the camp authorities, so to speak, thought th-the -- the allied forces would come in.</span> <span id="s1311">I don’t think I would have made that three or four days.</span> <span id="s1312">And General Eisenhower came to our camp, Feldafing was a hith -- Hitler youth camp, and after that they put in refugees they called displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1313">And I was away from him maybe an arm’s length.</span> <span id="s1314">I was very much impressed with him.</span> <span id="s1315">He was tall, handsome, with army boots and he was very much disturbed, his eyes were filled with tears.</span> <span id="s1316">So I really don’t agree what people said, that he want to send people back to where they came from.</span> <span id="s1317">And also they mentioned that in the camp they were not Jewish and they were very upset.</span> <span id="s1318">I’m not sure which camps the brigade came in, but our camp was solid Jewish.</span> <span id="s1319">We were part of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1321">Well, I don’t have any more questions.</span> <span id="s1322">Is there anything else that you would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Well, shall we talk about my children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: My wife and I raised two children, Mark and Marcia.</span> <span id="s1326">They were -- right now they’ve bor -- my son was born 1956, and my daughter in ’59, and we’re very proud of them.</span> <span id="s1327">I think -- they’re pro -- they are professional now.</span> <span id="s1328">My son is a surgical oncologist and my daughter is a dentist.</span> <span id="s1329">He went to Northwestern University and was a biomedical engineer.</span> <span id="s1330">And then he had several acceptances to medical school.</span> <span id="s1331">He went to Northwestern University Medical School, and then he did his surgil -- surgical residency in Cornell, New York for five years, and then he did a fellowship in Sloan-Kettering and now he’s private practice in White Plains.</span> <span id="s1332">I feel he is a very good surgeon and is a very good man.</span> <span id="s1333">He published several papers.</span> <span id="s1334">His paper was one the first ones International Congress in Toronto a few years back.</span> <span id="s1335">I’m not sure where he’s publishing now.</span> <span id="s1336">My daughter again, she went to Washington University and she was double major, she had a teacher’s certificate in biology and she was accepted in several -- early admission to several dental schools.</span> <span id="s1337">She ended up going to nor -- Northwestern University and then she did a internship for the navy, I think [indecipherable] for -- for the navy, I think, there were about 90 - 100 applicants for one person to accept it, and she was the one.</span> <span id="s1338">And she published several papers there.</span> <span id="s1339">And right now she is practicing with her husband who is also a dentist in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1340">And I think -- maybe I’m prejudiced, but I think she is a crackerjack dentist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: And I have grandchildren right now.</span> <span id="s1343">My son has three children.</span> <span id="s1344">In fact, I was -- just came from Bar Mitzvah for my grandson, th -- his name is Benjamin,
