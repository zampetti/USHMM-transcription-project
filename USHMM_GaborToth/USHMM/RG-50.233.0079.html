it could never happen in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Do you remember any stories in particular when you were listening to these refugees in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Yes we had a young actor whose father was a very famous actor as a matter of fact in Germany and he told us that he was in a camp and that they treated him very badly but I mean they did not talk too much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">And they settled in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">They settled in Austria or tried to settle in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Did your family feel safe in Austria even after 1934?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Yes actually yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Was there any experience with antisemitism in Vienna itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">By Austrians?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Oh yes, a lot, a lot of antisemitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Do you recall any incidents either in the theater or in public or in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">I went to school with a daughter of Seyss-Inquart.</span> <span id="s94">She was sitting next to me and she was .....</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Do you recall her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Oh yes Inge, Inge Seyss-Inquart and she would brush her sleeves when she touched us.</span> <span id="s97">There were a lot of Jewish girls in the class.</span> <span id="s98">Half of the class was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">So she had to wipe her blouse of what - Jewish breath or Jewish germs?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Jewish germs yes I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">So they knew you were Jewish or part Jewish in this class?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Oh yes with the name of Grunbaum there was no doubt.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">There was no doubt.</span> <span id="s104">How about your father did he have any experiences with antisemitism?</span> <span id="s105">You mentioned that he was an army war veteran?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Well when he was in the army he never told anything about it to us, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">How about as a furrier?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Well he never talked about it.</span> <span id="s109">He certainly had some experience because there was a lot of antisemitism in Austria at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Do you recall what neighborhood you lived in Vienna?</span> <span id="s111">Was it a mixed neighborhood or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Mixed - but in the neighborhood I really cannot say that I had antisemitism, we felt it in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">You had friends who were Protestant, Catholic and Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Yes but mainly Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Mainly Jewish friends - of your own age - both genders or just girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">At this time just girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">How about your brother did he have any - do you recall any experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Not before Hitler came not that he talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">You mentioned that you were in the theater.</span> <span id="s120">Did you have dreams as you grew up of becoming an actress?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Oh sure - we went to the Vienna Conservatory when we were children already, my brother and I, both of us and we took up - this was called Kinderconservatory - conservatory for children.</span> <span id="s122">I was seven and my brother was six when we entered and you know we had all kinds of music lessons -

there was a very famous opera singer - her name was Elizabeth Schumann and when she gave a concert she always had in between a young musician so she could rest.</span> <span id="s131">My brother played with her the first time when he was fourteen and then every concert she gave he played.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">In Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">In Vienna, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">And what was your brother's great dream as he grew up?</span> <span id="s135">This is your younger brother.</span> <span id="s136">.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">He wanted to be a pianist and a conductor.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">in Austria - In Vienna?</span> <span id="s139">Salzburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Well at this time, yeah, in Vienna, Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">That was the preference?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Oh sure Vienna was always for music.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">There was no talk of leaving Austria - of going.</span> <span id="s144">.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">No not when we were children.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Now do things become better or worse after the Dolfuss incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">It became worse.</span> <span id="s148">First of all there was a lot of unemployment.</span> <span id="s149">It was very hard to find a job and the antisemitism was pretty bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Even before Hitler came.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Yeah Did you follow the career of Inge Seyss-Inquart?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">No Did you know who her father was at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Well yeah, we know something that he was a Nazi but you know how old was I, fifteen or so.</span> <span id="s154">We were not so interested in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">You were more interested in art?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Yes much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Do you recall any classmates who were Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Oh yes we had quite a few.</span> <span id="s159">I couldn't tell you the name now because this is too long ago but we had quite a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">They cause any problems in the class - did they try to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Well they separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">They just tried to stay away.</span> <span id="s163">Did they attack any students?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">How about the teachers.</span> <span id="s166">Did you find them to be sympathetic or loyal to the republic?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Well we had a lot of Jewish teachers in this school and a few who were not Jewish and were more or less antisemitic.</span> <span id="s168">We had a few of them too but it was not too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">You could live with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">We could live with it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Do you remember where you were when the Nazis finally took over Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">I was in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">You were in Italy.</span> <span id="s174">How did you get to Italy?</span> <span id="s175">How could a nice little Austrian girl go to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Go to Italy?</span> <span id="s177">It started out that I was looking for an engagement in the theater and I had a contract to teach in Bodenbach which is in the Sudentenland and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Czechoslovakia then?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Sudentenland, yeah but they were already thinking - German.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">And you had to submit all your papers, of course.</span> <span id="s181">And I had a stage name.</span> <span id="s182">My stage name was Hermann, Trude Hermann.</span> <span id="s183">Of course I had to submit my real name and with Grunbaum right away they wouldn't give me the contract.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">This is in Sudentenland?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Yes and the same happened to me in Linz.</span> <span id="s186">I had a contract there too and they wouldn't take me when they found out that I was not</span></p> <p><span id="s187">an aryan.</span> <span id="s188">.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">This was before Hitler's time?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">This was in 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">That's interesting because your Jewish name - even though you were a protestant ...</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Yes this didn't cut any ice with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Linz and then the Sudentenland.</span> <span id="s194">Do you remember any of the towns in the Sudentenland?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Tetschen-Bodenbach [Podmokly] it was called.</span> <span id="s196">Tetschen-Bodenbach.</span> <span id="s197">And then my agent , you know you had to have an agent, he suggested that I go to Italy because he said I will not get any contract in a German speaking country.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">What did your parents think of your career in the theater and then going to Italy of all places?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Well, I was twenty then and could do whatever.</span> <span id="s200">.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">So you had relatively liberal parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Yes, and I went to Italy and I was in Milano when the anschluss came and my mother wrote me immediately please don't come back because our contract in Italy was already not expired but had one more month I think to go and she said try to stay in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">And you recall when you went to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Yes in September 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">And you had what a one year, six months.</span> <span id="s206">.</span> <span id="s207">?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">No we had a three months contract and then we were another three months so we were in Italy in March when the anschluss happened - in Milano.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">And you obviously did not experience employment discrimination?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Not in Italy, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Your mother said, "Don't come back."</span> <span id="s212">"Don't come back, be glad you are in Italy."</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Were you glad?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Yes, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">So you remained in Milan?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">I remained in Milano.</span> <span id="s217">We had to go to vote.</span> <span id="s218">The German embassy came to the theater, took all our passports away because we were thirty girls from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">You had Austrian passports?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Austrian passports, yeah, and they told us we had to go to the consulate and when we were there they said we had to go to vote on the torpedo boat "Wolf" which was in Genoa.</span> <span id="s221">We would be brought there from the German Embassy.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">So the German consulate in Genoa.</span> <span id="s223">.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">No it was a German boat and on this you voted because a boat is territory, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Okay so a German boat in Genoa was going to be your voting booth?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">And they gave you of course free transportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Free transportation.</span> <span id="s229">And I didn't want to go but there was a very intelligent, I don't know what he was, attache or something, who called me in his office and said go and vote because you won't stop Hitler but he could stop you.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">This is a German attache at the consulate in Milan?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">In Milan, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">So he advised you to vote in the plebiscite approving...</span></p> <p><span id="s233">He said vote what you want but go to vote.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">And you voted?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">I voted, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Do you want to tell us how you voted?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Oh you had to say yes because you had to give the thing, the slip you voted on, you had to give in an envelope and were not allowed to close the envelope.</span> <span id="s238">You had to leave it open and then you handed it to some of the soldiers who were standing there and he took your passport, looked at your passport - so - what chance did you have to say no?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Right and besides they would have known who you were and it would have defeated the purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Immediately, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">And were they surprised in any way that you were voting?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">They could tell you had a Jewish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Yes.</span> <span id="s245">One soldier said to me I think you are on the wrong boat.</span> <span id="s246">We don't go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Sense of humor.</span> <span id="s248">This is a Nazi, possibly?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Possibly not.</span> <span id="s250">Because otherwise he would probably not let me vote.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">And the real reason why you voted?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Because this gentleman told me it would be better for me if I do it.</span> <span id="s253">I alone could not stop Hitler but he could stop me and he would have.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">And of course your real sentiment was.</span> <span id="s255">.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Not very friendly, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">What were the rest of your family doing?</span> <span id="s258">They were still in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">My father was in Switzerland on business and he stayed there and did not come back.</span> <span id="s260">My mother and my brother were in Vienna.</span> <span id="s261">My brother tried to get out of the country which wasn't easy because you needed an exit visa in order to get out but he had applied for an international music - piano - competition in Brussel and with this he got the exit visa and he went to Brussels.</span> <span id="s262">They didn't let him play because for them he was a German.</span> <span id="s263">And he tried to go to France and he couldn't get a visa to France either so I wrote him a letter from Italy telling him that I was very sick and he should immediately come and visit me and he went to the Italian consulate and they gave him a visa to enter Italy and so he got a transit visa from France and got off the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Did he discover that you were sick or did he discover that you made up the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Oh he knew I made up the story.</span> <span id="s266">He knew I wasn't sick.</span> <span id="s267">But he had the transit visa in France and he got off the train and went to Paris and my father was in Paris at this time and so he got always I think a three weeks or six weeks visa, I don't remember, and always to apply again and again.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">So basically you faked an illness in order to justify this transit visa through France .</span> <span id="s269">.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">And the Italians gave him the visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Which then allowed him to go France?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">To get the transit visa from France.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">And your mother meanwhile.</span> <span id="s274">.</span> <span id="s275">?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">My mother was in Prague in the meantime.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">She left Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">She left Vienna for good, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">What had happened to your brother's musical career if you back up just a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Well he started in Paris with Claude Arrau If we could go further back.</span> <span id="s281">He had begun at age fourteen in Vienna and then in 1938 the Nazis come.</span> <span id="s282">At that point where was his career?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">He was still a student in the Conservatory conducting classes and he gave concerts in Czechoslovakia and gave a concert in Karlsbat [Karlovy Vary].</span> <span id="s284">He gave several concerts in Vienna and then he went to France and he studied.</span> <span id="s285">There he never worked.</span> <span id="s286">He studied there with Claude Arrau.</span> <span id="s287">He tried to go to the United States but he didn't have a sponsor so my mother wrote a letter to a very famous violinist who my brother knew, Fritz Kreisler and Fritz Kreisler went with him to the consulate and got him a student visa for America and he came here as a student.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Do you recall when?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Yes in '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">In '39.</span> <span id="s291">Before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">I think in August '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">And you were still in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">I was in Italy.</span> <span id="s295">I didn't have a sponsor.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Still in Milan?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">No.</span> <span id="s298">In Rome, Milan, - we traveled.</span> <span id="s299">In Italy you traveled.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">So you had work?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">I had work.</span> <span id="s302">I always had work.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">How about your passport?</span> <span id="s304">After the Germans took over Austria, you voted.</span> <span id="s305">Were you still with an Austrian passport or did you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">No, the Austrian passport was good till the end of '38.</span> <span id="s307">I had an Austrian passport as long as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">When you had to renew your passport?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">I renewed my passport.</span> <span id="s310">I wrote to one of my aunts in Vienna.</span> <span id="s311">Please send me an aryanmacher [262] Do you know what that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Proof of aryan.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">This is very hard when you have a Jewish father.</span> <span id="s314">So she sent me all the documents of my mother and my maternal grandparents and my mother's certificate of matrimony.</span> <span id="s315">This was the funniest thing that I got a German passport without a J. I'll never know because in this said that my father was the son of Ivor Grunbaum and Zara[270] geboren Cohen.</span> <span id="s316">This is really not real.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">So it was falsified?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">No, no I got it Through anybody's help?</span> <span id="s319">Was it a mistake or was it just that you had a nice guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A nice guy A nice guy, but he certainly wasn't Jewish.</span> <span id="s321">This was the German consulate?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">It was the German consulate.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">In Milan.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">In Milan, no, in Rome.</span> <span id="s325">He gave it to me and once you had a German passport, you were okay.</span> <span id="s326">The Italians didn't ask any questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">So you had a non-Jewish passport even though your name is still Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Yeah Were there any changes when the war breaks out?</span> <span id="s329">.</span> <span id="s330">Your brother is in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">My mother was in France and my father, too.</span> <span id="s332">My father was in Paris and my mother was in Lyons with her second husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Oh, so your parents had divorced.</span> <span id="s334">Were they divorced before the anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Before, much before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Before you even went to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Yes, I was seventeen when my parents divorced so that must have been '34.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">The year Dolffus...</span></p> <p><span id="s339">The Dolffus year, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">But it had nothing to do with Dolffus?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">No it had nothing to do with Dolffus?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Nothing to do with being Jewish or Protestant or Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">No, in fact her second husband was Jewish too.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">So your mother was pro- Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Was pro-Jewish, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Did your father remarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">No but my mother came with her second husband.</span> <span id="s348">They went from Prague ... He was Czechoslovakian nationality, lived always in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Yelenek [293] is the Yelenek, yeah.</span> <span id="s350">He and his brother were born in Russia, by coincidence because their father worked there for several years and when they applied for a visa to the United States - they came on the Russian quota which was wide open - and got immediately a visa because they thought they were coming on the Czechoslovakian quota which was waiting list for years.</span> <span id="s351">But they didn't know that in American law your nationality where you were born and not what passport you have so these two were born in Odessa and my mother was married to a Russian.</span> <span id="s352">They got immediately the visa and they came via Casablanca because they could not go through France anymore and could not go to Spain.</span> <span id="s353">Spain wouldn't let them in so they had to go Casablanca and from Casablanca to Portugal and from Portugal they went to Cuba and from Cuba they went to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Do you recall when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">This must have been '40, no '41, no '40.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Had the Germans gone into Paris yet?</span> <span id="s357">.</span> <span id="s358">.</span> <span id="s359">in the Vichy?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">No, I think before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">But after the beginning of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">No they were in Paris already, the Germans when my mother left.</span> <span id="s363">My brother was ...</span></p> <p><span id="s364">In the United States In '39, he came in '39 So it would have been after June of 1940 I think so, yes.</span> <span id="s365">I don't quite recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Was it winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">I don't recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Well, maybe we'll remember later.</span> <span id="s369">But anyway by 1941 they were here.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">They were here, yeah.</span> <span id="s371">I think they came 1940, the end of 1940.</span> <span id="s372">It was certainly not '41 because I think they came in the fall of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">That would make sense.</span> <span id="s374">After the Germans had occupied France but still the freedom of Vichy because in Vichy you could go to Casablanca.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Yes.</span> <span id="s376">It certainly was 1940 because '41 was already Pearl Harbor and they were here already in Pearl Harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Meanwhile you're still in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">I was still in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">And Italy is in the war in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">It was in the war.</span> <span id="s381">That's why I don't recall.</span> <span id="s382">We could not correspond too well then.</span> <span id="s383">The mail took very long.</span> <span id="s384">I mean it was still possible because America was not in the war.</span> <span id="s385">But a letter took months.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">As a German passport holder you were an ally of Fascist Italy in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Yes, but the Fascists didn't bother you.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Did you get even better treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">No.</span> <span id="s390">We always got good treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">How about the anti-Jewish laws that Mussolini introduced.</span> <span id="s392">Did they have any affect on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">No Were there any examples of anti-semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">No I'd never seen anti-semitism in Italy.</span> <span id="s395">No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Were you working - in Rome mainly?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">I was working - no, we traveled around because in Italy you don't work in a theater.</span> <span id="s398">You work in a company and the company travels around?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">And who were you working with?</span> <span id="s400">Were they mixed, Italians, foreigners?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">All Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">So you were the only Austrian?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Oh, we were a couple of girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Were there others who were Jewish besides you?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Italians as well as Austrians?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Well, Italians I cannot tell.</span> <span id="s408">We never talked about religion.</span> <span id="s409">That was never brought up, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">It was all acting, art.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Italians never ask you any questions.</span> <span id="s412">We had to go to the police every six months to renew the working permit.</span> <span id="s413">They never ask any questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Do you recall some of the places where you toured?</span> <span id="s415">Did you perform say for troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">We did perform for hospitals, for veterans' hospitals.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Italian veteran hospitals Italian, yeah.</span> <span id="s418">Not for the Germans, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">You didn't perform for Germans.</span> <span id="s420">After all the German troops...</span></p> <p><span id="s421">No, we never performed for German troops, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">By this time you have very little contacts with your parents, your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Well, as soon as the war started in Austria they had no contact with anyone outside because you could not write to America.</span> <span id="s424">I didn't know where my father was in France because he left Paris - he came to Nizza [Nice] and then he was in hiding for the rest of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">But you knew your family was - your mother and your brother - were safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">I know that they were in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">So your father was the only member of your family that you worried about?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Yes I was because France was occupied by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">How did you feel about Italy being on the same side as Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Well we always had the feeling that the Italians didn't like it too much - being on the side - but they had very little choice because the German troops were already in Brenner and Mussolini was not too happy either I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Do you remember any specific instances of Italian actor or actresses voicing their opinions against Germany or against Mussolini?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">No.</span> <span id="s433">You did not voice against Mussolini too openly but we never talked about politics really.</span> <span id="s434">We were glad we could stay there and we worked - politics was never a big thing with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Politics came to you now.</span> <span id="s436">Suddenly in 1943 Italy surrendered and the Germans occupy all of Italy.</span> <span id="s437">Do you remember any changes in your life then?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Yes.</span> <span id="s439">Of course, first of all the theaters were closed.</span> <span id="s440">When the Americans landed I think in Sicily it was and in Naples the Germans destroyed all their papers in the consulate so they did not know who was in Italy of German descendants or aryan or Jewish or nothing.</span> <span id="s441">They knew nothing.</span> <span id="s442">They only could go to the police stations, to the Questura, and there they found out where German people were living.</span> <span id="s443">But the Italians would not give the information about religion, never did.</span> <span id="s444">To them everybody was an aryan.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">The Germans knew that you were where?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">In Rome and we were called in the German consulate and had the choice to return to the Reich or work as interpreters.</span> <span id="s447">Of course we worked as interpreters because nobody wanted to return to the Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">So you worked as an interpreter for the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">For three, four months and there were a lot of German girls who spoke Italian and after the war I remember the UNRRA came and we could get some food packages from the UNRRA and all the interpreters I met there were Jews who had worked for the Germans just like we, Mimi and I and several others.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Did you change your name at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">No because for the German Grunbaum is not a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s452">We had an officer who was called Grunbaum and he certainly was not a Jew.</span> <span id="s453">For the Austrians this was a Jewish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">That's an interesting difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Oh yes, Rosenbach in Austria was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">And one of the leading Nazis was a Rosenbach.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">So Grunbaum was a German Jewish name in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">In Austria it was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">In Germany it was a non-Jewish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Both.</span> <span id="s461">There were Jews who were called Grunbaum but not necessarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">And did you look Jewish or aryan?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">I don't know.</span> <span id="s464">Apparently aryan enough because nobody ever asked me anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">What color eyes did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">I have blue eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">You still do, blue eyes and your hair was....?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Red at the time.</span> <span id="s469">But anyway the Italians didn't give out any information.</span> <span id="s470">They saved a lot of people, I must say.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Do you know of people who were saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Oh yes, at least all of them who worked with me there.</span> <span id="s473">I know of a lot of people who were in Italy and everybody will tell you the same.</span> <span id="s474">The Italians did not give out information to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Now in Rome as you know in late 1943 there were some deportations.</span> <span id="s476">The Germans attempted to deport Italian Jews to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s477">Did you witness any of these incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">No, but I know where it happened in Largo Argentina but I didn't see it myself, thank goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Did you know of anybody who was sent away?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">I didn't know anybody, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">How about incidents of armed resistance.</span> <span id="s482">For example in March 1944 there was a major partisan attack on the SS and then there was the retaliation.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">The retaliation.</span> <span id="s484">Three hundred in the catacombs.</span> <span id="s485">I remember that because I lived very near where this attack took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Did you ever have occasion to see or meet Colonel Kappler, the commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">No, I never saw him but I know who he was.</span> <span id="s488">Who didn't know?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Was it a name that inspired trust and love or.</span> <span id="s490">.</span> <span id="s491">?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">No, hate.</span> <span id="s493">He was terrible.</span> <span id="s494">Every day, this was in '44 just before the war ended, they had some American and English prisoners and they would parade them and the Americans would go with the V sign and the Italians applauded.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">The Italians applauded the American prisoners that were paraded by the Germans in Rome.</span> <span id="s496">Were you ever in danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Well, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s498">I was not really in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">And you didn't have to hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Yes, in the last few weeks, I did hide because I was afraid that they would take me with them when the Germans left Rome.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">So you were an interpreter for three or four months and then what did you do after?</span> <span id="s502">You kind of drew away?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">No, I was pregnant at the time and could quit work in May, 1944 and then I had a very nice boss I must say and he called me up and said go in hiding because they are coming to get you.</span> <span id="s504">Because they wanted gentile persons, everybody, to go with them up north and of course I didn't want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">That was the original choice as I recall.</span> <span id="s506">Either return to the Reich or work as an interpreter?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">But there they wanted us to go, all interpreters, to go north with the troops and I didn't want to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">And why was this sudden renewed interest in going north.</span> <span id="s509">Was anything happening near Rome?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Oh yeah, the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">The Americans entered.</span> <span id="s512">You probably remembered the date that they entered?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Yes, June 4, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">So you hid just before June 4, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Yes, about ten days before.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">And then what happened after the Americans came?</span> <span id="s517">Did you have work?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Oh yeah, at first I returned to the theater and then I worked as an interpreter for the Americans until '48.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">By then you must have known quite a few languages.</span> <span id="s520">You started out being German speaking.</span> <span id="s521">.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Yes, I spoke Italian and English.</span> <span id="s523">I learned English in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">You learned English when you were in Vienna before going to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">In school, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">So you would be interpreting between the Americans and the Italians or between the Americans and German prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">No, between Americans and Italians.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">And they paid you?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">They paid me, sure.</span> <span id="s530">And then we went to Argentina, my husband and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">So you had married in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Had a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">This one.</span> <span id="s535">[Daughter was present at interview] Born as an Italian citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">No, as an Austrian citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Male, female?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Female, name Irene.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Your husband was also Austrian?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">No my husband was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Jewish, non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">He was in Italy at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">He was in Italy at the time.</span> <span id="s545">Was a prisoner and we left for Argentina in 1948 because we didn't have a visa for the states.</span> <span id="s546">There was a long waiting period.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">He was a prisoner of the Americans but he had been there a German military?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Military, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Any word from your brother, meanwhile?</span> <span id="s550">.</span> <span id="s551">Your brother was in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">My brother was in the United States and of course I didn't hear from him during the war because you could not write but as soon as the war was over, no, not as soon, because you couldn't write for quite some time.</span> <span id="s553">But one day he came to visit me.</span> <span id="s554">In '45 he came in September.</span> <span id="s555">He was then stationed in the third army in Shongau, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">He visited you in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">In Italy, in Rome.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">And you hadn't seen him since when?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Since 1937, eight years.</span> <span id="s560">A lot of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Can you recollect what he was doing between 1939 and 1945 when you finally saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Yes, he was in New York.</span> <span id="s563">He studied with Schnabel, Arthur Schnabel, the pianist.</span> <span id="s564">He gave concerts.</span> <span id="s565">He taught.</span> <span id="s566">He worked with a Russian singer, studied with her, accompanied her.</span> <span id="s567">And then he was drafted in the army.</span> <span id="s568">Well he was not drafted, he was a student here so they gave him a choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">What was the choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">The choice was to join the army or have to leave the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">And return where?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">That is the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">What kind of citizenship did he have at that point?</span> <span id="s574">.</span> <span id="s575">He obviously was not an American citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">No, he was German, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">German, so were they threatening to return him to Germany?</span> <span id="s578">.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Well, they would not return him anywhere.</span> <span id="s580">He just has to leave the country and try to find another country which would take him.</span> <span id="s581">But he has a choice to join the army which he did.</span> <span id="s582">First he was in North Carolina, I think was his boot camp and several others.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Did he serve in Europe before he saw you?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Yeah, because he came in '44 to Europe and he came to visit me in '45.</span> <span id="s585">And just a month before he died, he was killed, an accident, we don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">He was killed a month after you last saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Yes Do you recall him telling any stories, any dramatic experiences as a soldier?</span> <span id="s588">.</span> <span id="s589">Did he describe the fighting?</span> <span id="s590">Did he describe what he saw in Germany, perhaps concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Yes he told me he saw concentration camps.</span> <span id="s592">He said everyone they interviewed never heard of Nazis.</span> <span id="s593">Nobody was ever a Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">He served in the US army.</span> <span id="s595">Was he attached to a particular unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Yes, intelligence.</span> <span id="s597">And he was an interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">So in some ways you had similar jobs.</span> <span id="s599">And his experience was that no German...?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Ever was Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Did he believe?</span> <span id="s602">What were his feelings towards the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">No.</span> <span id="s604">Well was not enthusiastic about the Germans.</span> <span id="s605">He didn't feel any hatred, I think.</span> <span id="s606">That was not in his character.</span> <span id="s607">All he wanted was to go back to America, resume his career as a musician.</span> <span id="s608">He didn't think he could be a pianist anymore because three years of not practicing the piano daily makes your fingers stiff but he wanted to go into conducting because he had the qualification to be a conductor.</span> <span id="s609">But music was his life.</span> <span id="s610">He was supposed to go home on November 19, 1945.</span> <span id="s611">On the eighteenth of November he told one of his friends that he was going to see Richard Strauss in Garmisch-Partnkirchen and he left early in the morning and was never seen alive again.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Do you know what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">We only know what the army told us, that he had an accident.</span> <span id="s614">That's what they said at the time.</span> <span id="s615">But not right away.</span> <span id="s616">He was listed as missing because nobody knew where he was and it was November and it started snowing and they could not search anymore for him and after the snow melted, my sister-in-law got a letter that he was found in Mittenwald with a fractured skull.</span> <span id="s617">And that is all we know.</span> <span id="s618">And at first he was buried in Metz and then I think the French wanted this cemetery to be eliminated so my sister-in-law got a letter where she wanted him buried and she said in New York and that's where he is, in Farmingdale, the military cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Do you have any opinions as to how and why he might have died and why the military was so secretive?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">I don't know.</span> <span id="s621">I only know that my brother told me when he was in Rome that the Germans always thought when he interviewed somebody that he was also the one who passes judgment which was not the case.</span> <span id="s622">He was only the interpreter.</span> <span id="s623">And he said the Germans if you have a uniform think you're a general.</span> <span id="s624">You have so much to say, which he didn't.</span> <span id="s625">But I always thought it had something to do with the Germans, that it was not an accident.</span> <span id="s626">He was not a mountain climber.</span> <span id="s627">He liked to take a walk in the woods but not in the mountains.</span> <span id="s628">He never did that before, why should he have done it the day before he had to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">And then you eventually came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">I came to the United States much later because my mother was our sponsor, but the Austrian quota was impossible, very, very small.</span> <span id="s631">I could go on the German quota with my husband, because he was born in Germany.</span> <span id="s632">So we're in Argentina and we finally got the visa in 1950.</span> <span id="s633">We were supposed to leave on September 13.</span> <span id="s634">On September 12 came the McCarren [674] Act and we already had the luggage aboard and we were called to come to the consulate, which we did and the consulate asked to see our passport.</span> <span id="s635">We gave him the passport and he put in "canceled."</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Because my husband was born in a totalitarian country.</span> <span id="s638">And at this time there was the McCarren Act that nobody in a country which had at one time a totalitarian regime could go to the United States.</span> <span id="s639">So we had to stay in Argentina.</span> <span id="s640">I remembered that Truman vetoed this and so I went to the consulate once a week.</span> <span id="s641">The poor consulate when he saw me already, "No, no visa yet."</span> <span id="s642">And we got our visa on May of 1951 and left and we came to the United States on May 28, 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Looking back on your experiences and thinking of your career in the theater and acting.</span> <span id="s644">.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">It was not much of a career If you had to select the most dramatic moment of your life at least during the time of the war what would you.</span> <span id="s646">.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">The most dramatic I think was when we were in Rhodes and I still had my Austrian passport.</span> <span id="s648">While I was in Rhodes I met two Viennese men who told me their story that they came over the border into Italy because they had an American visa and wanted to go to the States but the Germans wouldn't give them an exit visa so they went somewhere over the border and came to Italy without the visa and registered in a hotel.</span> <span id="s649">But the clerk brought the passport to the police and they saw they had no visa and they were not allowed to traverse Italy anymore and you cannot go to America from Venice.</span> <span id="s650">So they went on the first boat to Egypt and thought they could go from there and then they told me the story that Egypt wouldn't let them go ashore and they came back to Italy and they wouldn't let them go ashore and they traveled back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">You're in Rhodes and these people are traveling back and forth without the visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">They're also in Rhodes and once the Governor of Rhodes was on the boat and he was a Jew himself and he let them stay for awhile in Rhodes.</span> <span id="s653">He gave them permission to get off the boat and they were trying to get a visa to Egypt which they finally got.</span> <span id="s654">They told me the story and when we came back to Italy in Bari [710] and we wanted to go ashore because (actually we traveled to Venice but we stood a day in Bari and I was with this English ballet and all the girls got their passport back except me so I said, "Where's my passport?"</span> <span id="s655">So I went in and this Italian said I'm sorry you cannot get to shore because you are Jewish and Jews cannot enter Italy anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">This is an Italian official.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">An Italian official.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">In which year.</span> <span id="s659">Do you remember the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">'39.</span> <span id="s661">No excuse me, '38.</span> <span id="s662">After the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s663">I still had the Austrian passport hadn't expired.</span> <span id="s664">I said I'm not Jewish and my passport is still okay till the end of the year.</span> <span id="s665">And he said but if you were not Jewish you would have already changed it like all the others did.</span> <span id="s666">And so I remember that I voted and this was stamped into the passport.</span> <span id="s667">And first I did not remember it.</span> <span id="s668">I was so nervous I saw myself going back and forth on this boat like the people told me.</span> <span id="s669">Oh, G-d, what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s670">And then I remembered.</span> <span id="s671">I voted and I have that in the passport.</span> <span id="s672">And as soon as he saw that he said oh I'm sorry and he gave me the visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">So I remembered the man at the consulate.</span> <span id="s674">He was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">So your decision to vote for the Nazis saved you.</span> <span id="s676">This would have been after Mussolini enacted the anti-Jewish laws.</span> <span id="s677">This was why they gave you a hard time.</span> <span id="s678">But these are the Italians that are giving you trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Yes, well I'm Italian.</span> <span id="s680">But it didn't last very long.</span> <span id="s681">As soon as they saw this stamp, I could go in and in Rome they never gave me trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">And then you got the German passport without a J.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">I got it without a J.</span> <span id="s684">That I think was my most dramatic moment because I really saw myself on the boat going back and forth to Rhodes.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">And no amount of acting could have saved you, just quick thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Yes If your brother were here and had to answer the same question what do you think his answer would be based on his experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">I don't know.</span> <span id="s688">He had a lot of dramatic experiences in Germany when he was a soldier because he told me that one day there was a terrible bombardment.</span> <span id="s689">He said I was hungry, I was going into the kitchen and everybody said don't be crazy.</span> <span id="s690">You're not going out when the bombs are firing and he said, "Yes, I'm going out."</span> <span id="s691">And he went out of the barracks where they were staying and into the next one where the kitchen is and the barracks where they were staying was bombed and he was the only survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">By American aircraft.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">No, by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Germany still had an air force.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Yes they still had an air force.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">How about before he left Vienna.</span> <span id="s697">You say that he left after the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s698">Do you remember him having any bad experiences with the Nazis in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Yes.</span> <span id="s700">In the conservatory he was then nineteen years old so he was thirteen years a student in the conservatory.</span> <span id="s701">This professor Nielius [759] who was a teacher for the conducting classes.</span> <span id="s702">And he was always a star pupil and he always talked about him.</span> <span id="s703">As soon as the Nazis came in he wouldn't let him into the building anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">So he was expelled from the Vienna conservatory?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">No more concerts.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">No more.</span> <span id="s708">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Did he have his own piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">So when your family left Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">They left everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">You owned your own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">No, they rented.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">And when you went to Italy in 1937 did you have any idea that you would never return?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">No, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Did you have anything from your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">No, nothing.</span> <span id="s719">Just my clothes, some clothes, not even everything.</span> <span id="s720">But I sometimes had the feeling that I would never come back because I was convinced that Hitler would come to Austria and many people did not believe me.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">What made you think that?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Just a wild hunch.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">I don't think it was such a wild hunch.</span> <span id="s725">I think it was in the stars that he would come but people didn't want to believe it.</span> <span id="s726">The Austrian Jews did not want to believe that it couldn't happen in Vienna.</span> <span id="s727">I don't know why they don't believe it.</span> <span id="s728">There was a lot of anti-semitism there and Austria was very poor at the time.</span> <span id="s729">They had a lot of unemployed people.</span> <span id="s730">Austria was very poor and they thought that an Anschluss to Germany would - because everybody heard that since Hitler is the Germans have more work and everything is going better -- So there was economic hope in Germany.</span> <span id="s731">Was he popular?</span> <span id="s732">Did people admire Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">None of my friends admired him but certainly a lot of people did.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">And you recall the reasons that why they admired him.</span> <span id="s735">What was there about him that they liked?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">They thought that when Hitler will come they will all work, everything will be better.</span> <span id="s737">This did not last very long because I don't think he treated the Austrians too well.</span> <span id="s738">He was an Austrian, but he didn't like Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Now you, being in Italy must have been interesting vantage port in that Italy had been the ally of Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Yes, for a long time Dolffus' widow as a matter of fact was in Italy at the time and Schuschnigg was in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">You remember what the Italian reaction was to the Anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">The Italians didn't like it at all.</span> <span id="s743">They had very little choice because Hitler's army was on the Brenner pass already at that time.</span> <span id="s744">As a matter of fact Hitler came to Italy, I think, in '38 right after the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s745">I remember because I was living in a hotel with another Viennese who was also Jewish and we were called to the police and held there the whole day.</span> <span id="s746">They were very friendly to us but they were afraid that people would do something to Hitler.</span> <span id="s747">But I remember that Mussolini did not come to greet him.</span> <span id="s748">Just the king greeted him and Mussolini never came because he didn't care too much for Hitler but he had very little choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">On the other hand the king cared even less.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">The king cared even less but the king was not a very strong personality, it seemed.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Do you have any other recollections that you would like to tell us.</span> <span id="s752">Anything that we've forgotten?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Right offhand I don't remember anything.</span> <span id="s754">Maybe later on I will think of something then I will let you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Well, thank you.</span></p></body></html>
