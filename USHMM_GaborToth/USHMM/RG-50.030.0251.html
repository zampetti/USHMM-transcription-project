id="s10">Q: Would you tell me your name please and when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My full name today is Gerta Wilchfort.</span> <span id="s12">I was born on the 24th of April in 1923 in Breslau.</span> <span id="s13">Breslau is in today and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: What is your maiden name?</span> <span id="s15">What was your family name?</span> <span id="s16">A: Blachman.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Blachman, OK.</span> <span id="s18">Tell me, you were in Breslau when you were born.</span> <span id="s19">Tell me what it was like.</span> <span id="s20">Did you grow up in Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Tell me about growing up in Breslau.</span> <span id="s23">What was it like?</span> <span id="s24">What did your parents do?</span> <span id="s25">What was it like to be a child in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Well, I was an only child.</span> <span id="s27">Had no brothers and sisters and I had my grandparents there.</span> <span id="s28">I had my mother's both parents and my father's mother.</span> <span id="s29">And we had friends.</span> <span id="s30">I went to school.</span> <span id="s31">Went to, to four years of uh public school and then uh to up to four years you have to made a, a decision what kind of schooling you want.</span> <span id="s32">You have to, you can go either go on to the unit to the public school or you can go to the gymnasium (ph) and there were also two choices.</span> <span id="s33">You can go to a humanistic gymnasium where they learn Latin and Greek and little mathematics and little science or you could go to the other school where I went.</span> <span id="s34">We had, we started right away with French and the sciences.</span> <span id="s35">No Latin or Greek but French, modern languages, French and later English.</span> <span id="s36">But you had to go to school very little was exams, even then at ten years of age we had a whole day of exam to be able to get into this gymnasium.</span> <span id="s37">So I passed that exam and I went to the Catholic school.</span> <span id="s38">That was already uh shortly before Hitler came to power so I went to the Catholic school for girls only.</span> <span id="s39">And uh, I think right after, I don't know, must have been right afterwards that Hitler came to power and the anti-Semitism started right away and then I had trouble with some children.</span> <span id="s40">Some children stayed with me and became very close friends and said don't worry.</span> <span id="s41">But others started right away, I don't want to sit next to the Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s42">I don't want to the Jews smell and I don't want to sit with her and they had uh religious instructions.</span> <span id="s43">You know in the Catholic school especially they had a lot of religion and of course we didn't go.</span> <span id="s44">We had still a religious, a Jewish uh teacher come to the school and we had extra, different uh religious instruction.</span> <span id="s45">So that set us apart uh right away and uh, but in the beginning it wasn't too bad you know.</span> <span id="s46">In in 1933, '34 it wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s47">As a matter of fact I was a pretty good athlete in sports, you know, sports and Hitler put a lot of emphasis on sports so, I think in 1935 or so they uh had like little Olympics for young people and all over Germany they had to come and do a certain program and if you passed that program you got a certificate.</span> <span id="s48">So that swimming in clothes and a uh certain distance and we had to jump from a ten meter board and had to run and all these things.</span> <span id="s49">And when you passed it I got a little, I got a certificate signed by Hitler that I passed that thing, so it wasn't you know, and the Catholic school, the the uh principal was a lady and she was very much for us and helped us overcome these things.</span> <span id="s50">But after a couple of years or so she called me into the office or called my parents and said they are no longer able to keep us in the Catholic school.</span> <span id="s51">I either have to leave the school altogether or go to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s52">So luckily we had in Breslau a very good Jewish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s53">We had actually two Jewish schools and this gymnasium was accredited like any other school like here the Jewish Hebrew Academy that is accredited now.</span> <span id="s54">And I I knew a little bit of Hebrew but I was always very ambitious so I, I had, I took tutoring to get better in Hebrew so I could be up to par with the other kids who had started there.</span> <span id="s55">We had a lot of Hebrew, a lot of but all the other subjects I started where my English we had a very good English teacher and he was a stickler for uh grammatic and we learned very well the irregular verbs and all those things so we had a very good schooling there.</span> <span id="s56">That was only two years I think you know but it was very intensive and very good.</span> <span id="s57">And uh I was a member of the Zionist youth movement there which, I don't know and uh we had meetings and we had outings but I was the private, I was the single daughter so my father was always protective and I couldn't go very much to outings and to things but I went to meetings and uh we talked about youth going to Israel and to , to you know these little cans where we were prepared to live in kibbutz in Israel but uh they wouldn't give me the permit and the permit and so finally I, one day I said I have to go Berlin to the headquarters of the Zionist movement and see what's the trouble.</span> <span id="s58">So I went there all by myself.</span> <span id="s59">We had family in, in Berlin that I stayed with, and here they told me they can't give me the certificate, can't give me the permission to go because of my eyes.</span> <span id="s60">The eyes have to I am very nearsighted and uh they are afraid that if I do agricultural work, if I stoop very much that I'm going to have, my retina is going to uh depart, separate from the eye and they wouldn't give me, they have to have consultations and so forth.</span> <span id="s61">So I couldn't, I couldn't go.</span> <span id="s62">So when I had to leave the school and my parents knew that we're going to have to leave Germany you know pretty soon, in Germany was the custom that almost every, every middle-class family had a maid.</span> <span id="s63">So the kids would grow up, we didn't do very much.</span> <span id="s64">We didn't know very much of household work and cooking and things like that, so my mother said you have to learn because we're certainly not going to have a maid any longer.</span> <span id="s65">So they sent me to Hausen (ph).</span> <span id="s66">That was a Jewish household school near Munich and uh, I went there from in April, the German school year goes from April to April, not from September like here.</span> <span id="s67">I went in April and I came back for some vacation in the summer . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: What year is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: This was in 1938, I guess.</span> <span id="s70">Yeah, '38.</span> <span id="s71">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s72">You are how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Fif... I was born in '23 so fifteen, fifteen, sixteen.</span> <span id="s74">And us that was clear across Germany near Munich.</span> <span id="s75">From Breslau to Munich was quite a ... and uh I went back in September and in early November uh they had this uh in Paris on this on this ambassador so you know what happened there.</span> <span id="s76">On the ninth of November we were sitting near the radio and we were listening and we knew something terrible is going to happen but we didn't know what.</span> <span id="s77">And we were there, all young kids, young girls and uh so sure enough on the tenth of November that year the police came and the SS came to wake us up at six o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s78">Out, out, out of bed.</span> <span id="s79">You couldn't take anything only the clothes you know, we were there for a year.</span> <span id="s80">We had all our belongings there clothes and books and everything.</span> <span id="s81">They said no, no, nothing.</span> <span id="s82">Get out, out of the thing.</span> <span id="s83">So here we stood outside and uh the uh direct... director and the teachers wanted us to go home but there was no money, so they took us back to Munich and we stayed at the uh at the uh, uh station till they got the money together.</span> <span id="s84">We were maybe fifty, sixty girls from that school to send and get the railroad tickets to send everybody home.</span> <span id="s85">So by the time I got on the train was already afternoon and I was the only one from Breslau at this time so I was all alone on that train and really heard, heard only fragments of what happened.</span> <span id="s86">So I had to stay over and change trains on a little town so I got there about ten at night and I was afraid to stay alone on the in the station so I went to the nearest hotel and got myself a room and told them at five o'clock they should wake me up and bring me here back and went back to the station and back on that train.</span> <span id="s87">And here comes a whole bunch of SS people and sit in the same compartment with me.</span> <span id="s88">And start talking and telling the stories about the Kristallnacht how they were, uh how they smashed all the windows and how the synagogues were burning and how many people they arrested and beat up and so uh I got more and more scared.</span> <span id="s89">What will I find at home?</span> <span id="s90">Will I find my parents?</span> <span id="s91">Will I find, how will I ... so I got to this, to Breslau about two in the afternoon and uh uh the station was right in the middle of town so I took the trolley car and I saw already all the Jewish stores, all the stores the glass was on the and here we passed by the synagogue.</span> <span id="s92">The synagogue was still not burning but smoldering and I saw what happened.</span> <span id="s93">And I came home.</span> <span id="s94">Nobody was home.</span> <span id="s95">So, but after a while my mother came and told me that they were arresting all the men so my father had been hiding at his mother's house because there was no men in that house and my grandfather too was not arrested, but uh most Jewish men were arrested that night and many in smaller towns were beat up but I, I stayed home then for the winter and we knew then and there that the time has come to leave.</span> <span id="s96">Before that time, if I may go back, I was fifteen like I say, fourteen, fifteen, and I wasn't so emerged in in daily living or making a living and I always knew that we're going to have a terrible end in Germany.</span> <span id="s97">I couldn't figure out, you know, that they're going to burn us and kill us but I always had the feeling that they had in mind to to to have us die somehow.</span> <span id="s98">I always thought they're not going to give us any food coupons anymore and they're going to starve us to death and I begged my parents, let's get out, let's get out, and my father had a very good boss and he unfortunately loved him and said as long as you're with us we're going to keep you and you're going to make a living and he he put in a non Jew into the office and did all kinds of things to keep him there and uh that of course was wrong.</span> <span id="s99">So by the time they realized that time was up for us it was already pretty late and no other country took in Jews.</span> <span id="s100">The only possibility at this time was to go to Shanghai and uh my parents didn't want to go to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s101">So they managed, we had a cousin in Cuba and after many weeks of communications, we, she sent us a so called visa to go to Cuba and my parents purchased us seat (ph) uh the the cabin space on the Havana (ph) American line, on the St. Louis, and we were supposed to leave on I think was the 13th of May.</span> <span id="s102">Now to be on the personal side, on the 24th of April I had my sixteenth birthday.</span> <span id="s103">And my parents thought well you know, I had such terrible youth, at least she wants to make me a little party and I had a friend and he said uh can I bring another friend of mine.</span> <span id="s104">And my mother said yes, and I had some very good girl friends that uh my parents are friends with their parents from way back from World War I already, and so we had a little party, and he brought this boy.</span> <span id="s105">And he had come from so and that's how I met him.</span> <span id="s106">That was my future husband.</span> <span id="s107">(PAUSE) So a couple of days later these friends, these, they were two sisters and their parents left for Shanghai.</span> <span id="s108">And uh this young man Marcos (ph) said we'll go together to the station to say goodbye to them, and I met him again and he gave me, had given me a book so I went up and I met his mother.</span> <span id="s109">I went up to his apartment and I went and met his mother for the only time.</span> <span id="s110">And he told me that uh he wants to leave but his parents are quite old already and his father got quite beaten in this smaller town in during the Kristallnacht and he won't be able to go anywhere.</span> <span id="s111">So his mother wrote, he was also an only child, his mother will bring him to to the Belgian border and he will try to go illegally over the border to Belgium.</span> <span id="s112">He has a, he had a girlfriend that he met the year before in in some camp and uh her parents have written that they will be willing to take him as a border and he should come to Brussels.</span> <span id="s113">They are in Brussels already and he is going to try to go there illegally.</span> <span id="s114">So we said goodbye.</span> <span id="s115">I was going to Cuba and he was going to Brussels, and we were never going to see each other again.</span> <span id="s116">So we went uh ... a week later or so we said goodbye to my grandparents and uh I must say that to this day that affects me terribly to think back at how we said goodbye to those old people.</span> <span id="s117">You know, today I'm as old at this time, they were really old when you were sixty five or sixty you know, and my grandmother was a tiny little woman and she was not well and they just couldn't ... my parents thought we can send for them later on.</span> <span id="s118">Otherwise they probably wouldn't have left them.</span> <span id="s119">But there was no way at that time to take them along so we had to say goodbye to them and that was a terrible terrible moment.</span> <span id="s120">And my other grandmother also.</span> <span id="s121">So uh we went to the, to Hamburg . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Just before you get to . . . slow down a little.</span> <span id="s123">We have time.</span> <span id="s124">Tell us about your your grandparents.</span> <span id="s125">Uh they stayed behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yes, they stayed behind and... Q: What happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Well, they were eventually sent to Theresienstadt, this couple, my mother's parents.</span> <span id="s128">They were sent to Theresienstadt, but my other grandmother was alone.</span> <span id="s129">She was a widow and when she got the order to come to present herself you know to be sent away, she said no, I don't want to do that.</span> <span id="s130">I'd rather die peacefully in my kitchen rather than go to this camp and be killed there.</span> <span id="s131">But my other grandparents couldn't do that because they, first of all they were quite religious and they wouldn't commit suicide and uh they lived for each other.</span> <span id="s132">They thought they're going to help each other and maybe but and but they both died.</span> <span id="s133">I never heard from them.</span> <span id="s134">They never came out after the war.</span> <span id="s135">But my Grandmother Blachman, my , she was quite a lady and she always had her hair done so she had her hair done and she put on a wonderful, her best dress and she sat in a kitchen chair and opened the gas and went that way.</span> <span id="s136">People told us that after the war and we only heard about that later.</span> <span id="s137">But that was maybe two years later.</span> <span id="s138">And my husband's parents, I still have letters from them.</span> <span id="s139">They were sent to uh forced labor in Breslau at first after we left and uh it got harder and harder and they had to leave uh live in smaller and smaller apartments and rooms and they finally were sent to Theresienstadt also and never came back.</span> <span id="s140">So where was I?</span> <span id="s141">Oh, we were going to Hamburg and uh we, we got on this boat and you know, it's one laughing and one crying out because we knew we never going to come back and we never, we didn't know what the future will bring us but on the other hand we were happy that we left as a family and healthy.</span> <span id="s142">My parents were so young in 1939.</span> <span id="s143">My mother was 38 years old and my father was in his early forties so there was still the future we thought.</span> <span id="s144">And uh on the passage, going there was fine.</span> <span id="s145">I had a good time.</span> <span id="s146">I was sixteen and I had young men friendly and older uh, young men who taught me how to dance which I never did because in the Zionist Youth Movement you don't dance.</span> <span id="s147">You don't put on lipstick and you don't do anything but think of working and you know what.</span> <span id="s148">I changed and I had a good time.</span> <span id="s149">I played ping pong and I but uh everything of course was very innocent then.</span> <span id="s150">It's not like today that he was already twenty years old and I was sixteen but he was a gentlemen and . . . So we came to Havana ...</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Tell us before we get to Havana, tell us when you first began to suspect that it might not be a pleasure cruise?</span> <span id="s152">Did that . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Well, I personally didn't think of that.</span> <span id="s154">(OK) Uh we knew that uh the shipping line had uh asked for return tickets and uh it should have told us something but maybe my parents knew.</span> <span id="s155">I never thought about that.</span> <span id="s156">As a matter of fact when we uh came into Havana there was a big rush at the uh telegraph office on the boat that uh everybody was you know, the ship money, it was German money that would have been useless afterwards.</span> <span id="s157">They wanted to send telegrams send telegrams back home we arrived.</span> <span id="s158">But my mother also sent a telegram to her parents arrived safely in Havana.</span> <span id="s159">You know, and they didn't know much about this either.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: So you have come to Havana.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yeah, we come to Havana.</span> <span id="s162">But we didn't really dock.</span> <span id="s163">We were out un in the not too far but far enough so we couldn't even see much of Havana.</span> <span id="s164">We just saw the silhouette of the buildings and of the harbor and the .</span> <span id="s165">And they told us to come to the dining room with the passports and the uh the visas and uh to be admitted.</span> <span id="s166">And we went to the dining room and they were all sitting there, the officials.</span> <span id="s167">The Cuban officials had come aboard and uh they said, well, there are some difficulties or something.</span> <span id="s168">We should wait until tomorrow.</span> <span id="s169">So we stayed another night.</span> <span id="s170">It was very hot and very sticky and I think we slept that night up on the on deck because it was already unbearably hot and you know, coming from Europe and we are not used to this climate and uh next day, the next day there were all kinds of little boats came from Havana with family.</span> <span id="s171">There were lots of families that were uh split up.</span> <span id="s172">There were some men that had come out of some German concentration camps that had gone out first and the women and the children had come later when there weren't any places on boats or they had small business to attend to or some reason lots of families were split up.</span> <span id="s173">This one family, Matulski (ph), and that uh we befriended on the boat this lady was alone on this boat with three children and her husband was in Cuba already.</span> <span id="s174">And the cousin that sent us the uh our visa was of course in Cuba and she came and so a lot of people, relatives and friends came and hired little boats and there's a picture of that in that in the book if you want . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Well, let's see your pictures.</span> <span id="s176">Let's see yours.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: My pictures.</span> <span id="s178">OK.</span> <span id="s179">This is a picture of me with uh with this friend that I was talking about.</span> <span id="s180">(OK) And this is a picture on the way to Havana where there was a party on boat uh on board.</span> <span id="s181">We had parties at night and this was . . . I think these, this picture is of my parents from Breslau yet, from, from before we left.</span> <span id="s182">My father was a very good looking man.</span> <span id="s183">(Yes indeed) Yes.</span> <span id="s184">So I think it was interesting to see this, this picture of this of these little boats that this was the St. Louis its... itself the dining room was a beautiful dining room and came down the spiral staircase.</span> <span id="s185">I felt very glamorous.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: We can get, we'll get other pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Oh here's the little picture.</span> <span id="s188">Here's the picture where the where the relatives came.</span> <span id="s189">You see it?</span> <span id="s190">And they sent up pineapples and they sent up all kinds of things and there was yelling up and down the you know and we were standing very close on the on the railing and it was you know hard to find the people that there was almost a thousand people on the boat, on the ship.</span> <span id="s191">So anyhow it became clearer and clearer that we're not going to land.</span> <span id="s192">I mean you don't want to hear this. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yes, do.</span> <span id="s194">Talk about that.</span> <span id="s195">Yes I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: I mean the, the background of it was . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: No, the background we don't need but your how did it become clear to you that you weren't going to land?</span> <span id="s198">How did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Because of the time element.</span> <span id="s200">You know, we were in Cuba almost a week.</span> <span id="s201">We were sitting there in the harbor and we just gave up hope you know that the negotiations will come to an end and uh . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Did Captain Shroeder (ph) come and talk to you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: No, there was a Committee.</span> <span id="s204">There were lots of uh prominent people on board, you know Jewish lawyers and uh teachers and people like that.</span> <span id="s205">They formed a Committee and they were the in, the in between the people, the passengers and the uh captain and they sent telegrams to Roosevelt and to all over the world and they tried to get you know to get us going but didn't.</span> <span id="s206">So I think also the people that came in these little boats uh let us know that it looked pretty bad in Havana itself.</span> <span id="s207">And there was some few people, I think twelve people, that had, that were not refugees so to speak, that had regular visas and uh they got off the boat so we knew you know more or less we knew at the end that we're not going to stay.</span> <span id="s208">So one good day we just pulled out you know the anc... pulled up the anchor and we left and this is the picture here of this cousin she's standing there.</span> <span id="s209">Havana, June '39.</span> <span id="s210">She standing at the and crying and in the back you see the St. Louis pulling out.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Describe for me the scene on board as you pulled up anchor.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Well, if you can imagine there was a terrible mood.</span> <span id="s213">Everybody was very depressed.</span> <span id="s214">Few people committed, tried to commit suicide as I think uh the one man he, I think he cut his wrists and they, he was the only one landed because they had to take him to the hospital to to tend to him.</span> <span id="s215">I don't know whether he stayed or not.</span> <span id="s216">I think he did.</span> <span id="s217">He must have been the only one who stayed.</span> <span id="s218">But you know, humans are always hopeful.</span> <span id="s219">You know, we always cling to the hope something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s220">They're not going to let us rot on the ocean.</span> <span id="s221">I mean, something had to happen to us.</span> <span id="s222">Of course, the fear was that we would go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s223">That was the big thing you know.</span> <span id="s224">So we the food got worse and worse and the what ever water supply, I mean we had water but we had to be careful and of course the parties were over.</span> <span id="s225">No more parties, no more no more fun.</span> <span id="s226">We were just sitting and waiting what's going to happen you know and uh here again the Committee tried everything and sent telegrams all over the world trying to get us in but was everyday they had like newsletters printed and put out on board to tell us what's happening and everyday there was another country we were supposed to be going to go, but we never and nothing came about until finally at the we were already well, first we came to the coast of Miami and we thought we could you know I heard later that the captain had agreed that we make some kind of a forced landing or something but we didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s227">We just saw the uh Coast Guard boats surround us near Miami to make sure that we wouldn't even come close to the boarder, to shore, so that was out.</span> <span id="s228">So we saw the lights of Miami.</span> <span id="s229">We saw the lights of America and that was it.</span> <span id="s230">So we slowly sailed back to Europe and of course behind the you know there were a lot of negotiations going on with United, the United Jewish Appeal and there was a Mr. Tupper in Paris and he finally got it together that we will be divided between Belgium and Holland and France and England.</span> <span id="s231">And uh I don't remember very well I was up on deck not near my parents.</span> <span id="s232">You know when you're sixteen you don't cling to your parents and so uh when the loudspeaker came on and they announced that the first uh contingent of people will debark in Antwerp uh you know we were out already in the water before Antwerp.</span> <span id="s233">And they announced the names you know that was also the work of the Committee they made the list, the passenger list and they divided the passengers to wherever they wanted.</span> <span id="s234">Of course England was already then the preferred country because we knew it was away from Europe you know a little bit and that we had a feeling that would have been the safest, but not everybody could go to England.</span> <span id="s235">But my friend, this friend went to England and I never heard from him again.</span> <span id="s236">I don't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s237">But we went uh to Belgium.</span> <span id="s238">Maybe my mother told them that she had a brother there.</span> <span id="s239">I don't know how we came to Belgium, but I ran back to the cabin and my parents were already packing again and uh we debarked in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s240">We got off, one of the first ones and then the Paris Match came, the uh newspaper people came and took pictures.</span> <span id="s241">Do you want me to show you?</span> <span id="s242">(Sure) And uh we were all standing up on, on deck and waiting a man saved his dog, he had to have his dog, and my parents happened to be here they're here.</span> <span id="s243">This is my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s244">They were standing there, but I was not there.</span> <span id="s245">I had been running around.</span> <span id="s246">So this was in the Paris Match, and uh you know, was a big story, newspaper story at the time in Europe that this first boat and the people coming.</span> <span id="s247">So they put us on a train right away to Brussels and we stayed a couple of nights in a hotel and we were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: You had papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Well, they made us sign papers that we were not to work and that we were accepted as refugees but that as soon as the situation will allow us to leave the country, we will leave, we will leave.</span> <span id="s250">And we signed to that my parents, we signed to that.</span> <span id="s251">And forgot all about it but when the war was over, you know, we had to uh report every six months to the police and they presented us with this signature and with this promise.</span> <span id="s252">They hadn't forgotten it.</span> <span id="s253">It was just filed away through the war and uh that was one reason why we left again.</span> <span id="s254">They didn't pressure us actually but every six months we were presented with this again.</span> <span id="s255">(Oh, I see.)</span> <span id="s256">After the war.</span> <span id="s257">(After the war.)</span> <span id="s258">Yes.</span> <span id="s259">But we had signed that, we signed anything we didn't even read we were so glad that we were on uh soil and that we were not in Germany and that somebody was going to take care of us more or less.</span> <span id="s260">So here we were in Brussels and after, to go back to my private story again, I we walked down the boulevard and I stayed and I looked in the windows and I come and there's the young man and he didn't say anything and I didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s261">And I came home to mother and I said, you know, I think I saw Marcos, this young man that came to my birthday party.</span> <span id="s262">And he went home and there was somebody sitting there and he said if I didn't know that Gerta went to Cuba I would think I saw her today.</span> <span id="s263">And this man says, to Cuba?</span> <span id="s264">What boat was she on?</span> <span id="s265">And he said, I think it was the St. Louis.</span> <span id="s266">So he said yes, you saw her today.</span> <span id="s267">I was, I just come off the St. Louis and there was a Gerta Blachman and that was your friend girl, so we met again, and but he had this other girlfriend and but we were good friends and we saw each other off and on.</span> <span id="s268">And it was really a big coincidence that we got together again.</span> <span id="s269">So we stayed in Brussels and then uh by the time, by this time it was June . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Well, we had a very limited budget from the United Jewish Appeal to say the least.</span> <span id="s272">And my parents, all we could afford they brought us, this lady brought us to find so called apartments.</span> <span id="s273">Well, we were, we had then one big room and a kitchen and the bathroom on the floor that was used by the people on this floor and the people on the other floor and it was not a bathroom either.</span> <span id="s274">It was just a toilet and a sink.</span> <span id="s275">And we had to have the water from there.</span> <span id="s276">There was no running water in this so-called apartment.</span> <span id="s277">So my parents let in this one woman on this couch that had to be made up every night and I slept on a cot, the cot in the kitchen, so my mother was very anxious for me to get out of this environment and even though we were not supposed to work, she found me a little job as a children's maid in a very nice high rise apartment where I had my own room and had normal conditions.</span> <span id="s278">And I had charge of a little boy that was four years old, three or four years old.</span> <span id="s279">And it was away from them but you know, it was better for me.</span> <span id="s280">And uh so by uh I was there the whole winter, the whole winter until the 10th of May.</span> <span id="s281">I woke up and I heard the noises and there were bombs coming.</span> <span id="s282">And I was way up in the you know, in the little room on the top of the tilted roof so I was pretty high up and I heard the I heard the bombs.</span> <span id="s283">I went back to my, to the people in this apartment and I said what's happening, what's happening.</span> <span id="s284">The Germans attacked Belgium.</span> <span id="s285">So the husband was also German-born.</span> <span id="s286">They were Jewish.</span> <span id="s287">She came from Luxembourg but he was also German- born.</span> <span id="s288">But they, you know we were just there a few months and we lived there.</span> <span id="s289">We didn't know much what was going on but he knew somebody told him maybe from the police or something that they're going to arrest all the German men.</span> <span id="s290">The German Jews or non-Jews but because of the first column of spies.</span> <span id="s291">They were afraid of spies so they had orders to arrest all German men and he went to bed.</span> <span id="s292">He said he's sick.</span> <span id="s293">And he said go and call your parents and tell your father to do the same.</span> <span id="s294">And I don't remember anymore that they didn't have a phone I just see myself running through the streets to a for a drugstore for a telephone which was quite far and calling my parents and telling them the same, to do the same.</span> <span id="s295">And they wouldn't believe me.</span> <span id="s296">They said ah stories are . . . you know.</span> <span id="s297">We weren't use to doing things like that.</span> <span id="s298">Everything had to be on the up and up.</span> <span id="s299">So he didn't do it and two days later they made arrangements.</span> <span id="s300">They got into a taxi and they sent me home andâ€¦</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Who got...who they?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: This this couple with the little boy.</span> <span id="s303">(OK) You know she came from Luxembourg and they went to Luxembourg, or they went away.</span> <span id="s304">I mean they saved themselves.</span> <span id="s305">I saw them again after the war.</span> <span id="s306">They passed, they spent the war in ville.</span> <span id="s307">I don't know exactly how they got there but they left everything standing there and they got into a car.</span> <span id="s308">I think they had their own car.</span> <span id="s309">And they said we can't take you.</span> <span id="s310">You go home to your parents.</span> <span id="s311">So I see, I remembered going home I think even by taxi because I think by that time the trolley cars weren't even running anymore.</span> <span id="s312">And I come home and my mother is there and they had already taken my father.</span> <span id="s313">So I never saw my father anymore.</span> <span id="s314">They had taken him in the uh to the to you know, where the soldiers live.</span> <span id="s315">(A garrison?)</span> <span id="s316">A garrison, yes, and they had all these people, all these men assembled there and my friend Marcos had been just sixteen so sixteen was the cutoff age and he was on the street just walking.</span> <span id="s317">He didn't have a toothbrush.</span> <span id="s318">He didn't have a shirt.</span> <span id="s319">He didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s320">They took him off the street.</span> <span id="s321">My father they let pack at least a little, you know.</span> <span id="s322">They took him off the street and he was with my father and all the other Germans in the garrison.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">And uh . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: How did you and your mother handle that?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Well, we tried, you know we packed up things and we packed up things and we took it there.</span> <span id="s326">We couldn't get in and then they said, the next day they said they going to be transported to south of France and the train leaves on so and so, so we went early in the morning and we saw them marching through the streets.</span> <span id="s327">We saw them going to the train.</span> <span id="s328">And that was it.</span> <span id="s329">So I really wanted they said they're going to take them to south of France away from the war.</span> <span id="s330">Well the war accelerated but communication was so bad we didn't know in Brussels that they had attacked line and they to take France.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">We just thought they just had taked Belgium.</span> <span id="s332">You know, there was no television.</span> <span id="s333">There was hardly any newspaper at that time and our French wasn't that great.</span> <span id="s334">We didn't read the newspaper every day.</span> <span id="s335">And we didn't know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: You didn't have a radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yeah, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s338">I, maybe they didn't uh communicate that I'm pretty sure we didn't know.</span> <span id="s339">So I persuaded my mother we'll go with you know.</span> <span id="s340">Go away.</span> <span id="s341">We'll go, try to go to France or try to find my father.</span> <span id="s342">So we took the train from Brussels to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s343">This is usually; it takes today a half hour.</span> <span id="s344">At that time it took maybe three quarters of an hour.</span> <span id="s345">There were already really good trains.</span> <span id="s346">It took all day and we got to Antwerp it was dark and it was full of glass from the bombs.</span> <span id="s347">It was worse there than in Brussels.</span> <span id="s348">And uh, but there were we weren't the only ones.</span> <span id="s349">There were thousands of refugees you know so they herded us to a convent into the basement and we spent the night there.</span> <span id="s350">They gave us shelter and uh they gave us breakfast.</span> <span id="s351">And it was a terrible night that we'll never forget.</span> <span id="s352">You know, the bombs were flying and uh we were there down in the cellar and uh with hundreds of other people.</span> <span id="s353">So in the morning we got up on the street and here again everything was covered with glass and the only way to go to the French border was the tramway, the tramway that went all the way the co..</span> <span id="s354">.</span> <span id="s355">all along the coast from Antwerp I don't remember any more the last station in Belgium, uh, all little resort places that all along the coast and that tramway used to you know connect these little places.</span> <span id="s356">So we went to the end of the line till we found a young boy there that had lost his from this Mrs. Matulski (ph) that was with us from the boat and one of the three children she had gone the same route without us knowing it and she was there in the morning waiting for the tramway and she was a very nervous person, boom boom, she was on the tram with the girl and the boy was a little slower and he was standing there, and so we took him along and we eventually found the mother and the other girl and so we stayed together on this trip, on this what we called the and again something personal.</span> <span id="s357">When we got out of this tramway even though I was on the St. Louis and we were four weeks on this, on the water, I had never been on the uh on the shore of the of the ocean.</span> <span id="s358">You know, never seen the beach like that on the ocean and it was in evening and I really remember that that was such an incredible sight, and you know, the peacefulness and in the midst of all this uh turmoil and war and running and then there was the ocean, untouched and beach and the sunset and this is something I have never forgotten in all these years.</span> <span id="s359">So we tried.</span> <span id="s360">We found a place to stay.</span> <span id="s361">I was almost a woman.</span> <span id="s362">I was you know and the two ladies and the two children and uh they said the French border is closed.</span> <span id="s363">No body can go across the border.</span> <span id="s364">But we couldn't go back either.</span> <span id="s365">We couldn't go back and we couldn't go forward, so we stayed in this little hotel room and waited.</span> <span id="s366">Then one day they said, tomorrow they're going to open the border.</span> <span id="s367">You can go.</span> <span id="s368">So from there to the border was still a ways to walk, but we walked.</span> <span id="s369">That was the only, the only way to go.</span> <span id="s370">There was no transportation and there were no buses or anything so if you can picture this, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of people walking to the border and they thought across the border will be safe.</span> <span id="s371">It's France.</span> <span id="s372">So here comes the famous story of my mother's silver fox.</span> <span id="s373">We come to the, to the border and you know, we didn't have much luggage.</span> <span id="s374">We didn't have anything, you know, but she wanted the silver fox and she had it like just a stole like so when we came to the border and we showed our German papers, he said, oh no, you can't go through here with German papers.</span> <span id="s375">You go back.</span> <span id="s376">You can't, we won't let you in.</span> <span id="s377">So as the and then the people were pushing from the back and there was a young boy with a bicycle and somehow that wonderful silver fox got tangled up in the uh in the wheels of that bicycle and my mother ran after him.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">, .</span> <span id="s379">, and you know things have sometimes very funny undertones you know.</span> <span id="s380">So saved us.</span> <span id="s381">The silver fox, and we were all holding hands, and all five of us ran through with the silver fox.</span> <span id="s382">Well it wasn't such a wonderful thing you know.</span> <span id="s383">It wasn't any different over there than in Belgium.</span> <span id="s384">It was exactly the same.</span> <span id="s385">There were thousands of people and this bicycle with with uh wheelbarrows pushing their little belongings, with baby carriages, with any way they could you know, go along and bring things.</span> <span id="s386">And so we stayed one night in a school house and they had a great big pot in the school yard and they made one big pot of soup and everybody had a spoon went in there and ate and uh was pretty tough you know.</span> <span id="s387">And we knew that the Germans are behind us and how can you run away from the German army.</span> <span id="s388">I mean the German army was uh on tanks, on trucks and we were on foot.</span> <span id="s389">How can, you know, but we walked.</span> <span id="s390">We walked and then one day we walked around a highway and I heard, we heard the uh German uh planes over us and that was really the first, the only time I was really really afraid because they they uh machine gunned all the refugees right on this highway and I pulled my mother and said, let's go, and there was a farm house.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">We didn't even ask can we come in.</span> <span id="s392">We just went in.</span> <span id="s393">And we, all five, we were always together with this lady with the two children, and uh we stayed there and they let us in and you know, we stayed there a couple of hours and here come the Germans marching in.</span> <span id="s394">Now we weren't too thrilled.</span> <span id="s395">But we couldn't stay in that house because they didn't have room you know, so after, we stayed a few hours I think and after a while we walked on and there was a like a chateau, like a big castle like, you know, not a castle, castle, but a castle and we went in there and there was an old lady and she was also , she said yeah, yeah, I speak a little Flemish and I speak a little German and I speak a little French, and she said, yeah, you can stay here.</span> <span id="s396">And uh we stayed maybe one night or maybe not even a night when the Germans came there too.</span> <span id="s397">And they wanted to make the headquarters there, so the headquarters then we had to leave regardless of who we were, but they didn't want any civilians there.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: But they didn't stop you because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s400">They didn't even know that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s401">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s402">But uh they had, she had a little house on the premises for the uh servants before, and she said you go and stay there.</span> <span id="s403">So we stayed there, and, but there was nothing to eat and we were five people and there was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s404">The little girl went to, into the stable and the chicken coops and she got some eggs but you know it was so much, so my mother said I don't think, they, they are very delirious now with their victory.</span> <span id="s405">They walked all over Europe you know.</span> <span id="s406">They're not going to do anything horrible and besides I don't want to hide that I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s407">I think we should go and tell them, the Germans.</span> <span id="s408">You know, they were officers in this headquarters for the whole region.</span> <span id="s409">And so she went and she didn't actually say Jewish.</span> <span id="s410">She said we are German refugees she just said and let them figure out what they want to figure out.</span> <span id="s411">And we asked, we are two children, three children and we have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s412">Later on maybe you can do something.</span> <span id="s413">And they were very polite and very nice and they sent us bread and they sent us all kinds, you know whatever they had rations.</span> <span id="s414">And so we stayed there a few days and uh then there were some soldiers that uh</span></p> <p><span id="s415">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION and uh there was one from Hamburg who was actually a Communist you know from Hamburg, and they were from the waterfront, and he came and he helped us and they raided the uh the uh winery.</span> <span id="s416">You know, France has a lot of wine, so instead of water he gave us the wine and the kids drank the wine and we were half drunk after a whole week because there was no water but wine.</span> <span id="s417">And that was something.</span> <span id="s418">So anyhow after a week of that we said well, what we going to do, you know.</span> <span id="s419">So this guy and also that soldier got me a wheelbarrow and he got a bicycle for the young boy and whatever we had we put on the things and started walking again.</span> <span id="s420">So we walked . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s422">Let's hold it there.</span> <span id="s423">Let them change tape, but before they do, did you have false papers, because you would have had to show the Germans something?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Not at that time.</span> <span id="s425">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: You had papers that said Juda (ph) on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: They didn't ask us for papers.</span> <span id="s428">Not at that time.</span> <span id="s429">That was in the very beginning, in 1940, when they were very victorious and very, and they didn't have any uh any plans, any directives to do anything with Jews or not Jews.</span> <span id="s430">They had this in Germany, but this was war and there was nothing against Jews at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s432">Thank you.</span> <span id="s433">Let's let them change tapes.</span> <span id="s434">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s437">Let's pick up you are leaving the chateau.</span> <span id="s438">You've been there for a week now, and you are leaving with this wheelbarrow and a bicycle?</span> <span id="s439">OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: The five of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: The five of you.</span> <span id="s442">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Well, we made it into the next town and there were signs all over for the refugees, you know, we can go to the next, to the school.</span> <span id="s444">And we stayed at the school.</span> <span id="s445">They have cots or I don't remember any more.</span> <span id="s446">But we stayed in the school for a few days and uh they fed us there more or less and we never, there was already an organization in place to take care of more or less of the refugees, but uh then we figured we have to do something on our own so I went to the headquarters again and we were already emboldened by this first experience, so we went, I went to the headquarters there and I asked for transportation back to Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s448">Now which headquarters are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: The Germans.</span> <span id="s450">(The Germans?)</span> <span id="s451">Oh yes, was all Germans.</span> <span id="s452">And uh they put us on the uh, they said yes, go down to the plaza.</span> <span id="s453">There were lots of trucks and of these trucks are going to , to to a town near, in Belgium already but near Brussels and they will take you.</span> <span id="s454">So, cause you know, sixteen year old girl they all wanted to have in, during the war, they wanted me to sit in front with one and the other, my mother and the other and the Matulskis were in the back of another truck, but we were all together.</span> <span id="s455">I wouldn't leave them.</span> <span id="s456">You know, I said we have five people and we go together.</span> <span id="s457">So we got into and uh we stayed overnight with a with a Belgium family.</span> <span id="s458">They put us up but we didn't, we were really you know as Germans.</span> <span id="s459">They hated the Germans and we came there on the German truck, but what can you do.</span> <span id="s460">They had the advantage of the language at least.</span> <span id="s461">You know, we could speak.</span> <span id="s462">So next time, next day they picked us up and they gave orders to back to Brussels and we went back to my, to our old apartment and there was nothing there anymore and so, but Mrs. Matulski, the other lady, she had another apartment and there was one empty in her, in the same building and so we stayed there.</span> <span id="s463">And uh . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: How did you live now?</span> <span id="s465">How long, you stayed for quite a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yeah, well for a couple of years.</span> <span id="s467">As a matter of fact, that's where I started uh my, my sewing career.</span> <span id="s468">Because by this time I was seventeen and my mother said, girl, you'll never go back to school.</span> <span id="s469">There's no way.</span> <span id="s470">You should learn a trade.</span> <span id="s471">And sewing was always my big uh strength.</span> <span id="s472">I was very good in Home Economics and sewing in school and in that household school in Munich.</span> <span id="s473">I was always good in sewing so she found two Viennese dressmakers who was who were established and they, they uh in dressmaking, you know.</span> <span id="s474">To order.</span> <span id="s475">People came and brought their fabrics and so I really learned it there, learned a lot from them to do to do fine sewing and to do fittings and to do that's really where I got my first apprenticeship so to speak, with those two ladies.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">And uh my mother was able to make a little bit money and we didn't need very much and we finally got our uh the lift, this this box with things from Germany we got them out and uh out of the uh out of the they had been in the warehouse all the time (in storage?)</span> <span id="s477">In storage, yes . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: What was in the box?</span> <span id="s479">What did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: There was a very ingenious way of packing.</span> <span id="s481">They had made to order boxes like like uh closets and you know, on the one side were some clothes and then there were shelves on the shelves and then, they were sometimes as big as a small room but it was all one great box.</span> <span id="s482">So I don't remember any more exactly but I think my mother had uh uh table service that she was able, that we were able to sell and some crystal.</span> <span id="s483">No silver.</span> <span id="s484">No silver.</span> <span id="s485">No gold.</span> <span id="s486">That had to be brought to Hitler you know we had to, they allowed us two uh table settings silver a person, one for milk and one for supposedly.</span> <span id="s487">And uh, but everything else including jewelry and silver had to be uh brought you know, give them away, but she had the table, so she had beautiful linens.</span> <span id="s488">She had uh crystal and things like that that we sold.</span> <span id="s489">Little by little we sold it and she made a little bit of money and I must have made some money there too.</span> <span id="s490">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s491">Anyhow, we lived.</span> <span id="s492">We had a little apartment then in uh in Brussels and on the other side .</span> <span id="s493">Then she made friends with uh Jewish people who had lived there for a long time and they helped us and we got along.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s495">Tell me about your, the papers that you had at this time.</span> <span id="s496">They were . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: At this time we still had our regular papers.</span> <span id="s498">(OK) And nobody really bothered us because the Germans, you know, that was the beginning of the Germans but, and the and the occupation and the Belgiums were kind of in the background but we got food stamps.</span> <span id="s499">I mean not for free but for rationing.</span> <span id="s500">That we got.</span> <span id="s501">I don't, I guess with our regular papers.</span> <span id="s502">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: You brought a Juda, the star.</span> <span id="s504">Were you wearing that later?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: In a minute.</span> <span id="s506">So in 1942 then they, the Germans started to tighten the screws about the Jews.</span> <span id="s507">First they said curfew.</span> <span id="s508">You had to be home by eight o'clock at night when, you know.</span> <span id="s509">And then they started yes to, all the Jews had to wear this star out on their on their outer garments when we were out on the street.</span> <span id="s510">And a lot of Belgium people put it on too in solidarity to us.</span> <span id="s511">In Sweden, the King of Sweden wore it.</span> <span id="s512">A lot of people wore this to be, you know, in, to show solidarity with us.</span> <span id="s513">But we were still free.</span> <span id="s514">We could still go around with this or without it, not without it, you know, but this is, we could go.</span> <span id="s515">Till one day there was a proclamation, all Jews have to go the uh uh City Hall, City Hall and register.</span> <span id="s516">Just register.</span> <span id="s517">So my mother said, we are not going to register.</span> <span id="s518">If they don't know about us, they you know, that I'm not going to register.</span> <span id="s519">And this other lady, this Mrs. Matulski, said no, we have we have to, they're going to send us to work you know.</span> <span id="s520">We cannot do against it.</span> <span id="s521">Too dangerous.</span> <span id="s522">And she did register, but we never did.</span> <span id="s523">So time wore on and it got a little bit worse and worse.</span> <span id="s524">All of a sudden it started with people catching people on the streets or deportations.</span> <span id="s525">And they, on the street they took anybody that had this, you know.</span> <span id="s526">They went on trolley cars.</span> <span id="s527">They went in the front and in the back of trolley cars, the SS, and nobody could escape and they went through all the people and we had, we had identification papers, Jews.</span> <span id="s528">But from the lists that been registered they went from house to house and you know, they had the addresses.</span> <span id="s529">They had the people.</span> <span id="s530">It was very easy.</span> <span id="s531">They went and picked them up.</span> <span id="s532">So they sent them letters that they have to report, and it said for work only for labor.</span> <span id="s533">But my mother got around and they started to get rumors to rumors already that specially girls that they put girls in whore houses, that they used the Jewish girls for the soldiers and that's all she had to hear.</span> <span id="s534">So she wasn't going to let us down.</span> <span id="s535">We weren't going to go to any forced labor and we didn't.</span> <span id="s536">But then one day this lady got the letter.</span> <span id="s537">She has to report then and then for labor.</span> <span id="s538">It always said for labor.</span> <span id="s539">So uh she came, the boy came running to us.</span> <span id="s540">Mrs.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Blochman, my mother wants go to labor camp and please help us.</span> <span id="s542">I don't want to go and so my mother went over there and she said start packing.</span> <span id="s543">They lived with a family that had a grocery store downstairs and she had sent the girl away in the country with, to the family of these people they became pretty well friendly with them.</span> <span id="s544">And you and will go away like here is punctual and you can go under false names and you go there.</span> <span id="s545">Nobody knows you there and we will see what happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Nobody ever sent us a letter but they came closer and closer and they had these deportations so mother made arrangements we should hide like Ann Frank, you know, like in the house only we didn't have that much money and it was very expensive.</span> <span id="s547">People didn't do it just for the love only.</span> <span id="s548">You know, they, they wanted to be paid and they wanted to be paid for the food at least and for the room so mother and I we went, one night somebody said there's going to be a, said it's going to be uh some you know people going to be picked up tonight so we went into this room.</span> <span id="s549">We spent one night there.</span> <span id="s550">And I said mother, that's not right.</span> <span id="s551">We're going to go crazy.</span> <span id="s552">We can't stay here the two of us until the end of the war you know, alone and we don't have enough money to pay her so we came out of hiding the next day.</span> <span id="s553">And we had friends and he said, he got us into connection with the French underground.</span> <span id="s554">There were already the French underground and there were some uh English uh prisoners of wars that had escaped from Germany and there was an underground route to bring them to Switzerland and from Switzerland to Portugal and back to England.</span> <span id="s555">And somehow they got us into connect... into contact with this group and we were the first women that went.</span> <span id="s556">Mother and I first.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Not this lady.</span> <span id="s558">She was still in the and her little girl was in the country and everything was so far so good.</span> <span id="s559">So, but we didn't have that much money anymore.</span> <span id="s560">You know, when they only took you to the French border you know and then you had to have some money so we got together with another, with a Belgium lady or at least a lady who had lived there, had a business there for a long time, and she had also three children Âªa little girl was the smallest, was only two years old or three years old.</span> <span id="s561">And they said if you help me she said with the children on this trip I'll pay your expenses.</span> <span id="s562">So one Sunday, uh the meantime in France had started the deportations already.</span> <span id="s563">And the people like my father and, they were in this French camp.</span> <span id="s564">had come and the south of France wasn't free anymore.</span> <span id="s565">Was also German.</span> <span id="s566">So they got all the non-Jewish Germans out of this camp and took the Jews to Drancy.</span> <span id="s567">Drancy was this camp in Paris from where the French Jews were sent to Poland.</span> <span id="s568">It's a..</span> <span id="s569">.</span> <span id="s570">so we wanted to go on a Sunday and on Thursday morning we get a card, a postcard from my father from Drancy.</span> <span id="s571">So we knew, and my mother was very upset and she said, you do what you want.</span> <span id="s572">If you want to go, I'll go but she was out of her you know.</span> <span id="s573">So we left everything standing there like we lived you know and our whole apartment, we had everything threes between.</span> <span id="s574">Three blouses and three bras and three this, so we could change.</span> <span id="s575">One changed and the next day somebody, the other one changed.</span> <span id="s576">And we only had little uh like an attachÃ© case, that was all our luggage because they told us not to take anything.</span> <span id="s577">But we had some dollar bills.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">My mother had some dollars I mean, at that time maybe two hundred or three hundred dollars which was a lot of money then, and that was the most dangerous if, you know, if they found this on you that was immediate death.</span> <span id="s579">But this other money wasn't worth anything.</span> <span id="s580">So this French, that friend, said don't worry.</span> <span id="s581">We'll do something so he took a whole loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s582">Everybody stuck it in their shoes and that where the first place the Germans were looking for.</span> <span id="s583">But he was smart.</span> <span id="s584">He took a piece, a whole loaf of bread and he sliced it very fine and two slices, he put the dollar bill in and he sewed the two slices of bread together you know, so you couldn't tell no way, unless you really pulled it away, so we had this bread.</span> <span id="s585">You know, like we wanted to have something to eat on the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">And he gave us, there's where we got the false papers.</span> <span id="s587">From this underground uh from this underground organization.</span> <span id="s588">With different names and we rehearsed the names over and over and we were supposed to been born in Luxembourg or in so to explain our German accent, that we didn't speak perfect French.</span> <span id="s589">And we got on this on the train and uh with this other lady with the three children, and we we somehow got through.</span> <span id="s590">I mean there was a control on the border, on the French border, and we, we showed our papers and he accepted that.</span> <span id="s591">That was we got through that.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: How did you, you were coming up to the border A: Yeah ... in the train...</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: ...in the train.</span> <span id="s594">How did that feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Very fine.</span> <span id="s596">I mean, you know, we were but uh we somehow made it, you know.</span> <span id="s597">We, we just sat very quietly on our seats.</span> <span id="s598">We were not in the same compartment with the other lady, and then we had somebody with us.</span> <span id="s599">He didn't, from the underground he didn't communicate with us but he had his ears open and he might have heard some uh people reporting to him from the underground or, you know, and we knew he was there.</span> <span id="s600">And he you know it was either that or going to the camp in any event.</span> <span id="s601">I mean the alternative you know, wasn't that much better.</span> <span id="s602">We had to do it.</span> <span id="s603">And then we came to a another, then we got out in the next, in this French town I don't remember anymore but there was uh border patrol and SS on the on the exit and they looked everybody over and you know, they, but we got through that.</span> <span id="s604">So we got the little hotel room and we stayed overnight and then when they, I think next morning, we went for breakfast into like a cafe, you know, this little French town, and we were all sitting around and here comes, in a round, in a round table with the children, and here comes the SS, comes in and looks because we weren't the only ones.</span> <span id="s605">I mean that the way to Switzerland and we weren't the only ones going to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s606">And they were trying uh to catch as many as possible but they didn't want to make uh very big thing out of it so they just went, came into the cafe and looked and looked and our hearts stood still.</span> <span id="s607">It was like you know, like you're frozen in time.</span> <span id="s608">You know, we don't and then he looked at each other and he said no, I don't think there are any here.</span> <span id="s609">And they left you know.</span> <span id="s610">And you die a little bit at a time.</span> <span id="s611">So that was really the closest we came with the Germans.</span> <span id="s612">And then this young man told us uh we're coming very close to the Swiss border now and they are even more vigilant and more uh you know, so he won't go.</span> <span id="s613">He doesn't want to jeopardize the this underground.</span> <span id="s614">You know, they don't want him to, and we are on our own now.</span> <span id="s615">But we should look in this village there on the French uh Swiss border, we should look around and ask for a guy named Gerard (ph) and Gerard will take us over the border.</span> <span id="s616">He knows we are coming and he will take us over.</span> <span id="s617">Well, we got off the train didn't go to this village.</span> <span id="s618">We got off before and we were afraid to go all on the same bus so we sent this lady with the smaller children on the bus and mother and I were walking.</span> <span id="s619">And we were walking on the highway with our little attachÃ© case and two women it looked kind of in in city clothes after all, and we looked a little bit conspicuous I guess.</span> <span id="s620">So the French gendarme stopped us.</span> <span id="s621">And he really questioned us.</span> <span id="s622">Questioned our papers and he heard as a Frenchman more than the Germans that our French wasn't up to par and we said well, we are from and we always spoke German but well, it was a long story and but finally my mother said, look, uh you hate the Germans don't you.</span> <span id="s623">And he said yes, I hate the Germans.</span> <span id="s624">I said more than you hate the Jews.</span> <span id="s625">Yes.</span> <span id="s626">So, she said, what do you want from us.</span> <span id="s627">Let us take our chances.</span> <span id="s628">You know, she didn't tell we're Jews, we're not Jews.</span> <span id="s629">So he says OK.</span> <span id="s630">I'll, he let us go.</span> <span id="s631">So we went to this village.</span> <span id="s632">We came to this village and we couldn't locate Gerard.</span> <span id="s633">And wherever we asked for Gerard they just froze.</span> <span id="s634">The people froze up.</span> <span id="s635">So we stayed one night and there was a lot of German soldiers in this village and we were very scared.</span> <span id="s636">So we said, well, we have to get out of here because here they will catch us.</span> <span id="s637">So here we started walking again, and we walked up the highway and we came up to a little country inn.</span> <span id="s638">So we got in there and we asked for two rooms for the two families and there we were.</span> <span id="s639">And I think that people knew who we were.</span> <span id="s640">You know in German we have a saying when you die and you don't leave any money for the funeral, he says we're going to smell him out.</span> <span id="s641">You know, it's going to smell.</span> <span id="s642">They're going to have to bury us with a .</span> <span id="s643">So we're going to sit here until we smell, till they do something with us.</span> <span id="s644">And they did.</span> <span id="s645">They they got together and they called the uh, without us talking about it, they knew exactly what what we wanted you know.</span> <span id="s646">Was very close, within walking distance of the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s647">So uh, so they got the the priest and the priest talked it over with some people in the village and they talked it over.</span> <span id="s648">There came the letter carrier.</span> <span id="s649">The letter carrier was going on a bicycle, was always going on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s650">So they said to us, I mean we paid.</span> <span id="s651">I mean the lady had .</span> <span id="s652">We paid her for what nights we stayed and you know, and uh they sent a hay wagon with clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">They gave us uh old aprons like this farm women are wearing and they hid, they put us on the hay wagon and the, the children, they were hiding in the hay and they gave us milk cans.</span> <span id="s654">You know there were milk cans on like we were farmers' women that were going on the, coming home from uh milking cows or something.</span> <span id="s655">And they hiding our little bit of luggage under the hay and they took us back; the highway that was the way was back to the village.</span> <span id="s656">Oh, I forgot to tell, I went back one day with this young man, with this with this boy, to the village to ask again for Gerard, and I found out that he had been arrested.</span> <span id="s657">That's why everybody was so afraid to even mention his name.</span> <span id="s658">So we went back, they had to go back to this village in order to get to the border.</span> <span id="s659">And the letter carrier, they went around the dinner hour when the German border patrol was having dinner and they knew exactly by observation what time, but still, to make sure, the letter carrier on his bicycle went right in front of us, ahead of us to make sure that we don't run into any patrols or anything.</span> <span id="s660">So he went ahead and we came on that hay wagon and they brought us to the farm right on the border and we got out and we got, each got a glass of milk yet and that was the farm was like a hundred years ago and I can still see it and they said well, that's as far as we can go.</span> <span id="s661">You go down here in the back of us is like a ravine and there's a little brook.</span> <span id="s662">We go over the brook but there is barbed wire.</span> <span id="s663">You have to go through this barbed wire or over or under or whatever, and on the other side is Switzerland.</span> <span id="s664">Good luck.</span> <span id="s665">So that little girl had a pacifier and we, we went down this ravine and we went over the brook and we went up the other side and that little girl lost her pacifier and started screaming bloody murder, but we still made it and we came over the border and uh but the Swiss border guard had heard her all the way across and he came and he helped us and you know, and we were kind of happy, but my mother said let's go, let's go little bit further in.</span> <span id="s666">They can still send us back, and you know, we'll celebrate later.</span> <span id="s667">So we got but he was good.</span> <span id="s668">In the meantime in the beginning of the deportations, the Swiss didn't let anybody in.</span> <span id="s669">And they turned back a lot of people.</span> <span id="s670">But in the meantime, we came a little bit later already, the public opinion had forced them to take them in, especially women and children and we had no man with us, so he wasn't going to turn us back anyhow.</span> <span id="s671">So he took us, I don't think to another hotel by the way.</span> <span id="s672">He took us to a little, to, to a town where there was a bigger uh police headquarters and uh we stayed overnight and we had he stayed with us and he even watched us when we went to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s673">He stood in front of the bathroom.</span> <span id="s674">I mean he didn't let us get out of sight and uh my mother said by the way, we're not free.</span> <span id="s675">They watch us.</span> <span id="s676">They treat us nicely but we're not going to stay.</span> <span id="s677">So we tried to call our relatives in Zurich but we couldn't uh commu.</span> <span id="s678">.</span> <span id="s679">, there was no communication.</span> <span id="s680">I don't remember any more.</span> <span id="s681">We couldn't tell them that we were in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s682">So uh we told them of course right way that these papers are false, and we gave them our right papers, our right names.</span> <span id="s683">We had no papers to the effect but we gave them our right names and and everything and they were OK.</span> <span id="s684">I mean they fed us and they were very nice.</span> <span id="s685">And then in the afternoon, there was a bigger group of us.</span> <span id="s686">They put us on the train and it was a very strange feeling.</span> <span id="s687">You are in a new country, and they do with you what they want.</span> <span id="s688">They put us on the train didn't say a word where we're going or what's going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s689">And uh they marched us through the city of and there must have been about ten or twelve of us and uh people were looking out the windows.</span> <span id="s690">They'd say ah, the poor people, the poor people, they're going to the I don't remember anymore but they uh we spoke enough French to know that the prison is a prison is a prison, but it was a different word it was different they said a different word that we didn't understand.</span> <span id="s691">Well, we understood pretty soon, pretty quick.</span> <span id="s692">We came to this prison that must have been five hundred years old.</span> <span id="s693">The keys were this big.</span> <span id="s694">They had you know, thick walls and thick and they, right away they separated this lady from her family.</span> <span id="s695">They took the son.</span> <span id="s696">He was only ten or twelve years old.</span> <span id="s697">They took him to stay with other men and she and her daughter went in one room and mother and I were in another in another cell, and uh as a matter of fact the first cell had only one bed and we didn't know how, so we slept like this, like sardines.</span> <span id="s698">We had funny things that happening too you know.</span> <span id="s699">like I said the key was so big and the key hole was that big too, so I was laying in bed like this and all of a sudden I said mother, somebody is looking at me, somebody is looking at me.</span> <span id="s700">She said who's going to look.</span> <span id="s701">So anyhow there was a prisoner outside that had it wasn't you know a penitentiary or anything.</span> <span id="s702">It was an old jail where people was kept and all of a sudden I see, there comes a knife with a pad of butter through this key hole.</span> <span id="s703">And this was apparently in or something that could order his own food in there and he had wonderful breakfast and he wanted us to have a pad of butter.</span> <span id="s704">Oh, we had all kinds of . . . then we heard singing. . . Hebrew songs, Jewish songs, singing.</span> <span id="s705">And there was another group of refugees.</span> <span id="s706">They wanted us to know that they are there.</span> <span id="s707">You know, they couldn't communicate with us any different way, so we heard this singing and so when the regular prisoners were, they had time out in the morning to make their beds and to empty their sinks (ph) and so you know they kept us in the cells, but when they were, when the regular prisoners were in their cells during the day, then they kept us, we could go out in the hallways.</span> <span id="s708">And they were great big hallways with and we met with the other refugees and you know, it wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s709">And we, we got food and we uh the basement they had bathtubs.</span> <span id="s710">We could even take a bath.</span> <span id="s711">And not everyday but you know, they were very nice.</span> <span id="s712">But the food of course wasn't too great so my mother was always afraid that I was going to starve you know, the regular Jewish mother.</span> <span id="s713">So one day she said to this, to the , can't I get anything else for my daughter?</span> <span id="s714">And I said, mother, what do you think we are in prison what are you . . . Sure enough a couple of days later he comes up with a whole tray with a little steak and other things and I almost died because all these, our poor prisoners, got only water and you know the regular food and here I had a steak, but I guess mothers will be mothers even in prison.</span> <span id="s715">So that little by little everybody was transported away and even this lady with the children I think got out earlier than we did.</span> <span id="s716">and we were left just the two of us.</span> <span id="s717">We had Rosh Hashanan there and they had taken us to another little town for, and the women were in the hotel but they didn't have money to put the men in the hotel too.</span> <span id="s718">The men they put in prison there over night but OK.</span> <span id="s719">We were happy then.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: You got to go to services?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: We got to go to services and they gave us a very nice meal in the hotel, under surveillance.</span> <span id="s722">They were policemen there, but we met the Jewish people and it was it was very nice.</span> <span id="s723">Yom Kippur we spent in prison and there were a couple of men who held services in the cell.</span> <span id="s724">We were, like I said, we could visit during the day and they held our food until at night and we got the whole meal at night and it was OK.</span> <span id="s725">But then mother and I we were the only ones left and it got colder already and we didn't have any clothes so there was one family in had a beautiful department store, wealthy Swiss Jews and they always came visiting and see, to see what they can do for the refugees and uh when you know it got colder then uh mother said to them we really don't have any clothes and you know Switzerland is, gets cold pretty soon.</span> <span id="s726">Oh, they said, there's no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">And he asked the prison warden, you know, can these people come to my store and pick out clothes, and he said yes.</span> <span id="s728">So was a very strange situation.</span> <span id="s729">They opened the gates and mother and I we walked out and we went to the store, and the lady invited us up for tea.</span> <span id="s730">We had beautiful tea in the salon with cake and you know, like real people and he took us around in the store, and he said pick out what you need you know, was for winter and it became a habit.</span> <span id="s731">We went every day we went out walking and five o'clock we went back to the prison.</span> <span id="s732">You know, there was no place else to go.</span> <span id="s733">Was home.</span> <span id="s734">But of course not for very long.</span> <span id="s735">Then I got sick and we got to the Salvation Army and we stayed at the Salvation Army a little bit and then in the meantime this Mrs. Matulski and her two children came the same way we came and she was a very nervous person so she took some sleeping pills and she slept through the border.</span> <span id="s736">She was, and the boy was already you know children have to grow up pretty quick.</span> <span id="s737">He gave the policemen the the patrol their papers and she slept.</span> <span id="s738">So they thought if this lady sleep so well she can't be very nervous.</span> <span id="s739">So they made it too.</span> <span id="s740">And they were already in a camp uh like they called lager it was the beginning where people got processed.</span> <span id="s741">And she wrote to Mother we are here and it's very nice.</span> <span id="s742">We even have curtains on the window.</span> <span id="s743">We have and it's not so bad and why don't you try coming here.</span> <span id="s744">So while we were at the Salvation Army, we went to this to the police to the you know, and my mother said we have friends at this camp.</span> <span id="s745">We wouldn't mind going there.</span> <span id="s746">So he said Mrs. Blachman, I don't think you want to go there.</span> <span id="s747">I wouldn't like you to go there, but if you want to we will send you there.</span> <span id="s748">So he gave us a policeman and we you know went to this camp.</span> <span id="s749">That camp was worse than the prison because the camp was barracks and in the meantime it's November and it's raining and it's muddy and they have a toilet out on the yard and the watchman out in the yard, and my mother got a bladder infection and the food was terrible and we had it was like almost.</span> <span id="s750">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s751">And not only that there were a lot of people from France that we for the first time talked to and found out what my father went through and they told us that my father was deported.</span> <span id="s752">Actually that's where we learned it.</span> <span id="s753">And we saw how terrible these people looked already.</span> <span id="s754">You know, we were still fresh from Belgium.</span> <span id="s755">We hadn't lost so much weight yet and we looked still like people, but these people looked already like they had been through the mill you know, so so it was very depressing and uh there was nothing to do and we were sitting there.</span> <span id="s756">We had little curtains on the windows but that didn't make it.</span> <span id="s757">So it became winter and we got, we were divided into different camps, and mother and I we went, and this lady too with her daughter, went to uh Leistahl (ph).</span> <span id="s758">That's close to .</span> <span id="s759">And in the meantime I think we had communications with our family in Zurich.</span> <span id="s760">I think we wrote to them from the camp and they wrote back so one day, low and behold I get a postcard to Gerta Blachman from Marcos.</span> <span id="s761">Marcos is also in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s762">He had walked.</span> <span id="s763">He had, he was a member of .</span> <span id="s764">Uh not a member a child in the camp and he was in an school in France at uh one night they was going to be deported and the policemen came to the director of that school and said, send your oldest ones, the ones that you think can make it on their own, out tonight because tomorrow morning the SS is coming to take all the kids.</span> <span id="s765">So he was seventeen, eighteen, in the meantime and the director gave them whatever they could and money or whatever little, and he had made it to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s766">Like over five or six weeks he walked, in hotels and he walked at night and slept in daytime and he spoke beautiful French.</span> <span id="s767">He was very talented with languages.</span> <span id="s768">Spoke a perfect French.</span> <span id="s769">He worked for a time in the French youth group and they had trouble with them and I don't know how he made it to Geneva coming from south of France.</span> <span id="s770">He made it in to Geneva and in Geneva he got on the train.</span> <span id="s771">He was never caught.</span> <span id="s772">He was never and he traveled to Zurich to his uncle and he presented he had an uncle or a relative in Zurich and he presented himself there.</span> <span id="s773">And uh the uncle said I am very happy but you can't stay with me for the rest of... you have to go to the police and present yourself, you know, tell them.</span> <span id="s774">So they sent him to a different camp but not back you know.</span> <span id="s775">So he wrote to my relatives we had given each other the addresses so in case you know there were, and here he is also in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s776">And uh so the next spring by coincidence he got into what called .</span> <span id="s777">That was also nearby but maybe two hours by foot from my camp to his camp.</span> <span id="s778">And uh at that time we weren't allowed to go much yet but he sent, some other young man came and told me about him and maybe we could use telephone or something, I don't know.</span> <span id="s779">But anyhow we got together and that's really when our courtship started and we walked and walked to get to each other you know.</span> <span id="s780">It was down to and up through the fields and there were beautiful cherry orchards in the summer and the things were... Each had to walk an hour to meet and then we started walking because there was no place to go.</span> <span id="s781">I mean we couldn't you know was a very strange courtship but... Sometimes we met in the little town in the winter and we sat in the tearoom and had uh coffee or tea or called cafe in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s782">Was this bread and jelly and butter and coffee that's very uh Swiss?</span> <span id="s783">So that's where we started our friendship, our courtship when we got so we were in this working camp and here I sewed.</span> <span id="s784">I was sewing again.</span> <span id="s785">I, there were also the people sent in, donated clothes and there were also some Viennese who seemed to be the best dressmakers and they asked me, I said yes, I know a little bit and there I learned some more.</span> <span id="s786">And we changed, we altered the clothes, these donated clothes, for the for the people in the camp you know.</span> <span id="s787">And uh one day the director of the camp received a uh request, you know if there are young girls in there that know how to sew, there's a shortage of operators like operators you know for uh in a blouse factory in Bern and they would get the papers on the working permission for such a person.</span> <span id="s788">So she asked me would I go.</span> <span id="s789">And I said yes, sure.</span> <span id="s790">You know, to be free and to learn more in my trade.</span> <span id="s791">So was very upset and very heart broken that I would leave and he wouldn't be there.</span> <span id="s792">So the only way for him to be free was to become a dishwasher.</span> <span id="s793">That was also in shortage.</span> <span id="s794">So he put in to go to Bern to be a dishwasher and my, these people put in for me the papers to be an operator.</span> <span id="s795">Well, the dishwashers were needed more than the operators.</span> <span id="s796">He was there in one week.</span> <span id="s797">And he was washing dishes in Bern in a in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s798">And he was quite a spoiled young man but when it came you know from at home, he was an only child but when it, something had to be done, he did it.</span> <span id="s799">And he was alone in Bern and I was alone there in the meantime.</span> <span id="s800">But we stuck it out.</span> <span id="s801">He came back one weekend to see me and then finally my papers came through and I came to Bern too and we were together.</span> <span id="s802">I mean he stayed, he had to live there under very bad conditions and very dirty conditions.</span> <span id="s803">You know, but anyhow, this is so many years back.</span> <span id="s804">So we were there together again and uh I learned a lot in this factory.</span> <span id="s805">That was my first job as a power machine, you know, uh experience on a power machine and uh it was quite a strict thing.</span> <span id="s806">I had to be there very early and I am not an early riser so I had to be there from, they just started to change from uh sixty hour uh from uh from uh six day working day to five days a week and that meant of course more hours every day to put it into five days you know.</span> <span id="s807">They started very early but uh we managed to see each other on weekends.</span> <span id="s808">But he had to work weekends too.</span> <span id="s809">You know, in a restaurant was a different schedule so one day he stuck himself with a fork in the dishpan and he got an infection and couldn't and they sent him to the hospital and he got all bandaged up and he couldn't work so he, his boss said if you can't wash dishes you are no good to me.</span> <span id="s810">You are fired.</span> <span id="s811">And that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s812">So he came to stay with me in the same building.</span> <span id="s813">Had a little room next door and he stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s814">And my landlady was very proper and she got very upset and she sent no less the vice police after him and he got arrested.</span> <span id="s815">I mean he got taken in and they took, brought him to the police where he should have reported that he wasn't working anymore you know.</span> <span id="s816">And he, they said well, what's you know, what's the story and he told them and he said that's my fiancÃ©e but we can't get married because we have no papers so he says, oh sure, you can get married.</span> <span id="s817">He says do you have any .</span> <span id="s818">He said yeah, my mother in law is here, you know, her mother is here and I have a cousin.</span> <span id="s819">He said well, if they uh certify that this is your name, you can get married.</span> <span id="s820">So we got married.</span> <span id="s821">(Laughter) But he never went back to this camp.</span> <span id="s822">Neither one of us got back to the uh went back to the camp.</span> <span id="s823">My mother uh became a housekeeper.</span> <span id="s824">She got commissioned for a housekeeper in Bern and after we got married the first of May he uh went to a school there.</span> <span id="s825">The Jewish community sent him to a school to a uh business school.</span> <span id="s826">And so we worked.</span> <span id="s827">We were there together.</span> <span id="s828">We had one room but a bigger room, a nicer room, and nice people and my uh my boss, my you know, from the blouse factory kind of made the wedding.</span> <span id="s829">They came with us to the uh, it was on the first of May and there was no trolley cars so we running like crazy through whole of Zurich, no Bern, to the to the uh to get married and my mother was uh brought the flowers.</span> <span id="s830">The lady had given her lilacs.</span> <span id="s831">She came with a armful of lilacs that was my flowers.</span> <span id="s832">And after ceremony my the uh my boss took us out for lunch and then in the afternoon we went to the rabbi.</span> <span id="s833">We had a Jewish ceremony at the rabbi's home and the , the wife of the rabbi had made cookies and wine and it was... Then my mother had made little sandwiches and they all came to our new apartment.</span> <span id="s834">So we had no dishes.</span> <span id="s835">We had nothing and so this lady said what, you have no dishes.</span> <span id="s836">No.</span> <span id="s837">So she went to the department store there and sent us our first set of dishes the same day so she wouldn't . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Can you pull it.</span> <span id="s839">Let's, you're, you're now married and we need some of the little ... A: Well, after the war . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Yeah, bring us to the close of the war.</span> <span id="s841">Tell us what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Well, by then the war was almost over.</span> <span id="s843">As a matter of fact on the on the, I have a newspaper uh Bern, from Bern, where the headline is Hitler is dead, on the thirtieth, I think it was the thirtieth of April, 1945, and then the, and the civil column was of our marriage announcement.</span> <span id="s844">It's in the same paper, and was a big headline you know.</span> <span id="s845">And so uh, well sure there was uh the the landing in in France you know, when the Americans landed in France and we were listening to the radio, but we were powerless.</span> <span id="s846">We couldn't participate.</span> <span id="s847">We could only listen and hope and pray that the war will end.</span> <span id="s848">Then slowly came the news out about the concentration camps, but it came only at the very end that we heard about the liberation of the camps and what went on there.</span> <span id="s849">We had no, we didn't know anything about that.</span> <span id="s850">So we had no more, you know, we didn't hear from my father anymore and as a matter of fact long afterwards somebody told us, I don't know if this is the truth or not, that he was put into one of those famous uh railway cars and that they died in there, that he never made it to the camp.</span> <span id="s851">I don't know whether this is reliable truth or not, but that's what we heard from people who said they knew him.</span> <span id="s852">And my mother's brother didn't come back.</span> <span id="s853">He was in Drancy.</span> <span id="s854">He was sent back.</span> <span id="s855">And my grandparents and my husband's parents and actually only Mother and I made it through you know, through Switzerland.</span> <span id="s856">So we went, when the Red Cross sent us back to Brussels after a few months, about six or seven months after the end of the war, and my son was born there three years, two years, three years later, and we actually all wanted to go to Ecuador.</span> <span id="s857">I have an uncle in, my husband had an uncle in Ecuador and after that didn't materialize it was always a delay and all things so my step-father, my mother had remarried in the meantime, and my, the brother of my step father had a farm in , New Jersey and he said if you'd like to come, you know, and we started working then we had to, started at the blouse factory after I had been working in Switzerland for blouses and I had uh taken some private lessons from the uh lady who did the models and who did the patterns.</span> <span id="s858">I went at night to her place and learned that too, because the sewing alone wasn't enough, so I did this and my step father helped cut and my mother started selling and we had a beautiful little business going.</span> <span id="s859">But like I said they presented us with the signature then that we were, we had promised to leave and our status was semi-legal.</span> <span id="s860">I mean they prolonged, every six months they prolonged our papers you know.</span> <span id="s861">But we weren't citizens and then my son was born and he, they made him , not an enemy but German, and we didn't want our son growing up as German in Belgium you know.</span> <span id="s862">Today it doesn't make any difference I guess, but at that time that was the enemy you know, and having him go to school or something as German, so we decided to go to America where we can become citizens and live, you know, and he became a citizen.</span> <span id="s863">As a matter of fact the judge made him a better status than we are.</span> <span id="s864">When he said, when we went, he made us citizens first and then he made him like an American born of naturalized Americans abroad.</span> <span id="s865">He was born abroad, not that it made so much difference, but you know, he has an even better status than we have.</span> <span id="s866">And that was very important to us.</span> <span id="s867">I think we did the right thing, even though we liked Belgium very much but for my son's life it is much better.</span> <span id="s868">They both educated and they both have wonderful lives and wonderful wives and children and they are full American and you know, like born here and this was the right decision I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: I think so too.</span> <span id="s870">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s871">Thank you so much.</span> <span id="s872">That is quite a story.</span> <span id="s873">I didn't know all this when I started.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
