what?)</span> <span id="s325">When I graduated from institute it was the type of place for me to work-- they send papers-- they always do it like this in Russia-- they determine your place before you

want me.</span> <span id="s328">That's what I remember.</span> <span id="s329">She told me I'd have to go to a collective farm to pick potatoes and that I have to go on business trips, but I had my son, a one-year-old, and I couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s330">And I was scared of doing this.</span> <span id="s331">I wasn't prepared for this, so I went to the manager of this organization and said, I can't do this because I have a little baby.</span> <span id="s332">He was kind to me and found me a place.</span> <span id="s333">So it was a little incident.</span></p> <p><span

we use a lot of idioms?)</span> <span id="s363">To tell you the truth, it's not British English.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">(How far was it to the institute?)</span> <span id="s365">It was far.</span> <span id="s366">(How did you decide?)</span> <span id="s367">I think my father decided.</span> <span id="s368">He wanted to see me with higher education and we were talking-- what kind of education would be better for me.</span> <span id="s369">I wanted to be in trade.</span> <span id="s370">You know trade?</span> <span id="s371">To be a manager in a store, but he did not want that.</span> <span id="s372">He explained that it's not for me, I'm too honest to be there.</span> <span id="s373">Yes, in Russia that's a common thing.</span> <span id="s374">(Can you explain that?)</span> <span id="s375">They steal a lot.</span> <span id="s376">I don't know how to explain.</span> <span id="s377">Somebody who fools people.</span> <span id="s378">If you don't do it, you
