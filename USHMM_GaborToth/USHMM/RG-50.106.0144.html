were.</span> <span id="s25">We observed all the Jewish laws.</span> <span id="s26">My grandfather was very, very Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Did you have a favorite holiday?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Yes, it was Sukkot.</span> <span id="s29">We -- I vividly remember that we had a wonderful sukkah built in the backyard and as children we loved to go there.</span> <span id="s30">And there’s a real big connection with us because when we went back to Germany in 1996 or seven, we were able to go into the backyard of a home where in -- into the -- our old home, and the present owner said, look, there’s a platform, a cement platform that you used for some kind of Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s31">So after all these years, the cement platform of our Sukkot -- sukkah, was still there.</span> <span id="s32">And as a matter of fact, we went back this past summer to show it to my oldest son, and there it still was.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: We lived in a small town outside of Cologne that had many Jewish families, but they were interspersed in the town.</span> <span id="s35">There was no such thing as quote, Jewish neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: And what was the name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: At that time it was called Lechenich, but today it is called Erfstadt.</span> <span id="s38">And it is part of a huge county.</span> <span id="s39">There was -- there’s Erfstadt-Lechenich, Ernstadt, all these little towns are now under Erfstadt, E-r-f-s-t-a-d-t.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Do you have any memories of life before Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: What are some of your earliest memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Basically they start with when I had to go to school.</span> <span id="s44">In the town that we lived in there was no Jewish day school.</span> <span id="s45">And I started school in 1935, and for the first year, the first six months I would say, I went to the public school.</span> <span id="s46">And then the edict came down that Jewish children were not allowed to go to school any more, and I had to go to school in the town where my grandmother lived, and I had to go and live with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s47">Couldn’t live at home any more.</span> <span id="s48">In order to go to school, I moved there and went to school there.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And the name of that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: That town is called Linnich, L-i-n-n-i-c-h.</span> <span id="s51">And it was a -- maybe 45 minutes or an hour’s ride away.</span> <span id="s52">And I don’t think I was a happy camper, but being with my grandmother and not at home, it was all right.</span> <span id="s53">And I went to school there for a -- for a year.</span> <span id="s54">And then my -- my aunt and uncle also lived with my grandmother and they emigrated to Holland.</span> <span id="s55">And my grandmother went to live with another daughter and I had to go home and I then went to school in Cologne, which was a half hour, 45 minute train ride or bus ride from where we lived.</span> <span id="s56">So I commuted every day as a eight, nine year old, by train or bus to Cologne to school, on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: What kinds of things did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: I was in a Jewish day school.</span> <span id="s59">I had -- we had all Jewish studies and also all secular studies.</span> <span id="s60">And I went there through what you would call here, maybe fourth or fifth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: When you were a child going to school, what did you want to be when you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: I really didn’t know, but I was always playing around with the thought of being a pediatrician, but it never went any further than that.</span> <span id="s63">But I do have to backtrack and tell you that I was a feisty little girl, and coming off the bus one day there was this snotty little kid that called me dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s64">And I went after him and beat him to pulp.</span> <span id="s65">And after I had done that I got scared and I ran.</span> <span id="s66">And between the bus stop and where we lived, one of my father’s cousins lived.</span> <span id="s67">So I ran to his house to hide.</span> <span id="s68">But he got his dues for calling me dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s69">He never called me dirty Jew again.</span> <span id="s70">And I must have been eight or nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Do you remember other episodes of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes, very vividly after Kristallnacht in 1938, we had to leave our home and we moved into an apartment in the city of Cologne where three uncles and an aunt, brothers and sisters, all of whom were unmarried, lived.</span> <span id="s73">And it was like a two or three bedroom apartment and I don’t know how -- remember how many people piled in there.</span> <span id="s74">But now I was supposed to walk to school.</span> <span id="s75">And I think most days I did, but the teachers thought my Hebrew education was sadly lack-lacking, and suggested that I have some extra lessons.</span> <span id="s76">And my mother arranged for me to have them after school.</span> <span id="s77">Inevitably the teacher would call and ask where I was.</span> <span id="s78">And my mother said, well isn’t she there?</span> <span id="s79">And no, she’s not here.</span> <span id="s80">I was roaming the city of Cologne and there were all these stores that had the signs in the window, Juden [indecipherable], meaning Jews not wanted.</span> <span id="s81">And that’s the line I would stand on, and they were selling coffee with an eighth of a pound.</span> <span id="s82">And my grandmother, my mother’s mother, was very ill.</span> <span id="s83">She had cancer, and her only joy was a cup of coffee.</span> <span id="s84">So many afternoons I would come -- I would have stood on five, six lines and I would have come home with a pound of coffee.</span> <span id="s85">That’s where I was, standing on line somewhere or taking the streetcar and going to a bakery and pick up a piece of cake for my grandmother.</span> <span id="s86">But I never told anybody where I was going.</span> <span id="s87">I was just roaming the city and I -- I always got back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Before Kristallnacht, did you experience any other anti-Semitic verbal or physical attacks on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: N-No.</span> <span id="s90">There was a lot of discussion at home between the adults, but they tried to shield the children from it, so really, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: When you say they tried to shield you, how did they shield you?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: By not talking about any of their problems in front of us.</span> <span id="s93">It was always hush hush.</span> <span id="s94">And that’s why I have so few memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Were you aware that something was wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yes, we always lived in fear.</span> <span id="s97">We didn’t have a normal life.</span> <span id="s98">We didn’t go on vacations, we didn’t go on picnics, we didn’t go to the movies.</span> <span id="s99">It was not a normal life as you would know it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Did your family ever think of leaving Germany, even if -- I’m talking about before Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yes, my father very much wanted to leave Germany and he did have a visa application number y -- that everybody had to have, a quota number.</span> <span id="s102">But the quota numbers were very, very high for Germans at that time, and there was very little hope for us.</span> <span id="s103">We were working on it, but it didn't go as fast as you think it would.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: In the time before Kristallnacht, do you remember any book burnings, or do you remember any of the -- w -- you’re shaking your head, I can’t -- I can’t pick that up on the microphone.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Sorry.</span> <span id="s106">No, no, not at all.</span> <span id="s107">No.</span> <span id="s108">I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s109">No.</span> <span id="s110">We li -- we were sheltered.</span> <span id="s111">My parents sheltered us.</span> <span id="s112">My sister’s memories are so different.</span> <span id="s113">She remembers that she was never allowed out.</span> <span id="s114">She was younger and they kept her hidden, they kept her indoors.</span> <span id="s115">I just went out on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Is there anything else that comes to your mind about the period of time before Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Very vague, small things that I really can’t put together to make any sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Were you able to see or hear anything on Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Oh yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s120">I -- my parents, living outside Cologne, and I don’t think radios were very much in use at that time, sent me to school that day.</span> <span id="s121">And I went to school the way I usually did and when I got to the school, the -- the Gestapo or police, I don’t remember, I ca -- I still can’t tell the difference between one and the other, were standing in front of the school with German Shepherds.</span> <span id="s122">And they told us, children there is no school today, go home.</span> <span id="s123">And the school was right next door to a beautiful synagogue, and we could see that the roof of the synagogue was burnt out.</span> <span id="s124">And we went home -- we got on the train, went home, and when I got home my mother said, well, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s125">And I said, well, th-they sent us home.</span> <span id="s126">They said there was no school today.</span> <span id="s127">It must have been 11 - 12 o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s128">That time my uncle had a very good school friend who came to the house and said to my family, whatever you see or hear today, do not leave your home.</span> <span id="s129">Just don’t leave the house.</span> <span id="s130">In other words, he must have known what was going to happen and he told my uncle not to leave.</span> <span id="s131">So, around three, four o’clock in the afternoon we hear that the synagogue is burning, the fire engines ran.</span> <span id="s132">We saw the smoke from the home.</span> <span id="s133">My cr -- grandfather had been president of the synagogue for over 20 years and th -- his natural thing was to run to the synagogue to save the books, to save the Torahs.</span> <span id="s134">But my father and uncle would not let him leave.</span> <span id="s135">And we saw all this and we decided -- my grandmother at that time had a broken ankle, so her leg was in a cast.</span> <span id="s136">So my parents decided it was time to get out.</span> <span id="s137">Every other Jewish male in the little town that we lived in, ran to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s138">They were all picked up and put in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s139">My parents and my uncle and three cousins who lived in the next town over, all decided to go to Cologne.</span> <span id="s140">These are all the people that filed into this apartment.</span> <span id="s141">And a non-Jewish man drove us, my grandparents, my sister and I, drove us to Cologne.</span> <span id="s142">We had to sit on the floor of the car, and we were sitting on my grandmother’s cast.</span> <span id="s143">We were not allowed to look out the window.</span> <span id="s144">And he drove us to Cologne and that’s how we left, my parents, uncle, went to the next town over to pick up another aunt and uncle and my grandmother, who was very ill.</span> <span id="s145">And we also came -- they also came to Cologne.</span> <span id="s146">And when the man that drove us came back to the town where we lived, he was severely beaten for having driven us to Cologne.</span> <span id="s147">In that way there were many people that were very close to us.</span> <span id="s148">My grandfather was a very well-respected man.</span> <span id="s149">He did business in -- all over.</span> <span id="s150">He helped many people, he loaned them money, he set them up in business, Jews and non-Jews, and he was very well respected.</span> <span id="s151">As a matter of fact, when we went back this past summer, we went to a castle, and I think the lady that lives in the castle now is the granddaughter of the man that ran my parent’s business from 1933 to ’39.</span> <span id="s152">He was, of course, a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s153">Jews weren’t allowed to do business, and turned over all the funds to my family.</span> <span id="s154">And this lady invited us for coffee, and she also has these vague memories of things that -- my grandparents never spoke about it, a -- because my family’s grazing lands abutted the castle’s property, and they must have been very, very good friends.</span> <span id="s155">Was trying to remember, there was something I wanted to say before and I forgot it of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: What kind of business was your grandfather in?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Same business.</span> <span id="s158">What -- what -- the business consisted of my uncle and his -- my father and his brother, my uncle; and three cousins that were also brothers, had the same bus -- were in business together where my uncle would go to east Prussia to buy cattle, have it transported by train to the Cologne area, put it in this pastureland or in the stables, and then sell the l -- cattle to the dealers -- to the farmers in the area.</span> <span id="s159">S -- and my grandfather had that business and my father and uncles took it over.</span> <span id="s160">And the three brothers and the two brothers, were always in business together.</span> <span id="s161">[coughing].</span> <span id="s162">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: After Kristallnacht, what was next for you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Well, we piled into this apartment and my father, his brother and one of the cousins were terrified about being picked up and put into concentration camps.</span> <span id="s165">So for three or four nights they would sleep during the day and drive through Cologne at night in order not to be picked up.</span> <span id="s166">The only thing they did was stop for gas.</span> <span id="s167">They did this for -- well, Kristallnacht was on a Thursday, they did it Friday during the day, Friday night was Shabbat and they stayed home shab -- and they were hiding, because the m -- there were very few men around of their age.</span> <span id="s168">And they started doing this again Sunday, and I think Monday and Tuesday.</span> <span id="s169">And then they tried to go across the border into Holland, illegally.</span> <span id="s170">And of course they were caught and sent back.</span> <span id="s171">And tried -- a day or so later they tried again and they managed to get across the border, but were picked up by Dutch police that were friendly to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s172">And they informed the Nazis and they put them in prison.</span> <span id="s173">They were imprisoned.</span> <span id="s174">And as I said earlier, my uncle and aunt had gone to Holland already.</span> <span id="s175">And with the assistance of highly prominent people in Holland, that had connections to the queen, etcetera, they were able to arrange that they were not being sent -- that they would not be sent back.</span> <span id="s176">So -- and they were put into a camp, which was kind of like restricted.</span> <span id="s177">They were not allowed out, but they were not in prison.</span> <span id="s178">And they were there from November ’38 to May 1939.</span> <span id="s179">We did not see my father in all that time, we had no contact with him.</span> <span id="s180">And my mother then handled -- my mother and my aunts handled all the emigration things because after Kristallnacht, they m -- the Jews were told that they had to go and clean up the mess.</span> <span id="s181">And my mother went back and she looked at it and she said, I’ll never do that.</span> <span id="s182">The Persian carpets were on the manure heap.</span> <span id="s183">The prayer books were full of eggs.</span> <span id="s184">We still have some of them -- show you.</span> <span id="s185">And it was very, very difficult, but many -- not many, but several of the non-Jewish families came to her aid and helped her.</span> <span id="s186">And of course, food was very difficult to obtain at that time, and the people from the land would come with baskets to Cologne to bring us food.</span> <span id="s187">As a matter of fact, they knew we would only eat kosher chickens, one woman came every week with a live chicken on the bus, to Cologne.</span> <span id="s188">And two of my uncles were Shochten, they had learned that, so that way we had our kosher chickens.</span> <span id="s189">You see, we -- we weren’t -- we really did not any -- have any deprivations in that way, because people helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: You said your mother handled the emigration work, what kind of work was she doing at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Well, she didn’t do it alone, there was her sister, the cu -- and two cousins, and one of my unc -- two of ma -- of the cousin -- two of the three brothers that were cousins were still in Germany, so they all had -- worked on it together.</span> <span id="s192">But you have to remember, we had a 17 room house.</span> <span id="s193">It was fully furnished, that you could find on the street.</span> <span id="s194">Linens, clothing, everything in that house was smashed.</span> <span id="s195">There wasn’t a single piece that was left together.</span> <span id="s196">And at that time my mother went and bought a complete ha -- n-new furniture, dishes, pots, pans, housewares, linens.</span> <span id="s197">She bought everything new.</span> <span id="s198">She knew she was not allowed to take out any money when she left Germany.</span> <span id="s199">And everything she bought had to be paid to the store, had to be documented, and the same amount of money had to be paid to the German government for export tax.</span> <span id="s200">And I would say 75 percent of the stuff that she bought was on a boat to come to Africa when the British bombed it in the -- in the port of Hamburg.</span> <span id="s201">And I think if you look at the bottom, you’ll still find it there.</span> <span id="s202">So I would say 75 percent of the stuff she bought never -- never got to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Why Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: It’s a long story.</span> <span id="s205">America wouldn’t let us in and my -- one of the cousins was married to a woman who had a cousin who had, I think studied law in England.</span> <span id="s206">And he was hired by the Kenya government as an attorney in Kenya.</span> <span id="s207">And he -- and it was still relatively easy to get into Kenya.</span> <span id="s208">And he sent affidavit for 17 people.</span> <span id="s209">At the time, I think you had to deposit 50 pounds per person as an entry fee.</span> <span id="s210">And after the war started -- we arrived in Kenya on June first, the war started September first.</span> <span id="s211">After the war started that fee was up to 250 pounds.</span> <span id="s212">But we were lucky, we got in.</span> <span id="s213">My father and uncles went -- got there four weeks earlier.</span> <span id="s214">They went from Holland to England to Kenya.</span> <span id="s215">We went from Germany by train via Switzerland to Italy, and then we went to Kenya, on a German ship that served us kosher food.</span> <span id="s216">Talk about being ironic.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: What were you personally able to take with you when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: My clothes.</span> <span id="s219">That’s about it.</span> <span id="s220">Clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: No books or toys?</span> <span id="s222">A: No, they were all gone in Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Were you able to say goodbye?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s225">That was one of the saddest days of -- the saddest things that I remember, because a -- all the aunts and the uncles and any relatives and friends all came to the station in Cologne, the railroad station, to say goodbye.</span> <span id="s226">And we didn’t know that we wouldn’t see them again, but it was a very, very sad parting.</span> <span id="s227">Very sad.</span> <span id="s228">Cousins, uncles, aunts.</span> <span id="s229">It was really very traumatic.</span> <span id="s230">And of course, we never saw any of them again, except my uncle and aunt that lived in Holland.</span> <span id="s231">They were living in Holland and they got permission to come to Kenya, my parents worked on that.</span> <span id="s232">My parents arrived in 1939 and they wi -- got onto a boat in Holland the day that Hitler walked into Holland.</span> <span id="s233">They were on a boat and they were able to come to Africa in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Do you have any other memories of your life in Germany?</span> <span id="s235">Now that you’re about to leave Germany, anything else that comes to mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: No.</span> <span id="s237">I n -- you asked me if I was t -- able to take books or toys, I don’t even remember having them.</span> <span id="s238">Not because they weren’t available, but I just -- I don’t remember playing.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Going to pause and I want to flip the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Inge Katzenstein.</span> <span id="s242">This is tape number one, side B, and we have you now leaving Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: What were your -- what were your expectations about your new destination?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: As a nine year old, I don’t think I had any.</span> <span id="s246">I was happy that we would be together with my father again, and I think I was happy that we would be free to speak and run around again.</span> <span id="s247">But other -- other than that, I personally had no expectations.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did you have any regrets about leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Oh no, none.</span> <span id="s250">None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: What were your first impressions of your new home?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Lovely.</span> <span id="s253">Strange, of course, with all the flowers and greenery all year round.</span> <span id="s254">Different people.</span> <span id="s255">Africans and their living quarters and habits.</span> <span id="s256">Having to speak English, which we didn’t know a word about.</span> <span id="s257">Not being able to understand a single word.</span> <span id="s258">But that was very quickly rectified.</span> <span id="s259">I think after being there two days, we were in English schools.</span> <span id="s260">And that was very traumatic.</span> <span id="s261">New country, new school, no language.</span> <span id="s262">I was in fourth or fifth grade and I had to start again in first grade.</span> <span id="s263">And -- but it wen -- and that was very upsetting to me to be put back with the small children.</span> <span id="s264">But we learned English very rapidly.</span> <span id="s265">It wasn’t English as a second language.</span> <span id="s266">We were pushed into it, we learned.</span> <span id="s267">And every two weeks I was put up until I was with my grade level.</span> <span id="s268">And I remember that the first, second day, having to come home to learn a poem by heart.</span> <span id="s269">And not only couldn’t -- I could -- didn’t I understate it, couldn’t read it.</span> <span id="s270">And my 70 year old grandmother said, come child, I will learn it with you.</span> <span id="s271">She couldn’t read it.</span> <span id="s272">But between the two of us, we learned it by heart and by the time I got to school, I knew it by heart, but I couldn’t -- I couldn’t say it because I couldn’t -- I didn't know how to pronounce it.</span> <span id="s273">I could read it.</span> <span id="s274">I knew it by heart, but I could -- couldn’t pronounce it.</span> <span id="s275">But that -- those things were very quickly rectified and we were very happy in school.</span> <span id="s276">The children all wore uniforms so it was all -- we were all the same.</span> <span id="s277">And it worked out very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: What was your family’s legal status?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: We were enemy aliens.</span> <span id="s280">It was really ironic.</span> <span id="s281">We had left Germany -- I have to think a minute.</span> <span id="s282">We had left Germany as stateless.</span> <span id="s283">Jews were no longer considered Germans, so we were stateless.</span> <span id="s284">And we arrived in Kenya, which at that time was a British colony, and I don’t know under what quota, under what auspices, but the day war broke out, we were considered enemy aliens.</span> <span id="s285">And it was rather strange, but that’s what we were and we were enemy alien -- we were stateless until we came to America in 1947, when we came under the German quota.</span> <span id="s286">Again we were put -- at that point considered Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: What did it mean for you, for your family, to be enemy aliens?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: They laughed about it because it was so iro -- ironic.</span> <span id="s289">The -- the thing that it real -- that it meant physically was, my parents bought a very, very large farm in -- a ranch in Kenya.</span> <span id="s290">And what it came down to was we were interned on the property.</span> <span id="s291">We were not allowed to leave the property without permission.</span> <span id="s292">Any time we wanted to go to town -- every week we had to go to Nairobi, which was 20 miles away.</span> <span id="s293">We lived in the highlands in Limuru, we had to go buy groceries.</span> <span id="s294">We had to go to the police department and get permission to go to Nairobi and buy groceries.</span> <span id="s295">And -- but otherwise it was not a problem.</span> <span id="s296">But in the beginning, when we -- when war broke out, everybody was very upset and we were then declared enemy aliens and the British came with the A-African soldiers to arrest my -- all the men that had now come to freedom in Kenya, were arrested, including my 80 year old grandfather.</span> <span id="s297">And they were taken to a place of internment for security.</span> <span id="s298">And my grandmother at that point said to the British whoever he was, police officer, she said, now I want you to know something.</span> <span id="s299">We fled Germany to safety, to come here.</span> <span id="s300">I have been married to this man for 45 years and where he goes, I go.</span> <span id="s301">So if you’re going to take my 80 year old husband, I’m going to go with him, he’s not going to be alone.</span> <span id="s302">He looked at my grandmother, he says, okay, we’ll leave him here.</span> <span id="s303">And the men were there one or two nights and they came back.</span> <span id="s304">They realized what was going on and looked into their background and they were released.</span> <span id="s305">We were, at that time, still living in a ho -- in a house that my father had rented in Nairobi, and that was before we had purchased the ranch.</span> <span id="s306">Afterwards, they made it mandatory that the men help the war effort, and manage the ranches of the British that had gone to war.</span> <span id="s307">My uncle became a manager of a farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: For you as a young person, what kind of social life did you have in your new home?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: None.</span> <span id="s310">None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s311">First we lived on the farm, and my parents realized we needed to be educated, so they hired tutors for us.</span> <span id="s312">The tutors lived in, but we were much too rambunctious to stay with tutors.</span> <span id="s313">We did not -- it did not work out.</span> <span id="s314">And another thing that happened was in Africa we grew pyrethrum, which -- of which DDT is made.</span> <span id="s315">And that was a big business at that time because it was sold -- it was needed for the war effort, because America used to get its DDT from Japan, and they couldn’t get it any more.</span> <span id="s316">And my mother was terribly, terribly allergic to it.</span> <span id="s317">Her face would break out and her skin would break.</span> <span id="s318">It was just awful.</span> <span id="s319">So she could not live on the farm, and the tutor business didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s320">So my mother and my sister and I moved to Nairobi to town so we -- we could go to school.</span> <span id="s321">The first semester or so we moved to another place in Limuru, and we had to walk down a hill, cross the little river and up a hill to go to school.</span> <span id="s322">But we didn’t stay there too long.</span> <span id="s323">And my father, uncle and grandparents -- on the ranch that we bought there were two large homes.</span> <span id="s324">The three brothers and families lived in one and my father and uncle and grandparents, and we lived in the other.</span> <span id="s325">That had been the quarter -- the -- the laborers quarters before we bought the farm, and it was very, very dirty and it had no inside plumbing.</span> <span id="s326">And well, cleaned it up, and we moved in.</span> <span id="s327">And -- but after awhile my mother couldn’t live there, and we moved away.</span> <span id="s328">My father would come to us on weekends.</span> <span id="s329">And we went to school.</span> <span id="s330">First we went to Limuru girls’ school as day students, which was one of the most exclusive boarding schools there was.</span> <span id="s331">Don’t forget, we were in a British colony, and they all had boarding schools.</span> <span id="s332">Then we went to Nairobi and we went to school there.</span> <span id="s333">We went to the Nairobi girls’ high school.</span> <span id="s334">Again, very exclusive school.</span> <span id="s335">[coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s336">And we stayed there until we gra -- graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s337">And my father stayed on the farm and worked the farms and came to see us on weekends.</span> <span id="s338">In addition to that, money was not plentiful, so we had rented a home in Nairobi and my mother rented out rooms to augment her income.</span> <span id="s339">And that’s what we did for many, many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Did you have to get special permission to -- to -- to move there and have your father come visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: This was after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s344">That’s not true.</span> <span id="s345">No, this was during the war.</span> <span id="s346">I’m sure they did.</span> <span id="s347">I’m sure they did, but I don’t think it became a -- any trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Did anybody there ask you about your life in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Yes, many in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s350">There was a nice Jewish community in Nairobi and people that had been there 20 - 30 years, and yes they did ask us.</span> <span id="s351">But we were absorbed into the community, it was really -- living in Nairobi was very, very pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism there?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: No, not to my knowledge or memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Did you expect to stay there indefinitely?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s356">I don’t think my parents had that intention because there was basically no Yiddishkeit.</span> <span id="s357">There were no -- there were no -- I don’t think there were any other Orthodox Jews, except one or two families that had also come as immigrants.</span> <span id="s358">And again, it was very difficult to keep any of the observance.</span> <span id="s359">So after the war my father was anxious to leave, so that we -- that the children could at least be integrated into an Orthodox community.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: So the Jewish community that was there -- you said it was a -- it was a lovely Jewish community, where were those people from and what kinds of traditions did they follow?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Their traditions today would be con -- considered Conservative Judaism.</span> <span id="s362">Where were they from?</span> <span id="s363">From Poland, from England, from all over the world.</span> <span id="s364">From Somalia, from all over the world.</span> <span id="s365">Some were refugees like we were, others were older residents that -- I don’t know where they came from, but they had been there for years and years; they were well established.</span> <span id="s366">But most of them had Polish backgrounds, so I as -- assumption at this stage loo -- in retrospect is, maybe their parents left under the pogroms and settled wherever they could.</span> <span id="s367">That’s retrospect.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: How carefully did you follow what was going on in Germany and in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: My parents and uncle did as much as they could.</span> <span id="s370">While we were on the farm, we had no electricity, but we did have a radio that was battery run.</span> <span id="s371">It was only allowed to be used for the news, and my uncle and parents followed that very, very closely.</span> <span id="s372">They were very concerned about the people they had left behind.</span> <span id="s373">We did get some mail from them through the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s374">They did receive some packages that we had sent, but then after awhile all correspondence stopped, and they were very, very concerned, but there was nothing we could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Did you have any idea what was happening to the Jews in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: We had an inkling that things were very, very bad, but really exactly what was going on, no.</span> <span id="s377">At least -- as teenagers, we were off in another world.</span> <span id="s378">But my parents and uncles had ideas, but really didn’t know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Why don’t we pause until these sirens pass.</span> <span id="s380">[tape break] Okay, I think they’ve -- I think they’ve passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: My parents had ideas, possibly were able to read through the lines what was going on, but actually no, we did not know until after the war, what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: So when did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: What I remember -- I think I was either 16 or 17 -- the war was over in ’45, so I was 16, and at that time -- and came here when I was 17, so when we left Kenya, someone gave my father a book of pictures of the camps.</span> <span id="s384">It was a very new book and it was horrendous.</span> <span id="s385">It was a horrendous book, he wouldn’t let us look at it.</span> <span id="s386">And I remember he stood on the end of the ship, he threw it overboard.</span> <span id="s387">He could not see it, he could not live with those pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Before I have you leaving Africa, are there any other memories that you have that stand out, or any other experiences that you’d like to share?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Well, we became much happier, we went to the movies.</span> <span id="s390">We met other young people of our age.</span> <span id="s391">It was a -- it was a happier time, but cannot be compared to American teenagers life.</span> <span id="s392">And I had just graduated high school, my sister was still in school, and that’s about the time we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: And why did you leave at -- at that moment, that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: We got -- at that time we had received our visas and it was time to go.</span> <span id="s395">Trip was very long, it was seven weeks on a cargo boat, and was a long trip.</span> <span id="s396">We stopped -- we stopped in every port from Mombassa, which was Kenya, down to Cape Town.</span> <span id="s397">It was a cargo boat that took on -- was a very interesting trip for us.</span> <span id="s398">We went ashore.</span> <span id="s399">Actually, I’ve been into every port from Cairo to Cape Town.</span> <span id="s400">Coming -- coming from Germany we stopped in -- up there, and went through the Daman Isle, and round -- around Aden, we stopped in Aden and then came down, stopped in Somalia at that time, and then down to Kenya.</span> <span id="s401">And then seven years later we continued from Kenya to all the small ports.</span> <span id="s402">Port Elizabeth, Durbin, and then Cape Town, and then -- that took four weeks.</span> <span id="s403">The trip fr-from -- that -- because they stopped so much.</span> <span id="s404">And then it was three weeks up the Atlantic without a stop, to Boston.</span> <span id="s405">And at the end of that trip there was such a horrendous storm, that we were walking on the walls of the boat.</span> <span id="s406">Wasn’t a dish left in the kitchen that was whole.</span> <span id="s407">The storm was so bad outside of Boston, that a-although our tickets were for New York, they wouldn’t take us to New York, they said you have to leave in Boston, and we took a train to New York.</span> <span id="s408">And for -- for my sister and myself it was a wonderful trip.</span> <span id="s409">We did everything on that boat.</span> <span id="s410">From keeping the logs, from steering the ship, from swabbing the decks.</span> <span id="s411">We did everything.</span> <span id="s412">We had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s413">And no food.</span> <span id="s414">No kosher food.</span> <span id="s415">And we had taken some food along, and the funniest thing is, after the first day or two my mother refused to eat the bread.</span> <span id="s416">Why?</span> <span id="s417">The baker of the boat had a monkey that he dipped in the water every day and then rolled him on the deck like bread.</span> <span id="s418">It was a toy -- i-it was a pet.</span> <span id="s419">When my mother saw that, she got so disgusted she wouldn’t eat the bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: When did you arrive in the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: In February, 1948.</span> <span id="s422">Snow over the houses.</span> <span id="s423">No winter coats.</span> <span id="s424">Having lived in the tropics for seven years.</span> <span id="s425">Oh, it was cold.</span> <span id="s426">Very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Did you have any expectations about the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s429">Not really, because you know, we just took it day by day.</span> <span id="s430">Whatever we had to do, we did.</span> <span id="s431">I started school.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Queen’s Plaza, went to stenography school to become a secretary, and after a few weeks I decided I knew enough and I wanted a job and the only job I wanted was on Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s434">And I took the “New York Times” and went from -- and anything that was Fifth Avenue, I went in and applied for a job.</span> <span id="s435">I started way downtown and walked my way up.</span> <span id="s436">I think the first one I got was at 23rd Street, but I was so inexperienced, I didn’t last longer than a week there.</span> <span id="s437">So, took the “New York Times” again and started from 23rd Street up to 43rd Street.</span> <span id="s438">And finally found -- was hired in an attorney’s office, where there were two attorneys and an accountant.</span> <span id="s439">I knew nothing.</span> <span id="s440">Finally, one of the men that hired me -- they must have felt sorry for me, said, do us a favor, go back to school, and learn.</span> <span id="s441">And I did.</span> <span id="s442">I went to night school in Queens, worked in Manhattan and lived in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s443">I could have switched schools, but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s444">I was too -- too scared.</span> <span id="s445">I could have gone to college, because with the British education that we had, it was qui -- equivalent to the junior year in college.</span> <span id="s446">Didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s447">I had to work.</span> <span id="s448">We -- and I had that job for a long time and I told them I observe the Sabbath, and the one attorney said -- would come to me every aftern -- Friday afternoon, an hour before sunset and say, it’s time for you to go home.</span> <span id="s449">Which I thou -- you know, it enabled me to be home before sunset.</span> <span id="s450">I -- finally I did learn shorthand and stenography and I was able to type.</span> <span id="s451">And I used to do spreadsheets for the accountant, who was terribly fussy.</span> <span id="s452">He would hold my work up to the light and say, you erased, do it over.</span> <span id="s453">I learned to erase, he couldn’t tell any more.</span> <span id="s454">I worked there -- how long did I work there?</span> <span id="s455">A year, year and a half?</span> <span id="s456">Not -- yeah, til 1950, two years m -- year and a half, maybe.</span> <span id="s457">And by then my parents had bought a chicken farm in Vineland, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s458">And I was living with an aunt and uncle in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s459">And we belonged to an -- or -- or to a congregation there, and I made friends there and met a lot of young people.</span> <span id="s460">And didn’t want to come -- move to Vineland.</span> <span id="s461">And I somehow managed financially.</span> <span id="s462">I was on my own.</span> <span id="s463">When my parents left for New Jersey, my father -- I was renting a room somewhere on the West Side, 96th Street, and my aunt and uncle had moved to Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s464">And my father left me with a hundred dollars and he said, when that’s finished, it’s yours.</span> <span id="s465">And from that day on, I was independent.</span> <span id="s466">I got a job, I paid my room and board.</span> <span id="s467">Subway was a nickel one way, so all you need is a dollar a week for subway, and I was on my own until 1950, when I -- ’50?</span> <span id="s468">Yeah, end of 1950.</span> <span id="s469">I had met my husband in the fall of 1950 and moved -- and then moved to Vineland and became engaged in January of ’51.</span> <span id="s470">And then I st-started to work in Vineland for an attorney who came to my parents’ house and said, I hear you’re a legal secretary, can you come to work for me?</span> <span id="s471">And I did.</span> <span id="s472">And I worked for him til my first child was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Before I let you go any further, I have a few questions that I wanted to go back to.</span> <span id="s474">When you came to this country, did anybody help you?</span> <span id="s475">Any of the Jewish agencies or anything like that?</span> <span id="s476">A: To my knowledge, we went to HIAS to fill out citizen papers, period.</span> <span id="s477">We had an uncle that lived here and a cousin who owned a restaurant on 49th Street, his name was John Schwartz.</span> <span id="s478">He owned Headquarters restaurant.</span> <span id="s479">He was Eisenhower’s mess sergeant in World War II.</span> <span id="s480">He did the Berlin conference for Eisenhower and he was with Eisenhower through the entire campaign.</span> <span id="s481">And when he came back, he opened a restaurant in -- on 49th Street in New York City.</span> <span id="s482">So we had a lot of help from -- from the cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: When you came here, did anybody ask you about your experiences in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: No.</span> <span id="s485">No.</span> <span id="s486">People didn’t want to talk at that time, they didn’t want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: And how did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: It was a blind date in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s489">He lived in -- on the farm in New Jersey, and he would come ou -- he had vacation, and somebody gave me father-in-law my telephone number and he gave it to Werner and he called me and we went out and we enjoyed it, and he -- he was only in New York for a week, and he had just come out of the service.</span> <span id="s490">And he asked me for lunch the next day.</span> <span id="s491">Must have liked me, right?</span> <span id="s492">I went to lunch with him because to me it was a free lunch.</span> <span id="s493">I didn’t -- and from then on he kept writing, he kept coming to New York.</span> <span id="s494">And by the -- by the end of the year, the aunt and uncle that I lived with had also moved to Vineland, so I went to Vineland.</span> <span id="s495">And that’s when we be -- got engaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: I’m going to pause now to change tape.</span> <span id="s497">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Am I talking too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Inge Katzenstein.</span> <span id="s501">This is tape number two, side A. And you were talking about your husband courting you, but while I was flipping the tape you remembered something that you wanted to add, with respect to your experience in Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: I just wanted to say that in general we were very fortunate to be alive, because we left Germany before World War II, in June of ’39, and we were able to leave Kenya right before the Mau Mau uprising, be -- because had we stayed in Kenya we would have been right in the center of Mau Mau territory, and we -- the ranch that my parents had bought was not sold at the time, it took several years to be able to sell it, and for us to be able to transfer the funds from Kenya to here.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: While you’re talking about the -- the ranch and the funds, how was your family able to afford to buy a ranch in Kenya?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Again, my family was very fortunate.</span> <span id="s505">On May 1, 1933, one of my uncles took large sums of money to Holland and banked them in Holland, because after that it was more difficult to get money out.</span> <span id="s506">And that’s how we had funds in Holland, which were then transferred to Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: As we finished the last tape, you were telling me about your husband courting you, and can you tell me a little bit about his background?</span> <span id="s508">Is -- was he born and raised in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: No, he was born in Germany, and he -- he and his family [coughs] also left Germany in 1937 and lived in Holland until 1939, and were then able to come to America.</span> <span id="s510">He will tell it in his story.</span> <span id="s511">And they purchased a farm outside of Camden, New Jersey, and he will elaborate on that.</span> <span id="s512">And in 19 -- w-war broke out in 1942 for America, right?</span> <span id="s513">’41 - ’42.</span> <span id="s514">He was inducted into the army in 1944, again, as an enemy alien and became a citizen in the army and then was sent back overseas to Germany, first as an infantry soldier.</span> <span id="s515">He was wounded, and after the war ended he went into mini -- military government as an interpreter.</span> <span id="s516">And I think he was discharged 40 -- in 1946, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Just tell me his full name.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Werner Katzenstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: When did the two of you decide to get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: We became engaged in February of 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: And when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: September 11th, 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: And you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes, we have three children.</span> <span id="s525">Our son Michael is a hospital administrator and lives in Beverly, Massachusetts, which is the outskirts of Boston.</span> <span id="s526">Our second son, David is an attorney and lives in Highland Park, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s527">His offices are in Princeton, New Jersey, and he’s the proud father of five children.</span> <span id="s528">Michael has two children.</span> <span id="s529">Our daughter, Debbie is a venture capitalist banker in Pittsburgh, working for PNC, and she has two children.</span> <span id="s530">So we have nine grandchildren of which we are very proud.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: While you were raising them, did you also work outside the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s533">I worked as a legal secretary until David was born.</span> <span id="s534">My mother helped me take care of Michael.</span> <span id="s535">After that, I didn’t work for about 10 years and had another child, third child, Debbie.</span> <span id="s536">And when she was four years old I started to work to sell real estate.</span> <span id="s537">And for 32 years I sold real estate for, first [indecipherable] O’Reilly in Vineland, New Jersey which then later became Coldwell Banker.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: I wanted to ask you about some of the historical events that, you know, in the course of your late teens an-and -- and adulthood.</span> <span id="s539">After the war, did you follow the Nuremberg trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Not really, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Did you follow the partition debates in the U.N. regarding Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Vaguely, but not -- not -- not to an extent that I should have.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Did you follow the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Yes, yes, I think I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: What was your reaction, if you can remember, your reaction to the way it was presented to the people in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: I can’t comment on that because I don’t remember enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Did you feel that justice was done?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: You were in the United States during some of -- some very dramatic changes here.</span> <span id="s550">What were your thoughts about the Civil Rights movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: I think everybody should have civil rights and have the freedom to do and work in a manner that America was envisioned.</span> <span id="s552">And this should be freedom for everyone, regardless of color, creed or nationality.</span> <span id="s553">But it has to be a safe freedom.</span> <span id="s554">It has to be the people that -- just as a comparison that -- what I can say now is that pre-World War II and during World War II, America would not let any immigrants in -- or Jewish immigrants into the country.</span> <span id="s555">And looking at it today, which is ninet -- oh, 2001, after the terrorist attacks, God knows who’s running through America, and nobody checked.</span> <span id="s556">But a few harmless Jews were not allowed in, and I don’t know what to say any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: When did you move to Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: 19 -- January 1998.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s560">Why did you come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: My sister has lived in this area for 25 years.</span> <span id="s562">We were ready to retire.</span> <span id="s563">In addition to that, our mother was in a nursing home in Atlantic City, about which we were not too happy, and we were able to have her transferred to the Hebrew Home of Greater Washington.</span> <span id="s564">And it was quite a long trip to visit her.</span> <span id="s565">The trip from Vineland to Washington is about three hours.</span> <span id="s566">And we were retired, there was no reason for us to live in Vineland.</span> <span id="s567">Was more and more difficult to be observant Jews in Vineland, because the observant synagogues were closing.</span> <span id="s568">And this is what my husband and I wanted in our life, to have community that observes and be together with my sister and be able to see my mother, who died a year ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: When did you start working at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: I think it was April of ’98.</span> <span id="s571">My brother-in-law and sister have volunteered at the museum from before it opened, and they thought that would be a good place for us to spend some time.</span> <span id="s572">So we went down and we do translations now.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: What special insights do you bring to your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Insights.</span> <span id="s575">We were -- we feel very good about being able to translate the letters, which are heart-wrenching at times.</span> <span id="s576">They are the gifts to the museum of mostly grandchildren of people that have perished because they were not able to get out.</span> <span id="s577">And these -- and this correspondence is the grandparents writing to the parents.</span> <span id="s578">And the parents saved these letters, and the grandchildren can’t read them any more.</span> <span id="s579">Some of them are in German script that both my husband and I can still read.</span> <span id="s580">Some of them are very difficult to decipher and terribly heart-wrenching to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Have you had any unusual or dramatic experiences at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: No, not really, because we work behind the scenes.</span> <span id="s583">We don’t see the public.</span> <span id="s584">We go into the Ross building, have our little cubicle and spend our day there and go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Do you ever speak publicly about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: I used to speak to schoolchildren in -- in New Jersey, and I have done it once here because one of the teachers asked me to come to a class.</span> <span id="s587">Now, I’ve not done no s -- I have not done any s -- public speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Have you ever return -- well, you mentioned you returned to Germany since the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s590">The first time we returned to Germany was at my sister’s urging because the city of Cologne invited us as their guests for a week.</span> <span id="s591">I did not want to go but my sister said, come on, let’s go.</span> <span id="s592">And we did.</span> <span id="s593">It was a good week, it was a structured week.</span> <span id="s594">It was planned by the city.</span> <span id="s595">We were treated royally.</span> <span id="s596">But I kept looking over my shoulder to see who was following me.</span> <span id="s597">If I saw a German Shepherd, I ran.</span> <span id="s598">I was not a happy camper.</span> <span id="s599">This time we were in Europe for three weeks and we just spent four days in Germany because our son wanted to see, quote unquote, his roots.</span> <span id="s600">And he was able to fly over for four days, rent a car and we went to the town that my father was born in.</span> <span id="s601">We went to the town that my mother was born in, and we went to the town where our great-grandmother was buried.</span> <span id="s602">And after that we really had enough of the autobahn and we went on to Holland and he went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: On your second trip, the one that was not structured, ho-how did you -- how were you treated by the people that you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: The only people that we really met in Germany were hotel personnel, and we hadn’t -- th -- and then of course we were treated ex -- like royalty by the people that had the castle.</span> <span id="s605">We were also treated extremely well by the daughter of my aunt’s maid, who treated us like royalty.</span> <span id="s606">Very sweet, very nice and -- extremely nice, but these people were nice to us before.</span> <span id="s607">We didn’t meet any new ones.</span> <span id="s608">I had a -- I had an experience on the first trip which really shocked me.</span> <span id="s609">We were at a dinner planned by the city, with teachers, because at that time we had gone over and we spoke to classes in Germany.</span> <span id="s610">And one of the teachers sitting next to me, she says, I have to admit to you, my mother is a Nazi to this day.</span> <span id="s611">I was speechless.</span> <span id="s612">So anybody I saw that was my age or older, I considered to be a Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: I have to ask you about a Torah scroll.</span> <span id="s614">You have not mentioned it, but I would like you to tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s616">The two cousins that stayed behind to the very end were able to purchase a -- that -- a Torah scroll that was saved from one of the synagogues and they brought it to Kenya.</span> <span id="s617">In Kenya we used it because we had services on the holidays.</span> <span id="s618">The family had five adult males and during the war my mother ha-had many, many Jewish soldiers, from England, from Africa, from -- from South Africa, from America, that would come for rest and recuperation to our farm.</span> <span id="s619">And so for the holidays they always kept -- if they were still in Kenya, we’d always come back.</span> <span id="s620">And the Torah scroll was used in Kenya all the time.</span> <span id="s621">When we came to America, a Torah scroll was used in a small country synagogue outside of Vineland, called Brockmanville.</span> <span id="s622">And when we left the area, we took the Torah scroll with us again.</span> <span id="s623">It is not kosher any more, it cannot be used as a s -- Torah scroll.</span> <span id="s624">So not knowing what to do with it, not wanting to bury it, we donated it as a gift to KMS synagogue in Silver Spring, who gratefully accepted it and built a beautiful orann for it, and it s-stands in their bet-hamek in the small synagogue, and it is taken out once a year on Simchas Torah, when everybody dances with it.</span> <span id="s625">And I feel that is a beautiful place for it because it’s still being used for what it was intended for.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Is there anything that we have not covered that you would like to add before we conclude today?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s628">I have to say I don’t -- did I say it before about not being survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Say whatever you’d like, it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: I may have mentioned this before, that we wi -- feel very fortunate to be alive and to be able to live in freedom in America, to raise our children to be Orthodox Jews, and to be able to spend our later years of -- being to some advantage to the museum of being able to do the translations, even though they are very, very difficult at times to do.</span> <span id="s631">And some Mondays we come home quite depressed.</span> <span id="s632">But then life goes on and things get better.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Well, I’d like to thank you very much for speaking with me today and this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Inge Katzenstein.</span> <span id="s634">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Think I mentioned -- I think I was -- I repeated myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">End of Tape Two, Side
