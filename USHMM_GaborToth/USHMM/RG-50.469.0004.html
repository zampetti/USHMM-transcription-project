<span id="s203">And they wanted us to move in with them on the first floor we lived, on the groundfloor was the Sturmtruppe.</span> <span id="s204">And next door my neighbor, I didn’t know it, I went

anything.</span> <span id="s213">They kept the door open, the individual wasn’t bad, but the they were drugged or drunk or they thought, you were like... My brother had a nice store in the Neutorgasse, a fish store, and the man, who washed the floor, disappeared for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s214">Then he came back and he said: „You Jew, get out of here.</span> <span id="s215">You stink.</span> <span id="s216">I am taking over.</span> <span id="s217">“ So he took over the store.</span> <span id="s218">Naturally after two, three weeks he had to close, he had no idea.</span> <span id="s219">He thought money goes in and.</span> <span id="s220">And.</span> <span id="s221">That was of my brother, he had to get out and he tried to go away and he has been to Holland.</span> <span id="s222">And their he gave English lessons.</span> <span id="s223">He was a very intelligent man.</span> <span id="s224">He spoke quiet a few

month, he had to go in every week and after a couple of years, they took him in as a partner.</span> <span id="s231">He made that store blooming, he took from the Nordsee.</span> <span id="s232">And then he made a baking out.</span> <span id="s233">He finished an oven with three big tanks of oil and baking out, he fried it.</span> <span id="s234">There was a line around the block, at holidays a

id="s236">And when he left again for Israel, for Palestine then, the beggars came: „Why did he let him go.</span> <span id="s237">He gave us fish.</span> <span id="s238">“ So my brother said: „You can still come.</span> <span id="s239">You get the fish, anytime for nothing.</span> <span id="s240">“ And it was a big store, and it got stuff from Japan and von der Nordsee, from Holland, from Belgium, from all over.</span> <span id="s241">And that man thought, he could just sit on the desk and that’s it.</span> <span id="s242">Because one brother, his name was Issy, was sitting in Salzburg.</span> <span id="s243">And the merchandise came to Salzburg, and he sended all around Steiermark and Oesterreich the fish.</span> <span id="s244">It was a very big business.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q:

was my brother, who was secretary of sport in Israel.</span> <span id="s1627">And the first time she went alone and I said: „OK.</span> <span id="s1628">I go there.</span> <span id="s1629">“ And there it is very, no Jews there, maybe one or two, who came what I could recognize.</span> <span id="s1630">And that’s all, we just took trips and baths.</span> <span id="s1631">Three weeks we stayed there and we went to Graz twice to the graves and then went back.</span> <span id="s1632">In fact Tatzmannsdorf sent me a certificate of thousand Schillinge, that I should come back.</span></p> <p><span

very nice.</span> <span id="s1642">I really liked it and enjoyed it, even my blood pressure went down.</span> <span id="s1643">Honestly!</span> <span id="s1644">The doctor wanted to give me pills and I said: „No I am going to stay in a bath.</span> <span id="s1645">“ And I came back my pressure was down, he didn’t have to give me pills.</span> <span id="s1646">The baths are beautiful, the Kohlensaeurebaeder, shiny, clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: Yeah, they just opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: All, new everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: I forgot to ask you.</span> <span id="s1650">There was an orthodox synagogue in Graz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: It wasn’t a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1652">The synagogue was.</span> <span

orthodox, it wasn’t reformed, but they had a organ.</span> <span id="s1659">My father didn’t, they had a very good cantor there, so my father used to come in to listen to the cantor, after the orthodox.</span> <span id="s1660">And they usually used in a room of there or in the gymnasium of the public school there.</span> <span id="s1661">That was the orthodox, they didn’t had, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: But I found a note in a book, that there was an orthodox synagogue in the Gabelsbergstrasse.</span> <span id="s1663">A wooden synagogue, built by a Grazer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: Never, never.</span> <span id="s1665">There was only.</span> <span id="s1666">The orthodox mostly, the Galizianer Jews or Polish Jews had it.</span> <span id="s1667">There was only a room, never a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1668">And then when we moved, my father was many times a cantor, my brother used to go and we just used to walk over from the Griesplatz or from the Stadlgasse, where we lived last there.</span> <span id="s1669">But there was no synagogue.</span> <span id="s1670">It was just in a room or to the high holidays it was in gymnasium, because I was always sitting at the top of the climb wall.</span> <span id="s1671">And my father was always, I see him standing.</span> <span id="s1672">I was always sitting on the top of it there.</span> <span id="s1673">Before my sister was born, I grew up with five boys, I had to be worse than them.</span> <span id="s1674">Otherwise they wouldn’t play with me.</span> <span id="s1675">I was always sitting there.</span> <span id="s1676">There was no tree high enough for me.</span> <span id="s1677">Were all on top of them.</span> <span id="s1678">But there was no synagogue.</span> <span id="s1679">In fact my father was so religious, that we didn’t even eat the meat for a long time in Graz, because the man, who killed it, wasn’t a Jew.</span> <span id="s1680">Then in the latter years, then there came a Jewish butcher.</span> <span id="s1681">And then he start eating.</span> <span id="s1682">We only used to use chicken, what killed separate.</span> <span id="s1683">There were only a handful of real orthodox.</span> <span id="s1684">In fact the police, when they seen, there used to come a lot of people from Hungary, collecting money, this poor women get married, or that poor women.</span> <span id="s1685">And when the police seen, they said: „Go up to Samuel Burstin.</span> <span id="s1686">“ Oder when anybody asked for a kosher meal, they sent them to us.</span> <span id="s1687">And many times, I cooked, they thought we are a restaurant, I once told them: „We are no a restaurant, we are giving it to you for nothing.</span> <span id="s1688">“ But they, I made them once, I was a young kid I remember, scrambled egg for four eggs and they want it bigger.</span> <span id="s1689">And I said: „You are not paying.</span> <span id="s1690">That’s all we have.</span> <span id="s1691">“ The thought: „Are you a restaurant, we are paying.</span> <span id="s1692">“ I said: „We are no restaurant.</span> <span id="s1693">“ Then the latter years a restaurant came, a kosher restaurant, Hermann, in the, what was the name of it?</span> <span id="s1694">Joanneum.</span> <span id="s1695">.</span> <span

Galicia, and old Jewish families in Graz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: Oh, they were all against the orthodox.</span> <span id="s1702">Was a lot of their one the orthodox.</span> <span id="s1703">We, our family, was accepted more or less, because we were in everything they did.</span> <span id="s1704">And we did it good.</span> <span id="s1705">And we didn’t bother them.</span> <span id="s1706">In fact I went to school, there were only three Jewish kids which were taken.</span> <span id="s1707">Was a, how to you call it, a clause that they don’t take more Jews than three in that school.</span> <span id="s1708">And I was the only one, who didn’t sewed on Saturday or wrote.</span> <span id="s1709">I went to the Rabbi, Dr. Herzog, and he gave me a note.</span> <span id="s1710">My parents didn’t know for a whole year, what school it is.</span> <span id="s1711">Because they would never have let me, but I was able to walk.</span> <span id="s1712">The Entenplatz und Griesplatz was right two, three streets away.</span> <span id="s1713">Und when I told them I have a note from the Rabbi, I did everything on Sunday.</span> <span id="s1714">And there were a lot of directors, professor girls, pretty, Aristocrats or Nazi, call them whatever you want.</span> <span id="s1715">I was the one, who was invited to all of their parties, not the other two girls.</span>

home.</span> <span id="s1725">“ Because the teacher said: „Lets go home.</span> <span id="s1726">Who wanna?</span> <span id="s1727">“ And I said: „No.</span> <span id="s1728">“ So she said: „Who wants to stay with die kleine Burstin?</span> <span id="s1729">“ The called, I wasn’t to.</span> <span id="s1730">.</span> <span id="s1731">So the whole class stayed.</span> <span id="s1732">And the two Jewish girls went with the trolley car.</span> <span id="s1733">And the next day I got a big, from the teacher, the way, that the way to grow up and that the way to stick on what the way you
