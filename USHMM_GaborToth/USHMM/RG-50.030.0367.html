when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My name is Norman Belfer.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in a town in Poland called Borisov [maybe Borjislav??]</span> <span id="s16">(ph) on September 27th, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And was your name Norman at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: At birth my name was Nachman.</span> <span id="s19">It's a Hebrew word.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Can you tell me something about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: We were a family of -- we were seven children.</span> <span id="s22">I had four sisters and three brothers.</span> <span id="s23">I was the youngest, and my father and mother, also.</span> <span id="s24">My father was actually killed in Plaszow, shot by one of the SS-men with two other guys.</span> <span id="s25">My mother survived for a little while.</span> <span id="s26">She wasn't from Plaszow??</span> <span id="s27">, but she was sent -- when they evacuated all the women, she was sent to Auschwitz, and obviously she perished there.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Tell me about your parents before the war.</span> <span id="s29">What was your father doing and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: My father was an orthodox person, [but] he had an exporting business of feathers and down.</span> <span id="s31">Primarily we exported to Germany, America, Austria.</span> <span id="s32">European countries, but also to the United States.</span> <span id="s33">He was a very intelligent person and very good-natured person.</span> <span id="s34">Very charitable.</span> <span id="s35">So was my mother, very lovely.</span> <span id="s36">Great parents and great people.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Did your mother work in your dad's business, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: She helped along, especially when there were purchases, I know.</span> <span id="s39">We had different places where we used to purchase the feathers and down, and this particular town where we lived, where I was raised as a youngster, we had offices and a warehouse.</span> <span id="s40">And she sometime would help decide what price to pay for this or that.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: And tell me about -- you had four sisters and two older brothers -- can you tell something about them?</span> <span id="s42">They were all older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: One of my married sister with two children, the oldest.</span> <span id="s44">She tried to escape and hide at some friends' -- her husband had some Gentile friends, and they rented a horse and wagon to take some belongings.</span> <span id="s45">And they were supposed to go to a certain town, Csarnoviets?</span> <span id="s46">, but for some reason they were intercepted in the middle of the night, and they were all -- my sister and her husband and two children were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What was your sister's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Wilma.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Wilma.</span> <span id="s50">Was she the eldest of all of the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: And what were the three other sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: My brother -- my other sisters?</span> <span id="s54">One was ______, she also was married and had two children.</span> <span id="s55">And, as a matter of fact, one of her -- three of my sisters wound up in Piotchów (ph) from the ghetto there in Plaszow.</span> <span id="s56">And when they evacuated PLaszow, they also -- all the women were, they took my sisters and my mother.</span> <span id="s57">They sent her to Auschwitz, but my sisters wound up to be -- I heard after the war they were sent to Gdansk [or] Gdingen, where they worked in a factory where they were manufacturing uniforms for the German Army.</span> <span id="s58">But only days before the Russians came to Gdansk, they were told they're going to be exchanged with German prisoners who are -- who were captured in Sweden, there in Sweden.</span> <span id="s59">And they were put on boats.</span> <span id="s60">They gave her a quart of bread, you know, and they put them on boats, you know.</span> <span id="s61">There over 10, 12,000 women.</span> <span id="s62">They torpedoed the boats.</span> <span id="s63">And how I found out is about less than a hundred women survived.</span> <span id="s64">They kept them to clean up.</span> <span id="s65">And one of these girls I met after the war in Italy, and she was a friend of my sister, who was there.</span> <span id="s66">She saw it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: What was family life like?</span> <span id="s68">You were the youngest, were you the pet of the family, or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yes, in a way I was.</span> <span id="s70">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Were you spoiled?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s73">To a degree.</span> <span id="s74">They say I was, I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Were the sisters married when you were -- were they that much older than you, or did you live all together?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Two sisters were married; two were single.</span> <span id="s77">Still, they were young.</span> <span id="s78">I was at that time, when the war broke out, I was just under 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Did you family go on outings?</span> <span id="s80">Did you go on vacations together?</span> <span id="s81">Did you all feel very close together?</span> <span id="s82">Did you have good relationships?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: We had a very good relationship.</span> <span id="s84">We would go -- my parents would go to a resort area near Kriniza, it was a resort.</span> <span id="s85">And I remember they used to take me along, and my sisters or brothers -- I don't remember what they did exactly, you know.</span> <span id="s86">For recreation, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: There was big difference in age between you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: . . . and the next brother, so you didn't necessarily . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: My next brother was nine years older than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: So you didn't play with the brothers and sisters, or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: I did play with my two younger sisters, yes.</span> <span id="s93">And my brothers, first of all, Arthur married when I was about -- my oldest brother -- he married when I was maybe eight or nine years old.</span> <span id="s94">And he lived in Kraków the whole time.</span> <span id="s95">My brother, Maurice, eventually also lived in Kraków, born in a town on the German/Polish border called Holshov??</span> <span id="s96">(ph).</span> <span id="s97">In German they call it Koenigshuette.</span> <span id="s98">And my brothers were running -- we had two factories.</span> <span id="s99">One in Kraków and one in Holshov (ph).</span> <span id="s100">These factories were processing feathers and down for export, you know.</span> <span id="s101">I was a student.</span> <span id="s102">When I was of high school age, they had no high school in that town.</span> <span id="s103">So I lived with one of my married sisters in Kraków.</span> <span id="s104">I went to Hebrew high school for three years, and then the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Do you remember friends that you had during this period of time?</span> <span id="s106">Did you have girlfriends, because you were a teenager in high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Yes, I had many friends.</span> <span id="s108">In particular, I had one girlfriend.</span> <span id="s109">When the war broke out -- they lived in a different town, and they came to Borisov.</span> <span id="s110">And I was very fond of her, and she, as a matter of fact, when I -- I had a job.</span> <span id="s111">My parents arranged -- my father arranged a job for me to work for a German company, construction company.</span> <span id="s112">They felt if you worked for a German company, you may be -- it's a lot safer.</span> <span id="s113">So when I went there, there were also women and she was one of them.</span> <span id="s114">I knew her before, and she had also a sister there.</span> <span id="s115">And one day, it was just before Yom Kippur, you know.</span> <span id="s116">Just Erev Yom Kippur, they came, the SS men.</span> <span id="s117">Took all the women away.</span> <span id="s118">And certain men who didn't look fat or were old and some young ones.</span> <span id="s119">As a matter of fact, they also -- you know, they had lines of men and women, here and here and here and here.</span> <span id="s120">In other words, they sorted.</span> <span id="s121">And they sorted me out to go to with the ones who eventually went to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s122">But one of the supervisors, I think it was an engineer, used to bring clothes to all the SS men, to the SS men who were sorting.</span> <span id="s123">Oh, he's a very good worker.</span> <span id="s124">We were building barracks, so he put me back in the middle of the ones, you know, of the one who eventually survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Norman, I want to get back a little bit before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Do you remember hearing things about Hitler taking over, the Nazis taking over in Germany when you were growing up, starting in '33 and afterward?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes, we did hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Were you worried?</span> <span id="s130">Was the family worried?</span> <span id="s131">Were you</span></p> <p><span id="s132">01:13 wondering what was . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: I remember only one thing.</span> <span id="s134">That in school we were -- they were teaching us how to handle rifles, you know.</span> <span id="s135">Not where I went, but many high schools.</span> <span id="s136">And there was a saying going around, "We are so strong, we won't give a button," you know.</span> <span id="s137">That was -- if Germany ever comes, we won't give a button.</span> <span id="s138">But when Germany occupied, they said they didn't give a button; they gave the whole uniform.</span> <span id="s139">That was the saying, yeah.</span> <span id="s140">They actually ran over Poland within three to five days, it depends on where you lived at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Was there a lot of anti-Semitism when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: I would say yes.</span> <span id="s143">I had an experience, it's coming back to me, when I went to first grade and I was about six or six and a half years old.</span> <span id="s144">And after school, we were walking.</span> <span id="s145">I was walking with a couple of other kids.</span> <span id="s146">They told me, you know, "You're Jewish?"</span> <span id="s147">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s148">"You killed our God."</span> <span id="s149">I said, "What do you mean?"</span> <span id="s150">They said, "Yes, you did."</span> <span id="s151">So I went home, and I told my mother.</span> <span id="s152">She said, "Don't pay attention to that.</span> <span id="s153">That's not true."</span> <span id="s154">So that's the experience I had when I was very young.</span> <span id="s155">In the future when I was in high school or they call it Gymnasium, we had to wear uniforms.</span> <span id="s156">All private and public students had to wear certain uniforms, but you had a number on your left sleeve, you know.</span> <span id="s157">An insignia, which told you -- people would know if you went to one particular school or another different school.</span> <span id="s158">So I remember in the summertime you wanted to go certain places, over to the river, the Vistula river, and we had the number removed, you know, the number that was snapped on, you know, not to show that you came from the Jewish Gymnasium, you know, the Jewish high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Was that unusual or is that typical for Jewish students to go to Jewish Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Only a certain amount.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Did it cost a fair amount of money?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s163">I don't know how much, but that's where I learned some English, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s166">It started there.</span> <span id="s167">As a matter of fact, they taught German and English and Hebrew.</span> <span id="s168">And Polish, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yes, I was a very good student.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: What did you like best if you had special subject?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: I liked math and I liked history and languages.</span> <span id="s173">I was very good in languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Tell me what you remember most about your mother and your father when you were growing up.</span> <span id="s175">Is there any incident that comes to mind or feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">01:17</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: I can only say that the children were the most important to them.</span> <span id="s178">They wanted their children, obviously, to be well and well educated.</span> <span id="s179">And it was a very happy home.</span> <span id="s180">As a matter of fact, my father was successful by Polish standards at that time, and he built a house in Borisov, which was a two-story.</span> <span id="s181">It was the tallest, you know, -- tallest house, it was either two or three stories.</span> <span id="s182">It was two stories and like an attic, which there was some rooms there, you know.</span> <span id="s183">So they called it the skyscraper.</span> <span id="s184">It was a very tiny town.</span> <span id="s185">We were very respected in the community, and my father was very active in the community, you know.</span> <span id="s186">As a matter of fact, we had a telephone, number two; the police was one, and we were number two.</span> <span id="s187">That shows how many telephones you had in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Did you go for walks with your father?</span> <span id="s189">Did you talk a lot with him, and similarly with your mother?</span> <span id="s190">Was there private conversations?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s192">But I can't recall exactly.</span> <span id="s193">My father would always try to find out what I was taught in school and how much I -- how much knowledge I have acquired, you know.</span> <span id="s194">He would test me every once a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: And would your mother do something similar?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yes, but more my father.</span> <span id="s197">My mother was always busy with, you know, keeping the house in order and preparing meals.</span> <span id="s198">And when the married children would come home, it was like a big holiday with a big celebration.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Was she a good cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yes, very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Do you remember anything specific that you really loved that she made for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Do you remember any specific food that you really loved?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s205">For breakfast she used to make rice, you know, and butter and milk and sugar.</span> <span id="s206">And she had baked special little cakes that she filled with blackberries and stuff like this.</span> <span id="s207">This was -- usually she would do it Friday for the Shabbat, you know.</span> <span id="s208">And other dishes, gefillte fish and all that.</span> <span id="s209">She was a very sweet woman, but she was not a person that would like to travel, you know, except they would go to that resort, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s210">And they were come to Kraków, of course.</span> <span id="s211">My father very often stayed in Kraków.</span> <span id="s212">Most of the time, he would go there on a Sunday and come back Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: So your mother had simpler tastes than your father, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s215">Women were different, you know.</span> <span id="s216">They did not take -- did not play the same role as men.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: What do you remember when the Germans came in?</span> <span id="s218">What do you remember about the beginning of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I remember very well, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s220">What happened, I believe on the third day of the war, the Germans -- we heard there was shooting all around, you know, from distances.</span> <span id="s221">So my parents decided we should go -- we had a warehouse, and also my sister and husband from Kraków came to town, to that small town.</span> <span id="s222">And also Arthur's -- my brother, my oldest brother's wife and three children came also to Borisov (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s223">01:22 And during that time, the Germans when they came in, we were in that warehouse, and we had steel doors.</span> <span id="s224">We locked ourselves up.</span> <span id="s225">We had some neighbors and friends there, you know.</span> <span id="s226">The Germans came in town, and they start pounding these doors, you know, shooting.</span> <span id="s227">And they say to come out or else.</span> <span id="s228">"Heraus, heraus."</span> <span id="s229">Once they started shooting very heavily, we decided we'll go out because eventually they'll -- when we came out, they started kicking us, beating us, you know, to run, they showed us, to run to the square, the little square there in town.</span> <span id="s230">Only maybe a block or two blocks away.</span> <span id="s231">We had to run; even the little children we had to carry.</span> <span id="s232">Some houses we saw were burning, put on fire.</span> <span id="s233">Because wherever they didn't want to open doors and so on, they sometimes poured gasoline or whatever, and a couple of bullets ignited.</span> <span id="s234">When we were on that square, three people -- I don't know who they were -- they shot in front of everybody.</span> <span id="s235">And they left, you know, they left.</span> <span id="s236">So my parents decided not to go back to our house, we should go to the church.</span> <span id="s237">There was a church nearby.</span> <span id="s238">We felt the church will not be bombed.</span> <span id="s239">We were afraid of bombings.</span> <span id="s240">We all went to the church, and the priests there recognized my family.</span> <span id="s241">And they said, "You Belfers, you Jews, get out."</span> <span id="s242">They pushed us out.</span> <span id="s243">The other Jewish people, they told them -- they pushed all Jewish people out.</span> <span id="s244">Even Gentile people, or course, who had never seen a Jew wanted to be there.</span> <span id="s245">So we left.</span> <span id="s246">So we didn't go to our house.</span> <span id="s247">We had an uncle who lived like on the outskirts of town.</span> <span id="s248">He also had a warehouse.</span> <span id="s249">We were there one night, and they were shooting all night in the area.</span> <span id="s250">We were afraid -- everything was on fire.</span> <span id="s251">We saw fires and so on.</span> <span id="s252">Then the Germans, of course, occupied.</span> <span id="s253">They took over the police station, you know.</span> <span id="s254">And they also -- some of the Polish policemen became -- they started working for the Germans, you know.</span> <span id="s255">It was quiet for a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Can I go back a moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: When you're with your sisters and the kids and your mother and your father, as well as -- I mean, pretty much the whole family is together?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yes, except Arthur.</span> <span id="s260">Arthur was -- he left Poland to the United States on a business trip.</span> <span id="s261">And the reason he expected to leave after the Jewish holidays in September, you know.</span> <span id="s262">But he says -- he said that because it looks, the Germans, who knows what will happen.</span> <span id="s263">Let at least one of us be out, you know.</span> <span id="s264">So he left.</span> <span id="s265">He couldn't take his wife and children.</span> <span id="s266">They had passports, but he was lucky to get his wife and children out.</span> <span id="s267">What happened is in New York he met a friend who was also in the feather business, by the name of Rudy Ehrenhaus (ph), and they became partners.</span> <span id="s268">And Arthur was very upset.</span> <span id="s269">Who knows what's happening to my family in Poland, you know.</span> <span id="s270">So Rudy says, "You know, let's meet with my father."</span></p> <p><span id="s271">01:27: His father was a diplomat from the German government, not at that time, but before the World War II.</span> <span id="s272">And his father said, "You know, I have friends.</span> <span id="s273">Let me talk to a few friends.</span> <span id="s274">Maybe we can do something."</span> <span id="s275">So he met with the General Consul or Ambassador or Nicaraguan government.</span> <span id="s276">And he convinced them, he paid a certain amount of money, and they -- my brother had a picture of his wife and three kids.</span> <span id="s277">They said we can give you only passport.</span> <span id="s278">So they superimposed the wife and three kids on one picture, you know.</span> <span id="s279">And they sent the passport to Poland, and they had a problem finding, but it was delivered, I believe -- I'm not sure whether it was my mail or by messenger, the Nicaraguan government -- from the Nicaraguan government or consulate.</span> <span id="s280">Once she got the passport, she was very -- we weren't sure whether she should go or not go.</span> <span id="s281">Because that time was miserable, but it wasn't hot, like, they weren't killing people on the street.</span> <span id="s282">They may beat you up or they may have arrested some or -- whenever they arrested or shot somebody, they said oh, because there was -- some Germans were killed, you know, in the neighborhood or whatever.</span> <span id="s283">They always had excuses, you know.</span> <span id="s284">Should never happen.</span> <span id="s285">But you still could live, you know.</span> <span id="s286">Food was available, you know.</span> <span id="s287">Not everything, but nobody starved.</span> <span id="s288">But my parents didn't know -- were told you have to do what you think is right, you know.</span> <span id="s289">We would like all to go with you if we could.</span> <span id="s290">She went -- had to go to the police station, she's a Nicaraguan citizen, and the children -- they said they can't do anything.</span> <span id="s291">You have to go to Berlin.</span> <span id="s292">So they gave her a pass to go to Berlin.</span> <span id="s293">They went by train to Berlin.</span> <span id="s294">They came to Berlin, they stayed in some hotel, and she went to the German authorities to get her exit visa, you know, to Nicaragua.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">02:29:30</span></p> <p><span id="s296">[short interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: I think we have to stop and change the tape, so we'll finish the story.</span> <span id="s298">Norman, could you continue the story about your sister-in-law Rochelle (ph), she was in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Right.</span> <span id="s300">When she was in Berlin, she went to some agency where they give you exit visas, but they kept refusing.</span> <span id="s301">And only after about six months being in Berlin, they finally gave her an exit visa.</span> <span id="s302">Berlin was bombed during that period.</span> <span id="s303">They had to run to shelters, you know.</span> <span id="s304">The exit visa was to Portugal, and from Portugal they went by freight boat, you know, to Cuba.</span> <span id="s305">And my brother was waiting for them in Cuba.</span> <span id="s306">That's -- that was a very difficult trip, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Did you know that she was safely in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: We didn't know anything after she left Berlin.</span> <span id="s309">From Berlin we had communication.</span> <span id="s310">After that I don't think we had any communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: That must have been a difficult decision for her?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yes, very difficult.</span> <span id="s313">What is very unusual, she was a blonde woman.</span> <span id="s314">Didn't speak one word of Spanish, you know, and they let her through, just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: And now the whole family is in Poland?</span> <span id="s316">The rest of the family is in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Before you started that story, I was asking you about what was happening during the initial bombing when you were all trying to hide in that church with the children.</span> <span id="s319">How were the children reacting, the children of your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: We had to calm them, they didn't understand what was going</span></p> <p><span id="s321">02:03:30 on.</span> <span id="s322">They were very young.</span> <span id="s323">But three of them are in the United States, three of the children now.</span> <span id="s324">One is a graduate attorney from Harvard Law School, and he's a very successful businessman.</span> <span id="s325">And the two daughters are very lovely, very well educated, very successful.</span> <span id="s326">They have families, all have families.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: You went to your uncle's house because your parents did not think you should go back to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: The reason we didn't go to our house was too large and too obvious, you know, we felt.</span> <span id="s331">We didn't want to be -- also, my father also was very well known in town.</span> <span id="s332">We just felt to go to a different place.</span> <span id="s333">But after a while, we did move back.</span> <span id="s334">We did go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: So about how long did you stay with your uncle, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Only a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: And then you went back to the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Then we went back to the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: And was it fairly safe at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">02:05</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: It was quiet, didn't know.</span> <span id="s342">What they did is when they occupied a city, they left only a skeleton of SS men of Gestapo or whatever.</span> <span id="s343">And the Polish police became their helpers, so called, whatever.</span> <span id="s344">They worked together.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: And how bad was it?</span> <span id="s346">Did it go back to what seemed normal to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: It was almost normal, yes.</span> <span id="s348">Almost normal.</span> <span id="s349">I remember we used to go for walks, you know, with my friends and sisters, you know.</span> <span id="s350">My friends.</span> <span id="s351">On the street we lived on, we used to walk all the way to the end of town, you know, and into the areas that had agriculture, you know, gardens and so on.</span> <span id="s352">Orchards.</span> <span id="s353">Used to walk.</span> <span id="s354">In the beginning it was -- we didn't know how bad it's going to turn out.</span> <span id="s355">Nobody believed.</span> <span id="s356">Why would they -- people of military age certainly may have been more skeptical, but young or old or woman or children, nobody felt that they were going to touch anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Did you go back to Kraków to school or was school finished?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: School was finished.</span> <span id="s359">Couldn't go back to school.</span> <span id="s360">Yet to travel, you needed a special permit.</span> <span id="s361">You couldn't just travel.</span> <span id="s362">The police had to clear you.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Did your married sister who was in Kraków come to your parents' house also?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: So you were all together?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Just before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s367">When they heard it's going to be hot, war is imminent.</span> <span id="s368">All from the big city they came, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: So what did you do then?</span> <span id="s370">There's no school.</span> <span id="s371">What was your life like in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: It was very difficult, but you were only thinking at that time how to survive, you know.</span> <span id="s373">Everything else was not relevant.</span> <span id="s374">We had several families living in our house, you know.</span> <span id="s375">The children and all that, but we were happy that we can -- we hope we will be able to live through the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: What was it like to get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: You can get food, but it was more expensive, you know.</span> <span id="s378">And you can get everything, but you can get enough food not to starve.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: And was your father's business immediately confiscated, or did he have it for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Immediately confiscated.</span> <span id="s381">They put German trustees, they called them.</span> <span id="s382">Like a German work force, the name escapes me here.</span> <span id="s383">"Treuhaendler," or something, like a trustee, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And was your father able to go to work there at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: No, my father never went there because he wanted to stay with -- take care of the -- once everything was confiscated, nobody was to go there.</span> <span id="s386">However, one of my brothers, Maurice, went there.</span> <span id="s387">I don't remember why, but it could very well be that they asked him to come, you know.</span> <span id="s388">And he felt by going maybe he will get certain benefits, you know.</span> <span id="s389">In a way he did get certain benefits.</span> <span id="s390">When Borisov (ph) was -- all the Jews were taken away, you know, they didn't know where they were going.</span> <span id="s391">They loaded them up on these trucks.</span> <span id="s392">They said they're going to labor camps.</span> <span id="s393">But why were you taking little children and so on?</span> <span id="s394">You couldn't -- you wouldn't want to leave the children there.</span> <span id="s395">So everybody took their children.</span> <span id="s396">Some people refused to go, they were shot.</span> <span id="s397">And some houses, you know, where people were hiding, they burned the house down.</span> <span id="s398">So everybody had to leave.</span> <span id="s399">This happened the same time that I said the day before Yom Kippur when they evacuated the camp where I worked, which maybe 10 kilometers or 20 -- 15 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s400">They took all the Jews out of that town.</span> <span id="s401">My parents knew something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s402">They had prepared, you know, with some friends who were good friends of ours, Christians.</span> <span id="s403">And only maybe a couple of miles they lived outside town.</span> <span id="s404">They had a big orchard.</span> <span id="s405">What they did is, they were afraid -- at that time we had only three sisters, two children, my parents, you know.</span> <span id="s406">And this Polish family, they planned for us if everything -- because we heard that certain towns were being -- all the Jewish people were being taken away.</span> <span id="s407">That my parents decided and my three sisters and two children to go to that place.</span> <span id="s408">And what they did they built a bunker underground in the orchard, and they stayed there for several weeks, maybe two months.</span> <span id="s409">They couldn't take it anymore because it started to get very cold.</span> <span id="s410">At night sometimes they would go into their basement in the house, you know.</span> <span id="s411">But they were afraid, the Polish family was very afraid if they were caught, they would be killed, too.</span> <span id="s412">So this family was getting paid every week or every two weeks.</span> <span id="s413">My father had a thought.</span> <span id="s414">He says if he will pay them, who knows, one day they may get tired of them and deport them and so on.</span> <span id="s415">So we had a manager in Kraków, that's where my brother knew a Polish gentleman who worked for us for many years.</span> <span id="s416">He would go there every 10 days, every week, and pay a certain amount of money.</span> <span id="s417">We used it to buy food and whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: You mean your brother would go back and forth or this man would go?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: No, this man would go.</span> <span id="s420">He was a Christian person, so he had a little freedom.</span> <span id="s421">In addition, because he worked in the feather plant, he says he's going to buy feathers, you see.</span> <span id="s422">That area had a good production of feathers.</span> <span id="s423">So it was a good excuse.</span> <span id="s424">But after a while, one day that manager -- one night that manager would come at night or early morning.</span> <span id="s425">Late night or early morning.</span> <span id="s426">My parents would complain very heavily, they said they can't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s427">And the ghetto, there were no Jews around that area anymore, and no Jews in Kraków except in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s428">And if they found you outside the ghetto, you were -- they would shoot you or kill you, whatever.</span> <span id="s429">My brother, Maurice, was successful with this German trustee.</span> <span id="s430">He told the German trustee, "You know, you look like a very nice man.</span> <span id="s431">You've been treating me right.</span> <span id="s432">Can you do me a favor?"</span> <span id="s433">"What is the favor?"</span> <span id="s434">He says, "I have parents and sisters in hiding.</span> <span id="s435">Can we -- how can they</span></p> <p><span id="s436">02:14 get into the ghetto?"</span> <span id="s437">Because the ghetto was quiet.</span> <span id="s438">Food was scarce, but people survived.</span> <span id="s439">People would live in -- a family would live in one room, or they slept on the floors under the table, on top of the table.</span> <span id="s440">No room, you know.</span> <span id="s441">This particular German trustee said, "You know, I have friends.</span> <span id="s442">We can bring you to the ghetto, but it will cost a certain amount of money."</span> <span id="s443">So my brother says, "I don't have a lot of money, but I can give you some -- and I have some jewelry."</span> <span id="s444">You know, he sent a truck and two SS men in the middle of the night, and they arranged also -- how you call it -- code.</span> <span id="s445">If the Polish family would see a German military truck he should have -- he had a flashlight to light so they'll know where to stop.</span> <span id="s446">They took my parents and my sisters and two children to Kraków to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s447">This must have been sometime in October, November you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: In 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Let's see.</span> <span id="s450">It's '40, yes.</span> <span id="s451">[thinking] '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Do you think your brother took a chance by talking to this German?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Definitely did.</span> <span id="s454">But the reason he -- the way I understand it, took a chance, they all took bribes.</span> <span id="s455">Not openly, but they took bribes.</span> <span id="s456">As a matter of fact, the ghetto could get almost any food you wanted, but you had to pay very highly.</span> <span id="s457">How the German guards, if you paid them off, they let certain people daily, they will bring in food.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: So it was a big black market?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s460">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Now, Norman, prior to this because in some ways we've glossed over almost two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: What are you -- before you get to that camp or that company where they made barracks, what were you doing?</span> <span id="s464">Were you in forced labor for a year or two?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s466">What happened in Poland, we had in the wintertime, we had a lot of snow.</span> <span id="s467">Very cold.</span> <span id="s468">And the German trucks couldn't ride on the roads, so they had to mobilize all</span></p> <p><span id="s469">02:17 the young people in that town.</span> <span id="s470">They said we need a thousand or 500, whatever.</span> <span id="s471">And we had to go.</span> <span id="s472">They kept us there from early morning till late at night, while it was still light.</span> <span id="s473">And also in the summertime, they roads were all -- after the winter, the roads were damaged, so we worked on the roads to fix up the roads.</span> <span id="s474">You had to have volunteers.</span> <span id="s475">They would call up -- there was a Jewish community little center, you know, around the synagogue.</span> <span id="s476">They would call up the leaders there and say we need so many men.</span> <span id="s477">So we had to organize and send them so many men.</span> <span id="s478">At one time, they also said we have to have so many kilos of gold to save your town, so they collected jewelry, whoever had silver to buy them off, you know.</span> <span id="s479">It may have bought them off for a week or a month, you know.</span> <span id="s480">That's what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: So when you were working on the roads, you were shoveling snow, and then repairing roads?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Then we were patching up holes, cleaning rubble, or all that leftover, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Now, did you go back to your parents' home at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yes, at night.</span> <span id="s485">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: So you were working what?</span> <span id="s487">Ten hours a day?</span> <span id="s488">12 hours a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: I would say 10, 12 hours, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: How tough was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: How tough was this to do this work?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: It was very tough, but as long as you feel they didn't kill, you know, nothing was wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Were you ever beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Were you ever beaten on these . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s498">During that period, I've been kicked and so on.</span> <span id="s499">Nothing severely, but later years, yes.</span> <span id="s500">I'll tell you later.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Were you afraid when you were in this -- in the forced labor, were you afraid of what could happen?</span> <span id="s502">Was there a lot brutality or did it seem random to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Was a lot of brutality, but when you were in the camp already, they managed to take, make you weak and took your will away because you couldn't fight.</span> <span id="s504">You couldn't -- you had to look straight and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Are you talking about where you were working in the barrack manufacturer, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s507">You had to show, you know, you are willing to work and you're not resentful, or you're not, you know -- you have to keep a straight face.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Explain something to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: You were working on the forced labor for almost two years, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">02:20:30</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Your parents are at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: This is before they go into that hiding place?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: And your parents think that maybe if they get you into a German factory work of some kind . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: . . . that things will be better.</span> <span id="s520">You'll be inside working.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Now, how did they arrange this?</span> <span id="s525">Who did -- how did they know who to go to, or was it obvious at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: It was obvious.</span> <span id="s527">There were people in town who made, you know, if -- you had to pay a certain amount of money.</span> <span id="s528">And there hundreds, young people in particular, men and women, they felt by working there they might you.</span> <span id="s529">When I say money, I don't where they paid $100 or $1,000, I don't know.</span> <span id="s530">So they took you.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: So there were men and women working in this factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: And you lived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yes, in a barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: In a barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s537">They had barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: They did have manufactured barracks, or was that . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: We were -- they did build some barracks, but primarily what we did, unload railroad cars.</span> <span id="s540">Different materials, cement, you know, lumber and so on.</span> <span id="s541">Then I became a so-called carpenter cutting lumber and nailing, you know, some wood down to make these barracks, yeah, these structures.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Would you consider this another form of forced labor?</span> <span id="s543">You didn't . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Positively, because they didn't pay us anything.</span> <span id="s545">There's no payment.</span> <span id="s546">They fed us -- also, there they starved, they fed us twice a day.</span> <span id="s547">In the morning, you got some -- a quarter of bread and some soup, like water, you know.</span> <span id="s548">And then when we came home at night, you had just the soup.</span> <span id="s549">Some potato peels also.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Now, did you go to work for this firm in this camp-like atmosphere . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: . . . at about the same time did your parents go into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Before?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Before.</span> <span id="s556">Several weeks or a couple of months at least before.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Now, when your parents -- are you able to keep communication with your parents in spite of the fact that this is a difficult situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s559">I risked my life to see on two occasions.</span> <span id="s560">Two, maybe three occasions.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Can you explain those occasions and why you did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s563">Two reasons.</span> <span id="s564">One, I wanted to see them whether they are well and so on.</span> <span id="s565">So how I did it, and I had a cousin there, too, in camp.</span> <span id="s566">And on one occasion, yeah, he came along.</span> <span id="s567">We -- early morning, they had a sentry there, and they had reflectors, you know.</span> <span id="s568">Big lights which were rotating.</span> <span id="s569">So we watched as the light weren't there.</span> <span id="s570">Ran out of the barrack, and there were forests not far.</span> <span id="s571">Into the forest and walked, so through the forest and through the fields and it was a walk maybe an hour, I don't remember, or an hour and a half.</span> <span id="s572">That's how I saw my parents, but my cousin I didn't</span></p> <p><span id="s573">02:24 want him to come to see my parents.</span> <span id="s574">I didn't want him -- he would stop like a mile before, lay in the field.</span> <span id="s575">I was afraid if I'm caught -- if we're both caught and they torture us, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s576">I felt I would be able to take it, but I didn't want to risk him, too.</span> <span id="s577">So I would see my parents, and they said, "It's good you're working there, but we have it very difficult here," and so on.</span> <span id="s578">Another time I went with my cousin, my parents said, "We're running out of money.</span> <span id="s579">We have buried" -- my sister had a house, a small house, you know.</span> <span id="s580">She had buried some coins, some gold coins, some jewelry just in case, you know.</span> <span id="s581">So I went there with him, we dug -- in order to get it out, it was in a jar, you know.</span> <span id="s582">And when it came out, there was a Polish policeman, so we stopped.</span> <span id="s583">He said, "Hands up.</span> <span id="s584">Hands up."</span> <span id="s585">And he came close to us, but he didn't have the gun, he had a rifle.</span> <span id="s586">When we saw he had a rifle, we actually -- I don't know how my strength -- we both jumped on him and dropped him.</span> <span id="s587">And we took the rifle, we threw it away, and we ran into the fields.</span> <span id="s588">That's how it happened.</span> <span id="s589">Went back to camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Did you knock him out?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Did you knock him out?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: We may have, because he fell down.</span> <span id="s594">He was so unexpecting, he didn't hear.</span> <span id="s595">I believe I kicked him in the stomach, and my cousin pushed him, you know.</span> <span id="s596">I knew we were going to be killed, so, you know, you -- I didn't have the strength, what you call it.</span> <span id="s597">When you're really in danger, you gain extra strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: It's interesting that you both did the same thing at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Without even talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yeah, that's a reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: You went to your sister's house?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Not your parents' house?</span> <span id="s605">And where . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Well, the stuff was in my sister's house, because our house was too obvious, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: And where was her house again?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Only a few blocks away.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: And then you ran back to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">02:27</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: And did you get -- did you get these coins to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s614">I didn't go back to the -- no, I didn't go back to the camp.</span> <span id="s615">I went back to the Polish family.</span> <span id="s616">And I said, you know, since my parents are in Kraków, I'd like to go there, too.</span> <span id="s617">And I didn't tell them why, and I said I wanted to borrow some clothes.</span> <span id="s618">They had a son about my height, and I borrowed clothes, looked like a farmer, you know.</span> <span id="s619">It was in the winter, and I went by train, you know, from __???</span> <span id="s620">_______ -- that's where the place -- Kraków.</span> <span id="s621">When I got off the train -- I bought a ticket and everything -- when I got off the train, they asked for identifications.</span> <span id="s622">They didn't ask me.</span> <span id="s623">You know, they didn't ask everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s625">Let's stop and we'll take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s630">Norman, I just wanted to make sure of something.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: After you went to your sister's and got the coins and you hit this guy, and you and your cousin never went back . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Never went back.</span> <span id="s634">You see, there were fields right in the back of my sister's house, you know.</span> <span id="s635">Corn growing.</span> <span id="s636">So we ran for maybe a hundred yards, you know.</span> <span id="s637">We ran to that and we hid, and we were crawling, actually, for a while until we were far away.</span> <span id="s638">Nobody caught us.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: But by the time you went back to that farmer, your parents and your sisters had all gone, and your father and mother had all gone to Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: They had all been to the Kraków Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: So you went and asked for these clothes, they were not there?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: No, they were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">02:02:30</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Did you pay him for these clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s648">They treated me very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: So you didn't resent the fact that they wanted some money?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s651">I learned that later, I didn't know that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: So how long did you hide out in the fields before you thought it was safe. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: To go?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: I would say we were there -- it was very early morning, so we were there for maybe a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s656">But we were crawling like, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Now, what were you dressed like before you took on these farmer's clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: They had work clothes there to wear, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: So they were identifiable?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: So what did you now look like when you took this train?</span> <span id="s662">What did you have on?</span> <span id="s663">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: I had a very heavy shirt, you know, pants, very heavy pants.</span> <span id="s665">And a jacket, you know, and I had a winter hat, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Did you use the coins that you had to get on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: You didn't have to pay?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Yeah, I paid.</span> <span id="s670">I had some money you had to pay.</span> <span id="s671">Not coins, no.</span> <span id="s672">The coins, as a matter of fact, I hid them around in my socks, you know.</span> <span id="s673">There weren't many, but few, you know.</span> <span id="s674">Everything was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: But you didn't have an identification card?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: And no one asked you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Nobody asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: . . . when you went to the train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: No.</span> <span id="s681">And even more than that, after that I knew Kraków well from the railroad station.</span> <span id="s682">I went to the next trolley car, and two German SS men or Gestapo -- I couldn't tell -- they had people waiting for the trolley.</span> <span id="s683">They also asked for identification.</span> <span id="s684">About the middle of the -- they were on a motorcycle, they asked a few people and then they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: So you were very lucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Now, did you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: My hair was light, light brown, you know.</span> <span id="s689">And I had blue eyes, so maybe that helped, you know, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: And you spoke fluent Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s692">But if somebody's suspect, they could identify right away.</span> <span id="s693">Especially if it's a male, they really -- that's the first thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: What did you do then when you got to Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">03:05:30</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: I went by trolley car up to a point, and then I walked to our factory, you know.</span> <span id="s697">Before I went to the factory, I went to the manager's house or apartment.</span> <span id="s698">He was only a block or two from our factory, and he knew who I am.</span> <span id="s699">I said, "We have to hide.</span> <span id="s700">You have to find a place to hide me."</span> <span id="s701">He said, "Stay here until it gets dark."</span> <span id="s702">Then he took me to the factory, to where the warehouse.</span> <span id="s703">Made room, so between bags, you know.</span> <span id="s704">So I knew he would bring me food every day.</span> <span id="s705">I was there for several weeks.</span> <span id="s706">Maybe five, six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: And what were you doing?</span> <span id="s708">Just sitting?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Nothing, I was reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Where did you get the books from?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: He would bring me stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s714">I just -- I knew if I go out, because even I couldn't go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s715">If I go to the ghetto, go out, you know.</span> <span id="s716">My brother would have to make other arrangements.</span> <span id="s717">Didn't want to take a chance.</span> <span id="s718">So what my brother did, he met some people who were smuggling people out of Poland.</span> <span id="s719">And you have to be of a certain age, you know.</span> <span id="s720">I was the proper age, military age.</span> <span id="s721">What they did is they would bandage you up and put an Italian uniform, put you on a train.</span> <span id="s722">The train stopped in Italy, in Kraków, from the Russian front.</span> <span id="s723">And that's how people got out.</span> <span id="s724">Not many, but some.</span> <span id="s725">Unfortunately, I didn't -- I couldn't make that.</span> <span id="s726">The reason I couldn't make it, while I was lying in that warehouse, I got a dream.</span> <span id="s727">I woke already, a neighbor of mine, of ours in Borisov, she always loved me.</span> <span id="s728">She was a woman of the -- a childless woman, and she really -- I was like -- she treated me like I was her child.</span> <span id="s729">And she came to me in my dream, says, she called me "Nauchmush, Nauchmush, don't go there.</span> <span id="s730">Don't go.</span> <span id="s731">Don't go."</span> <span id="s732">She begged me, "Don't go."</span> <span id="s733">And I woke up, and I said I don't know what to do because my brother had arranged -- you know, I've said it since -- her name was Golda.</span> <span id="s734">I'm not going to go.</span> <span id="s735">The two guys who were supposed to pick me up -- this was early morning, you know, it was at dawn -- they were caught next to our office, you know.</span> <span id="s736">And they were shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s737">One was a Jewish guy, one a Gentile.</span> <span id="s738">And I found that out later, so I was just lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Did you ever have such a dream that -- a premonition type dream in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: I had another dream later after the war, and I'll tell you later about it.</span> <span id="s741">Then the manager would come around there, and sometime my brother, you know, during working hours.</span> <span id="s742">I said -- they told me about it.</span> <span id="s743">I said, "I want to go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s744">I want to go.</span> <span id="s745">I cannot stay here forever, you know."</span> <span id="s746">Going out, or maybe you can find a place where they will keep me or whatever.</span> <span id="s747">I said, "The whole family is in the ghetto, I don't want to be here.</span> <span id="s748">I have a place I want to go, the ghetto."</span> <span id="s749">So this -- when my brother went to work, he had one or two SS men with him.</span> <span id="s750">They had like two or three people walking with him to the place of business.</span> <span id="s751">He told one of the SS men, he felt maybe he could --something, through that German trustee, maybe he can help.</span> <span id="s752">He has a brother who lives out of town, and he's in the forest, but he would like to come to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s753">Can you help him?</span> <span id="s754">He said, "Of course."</span> <span id="s755">So one late afternoon after work, my brother told the guy that I arrived, I came here the other night or last night.</span> <span id="s756">He paid him something, you know.</span> <span id="s757">He took me to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s758">I gave him another -- you know.</span> <span id="s759">I had no clothes or anything, but I wore the same stuff that this fellow in the Polish family gave me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: So this was December of '42, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: And can you explain again, where -- is your brother living in the ghetto and working outside or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s764">He was living in the ghetto, working outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: And where was he working?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: In the feather factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: The same one?</span> <span id="s768">The same feather factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: The same feather factory.</span> <span id="s770">They needed -- they didn't know much how to process and manage.</span> <span id="s771">So they called him back.</span> <span id="s772">And he thought by doing that he would be saved, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">03:11:30</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Now, when these two guys picked you up, how did they treat you?</span> <span id="s775">Or the one SS, I don't know who picked you up.</span> <span id="s776">Was it one?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: One.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: One person.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Well, he said, "Where do you want to go?"</span> <span id="s780">I say, "I'd like to go to the ghetto."</span> <span id="s781">"Jawohl."</span> <span id="s782">That's all he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: That was it?</span> <span id="s784">That was the extent?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Yeah, that's the whole conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: And how did he get you in?</span> <span id="s787">What was that process like?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s790">I mean, you walked to ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: We walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: But getting inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Once you were -- they were all friends, you know.</span> <span id="s794">In other words, these guys who took people out of the ghetto to work outside the ghetto were almost all the same guys.</span> <span id="s795">They knew all the -- at the gates were friends.</span> <span id="s796">All the gate watchers, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: So there was no process?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: You didn't then get an ID?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Nothing?</span> <span id="s802">Was there a -- well, let me ask you, what happened when you first walked in?</span> <span id="s803">Did you know where your parents were and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: I knew it because my brother told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: And where were they living?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: I don't remember where, but they were living, yeah, with a relative who was in the ghetto before.</span> <span id="s807">They were originally from Kraków, and their name was Anisfeld.</span> <span id="s808">We moved in there, and there was another family, there were three families living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: And what was the space like?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: The space was -- I remember the two bedrooms and a living room, which was made a -- and even next to the bedrooms you slept on the floor, you know.</span> <span id="s811">And they had something else when we came, there was not enough room to lay down, so there was on an upper floor was like enclosed veranda, you know.</span> <span id="s812">Balcony.</span> <span id="s813">We somehow managed, whatever, we slept there, you know.</span> <span id="s814">And there was food, we ate, you know, everybody ate together, you know.</span> <span id="s815">We helped each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: What was the mood like?</span> <span id="s817">The mood of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: The mood?</span> <span id="s819">The mood was very sad, but, you know, you get used to it.</span> <span id="s820">You know you're always in danger, you almost -- well, getting used to it is very painful, but if you really took it to your heart, you couldn't survive.</span> <span id="s821">You had to be very disciplined and very strong mentally, I think.</span> <span id="s822">Because many couldn't do it; many [not] were fighting back.</span> <span id="s823">They didn't care if they got shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: What did you think of those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: It's hard to say.</span> <span id="s826">It's hard to say.</span> <span id="s827">It's just -- they just couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s828">I was in a situation once like that almost at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s829">I gave up.</span> <span id="s830">Like I say, they didn't feed us for four or five days.</span> <span id="s831">And we were on these barges, you know, from Melk to Linz.</span> <span id="s832">Then we had to walk I don't know how many kilometers, but we walked at least two or three days without food.</span> <span id="s833">So it was called the March of Death.</span> <span id="s834">I didn't even know, but I heard that after the war, you know.</span> <span id="s835">They did this in many camps.</span> <span id="s836">I don't know, half or three-quarters didn't make it.</span> <span id="s837">We were so hungry that I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s838">I personally ate grass.</span> <span id="s839">At night we had to lay down in the field.</span> <span id="s840">We had no water, nothing.</span> <span id="s841">It was -- you prayed you're dead.</span> <span id="s842">You didn't care.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Did you then understand better the people who committed suicide in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s845">Still I felt sorry for them.</span> <span id="s846">You see mostly young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Young people who committed suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s849">And older.</span> <span id="s850">But older, if you are 35, 40 is old.</span> <span id="s851">All young people who could work.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: How old were your parents when you went -- approximately at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: My father was killed when he was 55 in front of the whole town.</span> <span id="s854">I'm sorry for breaking down.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: When did that happen?</span> <span id="s856">Was that in Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: In Plaszow.</span> <span id="s858">And my father was an organizer of the brush factory, he and a brush manufacturer had a brush factory and several other factories in Russia.</span> <span id="s859">A metal factory and others that I'm not -- wasn't even aware of.</span> <span id="s860">Because you couldn't walk from one place to another.</span> <span id="s861">You could only walk where you work and to your barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Let's stay in Kraków for a little bit, because those three months are very significant.</span> <span id="s863">Were your parents glad that you came to the ghetto to be with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Was that helpful?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Yes, because they felt that outside the ghetto was more dangerous.</span> <span id="s867">There they didn't kill people unless somebody committed something crazy or if you smuggle in something.</span> <span id="s868">I know I remember two young boys maybe 12 years -- 12, 13 years old, of a friend of ours.</span> <span id="s869">They looked very Gentile, you know.</span> <span id="s870">They would get out of the ghetto, smuggle.</span> <span id="s871">There are ways of getting out.</span> <span id="s872">Either the guards let you out if they know you, because they went out to buy food and bring food and they would sell it.</span> <span id="s873">Maybe they gave the guards something, or I know of cases where they went through the sewer lines, you know.</span> <span id="s874">Which I have a long story on that I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s875">They</span></p> <p><span id="s876">03:10:00 would get out and come back and bring food in, you know.</span> <span id="s877">But these two boys were caught and shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Were there actions in the ghetto so that the Germans just came in and just took people out, and do you remember anything like that before March?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Did your parents talk about that, that they were coming in and just taking people and shooting them or taking people out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: I didn't know, I was not aware of any.</span> <span id="s882">Once you were in the ghetto, you didn't walk any place.</span> <span id="s883">You stayed in.</span> <span id="s884">Only if you had to buy some food, you know where to, so . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: So there was not work in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: No.</span> <span id="s887">Except they had some factories -- they had certain factories like the brush factory started in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s888">The reason it started, the Germans were short of brushes.</span> <span id="s889">And there was a shortage of bristle, and there was a brush manufacturer there who met with my father and my brother.</span> <span id="s890">And my father said, "You know, I heard there is a shortage of brushes.</span> <span id="s891">Maybe you should make it from feather quills.</span> <span id="s892">You know, they have large feathers, smaller feather, medium sized.</span> <span id="s893">You can make different density or softness or hard."</span> <span id="s894">So they employed 200 or 300 people.</span> <span id="s895">The same was organized in Plaszów, they had a big barrack and that's where they made brushes.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: So did you father organize it in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s897">Did he oversee it?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: He and a brush man.</span> <span id="s899">His name was Saltz.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: S-a-l-t-z?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Yes, or S-a-l-z, you know, I don't know.</span> <span id="s902">I don't remember his first name.</span> <span id="s903">Maybe Jonas, but I'm not positive.</span> <span id="s904">And we felt that if we -- in the ghetto and if you work and they'll be needing you, they will not touch you.</span> <span id="s905">So the whole family subsequently worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: How are your sister's kids at this point?</span> <span id="s907">How are they getting along in terms of not having quite as much food as they would have under normal conditions?</span> <span id="s908">What was that like for them, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: The kids were fed first.</span> <span id="s910">They were not, you know -- the parents would starve, but they would feed the kids.</span> <span id="s911">And the kids knew from five years, six years old not to yell, not to</span></p> <p><span id="s912">03:22 cry, not to -- they were brought up in such an atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: And are there two children with you all?</span> <span id="s914">Is that . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: The two children were in the ghetto, yes.</span> <span id="s916">When they evacuated, when they circled the ghetto, you know, evacuated the ghetto . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: You're talking about in March of '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Yes, March 13th, yeah.</span> <span id="s919">Children were taken away, and old people looking old were taken away -- I mean, on a different -- they had lines of people.</span> <span id="s920">Ones on one side and on the other side.</span> <span id="s921">Nobody knew why they do that.</span> <span id="s922">Maybe one goes to one camp, another camp or another ghetto.</span> <span id="s923">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s924">The children and women, they took away.</span> <span id="s925">They were all taken to Auschwitz or whatever, or Treblinka.</span> <span id="s926">And some were shot, also, in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: I saw, yeah.</span> <span id="s929">Yeah.</span> <span id="s930">I saw people lying that had been shot, yeah.</span> <span id="s931">Had gun . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Was the ghetto divided into two parts?</span> <span id="s933">There was an A Ghetto and a B Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s935">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: And were your sister's children taken during this evacuation?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: One little boy was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s938">He had a very bad cold or whatever.</span> <span id="s939">And when they encircled, they actually threw the children out through the windows.</span> <span id="s940">Just like that.</span> <span id="s941">This boy may have been three or four or five.</span> <span id="s942">I don't remember the ages.</span> <span id="s943">He had a sister who was seven or eight.</span> <span id="s944">We -- when I say "we," my parents or my sister and her husband -- she has a husband living together, too.</span> <span id="s945">My sister's husband.</span> <span id="s946">We dressed her up and they made her up and gave her high heels and it was cold there, a big coat.</span> <span id="s947">And they smuggled her into the Plaszów.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Your younger sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: No, my niece.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Your niece?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s952">But she stayed there only for a while.</span> <span id="s953">Then they took and rounded up the children, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: What do you remember about March 13th and 14th when they were liquidating Kraków and a certain group . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: What do you remember what it was like, the sounds, the smells?</span> <span id="s957">Was it chaotic?</span> <span id="s958">Frightening?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: It was very calm.</span> <span id="s960">You lined up.</span> <span id="s961">Some people went into hiding if they had bunkers or this or that.</span> <span id="s962">And since my parents and sister knew how it is to live in a bunker, they said, "Maybe it won't be so bad."</span> <span id="s963">Nobody knew how bad it's going to be.</span> <span id="s964">Why would they kill innocent people?</span> <span id="s965">Young, old, I mean no one understood that.</span> <span id="s966">But once they started marching us, you know, and they were starting to scream at us to run, to kick, and take people apart.</span> <span id="s967">You go here, go there.</span> <span id="s968">That's a tremendous -- there was a lot of commotion, a lot crying and a lot of pleading.</span> <span id="s969">They treated us -- animals wouldn't treat other animals like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: How did you analyze the situation?</span> <span id="s971">What were you thinking about when you saw all of this?</span> <span id="s972">Or were you thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: I was thinking why -- I couldn't understand why we don't get any help from outside because they saw what is happening to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s974">We all had very good relationship with friends and business friends, personal friends.</span> <span id="s975">Even relatives, there were intermarriages and so on.</span> <span id="s976">Nobody helped.</span> <span id="s977">Didn't help.</span> <span id="s978">As a matter of fact, if somebody didn't look Gentile, you had -- I would say a majority would point you out to the police or it just was impossible to understand this.</span> <span id="s979">It's very difficult.</span> <span id="s980">When you're all so run down, you know, you don't sleep normal and you don't eat and the tension, it breaks your human feelings.</span> <span id="s981">It breaks it down to an indescribable way, it's impossible to explain.</span> <span id="s982">That's what happened when we were surrounded by the German Army or Gestapo or SS, whatever.</span> <span id="s983">They all are the same.</span> <span id="s984">They had a license</span></p> <p><span id="s985">03:28:30 to kill or to beat or to spit on you, and there was no law.</span> <span id="s986">They could do anything if you're Jewish.</span> <span id="s987">But what turned out is they did -- they started with the Jewish people in Plaszow.</span> <span id="s988">But they also subsequently, you know, only weeks later, they brought in truckloads of Christian people, Gentile people.</span> <span id="s989">You know, they were different.</span> <span id="s990">And they were shooting them on a hill there.</span> <span id="s991">They made them undress, and they were beaten.</span> <span id="s992">Some of them who didn't want to, they would machine-gun everyone.</span> <span id="s993">And sometimes they made them dig their own ditches.</span> <span id="s994">They would bring them in truckloads, mostly young people.</span> <span id="s995">It was -- when we saw that, we knew this is going to be very, very, very difficult to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s997">Let's take a break.</span> <span id="s998">Are we both okay?</span> <span id="s999">Norman, before we get into -- you've explained part of the day going into Plaszów.</span> <span id="s1000">I just wanted to go back to the ghetto for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Surely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Do you remember anything about the pharmacy in Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Was there any other kinds of things you wanted to tell us about the Kraków, your few months in the Kraków Ghetto that we haven't talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: I saw misery.</span> <span id="s1008">People in the streets were begging for food, you know.</span> <span id="s1009">There were so many beggars and sick-looking people.</span> <span id="s1010">And what I really for some reason I did not go around anyplace.</span> <span id="s1011">Maybe my parents told me, you know, because they felt you're young and you're more -- they felt young people were more vulnerable because we had an experience, which I'll go back later even Borisov.</span> <span id="s1012">I can say it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: One night they were knocking on our door, and we didn't answer.</span> <span id="s1015">We lived on the second floor, you know, down below.</span> <span id="s1016">And they were knocking, then they shot into our window.</span> <span id="s1017">So my father said I'll go down and open up.</span> <span id="s1018">In the meantime, I was in pajamas in the winter -- in the back window where they had a roof, they had another small house, a roof.</span> <span id="s1019">I jumped out of that window I mean in pajamas barefoot and run down four houses down to a neighbor's house.</span> <span id="s1020">What happened is that they were picking up young people.</span> <span id="s1021">So they had a fear, whatever it is they tried to keep me away from whenever possible.</span> <span id="s1022">So I didn't go too many places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: In Kraków during those three months, what did you talk about, since you were together a good deal, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1025">We prayed and everybody prayed to God, and they said -- which brings back a story to me.</span> <span id="s1026">I was in Plaszów then back to Kraków.</span> <span id="s1027">I was in a barrack where they had a rabbi and he had three sons.</span> <span id="s1028">They were there from Hungary; I don' t know how they came there.</span> <span id="s1029">And the older son was always saying, "Gott, Gottenyou, Gottenyou [dear God]."</span> <span id="s1030">He was saying, "You Tatte," you Dad," you know.</span> <span id="s1031">He said it in Yiddish, you know.</span> <span id="s1032">"You promised me Messiah is going to come every day.</span> <span id="s1033">You promised me you will come in the morning, you will come at night, you will come at noon.</span> <span id="s1034">He isn't coming, when is he coming?"</span> <span id="s1035">So -- the Meshiach, you know, the Messiah.</span> <span id="s1036">People were so preoccupied with their trouble that they didn't discuss much except how to survive.</span> <span id="s1037">How can we protect ourselves?</span> <span id="s1038">What should we do or shouldn't we do, and so on?</span> <span id="s1039">That was most of the, you know, if you heard of a tragedy here or there.</span> <span id="s1040">You didn't hear much.</span> <span id="s1041">No newspaper, no radio.</span> <span id="s1042">For radio, you know, you got killed having a radio or a weapon.</span> <span id="s1043">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s1044">Nobody had anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: You heard rumors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: And did you hear rumors specifically about Auschwitz since it was so close to Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: No, I didn't know anything about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1049">No.</span> <span id="s1050">Even when I was in Plaszow, I didn't hear.</span> <span id="s1051">We didn't know even about Treblinka, any of these camps.</span> <span id="s1052">We only knew it after the war.</span> <span id="s1053">I didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: And did you hear about mass killings, mass shootings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: We saw when they took away kids and women and elderly.</span> <span id="s1056">People say, "Who know what's happening?</span> <span id="s1057">Never believe that."</span> <span id="s1058">Just the human mind didn't believe that this is going to happen.</span> <span id="s1059">We didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1060">The only mass killings I could see when I arrived at Mauthausen, even in Plaszów there were killings.</span> <span id="s1061">There wasn't mass killings, except when they brought in people from the outside, yes.</span> <span id="s1062">We didn't see them being -- but we knew because they took so many young people to dig up ditches, you know.</span> <span id="s1063">And they would bring truckloads of people daily, shoot -- made them undress.</span> <span id="s1064">They would beat them to undress and shoot them and bury them -- and then had to bury them.</span> <span id="s1065">I had one friend who survived.</span> <span id="s1066">He was Jew, he was shot in his arm.</span> <span id="s1067">When I say a friend, he became a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1068">I met him right after the war in Italy, and he had a left arm, he had two bullets or three bullets in they left there.</span> <span id="s1069">And I got friendly with him, he said he heard in America they have some medication.</span> <span id="s1070">He meant penicillin --</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">04:07 whether I could get -- I told him I have a brother there.</span> <span id="s1072">So I wrote to my brother and he did send some penicillin.</span> <span id="s1073">And they operated on his arm, but it was not completely useful, you know.</span> <span id="s1074">He played dead, that's how he got away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Do you remember after you marched in or were dragged into the Plaszów camp, do you remember what it was like that first day?</span> <span id="s1076">Where you went, what happened for those first few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: There was -- the dates in Plaszów?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Yes, when you first came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Oh, came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: August 13 and 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Yeah, they assigned, you know, barracks.</span> <span id="s1082">You could take along certain belongings.</span> <span id="s1083">I mean some -- but they took it away from you.</span> <span id="s1084">They took everything away.</span> <span id="s1085">And eventually they gave you -- there were uniforms, too.</span> <span id="s1086">I'm not so positive, striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s1087">I'm not sure, I know Mauthausen and the other camps, yes.</span> <span id="s1088">What happened is the same day, you know, just you live, there, whatever.</span> <span id="s1089">They assigned so many people per barrack.</span> <span id="s1090">Then they took us out, we had to carry stones.</span> <span id="s1091">In other words, Plaszów was a Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s1092">All the tombstones were split, you know, with sledgehammers.</span> <span id="s1093">And they were building roads.</span> <span id="s1094">There not enough roads in the camp, so they had my mother and my sisters, I saw them carrying stones for weeks, you know.</span> <span id="s1095">Then they organized the brush factory, we started working there.</span> <span id="s1096">It was like paradise by comparison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Now, who organized the brush factory?</span> <span id="s1098">Did you father organize it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: My father was gave the idea to the brush man.</span> <span id="s1100">My father didn't know brushes.</span> <span id="s1101">He told him we can substitute, you know, quills of poultry to make they call them Ersatz brushes.</span> <span id="s1102">Whatever Ersatz, more like fake, you know.</span> <span id="s1103">Fake brushes, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: So did they move the factory from Kraków into . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: From the ghetto into Plaszów, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Did the whole family work in Plaszów then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Including your mother and your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Yes, and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Was that unusual or did they have women working in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Was it unusual that there were women in . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: They had women and men working there.</span> <span id="s1114">You had to have a quota, you know, every day everyone had to have a certain amount of brushes.</span> <span id="s1115">What happened is my father was like a supervisor, and my brother and this Mr. Saltz, you know.</span> <span id="s1116">Since my father was very observant, very orthodox, even the supervisor had to have a quota of brushes.</span> <span id="s1117">So my sisters would make more brushes.</span> <span id="s1118">You know, they were fast, so he had his quota.</span> <span id="s1119">And one Saturday morning one young SS man, probably in his early 20s came in, and he went over to where my father and two other men were talking or reading.</span> <span id="s1120">They had a book open also.</span> <span id="s1121">I believe it was a prayer book or something.</span> <span id="s1122">He took them all three out, and he beat them severely, you know, with some kind of whip.</span> <span id="s1123">He made him walk to a point, you know, only maybe 100, 200 feet.</span> <span id="s1124">Made them undress, he was beating them.</span> <span id="s1125">It was a -- he got them help, they ripped their clothes and he shot them.</span> <span id="s1126">Just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: And you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: We looked from a distance, but not -- we went closer.</span> <span id="s1129">We maybe looked from 100 feet or 50 feet, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: So your whole family saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Yeah, we all went out when they took him, you know.</span> <span id="s1132">As a matter of fact, took a knife -- you know, they had knives there -- and I was running.</span> <span id="s1133">I was so, so upset.</span> <span id="s1134">I felt like running, but my mother and sister held me back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: You wanted to kill the SS man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1137">I didn't care if they killed me, but they said if you do that, he'll kill all of us.</span> <span id="s1138">So I didn't.</span> <span id="s1139">They stopped me, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: What happened after?</span> <span id="s1142">Went back to work, you know.</span> <span id="s1143">After work, a brother-in-law of mine was there and my brother, Maurice.</span> <span id="s1144">They were buried right where they were shot, they opened a grave, a hole.</span> <span id="s1145">Put all the three men in.</span> <span id="s1146">We measured, there were some trees nearby.</span> <span id="s1147">We measured, you know, we walked how many 20 walks this way, 10 walks, you know.</span> <span id="s1148">We felt that after the war is over, whatever, we will give them a proper burial.</span> <span id="s1149">At that time I was in Italy, you know, and we got a little established.</span> <span id="s1150">So I told Maurice, "I really want to back to Kraków."</span> <span id="s1151">So he said, "You go, I'll go too.</span> <span id="s1152">We should go get our father.</span> <span id="s1153">We know where he is, where he's lying, give him a proper burial."</span> <span id="s1154">I got a dream that night we shouldn't go because he was burned, you know.</span> <span id="s1155">They were excavated and burned.</span> <span id="s1156">I didn't dream that they were excavated, but they all were burned.</span> <span id="s1157">I shouldn't go, I shouldn't -- so I tell this to Maurice.</span> <span id="s1158">Maurice says, "Oh, they're dreams."</span> <span id="s1159">But only maybe a week later, a brother-in-law that I spoke of, he went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1160">And he had the same idea to go to that place.</span> <span id="s1161">We didn't know that he survived, but we found out later.</span> <span id="s1162">He went to that Plaszów place, he knew where they were buried.</span> <span id="s1163">He says there were all excavated and burned, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: So that was your second dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: The dream is my father came and told me that.</span> <span id="s1166">"Don't look for me because I'm on fire."</span> <span id="s1167">It's something that's hard to believe, you know, but it's hard for me to believe but it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: You must all have been very depressed after your father died.</span> <span id="s1169">It must have been very, very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Yes, very, very depressed.</span> <span id="s1171">As a matter of fact, at that time my mother told me and Maurice that she -- she said, "You know, you both are young, strong and you do everything to survive to tell the world what these murderers did to us.</span> <span id="s1172">Tell the world, you must survive."</span> <span id="s1173">And she then said, "You're the youngest," she even told me a second time.</span> <span id="s1174">"You're the youngest, you're strong.</span> <span id="s1175">You're smart.</span> <span id="s1176">You must survive."</span> <span id="s1177">You know, the reason she -- she felt after that that we had no chance.</span> <span id="s1178">No chance to survive, you know.</span> <span id="s1179">Just in addition right after, they took children out that way.</span> <span id="s1180">Or before, I don't remember before or after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: But it became clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: It became clear that this was mass murder?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1185">Why would they take children away?</span> <span id="s1186">And then</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">04:17 women, and then the men.</span> <span id="s1188">And they had a very tricky way of doing it.</span> <span id="s1189">Let's say when they organize to vacate Plaszów, they said we are going to a much better place, you know, workplace.</span> <span id="s1190">They gave us quarter of bread, a quarter of a bread.</span> <span id="s1191">And we marched to the railroad tracks, but maybe 100 feet or 200 feet before the railroad tracks, they would stop.</span> <span id="s1192">We would stop, and they would have like 20 people at a time, or 30 people at a time march to the railroad, to the boxcars, you know, railroad cars.</span> <span id="s1193">Before you enter, they took the bread away, see.</span> <span id="s1194">They did that deliberately, and I know this, the same thing when they put us on barges and so on.</span> <span id="s1195">They didn't want to have any resistance.</span> <span id="s1196">They would give you a kick or a hit and take the bread away, you know, and call you some nasty name.</span> <span id="s1197">"Verfluchter Hund."</span> <span id="s1198">Cursed dogs, you know, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: You were in Plaszów for more than a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1201">Let's see, March till probably June, July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: '44, that's March '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Did you ever see Hermann Goeth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Gert?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Goetz, Goetz.</span> <span id="s1208">G-o-e-t-z.</span> <span id="s1209">Goetz, it's pronounced.</span> <span id="s1210">Yes.</span> <span id="s1211">I saw him many times, and one time it was dark already.</span> <span id="s1212">But in the winter, you know, they had shorts.</span> <span id="s1213">He came to our work -- where the brush factory.</span> <span id="s1214">Everybody had to get up.</span> <span id="s1215">I remember I was shivering, you know, because people next to me were, too.</span> <span id="s1216">He came in, he looked around, and he walked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: What sort of a reputation did he have with most prisoners, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: He had a reputation for -- he would shoot I don't know how many people a day.</span> <span id="s1219">Just whoever was in his sight or -- he would shoot or whatever.</span> <span id="s1220">He was a very, very proud guy.</span> <span id="s1221">He was riding something, riding a horse.</span> <span id="s1222">Big, strong, vicious murderer.</span> <span id="s1223">I mean, I couldn't -- no one can believe that people can be so vicious, so sadistic to kill people.</span> <span id="s1224">If he went to look at certain sights and saw somebody talking or not working that moment or whatever, he would shoot on the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Were the other Germans like that, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Not like him.</span> <span id="s1227">Not as like him.</span> <span id="s1228">But he was -- also, once they called a roll call, you know, appellplatz there.</span> <span id="s1229">Everybody had to get out.</span> <span id="s1230">They had two or three young people, they brought them in from outside the area, the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1231">And then they picked men and women just at random, and one sister they picked of ours.</span> <span id="s1232">And they gave them 24 lashes, you know.</span> <span id="s1233">They were -- they had to remove their pants, and they would hit them 25.</span> <span id="s1234">I don't know how she made it, but was bruised for weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Which sister was this?</span> <span id="s1236">What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: This was my sister, Hindele, with a whip, you know.</span> <span id="s1238">They used it on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: On her back?</span> <span id="s1240">On the backside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: They had two guys.</span> <span id="s1242">One hit and the other one hit, just like that.</span> <span id="s1243">Two guys hitting.</span> <span id="s1244">They just picked people at random, I don't know, men, women.</span> <span id="s1245">Mostly women, if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s1246">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1247">They didn't do anything, just stayed in line like anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Was there any sexual brutality that you know about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: I don't know of any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Do you remember Jewish police in Plaszów?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: Kapos, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: What were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: They acted like policemen.</span> <span id="s1254">It's hard to tell.</span> <span id="s1255">I -- we were not as afraid of them as others.</span> <span id="s1256">They had I believe two faces.</span> <span id="s1257">When they were with the SS men, they were more severe, but, otherwise, they closed one eye.</span> <span id="s1258">But I heard that some were quite vicious, but I didn't have any experience.</span> <span id="s1259">And I think that when they were vicious it had to do because somebody was watching us, someone was telling them to do.</span> <span id="s1260">They thought they will survive.</span> <span id="s1261">You know what?</span> <span id="s1262">When they started shipping out people, you know what the first ones that they shot was all these kapos.</span> <span id="s1263">They were the first victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: You were still living in barracks -- your whole family, I mean, now without your father, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1265">But the whole is working in the brush factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: For that whole period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Until the women were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Until the women were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: But you were also living separately in barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Separately.</span> <span id="s1273">Women and men were living separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1275">Were you ever able to get together as a family except at . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: Except at work.</span> <span id="s1277">Otherwise, you couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: And could you talk to each other?</span> <span id="s1279">Could you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1281">When nobody was -- inside, nobody was watching, and we had codes, you know.</span> <span id="s1282">Everybody looked through the window.</span> <span id="s1283">The barrack had windows on side or maybe on -- yeah, on one side primarily.</span> <span id="s1284">And we had like people watching.</span> <span id="s1285">If someone would see, they had codes, you know.</span> <span id="s1286">A code say, you know, we had almost by description who was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Do you remember the code?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: I'm trying to think.</span> <span id="s1289">I can't remember, it may come back to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Was it helpful to you to have your family around, that you weren't alone?</span> <span id="s1291">Or did it . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: It definitely was helpful, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Especially my brother, Maurice.</span> <span id="s1295">I think I was a help to him and he was a help to me because we were never separated.</span> <span id="s1296">Just out of luck.</span> <span id="s1297">Nobody knew your name, they always knew your number so . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Even in Plaszów?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Even in Plaszów, yeah.</span> <span id="s1300">They had numbers, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Did you wear patches or anything in Plaszów?</span> <span id="s1302">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: I believe they had -- you put it on your clothes.</span> <span id="s1304">It was a little -- on your jacket or whatever.</span> <span id="s1305">You had to sew on a number or whatever, and maybe a star, yes.</span> <span id="s1306">The Star of David.</span> <span id="s1307">Yes, I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Now, even though you were there for a year, does it all sort of melts as if everything is the same in that year in Plaszów, or are there particular things that stand out in addition to horrible murder of your dad?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Yes, we had very little food.</span> <span id="s1310">We are hungry all the time.</span> <span id="s1311">We had to work very hard, especially with these stones, rocks.</span> <span id="s1312">They were quite heavy to lift especially if you walked</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">04:25 distances, you know.</span> <span id="s1314">And knowing also that we can't get out from there.</span> <span id="s1315">There is no -- in the ghetto we felt closed in, but there was much, much worse.</span> <span id="s1316">We saw all the barbed wire electrified.</span> <span id="s1317">Of course, some people went to the wire, you know, and they were electrocuted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Did people ever laugh, or did anything funny ever happen in such a situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: I don't remember it, but we had sometimes -- somebody would tell a story.</span> <span id="s1320">They will tell a story, you know, and people would laugh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: How did you get out your frustrations?</span> <span id="s1322">You must have been frustrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: You stopped thinking about it.</span> <span id="s1324">You think only that one day there will be light out of the tunnel, you know.</span> <span id="s1325">You had hope.</span> <span id="s1326">You always feel it's not going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s1327">That's how I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Maybe the next person, but . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Yes, you always feel it's not going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s1330">I think it's even now -- some people are more pessimistic.</span> <span id="s1331">Some are less pessimistic, and some who were very pessimistic didn't make it.</span> <span id="s1332">They couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s1333">Maybe the message my mother gave me, that also helped.</span> <span id="s1334">I wanted to survive in order to tell the world what actually happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Let's change the tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Norman, can you tell me what was the worst kinds of things in Plaszów for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Besides killing my father, I saw where the brush factory was situated, you could see truckloads of people brought up to the hill.</span> <span id="s1340">Originally, we thought maybe these were workers or whatever, but a little while later we found where all the shooting was going on.</span> <span id="s1341">And some were put on fire.</span> <span id="s1342">They were burning them or whatever, there was a smell.</span> <span id="s1343">And these were all young people, we saw them looking out.</span> <span id="s1344">Some you could see in the open trucks.</span> <span id="s1345">Some were closed, some were open.</span> <span id="s1346">This was almost a daily -- if not a daily, several times a week, you know.</span> <span id="s1347">And they were just slaughtering them like you wouldn't do it to an animal.</span> <span id="s1348">This was going on, you felt there would be no end to it.</span> <span id="s1349">You just, you know, but after a while somehow your mind becomes so dull, you don't want to think about it.</span> <span id="s1350">It just -- it's hard to picture this even by myself what I saw.</span> <span id="s1351">I can't accept that.</span> <span id="s1352">It's like a bad nightmare, but it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Does it surprise you when you think about it that you were able to take it?</span> <span id="s1354">That you could see this every day, and still have the strength to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: It does surprise me.</span> <span id="s1356">But not in the beginning, at the end.</span> <span id="s1357">It started with Mauthausen, it was hell on earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Well, why don't you describe the deportation out of Plaszów?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: How it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: On the -- when they made us go into the boxcars, after they pushed in as many as could fit in there, we didn't know where we're going.</span> <span id="s1362">We went for, I can't remember how long we traveled.</span> <span id="s1363">Not a long time.</span> <span id="s1364">And we sat there for two days or three days.</span> <span id="s1365">No food, nothing.</span> <span id="s1366">People died in the cars, you know.</span> <span id="s1367">It's tragic for me to explain, you know.</span> <span id="s1368">People died, you actually sat on them because there's no room.</span> <span id="s1369">You couldn't sit down, it was so in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1370">There was no room.</span> <span id="s1371">And what I found out not more than a year or two, maybe less than two years ago, that we were destined -- we stopped in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1372">There was no room, so they sent us to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1373">And some them, they did take off in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1374">And some they didn't; they sent to Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: And were you all men on these boxcars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: And were you able to say goodbye to your mother and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: No, they were taken away one day or one night in the middle -- or early morning.</span> <span id="s1379">They didn't show up.</span> <span id="s1380">All the women were gone.</span> <span id="s1381">They didn't have an inkling, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: So you and Maurice are in this cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1384">I even had a blade to cut, like a little saw that can cut steel.</span> <span id="s1385">And I kept it, you know, under my pants, under my shoes.</span> <span id="s1386">And I told my brother when I said, "Maybe we'll have a way of cutting out the window, the steel, or the floor when the train stops."</span> <span id="s1387">We never used it, we didn't use it because there was no room.</span> <span id="s1388">Plus I had an SS man on each side where the door was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Outside the door?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Outside.</span> <span id="s1391">Maybe where the -- I don't know it they stayed there all the time or when the train slowed down and they came to a halt.</span> <span id="s1392">You always had SS men, you heard them giving commands, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Do you remember the smells and the noise?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: The smell, noise?</span> <span id="s1395">No.</span> <span id="s1396">People were not screaming or yelling or crying.</span> <span id="s1397">No, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1398">Maybe when we were first taken to Plaszów, the women and children, yes, but later on they dulled our life.</span> <span id="s1399">They took everything out of us, you know.</span> <span id="s1400">We just were like sheep in a way.</span> <span id="s1401">We had nothing to fight with.</span> <span id="s1402">They starved out, tired out.</span> <span id="s1403">We knew if we rebelled, we had no arms.</span> <span id="s1404">They had machine guns.</span> <span id="s1405">Just whatever somebody did, some people, say, one of these SS men</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">05:07:30 would kick you or hit you, you would curse them back.</span> <span id="s1407">They pulled you out and shot you right on the spot.</span> <span id="s1408">We saw that, so everybody kept quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Did you throw away your . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: My blade?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: I have to think.</span> <span id="s1413">I must have, yes.</span> <span id="s1414">Because when we came to Mauthausen, we came there at night.</span> <span id="s1415">They undressed us completely, we had to undress.</span> <span id="s1416">Nude.</span> <span id="s1417">Not only that, we had to go on a chair or table and they looked all over your body and in your rectum.</span> <span id="s1418">In your mouth, to see if we had any -- would have anything hidden, you know.</span> <span id="s1419">Because they would find some gold, and maybe somebody may have had a diamond or a coin.</span> <span id="s1420">They didn't give us any clothes for about two days.</span> <span id="s1421">We had no barracks either; we are outdoors.</span> <span id="s1422">Then they gave us some of these striped uniforms, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Was it cold, or this was in . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: This was in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: . . . July or August?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1427">No, it was not cold.</span> <span id="s1428">At night it was a little cold, but we all were sleeping next to each other.</span> <span id="s1429">As a matter of fact, next to me was a German banker.</span> <span id="s1430">He complained to me, he was talking to me.</span> <span id="s1431">He said -- he and his son.</span> <span id="s1432">He says, "I'm not Jewish."</span> <span id="s1433">So I said, "If you're not Jewish, then why did they take you?"</span> <span id="s1434">"My son is not Jewish," he says.</span> <span id="s1435">"My father was Jewish."</span> <span id="s1436">"What about your son?"</span> <span id="s1437">He says, "He was born already Christian."</span> <span id="s1438">His son, I didn't understand it.</span> <span id="s1439">But later I learned that if you were -- you had to go like four generations, whatever.</span> <span id="s1440">He was such a nice-looking, sweet-looking man.</span> <span id="s1441">Maybe his son and I were about the same age, maybe that's the reason he talked to me and wanted his son to listen or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: You were about 23 then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1444">This was in '44, right?</span> <span id="s1445">22.</span> <span id="s1446">'44 was 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Being nude for those two or three days, that was very difficult for you and for everyone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s1449">You know, there is nothing nude.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Did you have to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: You had to go to the latrine, there was no paper, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Was there a latrine or did they make . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: There was a latrine nearby.</span> <span id="s1454">You know what some people did?</span> <span id="s1455">They tore off the end of the shirt a little.</span> <span id="s1456">And then they had no shirt after a while, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Did it feel shameful to be nude for two days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: I don't think so, no.</span> <span id="s1459">We thought they were going to kill us.</span> <span id="s1460">Then the third day or so, there were mining quarries, you know, rock.</span> <span id="s1461">They had big, big excavations, and they were blasting, mining rock.</span> <span id="s1462">We had to march down, like in form marching down to the quarry.</span> <span id="s1463">Pick up a piece of rock, you know, carry it up.</span> <span id="s1464">I don't know, you had to walk maybe like 50 stories, dump it, drop it.</span> <span id="s1465">And if somebody wouldn't carry it or complain, they would push them down.</span> <span id="s1466">They were driving us like you would drive a sheep, animals.</span> <span id="s1467">Beating on us on the way.</span> <span id="s1468">If you want to lay down for a minute to rest, you know, they're calling you all kinds of curse names and hitting you.</span> <span id="s1469">It was hell on earth, as simple as that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Did you watch them throwing people down?</span> <span id="s1471">Did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: I saw some people lying down dead when I went down, but I didn't see them actually push them.</span> <span id="s1473">Maybe I did, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1474">It's so -- but being there only about a week or 10 days, every morning you had a roll call, you know.</span> <span id="s1475">They had -- they say whoever is a carpenter, to raise their hand.</span> <span id="s1476">So I, my brother, and a number of other people raised their hands.</span> <span id="s1477">They took us out of that line and shipped us to Melk.</span> <span id="s1478">Melk by comparison was paradise, but they brought in there -- the camp had about 10,000 people, that's what I was told.</span> <span id="s1479">Ten, maybe 12, they brought in every week about 200 and always kept the same amount, you see.</span> <span id="s1480">Didn't have enough food, with no hygiene.</span> <span id="s1481">I wore the same clothes from Mauthausen to my liberation, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: So how come Melk is a paradise?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s1484">There they didn't -- there they made us go down and chute, pick up the rock, go walk up and sit it down.</span> <span id="s1485">We didn't understand what did they want from us.</span> <span id="s1486">They want to kill us, shoot us?</span> <span id="s1487">No.</span> <span id="s1488">In Melk, since I was a carpenter so-called, they took me, my brother, and how many hundreds that I saw, or thousands to a railroad station in Melk.</span> <span id="s1489">A little before the railroad, a side, tracks, you know.</span> <span id="s1490">Every morning we went to the Alps, we were there from, I don't know, an hour or two or whatever it took.</span> <span id="s1491">Maybe less than an hour.</span> <span id="s1492">And they introduced us everyone, you are going to this tunnel.</span> <span id="s1493">They divided us.</span> <span id="s1494">And the tunnels, instead of being carpenters, they made us -- they had air hammers.</span> <span id="s1495">They were drilling tunnels.</span> <span id="s1496">That's how you see my fingers are.</span> <span id="s1497">It's not from arthritis, it's from damaging to the joints always.</span> <span id="s1498">Once a section was completed, you know, we were drilling, and then they had carpenters shoring it up.</span> <span id="s1499">That's why they said carpenters, but they put me into the drilling.</span> <span id="s1500">They had shore up because the sandstone, sometime it came down.</span> <span id="s1501">They put emission??</span> <span id="s1502">plants, I saw that every day, you know.</span> <span id="s1503">You see, at least you did some work.</span> <span id="s1504">You didn't -- you felt maybe there is some hope.</span> <span id="s1505">I had two experiences there.</span> <span id="s1506">One, maybe only a few weeks, maybe four, maybe six weeks -- I don't know -- time is very difficult to measure.</span> <span id="s1507">One of the supervisors, a civilian engineer, he was always friendly to me.</span> <span id="s1508">I mean, he would say where did I come from, what I did at home, and I explained to him I was a student.</span> <span id="s1509">And how long I'm here, he</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">05:16:30 asked me questions.</span> <span id="s1511">At night going home, I told this to my brother, Maurice; we're discussing it, I said.</span> <span id="s1512">He said to me, "I saw him talking to you.</span> <span id="s1513">What are you talking -- I see he comes and talks to you.</span> <span id="s1514">He doesn't talk to anybody, he talks to you.</span> <span id="s1515">Maybe another guy somewhere.</span> <span id="s1516">See, tell him that we have friends in Vienna."</span> <span id="s1517">Because when he asked me where I come from, I asked him -- we have friends in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1518">"Who is your friend?"</span> <span id="s1519">I told him.</span> <span id="s1520">I didn't remember, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1521">My older brother knew, he was already in business.</span> <span id="s1522">He said -- we had a distribution center in Vienna, feathers and down, you know, like a warehouse.</span> <span id="s1523">This guy Phillip Frankowski?</span> <span id="s1524">(ph) was a junior partner and manager.</span> <span id="s1525">You know, he was running the show.</span> <span id="s1526">So I said, "We have a friend.</span> <span id="s1527">His name is Phillip Frankowski.</span> <span id="s1528">Would you tell him that the two Belfer brothers are working here, are alive and working here?"</span> <span id="s1529">He says, "When I go on my next weekend I'm going home, I'm going to see him."</span> <span id="s1530">I said, "I don't know where he lives.</span> <span id="s1531">I don't remember, but he probably is in the phone book."</span> <span id="s1532">He went to see him, and the guy gave him a 100 marks to buy -- he says every time when you go back on Monday morning or Sunday, whatever it was, you see the two brothers, buy them food.</span> <span id="s1533">He would bring bread, sometimes some salami, all cut up so it shouldn't be visible.</span> <span id="s1534">Sliced, I had a very small pocket or whatever.</span> <span id="s1535">Put it under my shirt, you know, and button the jacket.</span> <span id="s1536">So I would say the last six weeks, that probably made us stronger to survive.</span> <span id="s1537">You could have a little more food.</span> <span id="s1538">I met Mr. Frankowski after the war, you know, and he treated us like we were children.</span> <span id="s1539">He talked about the past, about my parents and my siblings.</span> <span id="s1540">He knew them all.</span> <span id="s1541">And after the war, he became the Commissioner of Traffic Transportation in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1542">He got a car and a driver, you know.</span> <span id="s1543">He was big person.</span> <span id="s1544">And I asked him how come -- you were in the feather business now?</span> <span id="s1545">He said he was a Socialist and he was always -- he was against Nazism.</span> <span id="s1546">And now it's a new regime, and they gave him such a high position because he helped them along during the war.</span> <span id="s1547">He would come to Italy, we would invite him.</span> <span id="s1548">We would send him packages and so on.</span> <span id="s1549">We became very, very friendly.</span> <span id="s1550">The engineer, I never met; I never knew his name.</span> <span id="s1551">Just when everyone asked -- Frankowski told me he gave him a name, but he's not sure he gave him the right name.</span> <span id="s1552">Because he tried one time to contact him and looked all over in the phone book, couldn't see it.</span> <span id="s1553">They probably, he tried in case, you know, he didn't -- he wasn't sure if maybe if Frankowski is a guy who may turn him in or whatever.</span> <span id="s1554">We were all aware of these things.</span> <span id="s1555">In other words, to protect each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: How many hours a day were you working with this air hammer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">05:20:30</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: How many hours a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: About.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: There were two shifts, so there must have been 11 hours or 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: And steady on this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Supposedly steady, but I don't think we worked half the time.</span> <span id="s1563">We also had a code word.</span> <span id="s1564">We made noise, and, let's say, we had to drill into the wall to make noise, so in order to make half stay and drill into the ground, just let it run then.</span> <span id="s1565">We say, we had a code, we say 23 or 11, we knew.</span> <span id="s1566">Or the letters A, B, C, we knew in that area we had that code.</span> <span id="s1567">It wasn't all over, it's just that group.</span> <span id="s1568">So these tunnels were like a mile long.</span> <span id="s1569">So they saw somebody coming, everybody was drilling and they walked away.</span> <span id="s1570">We took it easy, we didn't stop completely because, otherwise, they would notice.</span> <span id="s1571">They came around several times a day or every hour or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Was that painful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: It shook you up, you know.</span> <span id="s1574">It really shook you up.</span> <span id="s1575">And occasionally they would take, let's say, 10 of us, 12.</span> <span id="s1576">We had to shore up, also use I-beams.</span> <span id="s1577">You know, these steel beams.</span> <span id="s1578">It took four of us to carry one, I don't know how we did.</span> <span id="s1579">Then they put six and -- misery.</span> <span id="s1580">We had to learn how to lower, you know; otherwise, you cut your toes off.</span> <span id="s1581">Dropped, some guy got weak, you know, and we had to learn to jump back.</span> <span id="s1582">Then I got a cushy job; they made me a mechanic to this engineer after he starting bringing bread.</span> <span id="s1583">How I was a mechanic, they had these little like railroad, little cars and tunnels as in the coal mines, you know, come out.</span> <span id="s1584">I would grease the wheels, that was mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: That was your mechanical?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Mechanical, and sometimes they let me sit right out and come back.</span> <span id="s1587">I would check whether there is enough grease there, whatever.</span> <span id="s1588">That's my story there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1590">You were talking about the men with whom you were working, that you were giving each other codes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Was there also more than that in terms of friendship amongst you, not only between you and Maurice who were obviously very close . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: . . . but was there a larger with whom you were close?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Yes, there not only Jewish people there.</span> <span id="s1596">At that camp there were Gentiles and Jews and some Germans for political reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: And were you helping each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1599">During the work, yes.</span> <span id="s1600">But there were occasions, let's see, when they gave out bread, you have to be watchful.</span> <span id="s1601">Some prisoners, especially I remember there were Russian prisoners, too, from the war, they came in much later and they</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">05:24 were much stronger.</span> <span id="s1603">They would grab the bread from you, you know.</span> <span id="s1604">We hid it under your shirt, but sometimes they knock you down to grab the bread.</span> <span id="s1605">But, as a whole, no; we cooperated.</span> <span id="s1606">We all cooperated.</span> <span id="s1607">And it didn't matter whether you were Jewish or Gentile or Chinese or whatever.</span> <span id="s1608">Didn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: You were all in the same boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1611">The same boat, didn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Now, towards the end of your stay in Melk, you're getting this food, which obviously makes you somewhat stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Which you think may have helped you in the next stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: What then happened after Melk?</span> <span id="s1617">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: After Melk, they told us another lullaby, you know.</span> <span id="s1619">They said we have much work, better place to work, or words to that effect.</span> <span id="s1620">And we're going to go by boats to Linz.</span> <span id="s1621">And near Linz, big factories and we wouldn't have to work in tunnels and this and that.</span> <span id="s1622">You didn't believe.</span> <span id="s1623">It didn't make any difference.</span> <span id="s1624">I don't think we believed it, but some people may have believed it, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1625">I didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1626">Instead of boats, they put us on barges and an SS man with a machine gun on every barge.</span> <span id="s1627">They packed us up, except he has his own place.</span> <span id="s1628">And we were afraid, we were talking to each other quietly.</span> <span id="s1629">Maybe we should throw him or whatever, but there were so many other barges in back of us we thought they were going to kill us all so we didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1630">You know, they kept us on the barges, you know, slow moving and stopping and going maybe three days.</span> <span id="s1631">No food, we were drinking the water from the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: From the Danube?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: With the hand, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: What time of year is this?</span> <span id="s1635">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: I should remember.</span> <span id="s1637">Yeah, it must have been like April maybe.</span> <span id="s1638">Let's see, April -- no, yeah, it was in April.</span> <span id="s1639">It could have mid to the end of April, yeah.</span> <span id="s1640">Maybe the third week in April, because we were liberated May 5th, so approximately.</span> <span id="s1641">On top of it, we got off.</span> <span id="s1642">They chased us out of the barges, all of us.</span> <span id="s1643">"Einheitlich", means you had to -- four of them had to walk together.</span> <span id="s1644">And you were responsible, everyone was responsible for the others in case somebody runs away.</span> <span id="s1645">We start walking with no food.</span> <span id="s1646">People dropped.</span> <span id="s1647">I mean, they just sat down or they fell down.</span> <span id="s1648">Couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1649">Whoever can't walk, they pull you into a trench off the road.</span> <span id="s1650">They shot you or you died, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1651">And the trucks were in the back of the marches, and they put them on the truck, loaded them up one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s1652">The last day -- it must have been two days later -- first of all, we slept at night when it got dark wherever, in a field there.</span> <span id="s1653">We were so starved and so thirsty, we ate actually pulled grass and we ate grass.</span> <span id="s1654">You couldn't raise your head.</span> <span id="s1655">If you raised your head, you hear bullets flying.</span> <span id="s1656">And get up early morning.</span> <span id="s1657">Again, no food, nothing.</span> <span id="s1658">We have to walk.</span> <span id="s1659">We ask, "Where are we going?"</span> <span id="s1660">They'll say, "Shut up, you Hund, you."</span> <span id="s1661">Everyone was a dog to them.</span> <span id="s1662">Some place they'll say you verfluchter Jude, you know.</span> <span id="s1663">Cursed Jew or verfluchter Hund or whatever.</span> <span id="s1664">They could say that to any -- well, Christians.</span> <span id="s1665">Well, there you didn't even know who was Christian or Jewish.</span> <span id="s1666">By appearance you couldn't even tell.</span> <span id="s1667">We all lost so much weight, you couldn't . . .5:28</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Norman, excuse me.</span> <span id="s1669">We have to change tapes.</span> <span id="s1670">Norman, you said towards the end of the march you were eating grass.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Did you actually keep it down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: You swallowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: You didn't throw up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: No.</span> <span id="s1678">I didn't eat a lot.</span> <span id="s1679">I ate I don't know how much, but I didn't know what else to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: What were those last few days of that march like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: That march maybe a few hours away from Ebebsee or half a day, you know, I told my brother I can't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s1682">I just -- I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1683">He said, "Norman, don't do that.</span> <span id="s1684">Don't do it.</span> <span id="s1685">We lasted till now, we'll make it."</span> <span id="s1686">I said, "I don't believe we'll make it."</span> <span id="s1687">I threw myself down on the road, you know, and I knew they're going to kill me.</span> <span id="s1688">Two guys, two German SS came.</span> <span id="s1689">One took me by my arms, and one -- threw me to the ditch.</span> <span id="s1690">When the truck came, they picked me up and threw me on top of the truck, you know.</span> <span id="s1691">Just like that on top of other people and dead people.</span> <span id="s1692">Maybe a half hour later or 10 minutes later, I don't know, they threw my brother on top of the truck.</span> <span id="s1693">They didn't shoot us.</span> <span id="s1694">They took us to a camp and put us in a barrack.</span> <span id="s1695">There's no place to sleep.</span> <span id="s1696">They barely had places to sit.</span> <span id="s1697">They did give you soup, only once a day.</span> <span id="s1698">The soup was potato peels and hot water.</span> <span id="s1699">If you were lucky, you had a lot of potato peels.</span> <span id="s1700">And one morning -- usually they would wake us at down, you know, 5 o'clock, whatever -- they woke us like 3:00 in the morning, 4:00 in the morning, I don't know what time.</span> <span id="s1701">Nobody had a watch, but it was very early morning.</span> <span id="s1702">Zellappell call, they called it.</span> <span id="s1703">You had to go that square.</span> <span id="s1704">Every camp had a square where all the prisoners would gather.</span> <span id="s1705">They would count, also, everybody.</span> <span id="s1706">You had to stand a certain way and with a certain group.</span> <span id="s1707">Always the same people.</span> <span id="s1708">Sometimes we get lost, you know.</span> <span id="s1709">If they recognized it, it was a big, big -- you know.</span> <span id="s1710">On loudspeakers they said you know fellow Haeftlinge is prisoner.</span> <span id="s1711">Haeftlinge.</span> <span id="s1712">The enemy is nearby and for your safety because they may bomb us, we will all go to work to the tunnels.</span> <span id="s1713">They [in] Ebensee also had tunnels.</span> <span id="s1714">People started yelling, "No, we are not going.</span> <span id="s1715">"Wir gehen nicht" We are not going."</span> <span id="s1716">They started to shoot at us, the sentries.</span> <span id="s1717">Machine gun.</span> <span id="s1718">I don't know how many they killed.</span> <span id="s1719">I and my brother and a few friends, we went under -- we were close to a barrack.</span> <span id="s1720">We ran under the barrack.</span> <span id="s1721">And from one barrack, we went underneath to another and we hid there.</span> <span id="s1722">We hid for several hours.</span> <span id="s1723">I don't know how many hours.</span> <span id="s1724">We were afraid to get out because nobody was in the street.</span> <span id="s1725">Like deserted.</span> <span id="s1726">We didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1727">They night shift, I learned after, who wasn't in the tunnels, they blew up all the people.</span> <span id="s1728">So consequently if we would have gone there, they would have blown us up.</span> <span id="s1729">They didn't want to leave too much, what do you call, too much for the enemy to see.</span> <span id="s1730">They tried to hide.</span> <span id="s1731">Then we heard on the loudspeaker in English and German and Polish and Italian and French because all nationalities were there.</span> <span id="s1732">This is the U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s1733">Everyone who was in hiding or in barracks to come out.</span> <span id="s1734">We didn't believe it, we stayed.</span> <span id="s1735">Then we saw a U.S. tank, so my brother and two other guys were hiding.</span> <span id="s1736">We were all [inaudible] don't believe it.</span> <span id="s1737">Probably fake, you know.</span> <span id="s1738">Don't believe it.</span> <span id="s1739">Then we waited another, I don't know, a few minutes or half-hour.</span> <span id="s1740">We saw people start walking the streets, the prisoners, you know.</span> <span id="s1741">So we got out, so there were -- on the road there were American soldiers saying there's a kitchen, you know, they spoke in German, English, any language.</span> <span id="s1742">"There's a kitchen down near the SS kitchen.</span> <span id="s1743">We are serving food.</span> <span id="s1744">We know you're hungry."</span> <span id="s1745">So, of course, we went down and stood in line, they had many lines.</span> <span id="s1746">I took -- they gave you a dish, too.</span> <span id="s1747">So I got my food.</span> <span id="s1748">My brother got his food.</span> <span id="s1749">We went to the side and ate.</span> <span id="s1750">And then we went in the next line again, and that was very unfortunate.</span> <span id="s1751">People who went several times did not make it.</span> <span id="s1752">They actually died of diarrhea and everything else.</span> <span id="s1753">It's a pity that the army did not know that, you know.</span> <span id="s1754">It's unfortunate.</span> <span id="s1755">I did not take sick.</span> <span id="s1756">My brother was a little sick, but he pulled through.</span> <span id="s1757">He was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: Did you feel like you were liberated, or was that . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: You didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1760">It took a while.</span> <span id="s1761">No, it took a while.</span> <span id="s1762">The only thing I remember, we went to town and to a coffee shop outside, you know.</span> <span id="s1763">So I remember maybe there were four, six, eight -- I don't know, we were walking.</span> <span id="s1764">We sat down at a couple of tables.</span> <span id="s1765">We ordered bread, all kinds of food.</span> <span id="s1766">Coffee.</span> <span id="s1767">Then we got up, we said, "Hitler will pay," you know, we told them.</span> <span id="s1768">They knew the way we looked, the way we were dressed, still in these prisoners' clothes.</span> <span id="s1769">Then we decided to go Salzburg.</span> <span id="s1770">In Salzburg there were many displaced people in different camps came there, and we took over a military place where they have soldiers.</span> <span id="s1771">Probably they gave it to us.</span> <span id="s1772">And there they had a kitchen, your own kitchen where you could eat.</span> <span id="s1773">They gave you food.</span> <span id="s1774">And you could also sleep there.</span> <span id="s1775">They had no mattresses, maybe a few, but you slept on the floor, you know.</span> <span id="s1776">And one day in that place they had some notices.</span> <span id="s1777">Anyone who wants to go to Israel to come to this square between street so-and-so, between streets.</span> <span id="s1778">When I and my brother heard about it, of course, we want to go to Israel and many others.</span> <span id="s1779">So there were many volunteers.</span> <span id="s1780">What happened is the Jewish soldiers who served in the British Army came with trucks and they took as many at that time, maybe four, five, six trucks -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s1781">They took us through the Brenner Pass to Bolzano.</span> <span id="s1782">And then we went on trains.</span> <span id="s1783">There were some trains, commercial train, to Modena.</span> <span id="s1784">In Modena, we were like five weeks.</span> <span id="s1785">And we kept asking, "Why, we want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1786">What are we going to do in Italy?"</span> <span id="s1787">So they told us very politely and explained that the British Army intercepts every boat, and young people are taken off the boat.</span> <span id="s1788">If you are either ill or very old, you know, or sick, whatever, you can go -- and women, yes.</span> <span id="s1789">They took women and very old people, actually.</span> <span id="s1790">Very few men or no men except when they're really sick.</span> <span id="s1791">During that period, we contacted our brother, Arthur, who was in New York.</span> <span id="s1792">We didn't remember his -- we remembered only Hotel Broadway and I got friendly -- I don't know -- it had to do with UNRRA, you know.</span> <span id="s1793">There was -- no, this happened even in Salzburg, American officers, they used to come around.</span> <span id="s1794">I told them I have a brother and so on.</span> <span id="s1795">They talked to different people in their experience.</span> <span id="s1796">This particular guy was from Chicago.</span> <span id="s1797">I told him we had a brother in New York, but I don't know how to contact him.</span> <span id="s1798">There's no mail.</span> <span id="s1799">He said, "Give me his address."</span> <span id="s1800">I told him his name and he used to live at Hotel Broadway when we went to New York.</span> <span id="s1801">He wrote to Hotel Broadway, and then we left so we didn't see him and did the same thing in Modena; I talked to them.</span> <span id="s1802">And he sent a letter to New York, and my brother sent us $500, wired $500 to an Italian bank.</span> <span id="s1803">The bank didn't know where to find us, but they knew there were displaced people in that particular place.</span> <span id="s1804">So they sent somebody, they took the name down and called the name.</span> <span id="s1805">He said, "Our bank has some money for you."</span> <span id="s1806">We understood mostly, me and my brother.</span> <span id="s1807">We came there, we didn't know one word of Italian.</span> <span id="s1808">So the manager says, "Do you speak German?"</span> <span id="s1809">"Of course, we speak German."</span> <span id="s1810">He says, "Come after 3 o'clock."</span> <span id="s1811">So my brother says, "Why after 3:00?"</span> <span id="s1812">"It's better," he says, "it's better come after 3:00.</span> <span id="s1813">If you need some -- I'll give you some money now.</span> <span id="s1814">I'll give you $20."</span> <span id="s1815">It was like 2,000 liras.</span> <span id="s1816">No, no, 20,000 liras -- no, 2,000; I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1817">We came after 3:00.</span> <span id="s1818">To show what a gentleman he was, he said, "The official rate is 100 liras.</span> <span id="s1819">If I give it to you officially, you will get the $500."</span> <span id="s1820">One hundred liras, it's like half a million liras, you know.</span> <span id="s1821">"Because you came now, you get 10 times as much, see?"</span> <span id="s1822">So we got a lot of liras, we thought we're millionaires right away.</span> <span id="s1823">What do we do?</span> <span id="s1824">I put in my pocket, my brother put in his pocket.</span> <span id="s1825">We had a couple of friends waiting outside.</span> <span id="s1826">We told them, "Let's go buy some food."</span> <span id="s1827">So we looked for a place.</span> <span id="s1828">We saw a restaurant, a trattoria, and they displayed looked like chicken, bread, and whatever else, some food.</span> <span id="s1829">We bought a lot of stuff, brought it back to the place.</span> <span id="s1830">We shared it with some of our friends.</span> <span id="s1831">One guy starts eating the chicken.</span> <span id="s1832">He says, "This is not chicken."</span> <span id="s1833">"Why it's not chicken?"</span> <span id="s1834">"The bones are too thick for chicken."</span> <span id="s1835">It was actually rabbit, but we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1836">It was cut up.</span> <span id="s1837">Anyway, that's -- after being about five, six weeks there, my brother, Maurice, says, "You know, I remember some -- our father and Arthur and I, we used to buy feathers in Milan, Italy."</span> <span id="s1838">And he thought the name, and he remembered the name, Rudini (ph) and Pachitani (ph).</span> <span id="s1839">He said, "Let's go to Milan."</span> <span id="s1840">"Okay," I said, "we'll go to Milan."</span> <span id="s1841">We hitchhiked to Milan.</span> <span id="s1842">We didn't know where a railroad was.</span> <span id="s1843">We didn't know -- we hitchhiked, and the guy dropped us off near the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1844">The guy who -- it was a truck -- we didn't all.</span> <span id="s1845">Even a motorcycle.</span> <span id="s1846">It took all day to get to Milan, but we arrived there.</span> <span id="s1847">The way we were dressed we couldn't go to any hotel, even if we had money.</span> <span id="s1848">So we stayed at the railroad station all night, and early morning we went to the public place where you bathe and shave.</span> <span id="s1849">Went out and bought clothes and dressed up, you know.</span> <span id="s1850">We called up -- we were at the firm of Rudini and Pachitani (ph).</span> <span id="s1851">They couldn't understand one word.</span> <span id="s1852">They say, "Pronto, pronto."</span> <span id="s1853">I didn't know what pronto means.</span> <span id="s1854">So he said, "Do you speak German?</span> <span id="s1855">Do you speak English?"</span> <span id="s1856">He said, "Tedesco si."</span> <span id="s1857">Tedesco is German.</span> <span id="s1858">I said, "Padrone," I knew that.</span> <span id="s1859">We bought a dictionary.</span> <span id="s1860">So one of the owners came to phone because he heard I say to ask what name.</span> <span id="s1861">I said, "Belfer, Belfer."</span> <span id="s1862">So he came to the phone, he says please come right up.</span> <span id="s1863">And met us or either he came down.</span> <span id="s1864">He was in his office on the second floor.</span> <span id="s1865">He greeted us like we were his children and his partner.</span> <span id="s1866">And they talked to us and they took us out for lunch.</span> <span id="s1867">They even took us to a hotel, and said, "This is a decent hotel to stay, and don't worry about payment."</span> <span id="s1868">We said, "We have some money.</span> <span id="s1869">My brother sent me money."</span> <span id="s1870">He said, "Come tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s1871">We have a lot of feathers and down."</span> <span id="s1872">Because during the war, we didn't ship anyplace.</span> <span id="s1873">We had tons and tons.</span> <span id="s1874">Said, "We'll come."</span> <span id="s1875">He says, "You can send it to your brother, send samples.</span> <span id="s1876">Maybe you can start this way making a nice living."</span> <span id="s1877">And that's how it started.</span> <span id="s1878">That's why we stayed in Milano five years, and we became very prosperous.</span> <span id="s1879">By prosperous, I mean we had a nice apartment, you know.</span> <span id="s1880">We had a car and so on.</span> <span id="s1881">We were working very hard after that.</span> <span id="s1882">We were -- we went to Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia to buy feathers, Hungary and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: Was it difficult to adjust?</span> <span id="s1884">I mean, to now there is no war, but there is also -- you've lost your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: It was depressing, but the more you got -- I think what helped me is that I got something to do, you know, and make money.</span> <span id="s1886">I know when I went to the hotel with my brother, there was white sheets and a bathroom.</span> <span id="s1887">Pillows.</span> <span id="s1888">We lived well at home, but I thought this is like palace.</span> <span id="s1889">But you get, you know -- my mind worked, if I think back, like you have to do your best and show the world that you are a real human being and you can live as good or better than anybody else.</span> <span id="s1890">That you are as smart as everybody else.</span> <span id="s1891">I had this -- it's like it was always coming into me.</span> <span id="s1892">You have to do what is good for you and what is good for your relatives.</span> <span id="s1893">What is good for people in general.</span> <span id="s1894">I felt that, the opposite of what I've seen during these years.</span> <span id="s1895">I wasn't brought up this way, I felt this was a time in my life that would never repeat itself.</span> <span id="s1896">I felt the world would not permit this to happen.</span> <span id="s1897">That's how</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">06:20</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">the process went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: You thought the world had learned something so that this kind of thing couldn't happen to anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: I didn't know whether the world did learn, but I was angry at the world that let it happen and I always hoped.</span> <span id="s1902">When I saw the people, they go to the opera and they go to all these fancy restaurants, shops, and all this, I said I don't know how we -- it hurt me more what we missed and lost everybody and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: You lost a lot of your childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: Your whole teenage years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: So that must be very difficult to get into, and I understand . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: It was difficult, but I always -- because of my brother and also we had close friends, we tried to do the best -- I think we helped each other to overcome that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Were the Italians good to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: Were the Italians good to you?</span> <span id="s1912">Did you feel comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: Extremely.</span> <span id="s1914">Very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1915">I'm very fond of the Italians.</span> <span id="s1916">Whenever we go on vacation, usually if it's a little extended vacation, we to Italy.</span> <span id="s1917">I love the Italian people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: So it was fortunate to be able to go there and stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: Rather than in a DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1922">Of course, of course.</span> <span id="s1923">And I helped a lot of people while being there.</span> <span id="s1924">Somebody recognized me and so on.</span> <span id="s1925">They came . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: Did you give people jobs when they came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: Not in the beginning, I didn't have any jobs in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1928">But eventually we would have a plant, we had people working.</span> <span id="s1929">We had an office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Did you have survivors working for you as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1932">Except some cousins, we had some cousins we worked with and my brother-in-law eventually came because we worked with him for a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: Now, Maurice married in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: Yes, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Who did he marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: He married a German young woman, but she was raised in Italy.</span> <span id="s1937">Born in Germany, Saarbrücken.</span> <span id="s1938">And they have three children, you know.</span> <span id="s1939">I believe one was born in Italy and two were born in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: And when did you come to the United States?</span> <span id="s1941">After five years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: Less than five years.</span> <span id="s1943">I came in January 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: Why did you come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: My brother had developed a business here, and he came to visit us because we were shipping goods to him.</span> <span id="s1946">He did very well because with the shortage in the United States of the feathers and down, because the army used to use it up for sleeping bags and so on.</span> <span id="s1947">He felt I have a better future in America, so I came to visit in '48.</span> <span id="s1948">His son, he would say pull him out of the fire, you know, from the fire.</span> <span id="s1949">Robert Belfer, he was bar mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s1950">I came, I stayed here about three, four weeks.</span> <span id="s1951">I went to Washington to Chicago.</span> <span id="s1952">I didn't like New York particularly.</span> <span id="s1953">When I got off the boat, the screaming with the taxis and fighting and dirt, I just never could adjust to it.</span> <span id="s1954">So I went back.</span> <span id="s1955">My brother came again and again.</span> <span id="s1956">He says, "I want you to come.</span> <span id="s1957">I want you to meet some nice Jewish girls."</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Were you dating in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: Was he concerned about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: I don't know whether he was concerned or just talk, you know.</span> <span id="s1962">He said we're going on vacation.</span> <span id="s1963">We're going to the mountains during the year for New Year's or right around that time.</span> <span id="s1964">Mountains was Grossingers.</span> <span id="s1965">When I came there the first time, I was looking for the mountains, they called the mountains.</span> <span id="s1966">And that's -- I came and I started to work with my brother.</span> <span id="s1967">And I worked for him, with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: What convinced you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: To stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: There was a point where he had an accident.</span> <span id="s1972">He almost drowned at Long Beach, and they saved him, you know.</span> <span id="s1973">I believe a couple of people got drowned, actually.</span> <span id="s1974">He was pulled out, and he needed -- they removed part of his lung, one lung.</span> <span id="s1975">We didn't know that.</span> <span id="s1976">When we came, he told me all about it.</span> <span id="s1977">We knew that he was sick, we didn't know -- he says, "You know, I could use your help, and it's better for you to come there.</span> <span id="s1978">You'll meet some nice people," this and that.</span> <span id="s1979">So my other brother didn't come.</span> <span id="s1980">He came like three years later.</span> <span id="s1981">My brother, Maurice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: How long did it take you to adjust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: Until I met Eleanor.</span> <span id="s1984">Six months later.</span> <span id="s1985">I didn't like the food because steaks, I remember.</span> <span id="s1986">The first time my brother took me to a steak house, they gave you a steak like four portions, you know.</span> <span id="s1987">They ate so much and so full, but I got used to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Did you miss the pasta?</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: There was very little pasta at that time.</span> <span id="s1990">Or fish, you didn't see fish in restaurants.</span> <span id="s1991">Maybe a special -- special places.</span> <span id="s1992">That I wouldn't go, it took me a while to find out.</span> <span id="s1993">The diet was a little problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Where did you live at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: I lived with my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: Arthur?</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: Arthur.</span> <span id="s1998">I shared a room with Bob.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: His son?</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: His son, yeah.</span> <span id="s2001">For a little while, a few months.</span> <span id="s2002">Then my brother at that time also felt that he'd be needing me because he started -- he wanted to build a foam rubber plant on Staten Island.</span> <span id="s2003">He picked the place, there a was a big plant Wrigley chewing gum, that went out of business there.</span> <span id="s2004">And we bought that plant, and we made mattresses and pillows some cushions and so on.</span> <span id="s2005">That's where I met Eleanor, it was through her uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: Why don't we take a break now and change the tape, and you'll tell the story about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: How are you doing?</span> <span id="s2010">Are you tired?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: Are you tired?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: No.</span> <span id="s2016">It's a little warm, but I'm not tired.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s2018">Norman, can you tell us how you met Eleanor in Staten Island?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: My brother built the foam rubber when I was very active and had a small interest, too, on Staten Island.</span> <span id="s2020">And had an uncle supplied chemicals to us, certain chemicals for cleaning and some -- and also some supplies.</span> <span id="s2021">And he had a business where they were cleaning hospitals, offices.</span> <span id="s2022">I think he was also selling vacuum cleaners and stuff, household stuff.</span> <span id="s2023">So he would come there very once in a while and I would give him orders.</span> <span id="s2024">He said, "I've asked you so many times.</span> <span id="s2025">Why don't you come, let's go out for lunch?"</span> <span id="s2026">Every time I told him, "Next time, I'm busy," which I was.</span> <span id="s2027">But one time I said okay.</span> <span id="s2028">He took me out for lunch.</span> <span id="s2029">Then he wanted to show off his place.</span> <span id="s2030">He had a quite large place, it was a new building, nice offices.</span> <span id="s2031">He took me through the office, so then we went to his private office.</span> <span id="s2032">I said, "You know, you have some pretty girls working here.</span> <span id="s2033">Especially this one girl was sitting here, you know, is very pretty."</span> <span id="s2034">He said, "She's my niece, but she has a sister who is even prettier, an older sister."</span> <span id="s2035">I understand the one who worked there was 16 or 17.</span> <span id="s2036">So I said I would be happy to meet her, you know.</span> <span id="s2037">So one day he calls me up again, and he says, "I'll give you a call then."</span> <span id="s2038">So he called me, he said, "I'd like you to come to my house for a drink or dinner.</span> <span id="s2039">Are you free?"</span> <span id="s2040">I said, "Why do you want me to come to your house?"</span> <span id="s2041">"I want you to meet my niece."</span> <span id="s2042">I said, "I'll come."</span> <span id="s2043">So we came there, he served us drinks and hors d'oeuvres.</span> <span id="s2044">Then he said we're going to go to a restaurant in New Jersey from there, a special restaurant.</span> <span id="s2045">I had my own car, so I said I would drive and they'll ride.</span> <span id="s2046">I liked Eleanor a lot, it's true, from the first.</span> <span id="s2047">She was very pretty and spoke very well.</span> <span id="s2048">She sounded intelligent.</span> <span id="s2049">So she was a little upset with me because I was always riding and looking.</span> <span id="s2050">I told her that's how they drive in Europe.</span> <span id="s2051">She said, "You can't drive like this.</span> <span id="s2052">You'll get into an accident."</span> <span id="s2053">I said, "Oh, no."</span> <span id="s2054">We had a very nice evening.</span> <span id="s2055">And then I used to stay in the hotel, the St. George Hotel in</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">07:04 Brooklyn, after I left Arthur.</span> <span id="s2057">But then I started to spend more time, and I wanted to take some courses in chemistry at Wagner College on Staten Island.</span> <span id="s2058">The reason because we had a foam rubber process I wanted to know more.</span> <span id="s2059">So I took an apartment on Staten Island, sublet, you know.</span> <span id="s2060">There was a lady there, she would do everything for me, you know.</span> <span id="s2061">She would make breakfast and so on.</span> <span id="s2062">So we knew each other about six months, we decided -- got engaged and then we got married within, I don't recall, a year or so, or less than a year.</span> <span id="s2063">Nine months to a year.</span> <span id="s2064">And I'll tell you why right away, January '52 I came in.</span> <span id="s2065">I met her about a year -- took over a year.</span> <span id="s2066">A little over a year, I knew her.</span> <span id="s2067">We are happily married since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: So that really changed your life . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: . . . in some significant way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: There were four children.</span> <span id="s2072">Two boys and two girls.</span> <span id="s2073">Unfortunately, we lost one son.</span> <span id="s2074">He was wonderful boy, he was only 20 years old.</span> <span id="s2075">And he was a wonderful student at the University of Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s2076">Went to Wharton School and was a year ahead in school.</span> <span id="s2077">He went to Arizona.</span> <span id="s2078">Eleanor has a sister, a married sister in Phoenix, Arizona.</span> <span id="s2079">And from there he went up -- Eleanor's sister's son was planning to enroll at the University in Colorado.</span> <span id="s2080">So instead of his parents staying, they asked Jim to take him.</span> <span id="s2081">This was in August, you know, '76.</span> <span id="s2082">That would be 20 years.</span> <span id="s2083">In August '76.</span> <span id="s2084">He would call us every other night, saying we had a good time, this and that.</span> <span id="s2085">And his cousin would call his parents every other night, so we always knew where they were.</span> <span id="s2086">He called us on a Friday night, we're having dinner, and he says, you know, he had such an experience.</span> <span id="s2087">He met some old guy and told him certain stories.</span> <span id="s2088">He was a very lovely personality, very great, great person.</span> <span id="s2089">He called us he is coming on Sunday and what plane -- told us what plane, flight number, and we are</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">07:07:30 supposed to pick him up.</span> <span id="s2091">Saturday late afternoon around 4 o'clock, we had a call.</span> <span id="s2092">Jimmy drowned.</span> <span id="s2093">What happened is -- it's ironic.</span> <span id="s2094">He was on the swimming team at the University of Pennsylvania, and a very accomplished swimmer.</span> <span id="s2095">He didn't do anything wrong, but there was next to the University a few miles away, they had bicycles.</span> <span id="s2096">It was a hot day.</span> <span id="s2097">There were many kids there, University students.</span> <span id="s2098">It's a reservoir, but it had some -- it had three coves for swimmers.</span> <span id="s2099">On the waterway, they permitted boats, people were skiing, so one boat came into the cove where Jim was swimming.</span> <span id="s2100">And when he saw the boat coming in, he took a dive and waited for the boat to go away.</span> <span id="s2101">Because the boat came in very fast, and all of a sudden and made a curve into it.</span> <span id="s2102">So when he came up, the skier hit him in the head, and the skier said she didn't know.</span> <span id="s2103">She didn't think, she didn't see anybody.</span> <span id="s2104">Then she said what she thought was a ball or a dog or something.</span> <span id="s2105">The boat didn't even stop.</span> <span id="s2106">His cousin was watching while this was happening, and -- but he was talking to some friend or girl there.</span> <span id="s2107">They didn't yell to stop the boat, and Jim never came up.</span> <span id="s2108">It took several days to find him.</span> <span id="s2109">So it seems that -- that was devastating especially to Eleanor.</span> <span id="s2110">To me, too, but she couldn't -- she still can't take it.</span> <span id="s2111">Why?</span> <span id="s2112">You always ask why did it happen to him?</span> <span id="s2113">You know, why me?</span> <span id="s2114">There's no answer to it.</span> <span id="s2115">You search for an answer, but there's no answer to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: Do you have three other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: We have three other children.</span> <span id="s2118">Two are married.</span> <span id="s2119">I have a son, Andrew, he is an attorney.</span> <span id="s2120">He works in real estate development with me.</span> <span id="s2121">One daughter is married and has a family.</span> <span id="s2122">Andrew is married and has three children.</span> <span id="s2123">Two boys and a girl.</span> <span id="s2124">And my daughter, Carolyn, has also two boys and a girl.</span> <span id="s2125">My daughter, Lauren, is single.</span> <span id="s2126">And she works with me, too, in my office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q: So you kept the family together in the way that you all were . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A: Yes, we all live in the same area.</span> <span id="s2129">We live in Great Neck.</span> <span id="s2130">We live here most of the time now, because I work here, I work in New York.</span> <span id="s2131">But the children are more involved in New York now, and I'm more involved here.</span> <span id="s2132">But we are in daily touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: What do you think you learned from the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">A: I learned that we live in a very cruel world.</span> <span id="s2135">That there are very few people who really go out to help another person.</span> <span id="s2136">Very egotistical.</span> <span id="s2137">Very crude.</span> <span id="s2138">Even the educated ones, because Germany was considered a very highly cultured country.</span> <span id="s2139">Very good brains in so many fields.</span> <span id="s2140">But it seems they had no hearts.</span> <span id="s2141">There are very few people, you know -- it's not only you have a good mind, you have to have a heart.</span> <span id="s2142">And some people are lacking their heart; they have no feelings or they do such outrageous things.</span> <span id="s2143">They perform such atrocities, and</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">07:13 look at how many criminals, even not on a large -- on a smaller scale.</span> <span id="s2145">There's so many criminals all over the world now, and it's going up.</span> <span id="s2146">I think it has a lot to do with upbringing, education, and the government has to be more strict about breaking certain laws.</span> <span id="s2147">Shouldn't -- the punishment is not severe enough to discourage some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: Do you think you adjusted after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: Did I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: Did you adjust?</span> <span id="s2151">Did you somehow -- or is there still a piece of you that's . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: I adjusted extremely well.</span> <span id="s2153">Some of my friends did not adjust too well.</span> <span id="s2154">I had a brother-in-law who couldn't adjust at all.</span> <span id="s2155">He was such a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s2156">He just -- he was always telling me about dreams he has all the time, and he wasn't well.</span> <span id="s2157">He just couldn't take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: How do you account -- you had so much suffering.</span> <span id="s2159">You were in horrible places.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Plaszów alone, then Kraków could have undermined anybody.</span> <span id="s2162">What do you attribute your being able to take this and assimilate it somehow and lead, obviously, a full life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A: I think it's luck, fate.</span> <span id="s2164">I didn't listen -- there were people that were as strong and much stronger.</span> <span id="s2165">Big fellows and didn't make it, you know.</span> <span id="s2166">It's very difficult for me to pinpoint the many things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: Did Eleanor help?</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: To adjust after the war?</span> <span id="s2169">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2170">Yes, she is very understanding, very knowledgeable, very -- we personally helped many organizations, Jewish and non-Jewish, you know, people.</span> <span id="s2171">After the war, we tried to help in nearly every cause through every means available to us.</span> <span id="s2172">To a large extent, we are very charitable.</span> <span id="s2173">I like in a smaller way to create harmony and respect for people for each other, regardless of their religion or their race or color.</span> <span id="s2174">And I'm very broad-minded; although you would expect the opposite, I'm not.</span> <span id="s2175">I am</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">07:16 an optimist by nature, too.</span> <span id="s2177">I always feel now things are going to be better, and, hopefully, they will be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Did it help that Eleanor asked you to talk about your experiences, so you didn't have to hold them inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: I did not talk about my experiences to her for many years.</span> <span id="s2180">I mean, I would just tell her a certain -- I wouldn't go into details like we did today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: When did you start talking in detail and why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A: I had -- almost had a guilt feeling not to talk about it, you know, and even my children, I talked -- I remember talking to them and Eleanor would elaborate maybe to them.</span> <span id="s2183">Because I remember our older son was six years old, he wanted a certain bicycle that his friend had, our neighbor, his friend.</span> <span id="s2184">And Eleanor and I took him on a Saturday morning to buy a bicycle.</span> <span id="s2185">And he showed us which one, then he saw made in Germany.</span> <span id="s2186">He said, "Dad, I don't want you to buy this bicycle.</span> <span id="s2187">It's made in Germany."</span> <span id="s2188">So he already -- he was six or seven -- if he knew it, the other siblings knew it, too.</span> <span id="s2189">And I was telling them.</span> <span id="s2190">When I went back to Poland only about seven, eight years ago, I told them about it.</span> <span id="s2191">I took our son along and one of my nephews.</span> <span id="s2192">Maurice, my brother's, Maurice's son, two cousins.</span> <span id="s2193">We all went for the first march of the women, you know, from Auschwitz to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2194">I couldn't believe what they did to us, but I consider myself a very responsible individual.</span> <span id="s2195">And I look out for the underdog and I pray for a better world.</span> <span id="s2196">And never again, it should never happen again to any nation or to any people, wherever they live, whoever they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">07:13:30</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">Q: Thank you, Norman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: You're very welcome.</span> <span id="s2200">This is my father.</span> <span id="s2201">His name was Benjamin.</span> <span id="s2202">And he was a wonderful guy.</span> <span id="s2203">This picture was taken during the war for passport purposes, and this skull cap that you see was actually painted on in the photograph after the war.</span> <span id="s2204">Since he was a very observant orthodox Jew, we felt maybe he should have a skull cap on his head.</span> <span id="s2205">This is my mother.</span> <span id="s2206">Her name was Hinda.</span> <span id="s2207">She was a very sweet, lovely and generous person.</span> <span id="s2208">We all loved her, my family and friends, and whoever knew her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">Q: When was this taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: This was taken also during the war, about the same time when they took my father's picture in order to have pictures in the event they wanted to get a passport.</span> <span id="s2211">And these pictures I got after the war from my brother, Arthur.</span> <span id="s2212">It's unfortunate that she had to have such a tragic life and she was gassed in Auschwitz, which is incomprehensible for anyone to understand, including myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">Q: I'll take away the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">A: This is my sister, Helena, Hia.</span> <span id="s2215">[on the right] She was my younger sister, she was very, very bright and very sweet.</span> <span id="s2216">Has a lot of friends and was a very lively person.</span> <span id="s2217">We all miss her and love her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: How old was she around this time, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: At that time she must have been, let's see, probably 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: Where do you think this was taken, Norman?</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: I think this was taken in Borisov, Poland, in the hometown where we were raised as youngsters.</span> <span id="s2222">This is my sister, Sheindl[a].</span> <span id="s2223">The name Shayne, Sheindl means beautiful.</span> <span id="s2224">She really was a very beautiful young lady.</span> <span id="s2225">She loved life, and she was a very friendly person, very creative person.</span> <span id="s2226">She always was studying and reading and was an exceptional young woman, and she was loved by everyone.</span> <span id="s2227">The ladies on each side, I remember the one on the left side.</span> <span id="s2228">The left side, her name was Nika (ph).</span> <span id="s2229">The one on the right side, I don't remember her name, but I know they both were cousins the way I remember them.</span> <span id="s2230">And all were very close.</span> <span id="s2231">This is a winter scene, of course.</span> <span id="s2232">The picture I look on is a picture of myself.</span> <span id="s2233">This was taken after the war the first time when I arrived in Italy.</span> <span id="s2234">It must have been the summer of '45, mid summer of '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: That's you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: This picture is a picture of myself I believe in Modena, Italy.</span> <span id="s2237">The fellows on each side were friends of mine.</span> <span id="s2238">I don't remember their names, but I met them really in Modena after the war, yeah.</span> <span id="s2239">This picture was also taken in Italy in September 1948.</span> <span id="s2240">The picture was taken was for passport -- to apply for a passport permit, you know.</span> <span id="s2241">This our son -- late son, Jimmy.</span> <span id="s2242">My daughter, Lauren, next to him.</span> <span id="s2243">My wife, Eleanor, next to Lauren and me, myself.</span> <span id="s2244">Our daughter, Carolyn, lighting a candle for a party that was given in her honor.</span> <span id="s2245">She was becoming a bat mitzvah.</span> <span id="s2246">And next to her is our son, Andrew, who is an attorney in Great Neck, New York.</span> <span id="s2247">They all actually live in Great Neck, New York.</span> <span id="s2248">This is my wife, Eleanor, and our son, James -- Jimmy Belfer.</span> <span id="s2249">The one on the left is Eleanor, my wife; our son, Andrew; our daughter, Carolyn; our son, Jimmy; our daughter, Lauren; and this is myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0367 PAGE
