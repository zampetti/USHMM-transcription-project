Let's--[tape off then on] O.K., tell me when you were little, and let's begin with your time.</span> <span id="s16">What do you remember, and how old were you in the early '30s and...</span></p> <p><span id="s17">NF: I was born in 19--July 25th, 1935.</span> <span id="s18">So when the war broke out I was four.</span> <span id="s19">I was an only child.</span> <span id="s20">I was a very pampered child.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">JF: You lived in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">NF: I lived in Stanislaw, Poland [Stanislawów-Polish], with my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s23">And my grandparents lived with us too, my mother's parents.</span> <span id="s24">Since I was an only child I was a very pampered child.</span> <span id="s25">My father was quite well off, and act--whatever I wanted, I actually could have--there.</span> <span id="s26">I remember in Poland bananas were a delicacy.</span> <span id="s27">But I always had a banana.</span> <span id="s28">Various things, you know, I remember being very spoiled.</span> <span id="s29">I didn't like to eat, and I remember running around in the garden and my mother running after me with a spoon and a--the old, you know, Jewish mothers, where the child had to eat.</span> <span id="s30">Otherwise you would starve.</span> <span id="s31">And as a result I was a plump child.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">JF: Do you...</span></p> <p><span id="s33">NF: The reason why I'm saying that I was a very pampered child, because, what I went through later, just shows you that a person can get used to everything.</span> <span id="s34">That's why I get very angry now at people when they say, "I have to have that or I have to have the other thing."</span> <span id="s35">How I started being such a pampered little girl and then having all the deprivations, and somehow you get used to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">JF: Do you remember your life?</span> <span id="s37">Were you very Jewish when you were growing up?</span> <span id="s38">Did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s39">NF: Yes, my parents were very orthodox, and my mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s40">I remember they

just, you were brought up, and you did, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s51">ED: Jewish [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s52">JF: Do you remember when, when was the first time that you remember, it might be that it was, it wasn't so good to be Jewish?</span> <span id="s53">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">NF: I guess it must have been 1939, because I remember my father coming home and telling my mother that, "Hitler is coming.</span> <span id="s55">Hitler is coming."</span></p> <p><span id="s56">ED: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s57">NF: Maybe '40, '4--I don't

O.K.</span> <span id="s62">We don't need the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">NF: But I remember, oh, with that terrible frightened face he came in and told my mother that it's bad.</span> <span id="s64">"Hitler's coming in."</span> <span id="s65">And I really didn't know what Hitler was, but I saw my father was scared, my mother was scared.</span> <span id="s66">You know, I was scared too.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">JF: So you remember that that's the first sign.</span> <span id="s68">You remember the...</span></p> <p><span id="s69">NF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">JF: That everybody was scared that Hitler was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">NF: And from then on, I remember having this terrible fear, always a fear in the pit of my stomach.</span> <span id="s72">And always this feeling that, you know how when you're scared you have to go to the bathroom?</span> <span id="s73">And this constant feeling that I always had to go to the bathroom, because I was always scared.</span> <span id="s74">That terrible knot in your stomach that you...</span></p> <p><span id="s75">JF: That you...</span></p> <p><span id="s76">NF: Had.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">JF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s78">Tell me, what hap--what was the first thing that you remember that, you know, Hitler did, or that happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">NF: I remember that, we lived a little out of town or something.</span> <span id="s80">And I remember what my mother was talking about, that first action.</span> <span id="s81">An action was when they--a pogrom...</span></p> <p><span id="s82">ED: Riot.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">NF: A riot, a pogrom, or whatever.</span> <span id="s84">And when they said that all the Jews had to put on whatever gold they had and all the furs or something that they had, just get it all ready and wait and they'll come for you.</span> <span id="s85">And like idiots we stood and we waited and we waited.</span> <span id="s86">Because at that time, like my mother mentioned before, we just didn't believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">JF: You didn't, yeah, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s88">NF: We didn't believe that, I

because I didn't, we always thought, you know, if we do what we're told, they would have no cause to harm us and we would stay alive.</span> <span id="s100">Nobody imagined that for no reason at all they would just decide to kill you, just because you were born a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">JF: Were you wearing the arm bands by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">NF: Well, I was a little

girls used to wear earrings, gold earrings with little blue stones in them.</span> <span id="s110">And I had those on.</span> <span id="s111">Little things you remember.</span> <span id="s112">And we waited and we waited.</span> <span id="s113">And nobody ever came, because we lived out of town.</span> <span id="s114">And then when, towards evening I guess my father must have gone out, and he heard what had taken place, that all the Jews were gathered on a cemetery and 12,000 Jews were killed at that, in that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">ED: 20,000 [unclear].</span></p> <p><span

just, the thinking was if you would do what you are told, you will--they can't harm you if you do what you're told.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">JF: And that was, that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s167">NF: That was mainly the thinking.</span> <span id="s168">I--the rational way of thinking was that if you follow orders, you work hard, you'll be left alive.</span> <span id="s169">And nobody

and when you came back they, the Gestapo, stood there with big German Shepherd dogs.</span> <span id="s188">And the dogs, when you came back, would sniff you and, to see if you had brought in any food or anything that you weren't supposed to.</span> <span id="s189">And sometimes, at the will of the Gestapo, the, he gave an order to the dog to attack somebody.</span> <span id="s190">Just for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s191">Just for sport.</span> <span id="s192">He had to just touch the person on the shoulder and the dog would attack them.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">JF:
