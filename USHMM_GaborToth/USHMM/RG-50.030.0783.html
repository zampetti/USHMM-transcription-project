27, 2015, in Chicago, Illinois.</span> <span id="s12">Thank you very much Mr. Gubala, for agreeing to meet with us today, and to share some of your experiences from the war, and from the postwar years.</span> <span id="s13">What I’d like to do is talk a great deal about the world, and the life that you had before any of these events, before the war started.</span> <span id="s14">So, I’m going to start at the very beginning.</span> <span id="s15">Could you tell me, what was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Answer: My name at birth – oh, first of all, I would like to thank you for coming and visiting my modest little hacienda, here in the Windy City.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: And my name originally was Thaddeus Roman Gubała, L with the little slash above.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s20">And what was your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Date of birth was February 3rd, ’29.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: So that means your birthday is coming up next week.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: In one week.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I will enter the – 86.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Congratulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I was born in Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.</span> <span id="s30">This was Hosia(ph) Street three, the building is still existing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: This was – yes.</span> <span id="s33">Well, it was damaged during the uprising, but still, the structure is there.</span> <span id="s34">So whenever I visit Warsaw, I take a glimpse of that building.</span> <span id="s35">And during the occupation, actually, I didn’t live in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: You lived – you were elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s38">But a – my parish was a church, holy – holy – the Alexander Church in Three Crosses Square in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Is that the center of town, or is that a little bit outside the center?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: I would say it’s close to center, yes, close to center, because the Royal Tr-Track starts from Wilanów, all the way to the old town in Warsaw, but this is part of that section that covers that distance.</span> <span id="s41">They call it the Royal Track [speaks Polish] This is in Polish.</span> <span id="s42">But Nowy Świat, the New World, actually started from that square, Three Crosses Square.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s44">What kind of a building did you grow up in?</span> <span id="s45">Was it a huge apartment building, or single family –</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: No, it was in an apart – it was about five story building, five story building, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Built when, in the 19th century, or the 20th?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: This was, I would say, 20th century already there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s50">And how modern was it?</span> <span id="s51">Did it have electricity, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Oh, there were electricity, yes, electricity.</span> <span id="s53">We had the bathrooms –</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Running water.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Running water, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Mm-hm, and plumbing, and all of that.</span> <span id="s57">So, it was a modern place.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Yes, it was a modern place.</span> <span id="s59">Warsaw is a – as it grew, during the time after the first World War, this was under the Tsarist Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: But then, when Pilsudski came to power in 1918, Poland regained her independence, after 123 years of nonexistence, so to speak, of – Poland only existed only as partitions.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Poland was divided actually into three segments, and this was Prussian, Russian, and Austro-Hungary.</span> <span id="s64">So actually, Warsaw was part of the Tsarist domain.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: So, when Poland became independent again, and the three parts became united, 123 years is still quite a while, because it is more than living memory.</span> <span id="s66">Several generations are comprised in that.</span> <span id="s67">Had people changed very much?</span> <span id="s68">Could you understand one another – I mean psychologically?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Well, there were different, let’s say, frames that the Poles grew, that say, Germans were very anti-Polish, and Hakatay(ph) was the organization that even forbade the Polish language to be used at schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Russians were also trying to bring their influence to the point.</span> <span id="s72">And then, the most tolerant part was the au – aus – aus – aus –</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Austro-Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Aust-Austro-Hungarian part.</span> <span id="s75">Yeah, so that was was a – a little better for schooling, secondary schooling and so on.</span> <span id="s76">And let’s say Poles from Galicia?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: You know, they were a little different in character than let’s say, Poles that were slightly Germanized under the ger – the Prussian operation, and the Poles living under the Russians.</span> <span id="s79">So, this process of fusing us together was actually a great, let’s say, accomplishment of the Catholic church, because they mostly – the Poles were of Catholic faith, and that was – the church was actually the strongest party that existed in – in Poland.</span> <span id="s80">But then when Pilsudski became the Marshall of Poland – this was in 1914, and officially Poland regained her independence in the ’18, he was assigned a task of, let’s say, fusing th-the different characters of people that grew in different segments of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So what were some of the – I mean, just curiosity – you say the Galicianas are different than those who were – and Galicia was under Austro-Hungarian rule?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: What kind of character did the one have in comparison to the other two, and so on?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Let’s say the – the – let’s say the Germans, Poles, from the German part, from the Prussian part were, let’s say, a little bit more like Germans, very orderly, let’s say the work that they accomplished was more thorough than let’s say the group of Poles in the east, under the Russians.</span> <span id="s85">And let’s say the Galicians were also a little bit closer to – to – to – to German influence.</span> <span id="s86">But all together, united by the faith, you know, we were very quickly re – reburn(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Reborn.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Reborn, yes, reborn.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s90">And tell me a little bit – so, there are questions that I usually ask people who were in the eastern territories, that don’t apply here, but I will just bring them up.</span> <span id="s91">And that is, one of the – the issues that I want to find out about is the degree of modernization.</span> <span id="s92">So there I will ask, you know, did anybody have a radio?</span> <span id="s93">Did anybody have a telephone?</span> <span id="s94">Did they ha – did – were cars – automobiles common to see?</span> <span id="s95">Well, in the center of Warsaw, I would assume that these things –</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yes, the Poland was called – they called Poland at that time – the Warsaw was the – the – the Paris of the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: That was – city was about one point two million people.</span> <span id="s99">And there – there was, let’s see, very large Jewish diaspora in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s100">The diaspora was about 400,00, so every third Warsawian was of – of Hebrew faith.</span> <span id="s101">Some of them got more or less Poland-ized, then the – they were, let’s say, getting with the Poles closer, and the other ones were dep – Poland was free, as far as the religion is concerned, so they had their ow-own synagogues, they had their own traditions, and they grew in the environment that their predecessors are sort of giving them.</span> <span id="s102">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Did you – mm-hm, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: And Warsaw – Warsaw was specially – some districts of Warsaw were predominantly Jewish.</span> <span id="s105">The most famous synagogue was the synagogue on Tłomackie Street.</span> <span id="s106">Now, if you ever visit Warsaw at that area, was – actually is a skyscraper about 40 stories high, a blue building that was, let’s say built after the war, in that area where that synagogue was.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Is there –</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: And this was the most beautiful synagogue in the world, the largest, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Even though you weren’t Jewish – you aren’t Jewish, did you ever visit inside?</span> <span id="s112">Did you ever –</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Oh, my father – my father was always very, how should I say, trying to show me the – the cerkiew, which is the Orthodox church, we had one big chur – cerkiew in Praga.</span> <span id="s114">Because Praga is not the Czech Prague, it’s a – Warsaw was on the left bank of the Vistula, looking north was Warszawa, was Warsaw.</span> <span id="s115">On the right side was Praga.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: So it was like a – a district of Warsaw, a section of Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Well yes, th-the eastern part, you know, the bridges connected the city together.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: And there was a cerkiew, there was the Russian Orthodox church.</span> <span id="s120">And very often he took me over to show the – how they pray, and how they, let’s say, celebrate their different religious –</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Services.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: – services.</span> <span id="s123">And there was a – in – in Warsaw I visited synagogues from time to time.</span> <span id="s124">Actually in my classroom, I had many Jewish friends that especially – Thursdays were the days when they were teaching us religion; history of the Catholic churches, or at that time the – the Jewish minority was excused, they could take a walk into the park, play soccer, or whatever.</span> <span id="s125">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Let’s cut.</span> <span id="s127">[break] So, you were talking about something very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Th-Thursday –</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Oh, hang on a minute, let’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Yeah, you were talking about Thursdays at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Thursdays at school.</span> <span id="s133">So, the – let’s say, students, pupils that were excused for that day, of Jewish faith, you know, so very often I – I – I joined them just to be out in the park, and play soccer.</span> <span id="s134">That –</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: I was – yeah, I was going to say, weren’t you jealous of those kids who didn’t have to go to class?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: That’s right, you know, so I was what, eight, seven – seven, eight years old, so at that time it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: So, did you ever visit this beautiful synagogue you told us –</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: – when you were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: – I visited that synagogue.</span> <span id="s141">Yes, this was in 1936 or ’37, yeah, with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: So you were bor – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Do you have –</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Nowadays – nowadays they have Tłomackie Street, and there is a – a Jewish, let’s say library, and – and a small museum, because the main museum that was erected just th – one year ago, open up, it’s one of the most beautiful, modern museum, they spend a lot of money.</span> <span id="s146">And I think the – the help came from the good, old U.S.A., you know, so – and then fa – I think contribution was also made by the Polish president to build in the area where they have nalewki(ph), and that was that infamous Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s147">That’s was the – the Jews were loaded on the trucks, and taken over to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s148">So this was ex-Jewish district.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: So, was the Umschlagplatz within the space of the ghetto, or outside of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Umschlagplatz was on the periphery of ghetto, you know, but it was inside, inside yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: It was inside, but at the edge.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: And the railroad tracks at Stawki, there were, I think five tracks that the trains were coming in, because there was a – sort of like a 10 – 10,000 – 10,000 a day were trying to unload from Warsaw and send them to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: So when – when – when Jews were being loaded onto – you’d say trucks, and then to trains, or how would they be –</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No, they were – they were – they were walking toward the tra – Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s155">There were no trucks actually in the ghetto, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: They were streetcars, but they were not used.</span> <span id="s158">Normally the cruel police force were the actually Jewish police, because they were obliged to bring the contingent of so many Jews for that particular day, that were shipped to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So they would go by foot to the Umschlagplatz?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: But foot, with – they were normally told that they are going east for some places that they will be employed and work for the upkeep of their own lives, and so on.</span> <span id="s161">So they were – they were lied about this designation of Treblinka, because this was the end of the trip, so to speak, of –</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s163">And it was by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: By train, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: By train.</span> <span id="s166">Now, you say this was within the ghetto – the ghetto itself, but on the periphery.</span> <span id="s167">Did you ever see anything like this, were you able to see it?</span> <span id="s168">A: No, I – let’s see.</span> <span id="s169">I had my school located – let’s start from a different point.</span> <span id="s170">There were two ghettos actually.</span> <span id="s171">There was small ghetto, south of Wolska Street, which was main thoroughfare through Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: And there was a large ghetto north of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: And normally they build a wall around small and large ghettos, so this whole area was isolated.</span> <span id="s176">Along the Wolska Street, between Wronia and Żelazna, this was a point where two ghettos were –</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Connected?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: – connected, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: And they were also at the place like Żelazna and Chłodna, this was a bridge that was connecting small ghetto with large ghetto.</span> <span id="s181">That bridge you could see in that film of pianist, by –</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: That’s right, by Roman Polanski.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Polanski, yes.</span> <span id="s184">This bridge I remember well, and that portion of wall, and the main gate to the ghetto, I remember very well because my school was like – during the occupation, you know, the secondary schooling was forbidden for the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Hitler wanted us only to know how to count to a hundred, write and read, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s187">And we were designated for what they call konnektenvolk(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Konnektenvolk(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: What is konnektenvolk(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Konnekten(ph), it – it’s a subdue human beings working for the –</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Overlords.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: – overlords, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: So this was – this was school located – trade school, actually, this was trade school, because no secondary schools were allowed.</span> <span id="s198">But in that trade school we had schooling, secondary schooling undercover, we say.</span> <span id="s199">We used to say yeah, pod pokrywką gymnasium pod pokrywką.</span> <span id="s200">The secondary school was under the cover.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: So even we had the universities and polytechnics, everything was unofficially forbidden, but underground was acting.</span> <span id="s203">So, going to my trade school – actually, this was the first class of gymnasium we call it, high school, I was passing the main gate –</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: – and actually right by that bridge, what you saw in that film.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Walking there.</span> <span id="s208">So this was close.</span> <span id="s209">This portion was Aryan portion, so we saw it, everything what was going on behind the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: So you would see over the wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: What were the things that you were seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Well, the buildings.</span> <span id="s214">The street was divided by the wall, and these houses there, the – cause ghetto was overpopulated.</span> <span id="s215">At that time, some of the houses are already empty, because that process of sending Jews to the death chambers in Treblinka was – vacated a lot of space, leaving space in the buildings.</span> <span id="s216">So that was neglected.</span> <span id="s217">On top of the wall, actually, the Germans set up machine guns.</span> <span id="s218">There were, actually at that time, some of the people that came from the ukra – Ukraine – Ukrainians were guarding the Jewish ghetto, and Latvians were guarding the Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s219">And the Germans were in the supervisory positions.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: So what I saw there?</span> <span id="s222">I remember when the Jewish uprising started, this –</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Well, we’ll talk about that later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: We’ll go back now to –</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: So guide me to whatever –</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: – because I don’t want to jump from one –</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: – subject to another –</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: – because this gonna be a –</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: You’re – yeah, bu-but you’re explaining things in a very interesting fashion.</span> <span id="s234">And we started with the synagogue, and the beautiful synagogue that – that was there before the war.</span> <span id="s235">And I’d like to ask – you know, you were a young boy when you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: But do you remember anything from the inside of that synagogue, of what it looked like to you?</span> <span id="s238">A: Not the – the – the altar, the decorations, the building, the walls.</span> <span id="s239">I have a picture, but not too vivid, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Was it big?</span> <span id="s241">Was it a –</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Hm?</span> <span id="s243">Oh yes, very large.</span> <span id="s244">Very large building.</span> <span id="s245">Very large building there.</span> <span id="s246">There was a Torah displayed there, and that seven – seven candles.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: The menorah.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yeah, menorah.</span> <span id="s249">Then th – then I remember, and I listened to some of the can-cantors?</span> <span id="s250">I used to hear the singers.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: So they had the very good singers.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Did you go during service times?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Mm – no, no, no.</span> <span id="s255">But they had some practices during that time, so that we walked in and we were permitted to look around, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s257">Well, it sounds – it was unusual that your father would think of it, to take you to the churches of different religions, and the worshipping houses of different religions.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: You know, war – Warsaw was actually like an international sort of a metropoly(ph), and we had the majority Poles, okay, that was about 800,000 Poles at that time, and 400,000 were Jews.</span> <span id="s259">But we had Germans, we had Lithuanians, and different nationalities living in – in – in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: And your father, was he a – an international kind of person?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: No?</span> <span id="s263">So what was his reason for bringing you to these places?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Well, he wanted to – let’s say to satisfy my curiosity.</span> <span id="s265">I was always, let’s say, curious of what the other people, how they pray, what they do, and how the ceremony goes, you – so I – I remember when I visited cerkiew, which was that Orthodox.</span> <span id="s266">The only thing that was – that I remember was the – a lot of herbs, and holy –</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: The incense.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: – things – in – yes, th-they were burning, and the smoke of it, you know, then – then I started –</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Tearing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: – getting tears in my – tearing up, and then he said okay, that’s – that’s enough.</span> <span id="s271">But he – he wanted me to know, let’s say, what the city is like.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s273">Let’s – let’s turn a little bit then to your own home, which is, I started asking about the physical, how it looked physically, and if you could paint a picture for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Our – our apartment was, let’s say, within a complex – that was industrial complex.</span> <span id="s275">My father was working for the transportation com – company, and where he was in the – in this storage, purchasing the tires, different parts for the buses that were in the workshop, repaired.</span> <span id="s276">Our apartment consisted of one large room.</span> <span id="s277">There was a bed, and two bedrooms, and a kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: You know, for Warsaw that was a nice –</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Nice size.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Nice size of place.</span> <span id="s282">And the next, adjacent building was a large building, built during the Tsarist times, I think, that they had three different factories.</span> <span id="s283">That was a textile factory, there was some mechanical shop, and the top was some chemical establishment there.</span> <span id="s284">So we didn’t have many neighbors, you say civilians, because we were part of that industrial complex.</span> <span id="s285">My mother was running a little cafeteria, for one place, and the father was working for the Polska Linia Samochodowa, which was the transportation company.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s287">Was it a private company, or state-owned company?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: I would say this was a private company, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s290">Okay.</span> <span id="s291">And the – and was it that it was the co – a company apartment?</span> <span id="s292">That is, it belonged to the company, but people who worked there could rent them out?</span> <span id="s293">A: Yes, th-this is – this – when we moved from Hosia(ph) Street, because this part here is Krochmałna part.</span> <span id="s294">This is away from the center of the city.</span> <span id="s295">This was in the suburb called Wola, w-o-l-a, Wola.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s297">And when did you move there?</span> <span id="s298">How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: That – I was, let’s say I was about five years old or so when we moved there.</span> <span id="s300">And we lived there throughout, let’s see, siege of Warsaw in 1939, and during the occupation, until I was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s302">So it was your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: That was my home, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: That was your home.</span> <span id="s305">Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I had a sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yes, she was older, about four or five years older than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: So she was born in the mid-20s, something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: She was born in 1924, and my vintage was, as I mentioned, ’29.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Helena.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Is she still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s315">She was so exhausted actually, she died in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: You mean, during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Wa – after – after –</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Right after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s320">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s322">What was your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Mother name was Maria.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: And your father’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Piotr.</span> <span id="s326">Peter.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Peter.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: And your mother’s maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Wlodarski.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Maria Wlodarski.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Wlodarski.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: W-l-o-d-a-r-s-k-i.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s336">Were they – were they vars – Warsawians?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: My mother was born in vicinity of Kielce.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: And my father was Warsawian, yes, but he lived with his folks in – near – near Kielce.</span> <span id="s340">And we lived in Hosia(ph) Street, as I mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s342">Did you have aunts and uncles, and larger family?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Oh yes, my mother’s brother, we owned a little summer home in Otwock that was east – east of Warsaw, within the network of electrical trains.</span> <span id="s344">So we were communicating on weekends to Stara Wieś.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Stara Wieś.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Old village.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: And it was – and Otwock was a region, or a village, or a town?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: No, Otwock was the largest city that the electrical train was – had the terminal there.</span> <span id="s349">So Stara Wieś was [indecipherable] and Stara Wieś, this was couple kilometers east of Otwock.</span> <span id="s350">Otwock was larger – larger –</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: City.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: – city, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s354">And how far was it from Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: This was around, let’s say, 30 kilometers or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: So it was almost like a suburb.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes, almost like a suburb.</span> <span id="s358">Now, as the Warsaw is growing, the Otwock is getting closer and closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: I remember the – I remember Otwock, because there was a diary of a ghetto policeman from Otwock that was written.</span> <span id="s360">A very interesting book –</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: – and a very heartrending book, because he was writing about his dilemma being a policeman.</span> <span id="s363">He did not survive the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s365">Now Otwock I also knew during the occupation, but maybe that’s a subject we should touch later on, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Well, let’s see, and we’ll see.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: When the Germans caught me at the main railroad station, because we had some business with the Hungarians, or Romanians and Germans, that was going to the eastern front, you know, to – for a – for a cover-up I used to be selling cigarettes or newspapers, something, because we deal – we dealt with the Hungarians and the other soldiers for schnapps.</span> <span id="s368">We could buy some good material for our, let’s say weapons, even pistols and so on.</span> <span id="s369">So when I was arrested by the Germans, I was young – 12 years – or 12 - 13 years old, and they put me in the prison on Poznanska Street, and I – they kept me there – because Germans actually gave to the blue policeman.</span> <span id="s370">We had Polish police.</span> <span id="s371">On the Polish side they were in blue uniforms, and the German gendarmerie, that was the German police that actually cooperated with the Polish policemen.</span> <span id="s372">And they gave me, as a youngster to the blue policemen, and they put me in jail.</span> <span id="s373">So I spend there a few weeks, and what happened is that I – I was young, undernourished, and I had some beginning of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s374">So the Polish underground, when they saw what was happening to me, they sent me to Olenika(ph), which was the sanitorium near Otwock.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: And there I was, let’s say, for a few months, to kill that –</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Tuberculosis?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: – beginning to – tuberculosis, I had sha – shadows in my lungs that were the sarg – larger size of a plum or an apple.</span> <span id="s379">And this finally was arrested and calcinations were formed, and I didn’t have an open tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s380">So they saved my life, so to speak.</span> <span id="s381">Tu-Tuberculosis was, during the time of occupation of Poland was a very common problem, because people are undernourished, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Was it a killer?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Wa – did people die from tuberculosis?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Open tuberculosis is very contagious.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s389">So there are many reasons to try and catch it, not only for the person themselves, but so that it wouldn’t become infectious and an epi – an epidemic.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s391">No, the – the – it was very close to epidemic, because we were receiving about 1500 calories, and that was not enough to – to – to die, and not enough to live normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: So the Poles were starving, but the poor Jewish guys, they were even worse, because they were getting about 500 calories a day.</span> <span id="s394">So they were destined for death.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s396">Okay, let’s return prewar.</span> <span id="s397">Was your family very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: I would say yes; Father especially, and my mother.</span> <span id="s399">And nearby – I mentioned the church where I was baptized; this was the Saint Alexander church on Three Crosses Square in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s400">But when we moved, we belonged to Saint Clement’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: These were the – oh, I forgot that – maybe it will come back to me, but the parish nearby, we were members of that parish, and during the uprising, and during the occupation, we attended the masses regularly on – on Sunday.</span> <span id="s403">And that was only couple blocks away.</span> <span id="s404">This church actually, I found that was damaged, yes, damaged, but it was rebuilt, and it’s still existing in.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: So did you go weekly to – was it a – was it a family tradition to go to mass every Sunday?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Yes, every Sunday we went to mass, and – at this church, or church – Boromeusz Church.</span> <span id="s407">This was close to the main entrance to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s408">This was at the point where I mentioned street Żelazna.</span> <span id="s409">Actually at that point Włodna and Elektoralna, that was a Y, sort of branches, that the church was in that triangle.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: And this was something that I had to be there on Sundays, and some other big holidays, because that was sort of obligatory from the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Ah.</span> <span id="s413">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: So the school – the schools’ students, pupils, were going to that special mass for the students.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: And that would be on a school day, or on Sundays?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: This was Sundays, and major holidays –</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Saint days and things.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: This was before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Yes, I’m talking before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Before the war, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Yeah, before the war.</span> <span id="s424">And you said that you had – it was a public school that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yes, the school was number 100.</span> <span id="s426">It was a new building, built during the 20 years of Polish independence, and I remember it very well, because that was a walking distance.</span> <span id="s427">And school was very clean, well illuminated.</span> <span id="s428">We used to have a very soft – soft slippers that we couldn’t bring the shoes normally from the street, with the hard soles that would damage shining floors.</span> <span id="s429">Nice windows, big windows; classrooms were spacious.</span> <span id="s430">So that was a nice time that I had during the time til 1939 –</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: – attending.</span> <span id="s433">And I finished, I think the fourth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: In – and – by 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s437">Tell me a little bit about your mother and father’s own family histories.</span> <span id="s438">Had they, either of them finished university, or gone to university?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: No, my – no, they didn’t have a higher education.</span> <span id="s440">My mother completed high school; and Father, he was sort of a business-minded man, and he did not get university studies behind him.</span> <span id="s441">But he was, let’s say a junior college, education-wise.</span> <span id="s442">And he served, during the time when Poland was still partitioned, he served in the Austria army, so his German was excellent, and partially I inherited the German language from him.</span> <span id="s443">So he was – during the occupation, he was employed by the Ostbahn.</span> <span id="s444">Ostbahn, east railroad – the Germans had westbound, eastbound, Reich-bahn.</span> <span id="s445">So this was part of the Reich-bahn, and he was, as an interpreter, working at the main central station there.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Well, that’s quite an interesting position to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: So you were – the main central station for the ost, for the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: For the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s454">This was located on the Jerusalem alley, and it’s still there, but the building was completely, let’s say, destroyed, but that area was used for the new structure that is the center Warsaw station.</span> <span id="s455">Very nice building, near – near that – what do they call it, the gift from Stalin, near the palace of the – the Stalin palace, but this was –</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Oh, I think I know the building you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: – a – a left – did you see that building?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: It looks almost like the one at mo – in Moscow, with similar structure.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s460">This was a style that the Russians ca – kept, that they preserved building the structures according to the drawings that they made for their university in Moscow.</span> <span id="s461">So the Alexanderplatz in Berlin was similar to this.</span> <span id="s462">Well, this was despised by the Poles, th-they used to laugh.</span> <span id="s463">I remember the first visit in Poland in 1950 – ’59, when driving with the guy that was a taxi driver, he asked me, says, the best view of Warsaw?</span> <span id="s464">You know where you get the best view of Warsaw?</span> <span id="s465">He says, the best view of Warsaw you get from the palace.</span> <span id="s466">I said, oh yeah?</span> <span id="s467">Why is that so?</span> <span id="s468">Well, cause when you in the palace, you don’t see the palace.</span> <span id="s469">You know, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Even the taxi driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Even the taxi driver, yes.</span> <span id="s472">He says that he – he was going a little further, he says, even that antenna that they built – they built that was a protective weapon that no Pole could climb up on the very top and do things, dirty things.</span> <span id="s473">They hated the structure, you know.</span> <span id="s474">It’s still existing.</span> <span id="s475">It’s like a monument of the Russian occupation of – of Poland.</span> <span id="s476">And this was a gift.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s478">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: My wife re – remembers this vividly because she was witnessing the erection of that –</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: The construction of this building.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: The construction of this, yes.</span> <span id="s482">I saw it finished.</span> <span id="s483">Now it’s dark.</span> <span id="s484">When – when you see when the two systems meet, the – th-the monument of the communism, versus against the – the – the capitalism, so to speak, of the skyscrapers, you know, na – modern buildings.</span> <span id="s485">It is – it is a contrast that you cannot simply understand, you know, how the Russians could build such a awful structure in the midst of that modern new Warsaw that is growing – growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Well, you know, in – architecture has its own stories.</span> <span id="s487">In architecture and geography too.</span> <span id="s488">You know, geography you would think is such a neutral subject, but geography encompasses maps and street names, and those changed so often, because of whatever political force happened to be in power in this part of the world.</span> <span id="s489">Okay –</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: You can – you can actually take a – Poland as an example of a migratory nation, because when you look – when you look at the history, the union with Lithuania was what, 15th century, when we were one country, Poland was actually the largest state in – in – in – in Europe; from the Black Sea all the way to the black – Baltic Sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: And the borders were changing so much, going eastbound, westbound, and that’s why the Poles are of some different characters, because the days of occupation changed the people.</span> <span id="s493">And since the borders moved, the people moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: That’s true, that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: That was tr-tragic in a way, but when Polish borders were set up in Yalta, Potsdam and other places where the destiny of Poland was set up with the matches, they were laughing that Churchill, Stalin and President Roosevelt, they were setting up the borders of Poland with the m –</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: With the matchsticks.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: – matches.</span> <span id="s498">And then the famous Curzon line, the [indecipherable] of Curzon, you know, that divided the portion of eastern part of Poland, and the western part of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: You mean during the war itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: During the war itself.</span> <span id="s501">In 1939 – we jumping from subject to subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: We are.</span> <span id="s503">It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: But that mixture maybe will give you a little better idea what – that time, in ’39, there was that infamous pact of Ribbentrop-Molotov.</span> <span id="s505">Thirty-nine when the Russia was befriended with Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: With Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: With Germany.</span> <span id="s508">And this was – we call it the fourth partition of Poland, and the border line, Curzon Line actually came into picture.</span> <span id="s509">Because now – it – there is a certain similarity what they doing now in Ukraine, you know, when they coming to protect their brothers and sisters, living in the administrative territory of eastern Ukraine, that was happening in the eastern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s510">They came to resc – rescue the Ukrainians minority that lived there, and the Byelorussian minority, and all the part of north – northeast part of Poland that’s Lithuania nowadays.</span> <span id="s511">They were trying to save their people from the Polish tyranny.</span> <span id="s512">So the borders were moving and then we sometimes laughed that we have Poles with so many German names, and we have Germans with the Polish names.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: It got all mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: It got all mixed, and – through all of these chess players –</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: – you know, on the – on the field.</span> <span id="s518">Let’s go back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Let’s go back again.</span> <span id="s521">In the – at – I wanted to find out more about your families’ histories.</span> <span id="s522">That is, what kind of a family did your father come from, and that your mother came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: They were, let’s say Father, his brother owned a larger piece of land near Kielce.</span> <span id="s524">And Mother was living in that area, before they moved into Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: So they were rather the agricultural, farmer – farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Farm people.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s529">And when they lived in Warsaw, they changed their style completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Oh, did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yes, because you know, as they came from the smaller – smaller places, into big city like this.</span> <span id="s532">So this was a major change –</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Did they feel –</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: – in their style of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Did they feel – were they comfortable in Warsaw –</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: – did they feel good –</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Sister, for instance – we di – we were not rich, but we were pretty well-to-do, and Sister was going to ballet school.</span> <span id="s539">I was going to the normal public school, but later on, during the occupation, they had to dish out money so I could go to the secondary school, unofficial –</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: – secondary schools.</span> <span id="s542">And the sister was much older than I am, so she was continuing that – let’s say musical education that she wanted to finish, but that was very difficult.</span> <span id="s543">Difficult because living conditions were very –</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Living conditions were rough, very rough.</span> <span id="s546">People were rather concerned how to survive from day to day.</span> <span id="s547">They couldn’t have any plans at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s549">You –</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: I remember as a kid I used to say goodbye to my parents going to school, because I didn’t know whether I – I am gonna come back, you know, in peace.</span> <span id="s551">So city was living in a very, how shall I say, warlike atmosphere.</span> <span id="s552">Strit – streets were not safe.</span> <span id="s553">Streetcars were – very often street was blocked, and people were taken by force into the – the trucks, and put into the camp to be sent to work in – in – in Germany.</span> <span id="s554">Slave laborers.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: So, it just – you wouldn’t know, when you were on the streetcar, whether or not you’ll make your destination.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Is that what you’re saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s559">Nervousness.</span> <span id="s560">Nervousness was a controlled – a very rude way by the Germans.</span> <span id="s561">At the beginning – that was – I’m speaking of 1940, very rough winter in Warsaw, because it was very cold, and then ’42 – ’42, ’41 – ’42, when the separation of the population was getting to the point that they build the ghetto, and they separated Aryan population from the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s562">And then ’43, the conditions started changing where that German behavior, after Korksk(ph) and Stalingrad changed their attitude.</span> <span id="s563">They sort of mellowed down, you know, that’s – that greeting of high Hitler, with the hand raised very high, changed a little bit like, just in case we lose, high Hitler with the little – smaller – smaller gesture.</span> <span id="s564">We were laughing, and – but we sensed that was a city that was witnessing the change in the German attitude.</span> <span id="s565">Stalingrad was a major – major change in the German bravura, the German spirit of vic-victory for any cost.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: So, I’ll ask one question about this, and then I want to go back still, to pre-war.</span> <span id="s567">Did people know about German losses in Stalingrad?</span> <span id="s568">I mean, after all, they controlled the media.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Oh yes, yes, they – let’s say, the German propaganda was very strong when the Operation Barbarossa starts.</span> <span id="s570">You know, they named – the code name Barbarossa was the time when the Germans attacked Russia.</span> <span id="s571">This was a sh – shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: So you mean June 21st?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: I am saying June 21st, I think, 1941.</span> <span id="s574">Am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yeah, ’41.</span> <span id="s577">And th-the Operation Barbarossa was observed by us very closely.</span> <span id="s578">I was already a part of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Don’t talk about that, just about – I – what I wanted to know about is, how much did people know about the Battle of Stalingrad in ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s581">Let’s say, we drew conclusions what was happening in the eastern front, when we saw trains going through Warsaw with the German sol – German soldiers, you know, that no ears, no noses, no hands, because of the frostbites, from that famous Russian general.</span> <span id="s582">You know the fis – famous Russian general?</span> <span id="s583">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: General – General Winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: General Winter, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: And we were witnessing, plus the Germans themselves were telling these stories, and somehow the rumor was spreading out among – and then we had envoys from the Polish Home Army that were going sometimes eastbound.</span> <span id="s588">And they knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s589">Plus, we were getting the news from the BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: See, the radios were confiscated.</span> <span id="s592">All radios were confiscated when the Germans entered.</span> <span id="s593">But we were smart enough not to give all the radios away.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Did your family have a radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Oh yes, before the war we had a radio, because Mama, as I said, my mother was running that little cafeteria for the radio producer.</span> <span id="s596">Radio Union(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Oh, so she wasn’t working for the same organization as your father, she was running a cafeteria for another organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: So this, to make the ends meet, you know, both of them were working to send us through schools, and all the exp –</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Did she have any help at home for – I mean, hired help, or did she do everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Oh yeah, Stefcha(ph) – Stefcha(ph) – Steffa(ph) – Steffa(ph) was the girl that was actually sort of taking care of us –</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: – my sister and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s606">Okay, so before the war, you had a radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: We had the radio, we had telephone.</span> <span id="s608">That was not the modern, you know, iPhone like we have here.</span> <span id="s609">That was on the wall, with that little receiver that you are putting in, the dial –</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: You mean, your phone – your phone wasn’t a map service, and wasn’t a laundry service, and wasn’t a camera as well, like the iPhone is?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: No.</span> <span id="s612">No, we could call, let’s say, the operator for a weather report, or things like that, but that was the long way.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s614">So – so you had a phone, you had a radio.</span> <span id="s615">Did your parents own an automobile?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Let’s say, that was time when we had a couple cars that we rented for taxi.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: For taxi, you know.</span> <span id="s619">So later on, when there was no gas, there were no need for cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: So you rent – your family rented cars out and used them as taxis to make money?</span> <span id="s621">Is this what there was –</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: No, it’s a – when that firm actually was very close to – to bankruptcy, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Father received this, I should say, a premium, like, that were two cars that he repaired, and then he rented out to the guys that were taxi drivers.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Oh, and so he got some – some – he got some percentage of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s628">So the firm that he was working in, which was – tell me again, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: First Galena(ph) Samochodowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: And that was to do parts for buses, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: To buy parts for –</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: These were – these were the intercity buses.</span> <span id="s634">Not like a Greyhound, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Much smaller, but they were going from city to city, alongside the railroads.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: And did that – did that company go bankrupt before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: No, no, this lasted til 1939.</span> <span id="s639">Actually, some of the buses, some of the cars were requisitioned by the army when the war started in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I remember a visit of some high ranking officers that came over, and they were discussing what cars can be used by the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: The Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Polish army, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s645">Okay, now I want to turn to another subject; again, before the war.</span> <span id="s646">What were the kinds of conversations that you would have around the dinner table with your family?</span> <span id="s647">Did you talk about political events, and political things?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Say Poles all together, they have, let’s say, great interest in – in politics.</span> <span id="s649">And especially since Poland was exposed to all different, let’s say pressures from the west, from the east.</span> <span id="s650">Discussions at the table, and friends of my father came over.</span> <span id="s651">They were officers from the – active officers from the – from the Polish army.</span> <span id="s652">They discuss at the table the issues of Poland being such a strong country, that they – the Germans will attack Poland, we will resist, and then so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s653">So the talks were on the subject of military efforts, and – an-and Europe at that time was sort of sensing oncoming second World War.</span> <span id="s654">So these discussions, I remember that the father was discussing this.</span> <span id="s655">But when we had gatherings that my mother’s brother coming from Otwock for – sometimes for a weekends, or summertime, so we were going there, discussions were different, you know.</span> <span id="s656">Our schooling time, and then changes in the economy that were improving little by little; because you know, country was actually devastated during the first World War, and the oppressors, the occupiers, they – they were taking their share.</span> <span id="s657">So we could not develop, just like western Europe developed free, and that momentum that they had could not be, let’s say, shown in the Polish economy.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Well, here’s a question that’s a bit provocative, and I know in advance that it is.</span> <span id="s659">But there is the image, that when the war started, and Germany crossed the border into Poland with tanks, they were met by cavalry officers on horses and swords.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: This is – actually, this was a false story.</span> <span id="s661">Some of the big cavalry units were surrounded by the German, let’s say motorized units.</span> <span id="s662">And when they locked in, they tried to escape, but they were not, let’s say, crazy enough to attack with the lances against the German tanks, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s664">I mean – I-I mean more that Poland was so unprepared that it didn’t have tanks of its own, that it didn’t have modern military equipment.</span> <span id="s665">Is that so, or is that a falsehood?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: That’s falsehood.</span> <span id="s667">We had air force.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: That’s a – not as modern as the Germans had, but very effective.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: We had our own design, let’s say WSK Kalisz and that PZL-11.</span> <span id="s672">These airplanes were not large in numbers, because this was a developing industry in Poland, the aircraft industry.</span> <span id="s673">The tanks, they were not built in Poland, but we had tanks vic – Vickers tanks from – imported from England.</span> <span id="s674">And we had the motorized units.</span> <span id="s675">We had the motorized brigade that actually later on, became the first armored division in the west, under General Maczek, af you – if you heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s677">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: And when – when Poland army was formed, let’s say we had so much experience with the enemies that the army was indoctrinated well enough to be spiritually strong.</span> <span id="s679">Equipment-wise, we were inferiors to Germans.</span> <span id="s680">We were inferiors – spirit of fighting was much stronger maybe that the Germans had.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: So the morale was high.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Morality of the army was high, morale was high, but the equipment was inferior, inferior.</span> <span id="s683">But very effective.</span> <span id="s684">Because remember, when the – when the Germans attacked us from three directions, actually; from East Prussia, going south; from the Reich, they were going east, and from the south, they were attacked through – Czechoslovakia was already annexed by the – by the Reich, by the Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s686">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: And at that time also Slovakia joined the German camp.</span> <span id="s688">So we had some – part of the invasion of ch – Slovaks into Poland, the German armies, and then armies from the East Prussia that was coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: And that was all September 1st, 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yes, September 1939.</span> <span id="s691">So, wi – most of our defenses were directed against the Germans coming from the west.</span> <span id="s692">We did not expect the Russians will stab us in the back on the 17th of September.</span> <span id="s693">They attacked to come and free their people that were living in Kresy, which was the Volhynia, Polesie, Podole, and the Nowogródek, closer to Lithuania, as we were.</span> <span id="s694">So Kresy were liberated, quotation marks, by the – by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: So there was no knowledge of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: In Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Yes, there was knowledge, yes, we knew, we knew about it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: At the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Because it was signed one week before the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Yes, but we knew it.</span> <span id="s703">Don’t forget that the Polish dwika(ph), which was the, let’s say, compared to – to FBI or CIA, the Secret Service, and so on, we had a very good sensors everywhere in – in –</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: – in Prussia and in – in Germany, especially in Berlin.</span> <span id="s706">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So you had intelligence reports, the con – the government had intelligence reports.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Oh yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s710">But then –</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: And these were prior to the – prior to the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s712">We were pretty well advanced in decoding German messages.</span> <span id="s713">“Enigma” is – that’s the movie nowadays –</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: – going on, I don’t know if you see it.</span> <span id="s716">I didn’t see it, but I would like to see it, because there was a great contribution to the victory of the allied effort during the second World War, by giving the – giving the English and French the secrets of enigma.</span> <span id="s717">What was started was the getting in, was the mathematical school that the Poles attended in 1932.</span> <span id="s718">And the connections that the Germany had with East Prussia was via the enigma.</span> <span id="s719">They were sending codes, and all different secret information.</span> <span id="s720">So the Poles started getting interest in it, and Zygalski, Rafski(ph), and there was a third name that I forgot, but the – these were the three codebreakers, later on that they work for the Polish secret service.</span> <span id="s721">And this was in July 1939, when from England, Poland signed the agreement to be defended by England and France, in case that we get attacked by the Germans.</span> <span id="s722">But anyway, going back to that point that the British paid a visit to Poland, Pery(ph) was the name of the town in the suburb of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s723">Poles had copied two machines that were intercepted.</span> <span id="s724">When they send this to East Prussia, it went via Warsaw.</span> <span id="s725">So the secret service took the machines, dismembered them, photographed them, do everything possible to reproduce the machines.</span> <span id="s726">And some of the copies were so identical that the Germans wouldn’t be able to recognize which is the original, which is the copy.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Oh, so then you started fueling disinformation?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yeah, so when they came over, the British, Knox and Denniston, I think, they were two gentlemen, and the Frenchman, Bernard, Colonel Bernard came over, and they were actually exchanging their accomplishment that field of cryptology, with the Poles.</span> <span id="s729">And they were very surprised when the Poles simply showed them that, we have two gifts from you.</span> <span id="s730">One machine for the British, M – M – MI-6, I believe, and the French secret – military secret to Colonel Bernard.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: So they gave these two enigma –</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Enigmas to our allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s734">Okay, this shows how much you know about – I mean, very few people know the detail of this – these sorts of events.</span> <span id="s735">But when I asked of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and did people know about it, I – I need to be more precise.</span> <span id="s736">Did the man on the street know about it, or did the government know about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: I’d say, speaking of government, Polish government, when Poland was attacked, escaped, with a lot of trained personnel; most of the Polish airmen went through Romania – Romania was ally of Poland – and most of them escaped through Hungary and Romania to the west.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: So when the government left Poland, ji – was General Rydz-Śmigły, and Mościcki was the president.</span> <span id="s740">Mościcki was actually a – a s – a Swiss.</span> <span id="s741">He was educated in Switzerland and so on.</span> <span id="s742">But anyway, when they left, the official, legal Polish government was formed in France.</span> <span id="s743">In exile, they – we called it.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: So through that government, and the connections of the Polish underground, and the government in France, and later on when France was defeated, they moved to London.</span> <span id="s746">And then came picture of President Raczkiewicz, if you know, and then Sikorski, General Sikorski.</span> <span id="s747">He was a premier of the Polish government in exile.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Through that government, and the connections of Polish underground, you know, there was an exchange of news, views, and interviews, whatever was happening in the west, and especially in the Germany.</span> <span id="s750">You know, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: So that – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: – so they were well informed.</span> <span id="s753">The members of the underground in Poland was – were – were very well informed of what was behind the screen going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s755">What about people like your family, like your neighbors.</span> <span id="s756">Did you know of – of – were – were – was the regular person in Warsaw as well informed, or were they surprised?</span> <span id="s757">Because you see, when you say something like, the Soviet Union stabbed Poland in the back, that – that suggests a surprise.</span> <span id="s758">And if you’re very well informed, you won’t be surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Let’s say, we had so many refugees in Warsaw during the war, as the Germans advanced from the west –</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: – toward Warsaw.</span> <span id="s762">Eight – on the eighth day of operations, they were already at the gates of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s763">So we had refugees coming from the west into Warsaw, and we had refugees coming from the east into Warsaw.</span> <span id="s764">So, this melting pot, this city, the capital city was sort of a source of all kind of gossip; good news, bad news.</span> <span id="s765">So the people were pretty well informed.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Even the – in the streets, average Pole not maybe educated well enough, but still –</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Knew something.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: – people say.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: People talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: And this was an exchange of news.</span> <span id="s772">Plus, you know, we had hidden radios, we were listening to the BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s774">So now I’ve jumped ahead a little bit.</span> <span id="s775">I want to go back to the very beginning.</span> <span id="s776">Do you remem – the very beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s777">Do you remember where you were on September 1st, 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: September 1st, 1939, prior the day to that outbreak and attack by the Germans, I was walking with my sister toward the deli store nearby, and we were talking about – because the – that was in the atmosphere that Poles – we are so strong that if they attacked us, the third day, our forces will be in Berlin, you know.</span> <span id="s779">So I talked to my sister, I says, would you be – Helena, would you be interested to – to – to see the war, what it is like?</span> <span id="s780">And she says yes, it will be very interesting.</span> <span id="s781">So, as kids, you know, young people, we were talking about the oncoming disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: And you were 10, and she was 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s785">It’s – you were kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s787">The kids, but you know, th-th – the kids, let’s say, in – in – in adopted country, here in United States, they are not as mature as the kids in – in – in – living in the conditions, wartime conditions.</span> <span id="s788">Kids mature fast.</span> <span id="s789">You know, when you’re in danger, y-you don’t think about baseball, TV sets, and things at the time that was not existing.</span> <span id="s790">But we were seriously interested of what was going on.</span> <span id="s791">When I joined the underground – maybe that’s a subject later on –</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: – this was 1940 – ’42, I was – I was what, 12 - 13 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: You were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: I was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: You were young.</span> <span id="s797">You were young.</span> <span id="s798">Okay, so the day before, you remember going to the deli with your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: What about the day itself?</span> <span id="s801">When did you learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: We learn the first, when we saw the German airplanes flying over, and the Polish anti-aircraft artillery opened the full blast, whatever was necessary to protect our skies, I saw the dogfights of the Polish P-11 fighter planes in the sky.</span> <span id="s803">The Messerschmitts were much faster, and they were metal planes.</span> <span id="s804">But the planes that Poland had, had a very [phone ringing][break]</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: So you – you saw the Polish planes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: The Polish planes.</span> <span id="s807">The anti-aircraft – actually, there was a heavy machine gun position near that Clement’s church, in their garden, you know, they set up near the church, because you know, the religious Germans would not maybe mount an attack somewhat close to the church.</span> <span id="s808">But this – this post was manned by the – by the Polish army, and the anti-aircraft was very effective.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Were any of them shot down?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: I saw, let’s say, smoke trails, three times.</span> <span id="s811">One was, I think, Polish airplane, and then the two Messerschmitts went down.</span> <span id="s812">The conflict that lasted from first of September til sixth of October, the losses that the Germans suffered in the air force – they say that the Polish air force was grounded and non-existing, on the contrary.</span> <span id="s813">I have a book written by Becker, a German writer, who said that first 16 days, there was a very effective strength of Polish air force.</span> <span id="s814">Pilots were very well trained in Dęblin air academy.</span> <span id="s815">And these pilots that were fighting in 1939 over the Polish skies, they escape through Romania, through France, to England.</span> <span id="s816">And they were part of the – part of the battle – Battle of Britain.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: So, in other words, did they become – did they set up the training for the RAF pilots, and for Polish pilots over – over Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: The RAF, yes, that was the – Doening(ph), General Doening(ph), the head of the RAF.</span> <span id="s819">He was very skeptical, because there was a language barrier, and actually, he finally, when he saw what the damages the Luftwaffe did to the British, he decided to accept the Polish contingent of air pilots, and there were two squadrons formed.</span> <span id="s820">Three or two, and three or through – three.</span> <span id="s821">Kościuszko Squadron.</span> <span id="s822">I even have a poster that I can later on show you.</span> <span id="s823">These pilots – if you saw a movie, “Battle of Britain,” there were Poles, very brave, and we had the highest score, beating the Germans on equal basis, you know, because Spitfires and Hurricanes were equivalent to Messerschmitts.</span> <span id="s824">Or Dornier, or whatever they had, the bombing airplanes, the Heinkels and Dorniers, and all the weapons that Goering provided for – for the Operation Sea Lion, whatever it was, he wanted to put Britain on the – on her knees.</span> <span id="s825">And the fight was very, let’s say, effective.</span> <span id="s826">So the pilots, the pilots that left Poland, they put their talent to action in England, when they had better airplanes, but the spirit very strong.</span> <span id="s827">The – the British were a little skeptical, because of the language, and we were not so very obedient.</span> <span id="s828">We had our style of fighting in the sky, and the guys really, when they attacked, th-th-the British squadron leader at that time, there was a Canadian by the name of Kent.</span> <span id="s829">He was trying to control the disobedience of Pole, how to attack the Germans, but the results were rather – very effective.</span> <span id="s830">Realize that the Poles in England, with 15 squadrons, four bomber squadrons.</span> <span id="s831">We accounted for almost 1000 German planes shot in the air, th-the dogfights.</span> <span id="s832">One thousand, that’s a big –</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: That’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: – big score.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: That’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: The 303 was the Kościuszko Squadron.</span> <span id="s837">And why we named the Kościuszko Squadron was the story of Kościuszko heard that we got as a rep – re-reprocity.</span> <span id="s838">See, the Poland regained her independence, thanks to President Wilson.</span> <span id="s839">And at that time Americans wanted to pay the – pay the dues for – for fighting, for independence of Poland from the Bolsheviks; this is the first World War.</span> <span id="s840">And 18 American pilots, Americans, they formed the squadrons that fought the Bolsheviks.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: And they were the Kościuszko Squadron.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: And Kościuszko name for the bri – Battle of Britain was with the insignia of the same thing of Kościuszko, with the American flag, with the two [indecipherable] like this, I show you later on –</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: – in that poster.</span> <span id="s847">But that was paid respect for the Poles for our, let’s say, contribution to the independence of the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: That was now the General Pulaski that was, that died in Savanna, Georgia.</span> <span id="s850">The father of American cavalry.</span> <span id="s851">And Kościuszko, the father of West Point.</span> <span id="s852">I don’t know if you ever visited West Point?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: I – I haven’t, but – and I didn’t know that he would have been the founder of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Yes, he started this whole thing, as a stronghold against the Brits.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: And there’s a big bol – Kościuszko monument in the square of the – and there are many – many artifacts, and remembrances.</span> <span id="s857">Jefferson was that –</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: He called Kościuszko as a – the son – the true son of freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: I do know who Kościuszko was, of course, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: – that – but I didn’t know this about West Point.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Yeah, West Point.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: That was acad – a military academy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Right, sure.</span> <span id="s867">Okay, that’s a far away from Warsaw, and September first –</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Yes, okay, yes, I’m sorry for that [indecipherable] –</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: – because you are actually the guidance.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: You the – you’re the GPS.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: I know, but you have such interesting – interesting observations that I want to hear them, and then we get off track.</span> <span id="s874">All right, so we’re back down – we’re back at Warsaw.</span> <span id="s875">You see at least three trails of smoke; two from Messerschmitts in the very beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: And then how did the following days unvel – unfold and develop, in those first few days of –</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Few – few days of –</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: – in Warsaw, and what do you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: – let’s say – in eight – eight or ninth of September, the German forces were surrounding the city.</span> <span id="s881">Warsaw was defending herself til the 28th of September.</span> <span id="s882">No water, no ammunition, so that forced us to – to surrender.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Okay, here’s my question, though: what was happening with your family?</span> <span id="s884">A: My family, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: I want to know what happened with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: This – we – on the 11th, I think, on the 11th of September, I saw the Germans’ planes coming over and making some white streaks in the sky, and let’s say a few hours later, a heavy artillery bombardment started.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: So you hadn't heard any bombs before?</span> <span id="s888">No bombs were falling on Warsaw –</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: No, there were bombs – bombs bombing was, but not the part that we lived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: That was the direct hit that they started attacking the complex, because the repair shops of these transportation company, they looked like hangars, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Aha, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: – buildings, and the other buildings were sort of industrial.</span> <span id="s894">So when they marked, the artillery barrage started.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: And it was so powerful that the whole thing – we only were saving was our lives, that’s all, because there was such a quick, rapid involvement in flames, under the attack, that I remember we were trying to save one person that was locked behind the doors, and we were trying to break the lock to get to, because when we found it th-th-that a man had both legs cut off.</span> <span id="s897">So we tried to save him, but it was in vain.</span> <span id="s898">We saved one –</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: I – I don’t – I don’t understand, what is it that you – I understand you’re saying that man had both – how did – who was he, and where was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: No, he was a repairman or a watchman in that company that was in the – in the – in the repair shops, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s902">And the – and the bomb fell, and the or –</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: The – the – the artillery shells were falling left and right.</span> <span id="s904">The char – the buildings were inflamed.</span> <span id="s905">And – and – and – and we were trying to save lives.</span> <span id="s906">People – wounded – wounded people, so I was running around, trying to find the rubber hoses from the gas ovens, to use as –</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Tourniquets.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: – tourniquets to stop the bleeding.</span> <span id="s909">We were carrying some of the wounded people to the hospital next few blocks, on Płocka Street, in Wola.</span> <span id="s910">But whenever we delivered them to the hospital, most of them were – bled to death.</span> <span id="s911">So, we couldn’t save them.</span> <span id="s912">But when the houses, our houses, our apartment were all destroyed.</span> <span id="s913">You know who came to our rescue?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: We had orphanage across the street, orphanage of Korczak’s.</span> <span id="s916">Korczak.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Oh, Janusz Korczak?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Janusz Korczak.</span> <span id="s919">His real name was Goldsmith, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Janusz Korczak gave us a protection in his house, that was somehow saved.</span> <span id="s922">And I was in the basement.</span> <span id="s923">He was feeding me the oatmeals for a couple weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Korczak.</span> <span id="s926">I knew him personally, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: How did you know him?</span> <span id="s928">As a –</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: How did I know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: In – he provided shelter for us.</span> <span id="s932">I remember he was in Polish uniform with the – with the rank of lieutenant, I think.</span> <span id="s933">The – he was in the Polish armed forces, in the uniform, because as a reserve officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Had you known him before this?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: No, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: – no, no.</span> <span id="s938">We met during that disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: So your own apartment was bombed out?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s941">His house still stays there.</span> <span id="s942">There’s a monument of Janusz Korczak in the yard, in the courtyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: [indecipherable] I have some pictures of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Well, tell us, you know, for those who will not know, who was Janusz Korczak?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Oh, Janusz Korczak was the educator and teacher, well-known in western Europe, how to develop a child’s, let’s say, spiritual background.</span> <span id="s947">And he was teaching the Polish schools about how to bring up the children the right way.</span> <span id="s948">He was a doctor by – by profession.</span> <span id="s949">He was very well-known among the Poles, and also abroad, as a writer, and teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: What happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: What happened to him.</span> <span id="s952">When – when the Germans build the ghetto, he was taken with the children – there was about 200 children –</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Were they Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yes, m – Jewish, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: So this was a Jewish orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: All Jewish orphanage, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: He was moved to Chłodna Street, that was a building where they accommodated them, and this was in the portion that I mentioned before, when the small ghetto was adjacent to the large ghetto through three, four blocks, between Żelazna and Wronia, along the Chłodna Street, Chłodna Street.</span> <span id="s959">So I remember, as child going to that trade school, we had the backpacks.</span> <span id="s960">We used to use our blouses and backpacks for food.</span> <span id="s961">When we bordered the streetcar that was going through that three blocks of both ghettoes, we used to empty our –</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Backpacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: – backpacks, and – and whatever food we could share, we were throwing it on the street so the kids from the building actually were picking it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: So, in other words, they were allowed to go on the street.</span> <span id="s965">The streetcar – you couldn’t leave the streetcar, but you could throw things out the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Yes, yes, the – the police blew – policemen that were protecting people from getting off the streetcar, or getting on the streetcar, because streetcar didn’t stop in that segment, you know, it was going from the Towarowa Street, which was the – let’s say two blocks to Wronia, and then about four blocks to Żelazna.</span> <span id="s967">And this portion was off limits to the Aryans, and vice-a-versa.</span> <span id="s968">The Jews couldn’t board the – the streetcars to get out from ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: And did this streetcar operate throughout the – the whole time the ghetto was in existence?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Yes, the streetcars were going to through the main – main thoroughfares, through Warsaw, and through ghetto, with the – the streetcar, our streetcars, the Aryan side, used to have the numbers.</span> <span id="s971">The Jewish portion, they used to have the Star of David –</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: I see, so they would –</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: – on that round –</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: – signal sign.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: So there were actually Jewish streetcars?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Let’s say manned by the Polish operators, but going through the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: And only the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Only to ghetto, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: And after, let’s say, that Chłodna Street, when things got bad, the Korczak orphans were moved to Sienna Street, Sienna Street, which is close to the Palace of Science that Stalin gived.</span> <span id="s982">Even now when I visited Warsaw, there is a Korczak monument near the fountain, you know, as he’s embracing children.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: I see, but then – but the Stalin building wasn’t there yet, this is all before this.</span> <span id="s984">The – the building that – that you say was the gift of Stalin, wasn’t there at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: This was before this.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: This was before that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: So, from there, from Sienna Street, where the monument of Korczak is located in Warsaw, the kids were taken, and he walked with the orphans to the Treblinka for gas – for being gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: So that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Korczak died with these – with these orphans.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: There is a Korczak Park here in Chicago, as a – as a memory of –</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: – of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Korczak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Korczak.</span> <span id="s1005">And he took you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: There’s a book – there is a book written about that – I forgot the title of it, but it’s access to very many – many, many, let’s say publications on that subject of Korczak in that library, the Jewish library on Tłomackie Street, near – in the vicinity of that previous synagogue –</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1008">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: – in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1010">If you’re ever interested in this, go to Tłomackie Museum, maybe they relocated some of it to that new museum that’s on Nalewki(ph) Street, near the Umschlagplatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1012">So, how many people did Korczak take in after this bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: I would say there were about 200 kids, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: I mean, that’s how many there were before the bo –</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Before that, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: And then, since – since the artillery fire, and your bi – your home was destroyed, how many did he take in?</span> <span id="s1017">New people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Oh, the refugees?</span> <span id="s1019">I would say ma – my family was there, and maybe some three or four other groups – families that were in that basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: So you could have been about 40 people, or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: I would say, yeah – about that, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1023">And you said you got to speak with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Oh, he was – he was – he was delivering the o – oatmeals, you know, I was exhausted from that fire and then that shock from the artillery bombings, so I was sort of shaken up to the point that he had to calm me down with – whenever he was bringing the hot oatmeal to me, he was almost feeding me, so I could eat, you know.</span> <span id="s1025">So, he was very soft.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Did he say anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Oh, he said, you look very, very tired to me, you look very tired, so I have to help you to rebuild your strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: That sounds great, very kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Because you know, during the siege of Warsaw that lasted 28 days, our food supplies were exhausted.</span> <span id="s1034">The water was short, a shortage of water, and the resistance was strong, very strong.</span> <span id="s1035">We defended Warsaw for so long, and the Germans admired the – the knighthood of the Polish army that I’m after.</span> <span id="s1036">Because de-defending Warsaw was a guy by the name of Rommel, General Rommel, the Polish side.</span> <span id="s1037">I don’t know if there was any connection of that Erwin Rommel in Africa, or Rommel General.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: How interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Yeah, Rommel –</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: And how ironic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1042">Juliusz Rómmel.</span> <span id="s1043">And there was another general, Czuma, Czuma, I think his son was here in Chicago for a while, but he returned to Poland.</span> <span id="s1044">Czuma.</span> <span id="s1045">Czuma, c-z-u-m-a, Czuma.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: So, where did you go after you were at this orphanage?</span> <span id="s1047">You didn’t stay there forever?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: On the orphanage, what we did is, portion of the building that was not completely damaged, so to speak of, so we covered the windows that were all broken, the floor, the doors.</span> <span id="s1049">We tried to rebuild whatever space was available.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Did you return to your old apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Ah, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Thi-This whole thing was collapsed.</span> <span id="s1054">The next – next possession, next building which I mentioned to you, this was a portion of that was offices, portion were this mechanical shop, or textile shop and some chemical stuff that they were doing upstairs.</span> <span id="s1055">Portion of the offices we converted to our, let’s say, primitive living quarters.</span> <span id="s1056">No water.</span> <span id="s1057">The windows we covered with whatever.</span> <span id="s1058">We didn’t have plastic, but there was something very foggy that we covered too, because the winter of 1940 was so severe that – frost was so strong that the pigeons were falling off the balconies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Very severe winter, minus 40 centigrade, almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: That’s huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: That’s huge, for a place that’s not that far north.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: And there we was – we were – let’s say, the Germans, when they entered the city, some of the squares they set up the salamanders, you know, they were salamanders, they were like a coke ovens, and they heated up so the people could – could warm themselves.</span> <span id="s1065">And Wehrmacht at that time, they set up field kitchens – can you imagine, for the civilians.</span> <span id="s1066">The Wehrmacht was behaving like a regular – regular army.</span> <span id="s1067">No – no behavior like the SS, or – or – or the, let’s say gent – the – the field police.</span> <span id="s1068">Later on when the secondary units came, the Wehrmacht left, you know, so there was a change in attitude toward the civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: So, you move back across the street, and – and into one of the offices that now you converted –</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: I returned back to the next possession actually, that was adjacent to the area where we lived.</span> <span id="s1071">After the fire, we rebuild it.</span> <span id="s1072">I remember we had two rooms at the beginning, the whole family.</span> <span id="s1073">And there was a family by the name of Bront(ph), Bront(ph).</span> <span id="s1074">I think that was a – a German citizen, and his wife was Polish, Behrowska(ph), and they had a daughter, Danuta(ph).</span> <span id="s1075">And I think this family, because of the German roots, they signed the volks – Volksliste.</span> <span id="s1076">They sign up to be part of, let’s say that superior race.</span> <span id="s1077">So they lived in the two – they displaced us from the two rooms, and they – we were moved to the single room.</span> <span id="s1078">Four people, single room.</span> <span id="s1079">So, they later on moved out from the area, into a special section of the city that was reserved for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: I see, I see.</span> <span id="s1081">Did they have children, or was this only a couple?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: They’re a couple, they had one child, there was – that was Danuta(ph).</span> <span id="s1083">And when she came to visit us during the occupation, she was that hio – the ha – Hitlerjugend, but she was the mädel, the – the – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Ah, Wundersdeutchen mädels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: – mädel.</span> <span id="s1086">Wundersdeutches mädel.</span> <span id="s1087">Yeah, she came in uniform, and we couldn’t talk too much to her, even though they were – she was very befriended with my sister, going to the ballet school together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: But things changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: It’s changed, yes.</span> <span id="s1090">Now, I remember when I walked in when they were occupying that two room apartment, I remember the Griffarts(ph) on the wall.</span> <span id="s1091">You know the name Griffarts(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: No, what’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Oh, the German staff officers used to call Hitler Griffarts(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Griffarts(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Griffarts(ph).</span> <span id="s1096">This was abbreviation of – of grüsste – grüsste feldherr aller zeit.</span> <span id="s1097">The – the – the greatest field Marshall of all times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Griffarts(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Griffarts(ph), yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: And was it a term of respect and endearment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Well, you know, the Wehrmacht were – tha-that was endearment – I – I rather not, because later on Hitler acted like a strategist, because he had dreams, you know.</span> <span id="s1102">So – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: You mean, like dreams at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: At night, yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: – that he was trying to implement these dreams into the action, you know.</span> <span id="s1107">Manstein – Manstein, his number one strategist on the eastern front, he had to listen to the fuehrer, you know.</span> <span id="s1108">So the officers among themselves, from time to time they used the name –</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: So they had a picture – okay, so, in their apartment, you – the – the Brandt(ph) family had Griffarts(ph) on the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: He had the fuehrer on the wall, so that – to us it was a shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Groste Feldmarschall –</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Feldherr aller zeit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Aller zeit.</span> <span id="s1114">Groste Feldherr aller zeit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: – zeit, yeah.</span> <span id="s1116">Griffarts(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Griffarts(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Never heard of it before.</span> <span id="s1120">Very interesting.</span> <span id="s1121">Can we cut now for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Thaddeus Gubala, on January 27th, 2015.</span> <span id="s1125">And I would like to pick up where we left off before the break.</span> <span id="s1126">And from what I remember, we were talking about the Volksdeutsche family neighbors that had been in – near you, who displaced you from your own small quarters after the arsenal – the artillery bombs and shells of your own apartment, and had a picture of Hitler on their walls in their own place.</span> <span id="s1127">And he was called the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Griffarts(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Griffarts(ph).</span> <span id="s1130">Griffarts(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Groste Feldherr aller zeit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Groste – groste Feldherr aller zeit, and their daughter belonged to the association of young German girls, and – and she no longer – she had been a friend with your sister, but then they no longer could really be close after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Superiority of race.</span> <span id="s1134">This – the – they disconnected our good relations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: So how did your lives then – I mean, they wer – ye – it was – your life was turned over because you lost your place to live, and Warsaw was now occupied by – by the German Wehrmacht, and soon – how did things develop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Let’s say the control of the city – I think that was a Fisher, the – the governor of the city, because Frank was – Frank was in Kraków.</span> <span id="s1137">Kraków was the head – ci – the main city of GG, government gubern –</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Gouvernement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Gouvernement, yeah.</span> <span id="s1140">General na gubernia(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: And Warsaw was a city of transit for the Germans to the eastern front, one of the cities.</span> <span id="s1143">So the character of the city was changed.</span> <span id="s1144">A lot of military uniforms we’ve seen in the streets everywhere, that they were occupying the best place to, let’s say, live and be treated.</span> <span id="s1145">So most of the theaters, restaurants, were with the inscription, nur für Deutsche, for Germans only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1147">So Poles couldn’t go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: So streetcars, even streetcars, you know, they had the platform, front platform on the streetcar there was nur für Deutsche, only for Germans.</span> <span id="s1149">Sometimes when there were too many, let’s say, attacks on the Germans, or too many of their side weapons disappeared, because in the crowd, the streetcar, many times, you know, the AK were cutting their holsters, and stealing their weapons, and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s1150">So they were changing the platform, sometimes in front, sometimes in the back.</span> <span id="s1151">But this was strictly for Germans.</span> <span id="s1152">And a city, as such, you know, was divided for the Aryans and the Jews.</span> <span id="s1153">The ghetto was formed, the wall was built, and the minority of the Jews, which was the largest diaspora in the world; I think maybe more than in New York; so they were put into either small ghetto, or large ghettos.</span> <span id="s1154">A small ghetto actually, delicately speaking, was reserved for the well-to-do –</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: – Jews.</span> <span id="s1157">Yes.</span> <span id="s1158">And the large ghetto was – well, the Germans used the term lumpenproletariat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Did you hear that one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Lumpenproletariat.</span> <span id="s1163">So the poor Jews were in the large ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: And, well, the annihilation of the Jewish race started right from the beginning, when they activated Treblinka, which was the closest crematorium, closest to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: So, there was a gas chamber as well as a crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1169">I’d like to focus a little bit more precisely on what changes did you see, and what changes happened within your family?</span> <span id="s1170">So let’s – let’s focus on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: It’s – okay, my sister was working for a food – food – food factory, and my father, as I mentioned, because of his knowledge of German language, he was used as a interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: When you say your sister was working for a food factory, was this now something under German control?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1174">Most of the Polish industry, which was in the city, and the workshops and the – all kind of places where they could use for the war machinery for the Third Reich –</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: – they immediately activated that, an-and they were trying to give some kind of a priority to produce the machinery of war.</span> <span id="s1177">Like for instance, that building nearby, what we lived in, the section that there were offices converted to apartments.</span> <span id="s1178">Now, this portion of the building, the – what was saved after the bombardment, they repaired whatever they could, but the basement and the first floor, what they were doing, they were building field kitchens, you know, just like the first World War, that was on wheels.</span> <span id="s1179">All these containers and they were cooking the meals for the army.</span> <span id="s1180">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Yeah, so this was a place, pretty active.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: So, it meant the equipment that – that cooked the food was being manufactured there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Manufactured there, yes, by the Poles.</span> <span id="s1185">And the production was for the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s1186">I remember a visit one day that – I don’t know whether he was a Reichsdeutsche or Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s1187">I think he must have been Reichsdeutsche because he had that Tyrolean hat with the little –</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Feather?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: – brush.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Feathers.</span> <span id="s1192">And he came over, visited.</span> <span id="s1193">He came in a Škoda, Škoda, that was Czech car, very nice car.</span> <span id="s1194">And he inspected the facilities, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Was this a – a – a person in a uniform, or in civilian –</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: No, he was a – a – a private – private – a civilian uniform, yeah, civilian uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1198">So was the – so was the – was this production facility owned by – beca – was it still private?</span> <span id="s1199">In private hands, but German hands?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: I would say yes.</span> <span id="s1201">I didn’t see any in uniform, any people in uniform.</span> <span id="s1202">There was the guy that came over a couple times, you know, to inspect the facility, and see what there is – the production rate, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1204">Did you know that – if he was a chief or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: I would say so, because he had that round sign – badge of Reichsdeutsche –</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: – you know, they used to have these badges on their lap –</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Lapel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Yeah, patel – yeah, that’s – it was – it – it looked like a Ebermensch(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: An übermensch, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Now, when you said that those apartments had been conver – those offices were converted into apartments, and at first you had the two room one, and then you were – your family was pushed out into a one room, what kind of kitchen facilities were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: You know, we – we sometimes improvised things as we need.</span> <span id="s1214">So I remember my father built his own little oven, connected to the stack, to the chimney, and we were cooking right on two – two – let’s say two burners, not burners, but fire [indecipherable] what we had that was something, a hotplate like.</span> <span id="s1215">So this was the part, and the sanitary facilities, they were using some toilets that were left, you know, with –</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: From the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: – of the office, so the primitive and very s-simple way, and the – the idea was to survive, so we did not complain too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: What about taking a bath?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Heating – hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: What about taking a bath, and heating?</span> <span id="s1223">How did you handle those things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: This – heating, we were boiling the water, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: – in that little stove that we had.</span> <span id="s1227">The washing facilities, there used to be a public – the public shower stations in the city, so we utilized these.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: But then we were heating the water in some tub, you know, and then washing ourselves the best we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: There was a lack of everything, you know.</span> <span id="s1232">Soap was scarcity, paper was a scarcity.</span> <span id="s1233">Bread tha-that was made for the Poles.</span> <span id="s1234">Sometimes we were laughing that that bread was just like a – like a – like a board, not properly baked in the – in – in – in enough time to make it edible, to make it edible.</span> <span id="s1235">They didn’t use the flour, they used the sawdust underneath in the ovens, you know, so – so this was a substitute.</span> <span id="s1236">Everything was ersatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Substitute, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Substitute.</span> <span id="s1239">Ersatz.</span> <span id="s1240">That’s a – the bread, the basic stuff, staple.</span> <span id="s1241">The marmalade was made out of beets, sweetened up with saccharin.</span> <span id="s1242">You know, it was the artificial sweetener.</span> <span id="s1243">And that thing, you could eat as much as you wanted, but the next day the thing was fermented and was growing.</span> <span id="s1244">You always had a full – full jar.</span> <span id="s1245">So meat was only on the black market – black market, you know, so the ingenious Poles were going to the countryside to bring food.</span> <span id="s1246">The Germans intercepted – most of the railroad stations they were intercepting in order to take that food away from them.</span> <span id="s1247">But food; meat, butter, you know, these were things very difficult to obtain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: And they were forbidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1250">Schwarzmarkt is what they call it, the black market, was a no-no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Well, here’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: The Germans were setting up patrols and – and – and stopping the trains before this destination, and – and – and getting the people, sorting them out, and checking what kind of food they bringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1254">I want to just make sure that I understand it properly.</span> <span id="s1255">There was rationing, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: There was rationing.</span> <span id="s1259">We –</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: And there was rationing so that you could get only a certain amount of any kind of food, but was it actually so that certain foods were forbidden to even have, whether the e – for example, if it’s eggs, or butter, or meat.</span> <span id="s1261">I-Is it that it’s not forbidden if you have it in your home, that it’s forbidden to bring it there?</span> <span id="s1262">Ho-How did that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Let’s see, it was forbidden to – meat, especially meat, you know.</span> <span id="s1264">But eggs you could buy on the bla – black market; flour and butter, you know.</span> <span id="s1265">Whatever the people could smuggle in from the countryside, that was done.</span> <span id="s1266">But not all these, let’s say attempts, were successful.</span> <span id="s1267">The Germans were intercepting and taking away from the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1269">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: So even they joked that sometimes as – a pig was smuggled into the city.</span> <span id="s1271">But how it was smuggled?</span> <span id="s1272">Because it was dressed up in a human suit, you know, where the snout was all covered up with bandages, you know, and the – th-they – the German patrol was told that this was a sick man going to Warsaw hospital; suddenly there was a pig.</span> <span id="s1273">Women were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Was that actually true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1276">There were many, many different ways of how to outwit the Germans, for the sake of survival.</span> <span id="s1277">Things were very risky, but still they had to be played.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: So you are at – in 1939, you’re a 10 year old boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: You go through the winter of 1940, and di – did your sister and yourself ever refer to that conversation that you had about gee, it would be interesting to see what war was like, after you actually felt it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Yes, many a times said now, we are experiencing this unfortunate exchange of thoughts that we had just before the war started.</span> <span id="s1282">Because the occupation was cruel, very cruel.</span> <span id="s1283">And we were treated as sub-humans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Did you – how did you personally experience that kind of treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: How did I experience that kind of treatment?</span> <span id="s1286">First, as I said, the streetcars were separated for Germans, and for the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: The s – on the sidewalks very often, we had to leave room as the Germans were passing by for them.</span> <span id="s1289">And the lines for food in our, let’s say, stores, were long, people were waiting, sometimes for nothing.</span> <span id="s1290">The German stores, there was a company my – Mynell(ph) – Mynell(ph), that was for Germans, where they could buy anything they wanted; butter, eggs, meat.</span> <span id="s1291">Everything just for the Germans, separated from the Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Were there German civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1294">During the heavy bombing of Reich, the – Germany wen – was bombed.</span> <span id="s1295">Many Germans, to save their lives, they were moving.</span> <span id="s1296">Let’s say members of the families, they were moving into Warsaw to live, and certain parts of the city were reserved for a German population.</span> <span id="s1297">The better sides, undestroyed, and – was provided for the German families, Reichsdeutsche that came from the – from the Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: So, does that mean towards – clo – closer towards the second part of the war?</span> <span id="s1299">If you’re saying it’s when Germany itself was being bombed, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Well, the mass – mass bombing, you know, it started where the Americans declared war, when was this, 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Forty-four, so that’s late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Forty-three, I believed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: No, the Americans started in – June 6th, 1944 was the invasion of Normandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Normandy?</span> <span id="s1305">Oh, but I am speaking of bombing of Germany was already – I think the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Underway?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: – American air force was already in England prior to that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Oh, that could very well be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: That could very well be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: And – and the – Harris, what they call General Harris, the bomber – there’s a monument in London of Harris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Well, but my point is – my – my question is, did these civilians, were they were from the very beginning –</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: – in Warsaw?</span> <span id="s1315">They appeared later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: No, they appeared later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Later, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: So, in the beginning the Germans that you saw were military people, were all somehow or other connected with the war effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1322">Did you see any – you mentioned during the shelling of the artillery, when the factory that – in your home was – was destroyed, that people died, were killed as a result of this artillery fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Did you ever see anybody el – did you ever see anybody treated violently on the street?</span> <span id="s1325">Did you ever see any corpses on the roads?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: No, not violently in the street, there was no scene like this.</span> <span id="s1327">But there were times where the Germans, let’s say, separated certain parts of the street, or streetcars that were in, in order to kidnap the people for work in the Reich.</span> <span id="s1328">So these things were very frequent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: And you saw these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Yes, I was part of it.</span> <span id="s1331">That’s a scene that I remember.</span> <span id="s1332">One of my colleagues, he had a pistol on him, and when the Germans stopped, you know, he was so upset that he started sweating, you know.</span> <span id="s1333">And there was an older lady, say 80 - 85, she look at that young fellow, and she open her purse, you know.</span> <span id="s1334">So he put the gun –</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: In her purse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: – into her purse, she close it.</span> <span id="s1337">The Germans didn’t attack her, you know, didn’t question her at all.</span> <span id="s1338">And the boys –</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: But they searched him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: – he save his – she saved his life.</span> <span id="s1341">And – and the spirit, and – and the brotherhood among the Poles in Warsaw was unusually unique and – and good, from the sense that we stood for each other until the end.</span> <span id="s1342">And we knew that the end is coming for all of us, one way or the other, so we stuck together.</span> <span id="s1343">There was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: And that’s – that’s unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1346">For [indecipherable] yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1347">There were – there were cases, you know, like schmeil(ph) shovnik(ph), you heard that expression?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Tell me what this is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Schmeil(ph) shovnik(ph) were the people that, for instance, when the Jews were vacating some areas in Warsaw, these guys were sort of acting against them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Anti-Semitism, by e-even – even in the cemetery, you know, when they saw the buried bodies, you know, so they were hunting for people buried, for gold teeth, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: So they were – they were actually going through corpses to be able to rob them of whatever –</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1354">These were cases, yes.</span> <span id="s1355">And th-the underground government, when they saw certain peoples, the squealers, or some informers, they used to issue the death sentences, and AK was executing these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Now, you – you – did you know all this as that 10 or 12 year old boy, walking the streets?</span> <span id="s1357">I want to get back to this child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: I was a member – okay, I was a member, I joined the underground when I was 12.</span> <span id="s1359">In 1942, I was sworn in in Schweidel, the suburb, you know, very nice forest there.</span> <span id="s1360">I was sworn in into paramilitary organization, which was – pre-war, it was the Boy Scout movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: So tell me how did that happen?</span> <span id="s1362">Did you find them, or did they find you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: No, they found me, I think.</span> <span id="s1364">I had two good teachers, you know.</span> <span id="s1365">Casimira(ph) Bye(ph) and Janina(ph) Guretsky(ph).</span> <span id="s1366">They were observing me at school, and my behavior, and the way they trusted me.</span> <span id="s1367">And there was a third teacher, that was Mrs. Bernisz(ph).</span> <span id="s1368">She was of German descent.</span> <span id="s1369">And they accosted me, and they ask me if I would be interested to work in the underground.</span> <span id="s1370">So, I sign up, I was sworn in in 1942, and the rest of the years of occupation, I was a member of the Home Army, Polish Home Army, with the sign of, as you can see, that anchor, PW, which stands of Polska Walcząca, I don’t know, the fighting Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: The fighting Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1373">This was a sign repeated many places, on monuments –</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Can – excuse me.</span> <span id="s1375">Can we focus in on that please?</span> <span id="s1376">On the – what’s on his – on his tie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: Oh, this one is here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1379">So it’s – it has an anchor, and it has –</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: And W.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: And – and a di –</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: P for Poland, and W for Walcząca, which means fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Okay, Walcząca.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1385">Krahelska was the designer, one of the soldiers that died the first day of uprising was Krystyna Krahelska.</span> <span id="s1386">She designed that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: That sign.</span> <span id="s1388">The insignia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: That sign, and that remained with us, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Did your parents know any of what you were going to be doing, or – or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: Especially when I was coming – you know, there was a police hour in Warsaw, eight o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Curfew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Curfew, yes, that people stopped in the street without proper documents, they were arrested, and if they didn’t respond to, let’s say a [indecipherable] they were shot.</span> <span id="s1394">After many a times, I was coming home, and there was a discussion, you know, and finally they gave up, you know, because I couldn’t do – they couldn’t punish me anymore.</span> <span id="s1395">So I was disappearing for late hours to do my duties, which were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: So – I’m going to interrupt right here.</span> <span id="s1397">You’re saying that you would come home after eight o’clock, and your parents would be upset?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: And they would say –</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: – where were you?</span> <span id="s1402">And did they – did you tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: They sensed something, yes, they did sense something, that I was doing all kind of things that would be penalized by death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: And did they ever address those risks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: The way – the way we lived, and the feeling we had toward the occupiers, they did not forbade my activity, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Your mother – you said your father was working as an interpreter at the Ostbahn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Now, what was your mother doing, was she ki – still in that cafeteria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Sh – no, no, there was no more of – that was burned out place, and she was just a housewife, you know, fighting to prepare a meal for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Here and there, every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Yeah, not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Whatever was available.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: What did you usually eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Oh, let’s say, for school, sandwich.</span> <span id="s1416">We had that – that bread, which we called sort of a – like a pumpernickel bread.</span> <span id="s1417">Two slices that were soaked in artificial coffee made out of grain, regular grain.</span> <span id="s1418">Put some sugar on top of it, put these things together, and that was my sandwich for school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Or, sometimes the onion that was fried in some schmaltz, lard, and this was sort of a spread –</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Onto the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: – for the sandwich.</span> <span id="s1423">Meat was a scarcity, scarcity.</span> <span id="s1424">And let’s say sometimes the Ostbahn, they had the cafeterias where my mother could get the soup for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: So your father would bring it back, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: No, my mother used to walk to there and she had the document that she was wife of the employee of the Ostbahn, and she was bringing the soup home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: But I’m speaking of soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s1430">I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: But the pota – piece of potato was a surprise.</span> <span id="s1432">And piece of meat, you know, unseen.</span> <span id="s1433">So this was a starvation diet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: And you said your sister worked in a food production factory –</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Yes, be –</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: – or place, or something.</span> <span id="s1437">So what was that all about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: The food was actually for us, for the Poles.</span> <span id="s1439">That was not for the production, for the Germans, was strictly controlled by – by the Germans, you know, so they – they were very careful.</span> <span id="s1440">Let’s say they were confiscating the cattle and the – and all the things, but the processing of that was made by – by them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1442">So, your sister worked.</span> <span id="s1443">What kind of food was she producing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: I think this was like marmalades, and all kind of preserves, fruit preserves.</span> <span id="s1445">No – other, let’s say preserves.</span> <span id="s1446">They were – made, you know, pickling the cucumbers, or – or pickles.</span> <span id="s1447">And that was the simpl – simple – simple food like this, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: And did she ever bring any of that home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: Oh, she – they put that was that, let’s say, instead of payment, you know, they used to give something for the employees.</span> <span id="s1450">Like my father used to get the alcohol, or coal – coal for burning in the stove.</span> <span id="s1451">Or sometimes he was getting a – a bread, or mar-margarine.</span> <span id="s1452">Artificial butter.</span> <span id="s1453">So these things that he could get from the – from his superiors, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: So, instead of – instead of money, sometimes his – he was paid in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: That was like a premium.</span> <span id="s1456">Sort of a supplement to – to – to – to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: To the salary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: – to mediocre salaries.</span> <span id="s1459">Because this money what the Germans issued had no purchasing power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: Like for instance, if you went for the black market to buy food in the country.</span> <span id="s1462">The farmers used to accept only the pre-war money, which was silver coins.</span> <span id="s1463">Silver coins, you know, the tens złotys, five złotys, two złotys.</span> <span id="s1464">They were silver.</span> <span id="s1465">I-I think at about 60 or 70 percent pure silver.</span> <span id="s1466">So they knew the metal value, and they were selling food for this kind of bouillon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1468">Rather – and rather than the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Than accepting the paper money issued by the Germans, which had no – it was good for the General na gubernia(ph) to – to – to buy some stuff on the black market, but the farmers, they were very skeptical about the paper money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1471">Krystyna(ph) herself, was she involved in any underground activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: My sister?</span> <span id="s1475">I – she knew something about it.</span> <span id="s1476">Very often, you know, th – sh-she didn’t show up on time home, it seemed to me, but everything was enveloped in secrecy.</span> <span id="s1477">We couldn’t operate with the names, we were using only nom de guerre.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Mm-hm, what was yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: Tabacca(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: So your pseudonym was Tabacca(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: Tabacca(ph).</span> <span id="s1482">And then when there was some kind of a [indecipherable] which we used to call when the Germans discovered some – somebody that was squealing, and we were in danger of being discovered, I was changed to Zbeek(ph) Enrysh(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Zbeek(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Zbeek(ph) Enrysh(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Enrysh(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Fox – and Zbeek(ph) was [indecipherable] too –</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: – you know, so I change, but normally I am using that Tabacca(ph) as a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: As a pseudonym.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: – my nom de guerre, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1492">So, your father worked there, your sister worked in the food production place, your mother stayed at home and tried to find some way of making meals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Did your father ever t-tell stories of what he would see at the Ostbahn?</span> <span id="s1495">What kind of things he would be translating?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: When – he often told me about the German trains coming from the eastern front.</span> <span id="s1497">He said that he saw some kwerp – corpses.</span> <span id="s1498">I mean, the people without legs, you know, frozen noses, ears.</span> <span id="s1499">But they were running through the tracks that were separated by some kind of partition, so the civilians wouldn’t see them.</span> <span id="s1500">But he said that casualties were coming from the eastern front, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: So he could see these things and he talked about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1504">And did he work with one particular German if – in – official in particular, or with many?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: I think with many, because the administration of the railroad was in many hands, you know, but the chief honcho, I don’t even know who –</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: – who – who that guy was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: And what would be the sort of things – he – was he a sort of like an in – in between the – the German bosses and the other workers?</span> <span id="s1509">Is this where his translation skills were used, for them to translate orders?</span> <span id="s1510">Or was it in different capacities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: He was translating because there were many Poles employed that didn’t speak German.</span> <span id="s1512">But the work assignments that were, let’s say, by the Germans to direct certain squads of people to do this kind of work, [indecipherable] repairs, or the – what they call, the platform repairs, or – or is – cleaning up the stations, you know.</span> <span id="s1513">So he was always called in as a interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: And do you think that he might have been involved in underground work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: I – I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1516">Maybe he was accosted by some people, but I don’t think that he was – he was aware of that I was doing, toward the end, but I don’t think he was part of it.</span> <span id="s1517">He, let’s say, cooperated, if there was some assignment to report, yes.</span> <span id="s1518">But I don’t think that he was fully sworn in, an-and – and – and working for the – for the underground.</span> <span id="s1519">Let’s say Poles were all members of the underground.</span> <span id="s1520">We were all, let’s say, sympathetic to the people that were actually the activists, you know, and the civilians were cooperating every time there was a situation, a dangerous situation, so they did help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: Like the lady who opened her purse for the gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1523">They say with that inscription, and I said nur für Deutsche, we played the joke on Germans, because somehow the buchhandlung, there was some –</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: A bookstore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: – bookstore, in the German part of the ci-city, we bought a lot of these opaski, what was this?</span> <span id="s1526">Armbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: The armbands, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Armbands, nur für Deutsche, you know.</span> <span id="s1529">And then we started putting in on the lampposts, telegraph posts, everything that was vertically up, you know, we put these things around, nur für Deutsche.</span> <span id="s1530">And they caught that thing after a while, and that was repercussions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Just like repercussions was – the Germans used the sign of victory.</span> <span id="s1533">The Pilsudski square in center of Warsaw, that’s where the tomb of unknown soldier is located.</span> <span id="s1534">It still exists, partially, the uprising – survived the siege of 1939.</span> <span id="s1535">There are only three or four columns.</span> <span id="s1536">If you’ve been in Warsaw, maybe you saw it, the tomb of unknown soldier.</span> <span id="s1537">Anyway, this was Pilsudski square.</span> <span id="s1538">When Hitler came to Warsaw for the victory parade, as a gift they changed the name of many streets to German sounding names, and this was changed to Adolf Hitlerplatz.</span> <span id="s1539">And in front of Poniatowski monument, they put a big sign of Victoria, and that victory sign underneath was Deutschland siegt am allen fronten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: Okay, Germany is victorious on all fronts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: On all the fronts.</span> <span id="s1542">The word siegt, we changed S to L, and the sos – Deutschland liegt am allen fronten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: So that mean – allen fronten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: You know, this – this was a very –</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: And how would you translate that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: The German lies on all the fronts.</span> <span id="s1547">You know, flat.</span> <span id="s1548">So this, they didn’t like it at all, because many places they had Deutschland siegt am allen fronten.</span> <span id="s1549">And there were propaganda signs by Dr. Goebbels, even showing a Polish soldier wounded, and Churchill, and the Polish soldier is saying, England, this is your deed.</span> <span id="s1550">I don’t know if you saw it in some of the books.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1552">So – oh the – so the fact –</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: That the guilt – the guilt lies in engl – with England, you know, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: That Poland is o – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: – they are guilty of – of our suffering, and so on.</span> <span id="s1556">There was tremendous shock, the time I – that was 1943, around the springtime, March or – March, I think.</span> <span id="s1557">There was mutual agreement between Poland – let’s say the government, Polish government in exile in England, Sikorski, with ma – with the Russians, fighting against common enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: But, when there was Katyn discovery, what happened is that the Germans advanced, and they stop at Smolensk, Charkow.</span> <span id="s1560">They found this massive graves – graves, Polish graves.</span> <span id="s1561">These were places of execution of the Polish officers that were captured during that attack on the 17th of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: September.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: I mean, 17th of September, 1939, when they stabbed us in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: They deported million and a half Poles to Siberia, and they separated the military personnel to be, let’s say, kept in the different camps.</span> <span id="s1566">Out of this they selected the officers.</span> <span id="s1567">The officers were the officers of reserves, so there were, you know, lawyers, doctors, professional officers and all kind of intelligentsia that was part of that 200-some 20 prisoners of war that these Russians captured.</span> <span id="s1568">Out of this they selected the officers, and they were executed in Katyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: So you’re talking 220,000?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Two hundred twenty military personnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1572">Only 220 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: Thousand, out of which –</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: A tow – thousand, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: – they selected the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: The officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: The officers, and so on.</span> <span id="s1578">They –</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: So what happened when the graves were discovered?</span> <span id="s1580">How is that received in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: As the Germans advanced, and they discovered – immediately the Russian propaganda was saying that the Germans did it, you know, and they tried to blame the Russians for this.</span> <span id="s1582">The Germans, to prove the case, they have asked the higher ranking officers, British, French, and then whoever was there from the western European POW camps, and they form a commission.</span> <span id="s1583">And this commission was joined by the Red Cross, and they all went to the passive disc – discovery of these big, massive graves, and they selected the caliber of the guns that they were using to shoot them in the back –</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Okay, I want to make sure I understand.</span> <span id="s1585">They selected not only th – they asked not only the international Red Cross, but their own prisoners of war that they had captured –</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: They formed a commission from some of these selected people –</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: – who were prisoners themselves, to go to the site of the mass graves –</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: – and do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: Exhume the bodies.</span> <span id="s1593">Check, you know, some of the insignias, dog tags, and the – the – the bullets that normally they found the skulls with the hole in the back, because the prisoners were tied in the back, walked into the room, and shot by the NKVD –</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: – in the back of their heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: So this was a shock for me, when I walked into classroom, and I saw my teacher crying, Mrs. Bernisz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Or Umlaut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: Or Umlaut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Bernisz(ph), yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Bernisz(ph), you know.</span> <span id="s1604">Her brother, Lieutenant Bernisz(ph), a Polish lieutenant – she admitted that she was of German descent, even for generations in – in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1605">So she says – she was crying, you know, and I ask her now, why do you cry ma’am?</span> <span id="s1606">What happened?</span> <span id="s1607">You know, she just simply pushed a Red Cross card, a notification postal card to me, and then I ripped it over, and I looked at this, and that was his name listed among the bodies exhumed from that mass grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: And this changed entirely, the diplomatic relations with the Polish government in exile.</span> <span id="s1610">They were broken, these relations were broken, and the Russians ignored the free legal Polish government.</span> <span id="s1611">They said that this is not true, the Germans did it, and we were siding with the fascists, you know.</span> <span id="s1612">Th-The – the regular way of the Russian lies that are – even now you can s – listen to [indecipherable] and – and – and – and see how nicely he forms certain ways of how to do the right thing the Russian way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1614">Let’s go back to these events.</span> <span id="s1615">So people discovered that – Warsaw begins to discover that these missing officers have been murdered by the rus – the Soviet forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: You find out in a very personal way, through your teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Teacher, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: How did it – how did people find out in general abou – was this something that the Germans were – were broadcasting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: Well, they were the – they were drumming it up.</span> <span id="s1621">Germans were drumming it up, and the situation was even getting worse and worse, because the Polish formations of soldiers in Russia, under the command of General Anders –</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: – there was a situation when Sikorski met with Stalin and all the other big brass, Russian brass in – in – in Moscow, I think, and he asked about, where are the Polish officers?</span> <span id="s1624">Because when we formed these units, Polish units to fight the Germans, where are the officers?</span> <span id="s1625">And the Russians responded by saying, you know, they were somewhere in Manchuria and they run away.</span> <span id="s1626">They escape from the captivity.</span> <span id="s1627">They never admitted – they – you know when they admitted?</span> <span id="s1628">When – I forgot his name, that Russian prior to Gorbachev, ye – ye – yench –</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Oh, prior to Gorbachev?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Gorbach – yelchin – yelchin –</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Yeltsin was after Gorbachev.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: After Gorbachev?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Prior to Gorbachev was Chernenko.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: Chernenko?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: And then was Andropov.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: No, one of them, I think Yeltsin was the one who admitted for the first time that this was the NKVD job, that what they did to the Polish officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: So we’re talking well over 50 years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1643">And – and – and Gorbachev admitted too, and he sealed off that this was the Russian doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1645">Your – let’s talk a little bit about your activities.</span> <span id="s1646">Your e – inducted formally into the Home Army at the ripe old age of 12 - 13?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Twelve –</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Twelve?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: – 13, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: And what was your involvement?</span> <span id="s1651">Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: My involvement – when I was sworn in, we were paramilitary because of the age, you know.</span> <span id="s1653">There was Gray Ranks, Szare Szeregi we used to call Polish SS.</span> <span id="s1654">You know, Szare Szeregi, Gray Ranks.</span> <span id="s1655">That was sort of divided by age, you know, Zawiszacy were the youngest ones, which was a part of it.</span> <span id="s1656">That was from, let’s say, 12 to about 15.</span> <span id="s1657">And then Skoły Bojowe, the – the military schools, were from, let’s say 15 - 16, up to about 18.</span> <span id="s1658">And then was – third group was the gr – Grupa Sztrumowa, the storming groups.</span> <span id="s1659">These were guys 18 and up.</span> <span id="s1660">That was a full military preparations, they were train in the forests for military action, and that military action was called the tempest – zboże tempest.</span> <span id="s1661">And they were fully military organization.</span> <span id="s1662">The lower group –</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: So you’re saying there were – there were three different categories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: Three different categories guided by age.</span> <span id="s1665">So let’s say the Skoły Bojowe, some guys were lying their age to join, you know, to be more active in the more advanced group, let’s say, Skoły Bojowe.</span> <span id="s1666">So they pretended they are different –</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: They’re older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: They’re olders, you know, the husky one.</span> <span id="s1669">I was always small – small and puny, so I couldn’t even pretend that, so – anyway, they put me in that Szare Szeregi, and they put me in the platoon one, and this was the squad of yul – the regina(ph) yulka(ph).</span> <span id="s1670">That was in [indecipherable] – what our activities were.</span> <span id="s1671">So we were sabotaging the German vehicles as much as we could, you know.</span> <span id="s1672">Even methods like – the Germans used the artificial fuel, gasholz.</span> <span id="s1673">Gasholz was almost a – a – a – a [indecipherable] on a car, mounted, where they were using hardwood to – to – to burn, and form the methane gas that was actually the propelling –</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: Agent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: – energy of the cars.</span> <span id="s1676">So there was an air intake, and we used to put potatoes into the air intake and that thing would die.</span> <span id="s1677">We put sugar into tanks, then the Germans introduced [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: But aren’t these – we – then – then, but these are deficit items, the potatoes, and the sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: Yes, yes, they were deficit items, but necessary.</span> <span id="s1680">So they were sacrificed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: And then we were using all kind of propaganda posters to counteract the German propaganda posters.</span> <span id="s1683">Like, for instance, the mysterious death of General Sikorski in Gibraltar.</span> <span id="s1684">When General Sikorski was visiting Polish troops in the Near East, le – Lebanon, Palestine at that time, he was on the way back to London, and they made a stop in Gibraltar.</span> <span id="s1685">You know the Gibraltar Straights?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: Yes, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: Africa continent –</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: – you know, European?</span> <span id="s1690">So, there was a mysterious death that the plane landed in the water, because the steering mechanism didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Puzzling – puzzling item was that at that time the governor of that British base was Philby.</span> <span id="s1693">You heard of Philby?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Kim Philby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: Kim Philby.</span> <span id="s1696">That was an agent, a communist.</span> <span id="s1697">He was buried as a brigadier general of NKVD.</span> <span id="s1698">This – this guy was actually – Philby was the secret agent allowed to – to have access to th-the top secrets of American state.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Well, MI6.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: Ducas – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: Yes, MI6 is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: MI6 is a British –</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: – but I mean, the CIA or whatever, we had the security system here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1705">Him –</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: It wasn’t the CIA yet, but it was the – during the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: SOS?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: OSS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: OSS, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: OSS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: So this was a very mysterious death, and he was buried in the – in the – in – the only guy that survived was pilot, Prchal – Prchal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Prchal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: Prchal.</span> <span id="s1714">He was a Czech pilot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: The plane was a Liberator, I think, and when that thing ended up in water, most of these – even daughter of General Sikorski, and some liaison officers, British officers died.</span> <span id="s1717">So the only survivor was Prchal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Okay, and this is what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: This was, I think fort – July ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1721">And so how did that show up in the propaganda in Warsaw?</span> <span id="s1722">So, how –</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: How these things here, the wa – the – the posters were printed with the mysterious death and tragic death of our leader.</span> <span id="s1724">How the thing was, I think, the BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1726">And so you would – the po –</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: And we were posting this – let’s see, there was sign about what, 15 inches by 12 inches, you know, with the inscription, General Sikorski tragic death in Gibraltar and so on.</span> <span id="s1728">We were posting in on any streets, main streets in Warsaw, to notify the public of what happened, you know.</span> <span id="s1729">Not all had the access to – to BBC reports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: Did you have a radio at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: I had a crystal radio, you know, something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: What’s a crystal radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Crystal radio di – was some kind of a magnetic stuff, with the earphones, that you could pick some of the waves, you know, from the air.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: So, you’d have an earphone –</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: – a – you’d have earphones on –</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: – and then you’d have some sort of – what did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: It was – look like a cr – a crystal, a metallic crystal, silver dots in it.</span> <span id="s1740">But that was a poor reception.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: So, but it – it wasn’t even a box, it was just like a little knob, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: Knob, yeah.</span> <span id="s1743">But friends of ours that we used to go and visit, they had their radio in the big heating – heating ovens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Heating ovens.</span> <span id="s1746">That the radio was mounted in the back, and at night we used to listen to the BBC program.</span> <span id="s1747">And you know, there was a special section in AK that was, let’s say, printing out on the basis of true news, because the German news were always partial on protecting the German side, and they never admitted their –</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: Weaknesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: – what was mistakes and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: – and things like that.</span> <span id="s1752">They were always trying to minimize their losses, and maximize they – whatever they needed to – to – to tell us to bra – break the morale of the occu – occupied nations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: So your – so you would be sabotaging the cars –</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Sabotaging the cars, and then a second assignment was that, since there were two main bridge – two main bridges across the Vistula River to the eastern front, our assignment was to stay at hidden places, and mark and count the equipment, the armaments that went over the bridge.</span> <span id="s1755">Tanks, armor cars, any cars, any guns, anything that was on wheels.</span> <span id="s1756">So we used to have charts and mark these things to send later on to our headquarters, which in turn sent it over to – to London.</span> <span id="s1757">That was very useful, because the Brits knew, you know, what strength actually, the Germans are sending to the eastern front, that this was a sign to us on two bridges; Poniatowski bridge, and Kierbedzia bridge.</span> <span id="s1758">So very often my duty was to be on the observing observer’s point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: So, until you mentioned this, I figured most of those things that you would be doing, you’d have to do in the evenings, when that – when night fell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: Not in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1761">We had these garbage – little garbage carts –</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: – you know, that there sometimes were – tilted them over.</span> <span id="s1764">And under the cover, we were sitting there and doing all kind of dangerous markings in the different charts to – to counter the – the – the pieces that were across the bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: I see, so in the – in the daytime you would observe –</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: After the police hours, at night, wi – you know, daytime, sure, we were doing this something by hearts, you know, watching and sitting on the curb of the sidewalk, you know, watching –</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: Just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: Watching this.</span> <span id="s1771">And what else did we do dirty for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: For the Home Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: This was – you know, we were very critical of people going to – to – to movie theaters, and we had a saying, tylko świnie siedąc w kinie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Only the pigs sitting in the movie theaters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: And why would that be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: We used to – yeah, we used to put the name with the tar, you know, on the – on the entrance to the theaters.</span> <span id="s1778">And that worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: But why would – why would that be –</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: [indecipherable] the money that was spent by the Poles that went to the armaments of the – this was government – the German government controlled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: I see, so – I see.</span> <span id="s1782">So it wasn’t that people wanted to have some relief, an-and see some sort of fantasy and escape from reality, it was because it was a way of helping the economy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: The German economy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1786">There was another scene that I remember.</span> <span id="s1787">See, they set up – when the war started, the Barbarossa Operation started, there was a big empty square right by the central railroad station, so the Germans built a big screen to show their victorious march, drang nach osten, push to the east.</span> <span id="s1788">The Barbarossa Operation, they were showing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: So that’s June 1941, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1791">They were showing, you know, the [indecipherable] Kraków, all the areas that were taken away from the Soviets, they were taking Russian prisoners by thousands, by thousands.</span> <span id="s1792">And – and – and the Russians were giving up.</span> <span id="s1793">They didn’t have the spirit, they didn’t have the good officers at that time.</span> <span id="s1794">Why they didn’t have the good officers?</span> <span id="s1795">Because the officers were chistka.</span> <span id="s1796">You know what a chistka is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: The – Stalin in 1935 noticed that there were some kind of plot to – that they were trying to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Overthrow him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: – overthrow him.</span> <span id="s1801">And this was among the Russian officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Was it really a plot, or did he think it was a plot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: There was something that the Stalin was so upset, that he immediately ordered them to be put behind the bars, and many of them were eliminated.</span> <span id="s1804">There was this case, and also – what else they – they were trying?</span> <span id="s1805">Oh see, there was a lack of a – of a higher command among the Russians at the time when the German were pushing forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: Okay, so it meant – it meant that in Warsaw, you’d have these big screens up, and – and you – and people would see –</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: At the central station, yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: And people would see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: Ye – they – you know, people were curious always, you know, when they saw the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: So it was like an open movie theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: Like an open movie theater.</span> <span id="s1812">There was no drive-in, but just an open – open theater, and the people wanted to know, even there were the – at the time, these were the true things.</span> <span id="s1813">The blitz – the German blitz was so effective that they were taking thousands and thousands of Russian prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">Q: Did they ever show Germans taking Jews up?</span> <span id="s1815">I mean, in – in those reels, newsreels?</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: Did they ever show anything about what their behavior was to the Jews of the east?</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: To the Jews of the east, no, I – I don’t remember anything like this, but I remember the operation when we used the eggshells.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: Eggshells, we blow up the egg, you know, whites and yellow and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: Red?</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: – and fill it up with – with paint, dark paint.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: And we were sitting in the first row.</span> <span id="s1825">And when we saw Hitler delivering some kind of a speech, we used to toss these things against, and you could see the streaks of the things.</span> <span id="s1826">And then the Germans, after a while, they discontinued this kind of propaganda.</span> <span id="s1827">They discontinue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: Well, of – of – of everything that you were telling me about, this sounds the riskiest, cause if somebody fa –</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: That was risky, yes.</span> <span id="s1830">Our operations even there, were done by the young – youngsters –</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: – they were very risky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1834">And yet – and yet, as you describe, it sounds like quite important, not just work.</span> <span id="s1835">Not just funny work, or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: This was important, you know.</span> <span id="s1837">Even small and let’s say people were looking at us as – as – as misbehaving youngsters doing, and risking sometimes, the lives of the grownups.</span> <span id="s1838">But this was necessary to keep the morale of the people, and – and the morale of the – Warsaw, occupied Warsaw was very strong, very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: I want to turn now to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1840">Did you see the walls of the ghetto being built?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1842">This was along the Leszno Street.</span> <span id="s1843">Leszno Street, which was parallel to Wolska Chłodna thoroughfare that I was saying –</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: – toward the Kierbedzia bridge.</span> <span id="s1846">Leszno – there were the county courts, and the brick wall was separating into two halves, the Aryan side and the Jewish side.</span> <span id="s1847">And that wall, at that particular part, what they did there was ex-execution of Polish hostages, at Narutowicz square, in Ochota district of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1848">And there was a rumor that the people that were shot over there, they were brought in and hung on the balcony metal parts, you know, these vertical –</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: – members.</span> <span id="s1851">They were hung by the necks to – in order to show and let’s say show their punishment toward the Poles, what they can expect if they don’t stay at the bay and – and – and – and – and listen to the – to the authorities of German – the German administration, as a sign of their rule, they wanted to break their morale.</span> <span id="s1852">So the pilgrimage of war where [indecipherable] were marching along the Leszno Street, looking at that thing to – to see what was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Did you see that too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1855">I personally saw it.</span> <span id="s1856">There was about 27.</span> <span id="s1857">And I was wondering if buddy of mine, Kazik(ph), that he was one of them, but I couldn’t recognize.</span> <span id="s1858">You know, people, when they get shot, you know, they freeze in their position.</span> <span id="s1859">And you could see that these people were not hung there alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s1861">So they had already been killed in some form, and were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Yes, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: – hung there.</span> <span id="s1864">Okay.</span> <span id="s1865">And the purpose of it was not – had nothing to do with the ghetto, but it happened to be physically close to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: Let’s say on the wall, th – at that time, you know, in order to see some kind of a violent reaction by the Poles, they – the Germans had the two machine guns, I remember, on top of the wall, directed to the Poles marching alongside the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: Was this a – was this a – was this a mandatory kind of march, you were – you had to go see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: Yes, yes, the people were forced almost, to see it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1872">And then it was – this also at the time when the ghetto wall was being built, or was already built?</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: No, there – it was already built.</span> <span id="s1874">That’s – I’m speaking of year, I think was 40 – ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: It was about time when the built the bridge.</span> <span id="s1877">If you saw that pianist movie, there was a bridge from the small ghetto to a large ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: And that bridge was alongside the Żelazna Street, right at that triangular s – triangular park –</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: – in front of that church of Boramayus(ph) in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1882">And nowadays that Father Popiełuszko’s, let’s say, park –</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1884">Yeah, that’s after the priest who was murdered during solidarity times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: Yes, Popiełuszko.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: Mm-hm, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: And this was at the point where the two streets divided, you know, there was one, Chłodna, going toward the Hala Mirowska –</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: – which was like a big marketplace.</span> <span id="s1890">And the other one was Elektoraina Street, which was going to – to bank – Bank Square.</span> <span id="s1891">Plac Bankowe, Bank Square, in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: So does this mean that until then the two ghettos had not been connected?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: They never were connected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">Q: Even with that bridge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: Let’s say they never – let’s say, they were, on that portion that was from Wronia to Żelazna, they were connected, small and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: And large.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: – and large.</span> <span id="s1898">And then, in order to keep the traffic between small and large was that bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: Was that bridge, so there were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: And so did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: – connections, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1904">Did you see the building of that bridge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1906">I saw it when they were erecting, that was a wooden bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: That was a wooden bridge.</span> <span id="s1909">The – I – I have the pictures in that album that I show –</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: I – as I say, what’s important for me is not what is published later, but what are your specific recollections.</span> <span id="s1911">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: I saw it, yes, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: You saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: – I was going to that school for almost a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: So almost on a daily basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Q: And this is where your teach – the school where your teachers were observing you, and then later recommended that you be part of the AK?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: AK.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A: They recruited me there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: There was, as I said, Casimira(ph) Bye(ph), and Janina Grotska(ph) – grotes -- Grotska(ph), yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: And Mrs. Bernisz(ph).</span> <span id="s1924">Or Miss Bernisz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: And Bernisz(ph) was the third one, yes.</span> <span id="s1926">That was already when I was going to the sixth grade, but this was a cover-up, because actually I was going to that first year of high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: But pretending that the schools, the underground schools not – not existed, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: – this was used for a cover-up.</span> <span id="s1931">Trade schools, and all schools that actually Germans considered that they can stay open, like a little business school.</span> <span id="s1932">But the higher education was out of question.</span> <span id="s1933">The poli – Warsaw Polytechnics, which was very large institution, and well-known; the University of Warsaw was also closed, but the faculty, even some of them were murdered in [indecipherable] operation.</span> <span id="s1934">But some teachers that survived, they used to participate in that underground schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1936">Now, in your – in your AK unit, you were known only by your pseudonym, not by your real name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: And did you get to be friends with others, or you know, how large was your cell, how –</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: The cell was about [indecipherable] number one was [indecipherable] one was about six, seven guys.</span> <span id="s1940">I knew them all, because we had the meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: We were getting instructions, we were getting training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: Did you ever know their real names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: Yes, some of them I knew, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: And they knew your real name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: Yes, but we was – we were penalized if we used any family names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1948">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">A: You know, this – this underground, that was actually there was the – one of the largest underground the world, in – in occupied Europe, by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1950">We had – AK had the connections, and there were planes coming from England to Poland to pick up some representatives to the Polish government in London, and some important people.</span> <span id="s1951">So there were a lot of, how should I say, connections and the practical sharing of certain, let’s say, things that were very valuable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: Did you know that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: About the planes that were coming to Poland?</span> <span id="s1954">No –</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: – no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: We need to distinguish that, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: – then it gets murky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: Where it is, the – the adult Thaddeus Gubala is talking about something, and where it is the experience of the child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1963">I didn’t know the operation, the secret operation, but after the war I was engrossed in all kind of reading books, whatever I could find, because we were, let’s say, eager to learn what was happening behind our backs, you know, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: So, the underground was very effective, and very helpful to the allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: I don’t know if I can mention right now –</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: If it’s your – excuse me, I’m going to interrupt; is it your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: That was my experience that I knew the operations, and the help that we were getting from England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: Then tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: Because we were getting the – I mean, the higher groups, there was even money sent to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: And did you ever see any of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: No, I would – I wasn’t paid in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: In money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: – dollars, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Were you paid in anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: We were – we were the youngsters, and very helpful in the operation, but sort of secondary help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: Well, you’re young –</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: – you’re children.</span> <span id="s1985">And I’m sure they didn’t want to put you in too much danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1987">Even during the uprising, we were not subject to the strict military rules.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1989">Tell me wi – I want to come now to the – both uprisings.</span> <span id="s1990">Did you see any part of the ghetto uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: As I was walking to school, this was, I think toward the end of May – no, toward the end of April, because May, th-the uprising stopped.</span> <span id="s1992">It was liquidated by, I would say, May 19, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: I think it – I don’t know the exact date, but I think it was mid-April that it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: Yes, mid-April.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: During that time, the ghetto was on fire.</span> <span id="s1997">General Stroop, he brought to ghetto – he brought the Ukrainians that were serving with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1998">I notice Latvians, because they had different, dark uniforms that were part of the guard, around.</span> <span id="s1999">And there were Germans in the supervisory sort of positions as military.</span> <span id="s2000">This – what I notice, that a lot of people on the Aryan side were looking from the gates of their apartments, you know, looking toward the ghetto to see how sometimes people were throwing people out of the windows.</span> <span id="s2001">Instead of being burned, you know, they committed suicide.</span> <span id="s2002">I saw flames coming out because the Germans actually set fire as they were conquering –</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: Clearing up, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: – clearing up the – the segments.</span> <span id="s2005">I saw this, yes.</span> <span id="s2006">Because that point of bridge, you know, that I said, two divided streets, Elektoraina and Chłodna, this was a main gate.</span> <span id="s2007">Main gate.</span> <span id="s2008">Across kitty corner from that building there, there was Vacha(ph), there was a very strong German point that the guardsmen were the Feldpolizei; that was the military police, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: – they were armed, and there was a bunker, bunk – concrete bunker to protect their segment of the building.</span> <span id="s2011">The building is – even now that’s standing, it survived the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s2013">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2015">And that bunker actually there is the original bunker that is shown in that uprising museum in – in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: So you would see the flames of these – of the buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: Flames, and the people jumping out of the windows, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: You would see that too?</span> <span id="s2019">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2020">Because at –</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: Was there a smell?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: – when – when the Germans – when the Germans were setting up fire –</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: – at the ground level, you know, and the flames started shooting up, some of them I saw escaping from one building, jumping over to another one just to get away from the buildings that are set on fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: Very cruel behavior was of the Jewish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: Wa – in what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: In what way?</span> <span id="s2029">They were responsible for gathering the Jews for that shipment to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: And they were cruel, because they were responsible to deliver that many Jews as the Germans ordered them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: Well, what choice did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: They were very cruel.</span> <span id="s2034">And then, the – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: But again, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: – producer – producer of that film –</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: Mm-hm, which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: Kanista(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: When they had the premier of the film in – in – in Tel Aviv –</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: – the people were whistling and – and – and – and really criticizing that this is not true that the Jews were so cruel toward the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: I have to – I – i-it can all be true.</span> <span id="s2044">I don’t know that.</span> <span id="s2045">But in – in our discussion, if you – if it’s something that you say, I need to substantiate it with, did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: Do – yes, did I see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: And if you saw it – and how – in – in what way did you see it.</span> <span id="s2048">So, did you see this cruelty?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: Yes, I did, yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: – I di – in what way?</span> <span id="s2052">Where the people were actually were set on fire in the windows, jumping out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: All right, by the Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Combined forces.</span> <span id="s2055">There were Jews and there were Germans, and there were Ukrainians guards at the main gate.</span> <span id="s2056">So I saw this, yes, I saw this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: I saw, let’s say before the Jewish uprising, I saw the groups of Jews that were recruited to work on the Aryan side for the German factories, whatever they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: Marched by the blue policemen, or the German policemen, toward their destination where they were working.</span> <span id="s2061">There was, let’s say, sometimes 50 - 60 Jews marching through the Aryan side to their place where they worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: And the behavior of – toward the Jews was awful.</span> <span id="s2064">I mean, for the Poles that helped the Jew, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: – that was the only country in Europe that for helping the Jew, there was a death penalty.</span> <span id="s2067">The only country in Europe that if they saw you helping Jew, you could be shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s2068">And if they didn’t do this, then they arrested your family, or even some of the buildings where this occurred, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: – they were all liquidated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: So you would see – you would see guards be cruel to Jews who were being taken to work outside of the ghetto on the Aryan side?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2073">There was kicking, pushing, shouting, and things like this, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2075">Did – oh, I had a question, and it just escaped my mind.</span> <span id="s2076">And you saw people jumping from roof to roof while the ghetto uprising was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: As the flames were spreading out, they were running away, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: Did – was there a smell coming from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: Oh yes, day and night, because the Germans were bombing ghetto during the night.</span> <span id="s2080">There were – they brought heavy guns, and they were using the armor cars when the uprising started, because the group of fighting Jews, there was about 350 of them, you know, that some of them were equipped with the weapons delivered by the AK, and they were heroic in their attempt.</span> <span id="s2081">They knew that this is the only solution, is to die fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Did – were there any Jewish boys in your cell?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: In my cell no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Were there any in the – in that category in the AK, you know – you know, in this youngest age category, that you knew of?</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: Repeat that question.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2087">You explained to me there were three categories; the gray –</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: Gray ranks –</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: The Gray Ranks.</span></p>

id="s2094">A: And then Grupy Szturmowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2096">In that youngest category, did you know of any Jewish boys who were in there, who might have escaped from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: There were no Jews, but I heard that there were some –</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: – in the upper ranks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: In the upper ranks.</span> <span id="s2104">And especially during the uprising – maybe I’m time-wise jumping too far ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Which, which, the Warsaw uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: The Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s2107">There were – in the ghetto there were Jews that were brought from Hungary, but they were protected by their skills, you know, tailors, shoemakers that were contributing to the war machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: The German war machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: The German war machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: Right.</span></p>

gang Shufka(ph).</span> <span id="s2113">Gesia Street was the street in the ghetto, and they had these barracks where they were working –</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: – for the German war machine.</span> <span id="s2116">So some of these guys joined the Polish units during the Warsaw uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: When they were liberated, however, when were they liberated, by the – by the si –</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: By the AK people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: Yeah, when?</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: This was 1944, I would say the middle of – middle of August.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: But my question is, by that point, the ghetto is obliterated.</span> <span id="s2122">There is no more ghetto.</span> <span id="s2123">The uprising had been put down –</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: Yes, the ghetto – the ghetto was put out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: I’m speaking of some remains of the skilled Jews that were used for the war machine, that were separated from the rest of the Jews in – in Shufka(ph), and these were the Hungarian Jews that were kept.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2128">Hungarian Jews weren’t deported from Hungary until March ’44.</span> <span id="s2129">So, in other words, they couldn’t have been part of the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s2130">They couldn’t have been part of the Warsaw ghetto that was obliterated, and yet they’re kept alive.</span> <span id="s2131">They must have been brought in later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s2133">It could be like this, because there was even a negotiation between the allies, the – the Germans demanded trucks for trading freedom for these Jews.</span> <span id="s2134">There was something secret that I – I never, let’s say, analyzed this so deep, but they were trying to save the Jews by giving some –</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: Getting some materials for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: – material for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">A: But these Jews were brought from Hungary, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: Hungarian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: So, it would have been in ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: Rather than – rather than any time earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2145">And these –</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: And that would have been when the ghetto was already a – a – gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: No, the ghetto, the ghetto, the small and large one was already finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s2149">Okay, so let’s talk about your activities in 1943, and 1944, until the Warsaw uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: Well, these activities I mentioned to you, the little sabotage that we had –</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: It continued.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: – on the bridges, and then the posters, and then the inscriptions of PW –</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: – in different places, to show that we still existing.</span> <span id="s2155">And marking the theaters and the – sabotaging the German propaganda slogans.</span> <span id="s2156">So, this was the activity of 1942 - ’43, until the uprising, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: So let’s turn to the uprising.</span> <span id="s2158">How do you – what ha – what do you get involved in, what changes in your life to prepare to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: What happened, the uprising started on the first of August.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: Right, and where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: I was near – near that Janusz Korczak building, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">Q: Where the orphanage was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A: Orph – the cro – across the street, yes, and the last meeting we had with the patrol one, we said that we are going together at Kartselak(ph), which was a marketplace right at the Wolska Street, that main thoroughfare, and Towarowa, and Przyokopowa, this was a large square, like a Maxwell Street in Chicago, you know, there were little stands that the people were selling.</span> <span id="s2164">Anything that your heart desire, the black market at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: So, the meeting didn’t come through because of the beginning of uprising was scheduled for five o’clock [indecipherable] stands for walka(ph).</span> <span id="s2167">And there was supposed to be at five, but it started at the different time.</span> <span id="s2168">So what happened was that I simply joined the newly formed company, 315, across the street in that building of Janusz Korczak.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: And what the – happened, they assigned me to be the observer.</span> <span id="s2171">So I was posted on that highest point of that building that was safe from that siege during the 1939.</span> <span id="s2172">And I was watching the Germans coming Karolkowa Street, toward the Wolska.</span> <span id="s2173">This was street – side street, but anyway important, because they tried to clear both sides of Wolska, so the German traffic would go free, without any side – side attacks.</span> <span id="s2174">But what we did over first and second of the uprising day, we build a barricade and a deep ditch on Karolkowa Street.</span> <span id="s2175">So the Germans, when they came over, to the point I saw them, I was reporting down that there is a German armor car waiting, but they hesitating to cross because of the obstacle.</span> <span id="s2176">Then – this was couple days like this, and then, before – actually, before uprising started, I was put to work by cleaning some old rifles that were recovered from the hiding places, for an attack by the grownups, of that School 100.</span> <span id="s2177">Because School 100 that I attended during – before the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: – this whole building was converted to a rest house for the Germans.</span> <span id="s2180">All the nicer buildings –</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: The beautiful building where you didn’t walk with shoes.</span> <span id="s2182">Where you walked on your si –</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: Yes, yes, this was converted to a shelter for the Germans that were coming to Warsaw to rest, after the battle fatigue –</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: – whatever they had in the east, or – they were re-convalescence after they were wounded, whatever.</span> <span id="s2186">Most of the better buildings were taken by the Germans, by the Germans.</span> <span id="s2187">So anyway, this attack failed, because the Germans were armed to the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: Teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: – kin.</span> <span id="s2190">And this thing was a failure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: So the next operation, what happened was, on the V separation of two streets, Towarowa and Przyokopowa, there was a German repair shop, for German vehicles.</span> <span id="s2193">So, we were told that we have to get gasoline for the Molotov cocktails.</span> <span id="s2194">And I remember from 1939 I had these flare – flare gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: That was my weapon.</span> <span id="s2197">There was one guy that – with the saw off Mauser, you know, carbine?</span> <span id="s2198">Anyway, when we – there was about five of us, two mechanics, and there were two, three of younger ones, you know, and we entered that place, the Germans got scared off.</span> <span id="s2199">They got on a – motorbikes, and they left.</span> <span id="s2200">So we started getting the cars into some kind of a position that maybe we can start –</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: Drive them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">A: – drive them out.</span> <span id="s2203">So one of the mechanics, you know, he was able to – the car had the four tires on.</span> <span id="s2204">The others didn’t have the tires on because they were over the – what they call, the tunnels, that they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: That’s right, where they were repairing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: Repairing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: Repairing things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: So the one with the four tires was okay, so he started this car.</span> <span id="s2209">But in the meantime, what I was doing is I was collecting into jerry cans –</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: You know the jerry cans are.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: Those 20 liter –</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: – metal containers.</span> <span id="s2216">I was sucking – siphoning the gasoline from the ones that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">Q: Were on ther – right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">A: – have the tires on, that was getting ready for repairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: So I was able to put about two – two – two of these canisters, jerry cans –</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: How were you siphoning?</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: With the rubber hose.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: And you were sucking it in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">A: Sucking it in.</span> <span id="s2225">Once it started, you know, then the gasoline was dripping out.</span> <span id="s2226">Anyway, I was – this was the most precious liquid at the time, because the company 315 was waiting for delivery of weapons, but it never materialized, you know, they didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s2227">So the most effective weapons were the Molotov cocktails.</span> <span id="s2228">Some of the units that were on the barricade on Gorczewska Street, parallel to Wolska, right at Młynarska, these were barricades attacked by the Germans, and they were trying to really break the opposition at any cost.</span> <span id="s2229">They were even putting civilians in front of their tanks, and – and – and approaching the Polish points of resistance –</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: With the civilians in front?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: Yeah, so we would stop shooting, you know, at our own people.</span> <span id="s2232">And anyway, I delivered – I could carry the whole jerry can, but I take half of it, couple times.</span> <span id="s2233">I walked from Krochmałna, from that Janusz Korczak place, and I carried this over to Gorczewska Street, which was a distance of at least five, six, seven blocks, as a small kid, with a friend of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: That’s not – that’s not bad –</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: – that’s quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: And you know, they welcomed me at the barricade when I brought that gasoline, because whenever Germans approached – and the houses on the left, and on the right, you know, had these bottles, you know, these things were very dangerous for the Germans [indecipherable] we set the fire to a tank, you know, the – the – the crew was jumping out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">A: So this was one of the major operations.</span> <span id="s2240">Then this other one – oh, this was something that I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s2241">We were told, for the areas that were already freed from the Germans, to hang our national flags in front of the houses.</span> <span id="s2242">And this was a – boo-boo, because the Germans marked the areas they saw the flags; there were observation planes flying over, and three Stukas came over, and bombed again, the area where we lived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: They flatten it out.</span> <span id="s2245">I remember as a ki – that I was – I – I was holding a – a – a radiator, you know, on the first floor, and somehow I was found semi-conscious in the – in the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: From that flattening out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: From that flattening out.</span> <span id="s2250">And then, after this, we all took a shelter in the Korczak’s building – Korczak’s building.</span> <span id="s2251">And then – that was August third or fourth, the Germans brought R.O.N.A., you heard of R.O.N.A.?</span> <span id="s2252">R-o-n-a.</span> <span id="s2253">That was Russkaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A: The Russian freedom – freedom army.</span> <span id="s2256">This was General Vlasov, you heard of General Vlasov?</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A: This was a traitor.</span> <span id="s2259">This wa – he was a Russian, and he recruited the Ukrainians, and Russians, whoever was available, and some – some Mongols from the Azure, to put them to work on Poles, the rebellious Poles, and finish us off.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: So in other words, this was a group of Russians who were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: Volunteer –</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: – Russians and other Soviets who were against the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s2263">That is the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: Yes, Vlasov, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q: Yeah, Vlasov armies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">A: Vlasov army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: And they not only were against the Soviet Union, but they joined forces with the Germans, with the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2269">They had the Cossacks –</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Q: Hat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: – hats, with the Hakenkreuz, and the German Wehrmacht uniforms, and some of them had the SS marks.</span> <span id="s2272">So they were special troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q: So what was this – what was distinguished about them, aside from their look?</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">A: Aside from them look, they had that R.O.N.A. badges on their left arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2276">And what did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: And they were used to especially quench the partisan war – partisan war in the countries occupied by the German armies.</span> <span id="s2278">These were under the command of General Bach, von dem Bach.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: Von dem Bach, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: Von dem Bach.</span> <span id="s2281">He was in charge, a specialist for the partisan warfare.</span> <span id="s2282">He was in Warsaw operation on, I think, the fourth or fifth of August.</span> <span id="s2283">And he was the guy that stopped the mass mor – murders of that district Wola.</span> <span id="s2284">Because during that time when the R.O.N.A. came into picture, and they started shooting civilians, 50,000 of ar – Soviets lost their lives because they were cleaning up, mercilessly, all the side streets, and every courtyard was a cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: So they were indiscriminate in who they were shooting?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2287">To the point when that was the fifth or sixth of August, I was in the courtyard – that’s where we lived – and I was in the basement, and some civilians went into basements and they were hiding there.</span> <span id="s2288">The windows were covered with the sandbags, and some metal plates to protect from any kind of outside attack.</span> <span id="s2289">When the R.O.N.A. soldiers came over, they had this German potato mashers, you know, these grenades with that little handle on?</span> <span id="s2290">They used to combine these grenades together and make the bundle of them, and they used to open that little windows and they were tossing into the basement of people.</span> <span id="s2291">And this was almost unbelievable scream of people dying in the basements.</span> <span id="s2292">And they took us, the live ones, they took us outside the building.</span> <span id="s2293">You know, my father was already with – old men separated, and I was pulled by the women on the left side.</span> <span id="s2294">They put some kind of a babushka on my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: A kerchief on your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">A: Yes, and they took us into captivity, we were running along this street of Krochmałna, then Karolkowa, to Wolska Street, then we kept running westbound on Wolska Street.</span> <span id="s2297">And that time I saw last time my father standing already with the hands up in front of Biernatzki – Biernatzki Palace.</span> <span id="s2298">That was a big structure right in the back of that Clement’s church.</span> <span id="s2299">There was the last time I saw my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2302">And we were driven by force, running all the way to Warsaw west station.</span> <span id="s2303">The electrical trains were still operating, Warsaw west.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: Do you know what – excuse me, I’m going to inter – do you know what happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: Well, there were two stories that I heard.</span> <span id="s2306">That the executions of men during the vols – vol – vol – Wola massacre, the execution of the men were two places: one, the Saint Albert church on Wolska Street, and then Franaszek factory.</span> <span id="s2307">This was chemical factory when they were executing men by hundreds and hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s2308">And when they ki – were killed, I heard that they were piled up, you know, the live ones were piling the dead ones, and pouring gasoline over, and burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: And you think that he’s in either one of these places?</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2311">And I think there is a cemetery, Wolski Cmentarz.</span> <span id="s2312">Wolski cemetery, that they say that they buried ashes of about 50 - 60,000 people from Warsaw, all over.</span> <span id="s2313">They were exhuming the dead and burning them.</span> <span id="s2314">And by weighing, you know, how much ash you get from one person, there were some 12 or 14 big trucks carrying the ashes into a common grave at Wolski Cmentarz.</span> <span id="s2315">And I visited this place last time I was there in August.</span> <span id="s2316">And there was a big ceremony, there was American ambassador, there were Polish president Komorowski, and our new allies there was the German Bundeswehr, two officers, I took some pictures of them; politely watching what was happening there.</span> <span id="s2317">It was a big ceremony, and the people came and by – by hundreds, thousands almost, to participate.</span> <span id="s2318">They were four spiritual leaders.</span> <span id="s2319">There was a rabbi, there was Orthodox church, there was evangelical pastor, and a Catholic, you know.</span> <span id="s2320">And they were all praying for those that were – this is the largest cemetery in the world actually, of 50 - 60,000 ashes of people buried.</span> <span id="s2321">And they have the whole yard [indecipherable] to build with these stones, you know, they look like a skull.</span> <span id="s2322">And one older woman, she said, do you know the symbol of these stones?</span> <span id="s2323">But this is large area I’m speaking of.</span> <span id="s2324">And I said no, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2325">These are supposed to, let’s say symbolize the heads of the people that were buried there.</span> <span id="s2326">Wolski Cmentarz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Q: Wolski Cmentarz.</span> <span id="s2328">What happened to your mother and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: Mother and sisters, they were all put into concentration camp Pruszków.</span> <span id="s2330">Pruszków was concentration camp 121.</span> <span id="s2331">Pruszków was the station, let’s say, in the western part of the city.</span> <span id="s2332">That’s where they converted railroad repair shop into a camp for the civilians brought to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: So when we were in Pruszków, the 600,000 [indecipherable] went through two camps: Ozarów and Pruszków.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Q: And I had interrupted you to find out about your father.</span> <span id="s2336">So you were telling me where you were being herded to, more or less, you were being forced to run to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: Yes, this was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">A: – to Warsaw west.</span> <span id="s2340">Warszawa zachodnia, Warsaw west.</span> <span id="s2341">That’s where we boarded the trains that took us over to Pruszków, that was I don’t know, 20 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s2342">Pruszków was a camp where they were loading us into cattle cars after two, three days of – of tremendous, tumultuous situation.</span> <span id="s2343">People were looking for each other, lost you know, wounded, sick.</span> <span id="s2344">There was a Red Cross, and there was that help e – help.</span> <span id="s2345">This whole thing was a chaos, you know, there was the – people were shocked.</span> <span id="s2346">They were s-semi-alive.</span> <span id="s2347">They were put by 70 to a freight car.</span> <span id="s2348">When they loaded the freight car, there was about 40 – 40 – 40 cattle cars.</span> <span id="s2349">And that train moved toward Reich, toward Germany.</span> <span id="s2350">And we were transported – the first stop after seven days, no water, no nothing, you know, the car was locked.</span> <span id="s2351">And there were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: No food, no water.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: Yeah, and there was barbed wire in the windows.</span> <span id="s2354">We had one – one older guy with the – with the knife, scissors.</span> <span id="s2355">So he was cutting the openings in the floor of that car, so this was our –</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: Toilet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">A: – toilet.</span> <span id="s2358">Toilet, yes.</span> <span id="s2359">There was 70 people almost, in the car.</span> <span id="s2360">You know, first stop was Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s2361">You heard of Oranienburg?</span> <span id="s2362">It was a concentration camp that the Germans built – built for the Germans, and all those that did not comply with the German philosophy –</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: Politics, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: – yes.</span> <span id="s2365">So the – first were Germans.</span> <span id="s2366">And then, what happened there, there was night, and I remember Berlin on fire, you know, there was – under bombing, and I think that the British at night were bombing it, because they were throwing these phosphor bombs, and they looked like a Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s2367">So anyway, I peeped through that hole –</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: And this was probably late August, or something?</span> <span id="s2369">When was this, mid-August, late August?</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: That was the beginning of August.</span> <span id="s2371">There was the seven – no, eight te – middle, middle, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">Q: Middle of August.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">A: Middle of August.</span> <span id="s2374">And when we stopped there, what happened is that they disconnected three or four cars.</span> <span id="s2375">And the train was moving at night, not during the daytime, because daytime, any moving train was attacked by the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: Allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: – by the allied, you know, so at night we moved, and the next stop was Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: Weimar, near to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: Exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2382">That was a place that Schiller and Goethe was creating.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">A: Yes, Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">Q: A buti – i-it’s the biggest irony.</span> <span id="s2386">It’s a beautiful little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: And right next to it is Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: Buchenwald, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">A: And so they disconnected three or four cars.</span> <span id="s2392">They were distributing the mar – th-the manpower according to whatever they –</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: Needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">A: – scheduled, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: So after that, you know, the train started moving at night again, and the next stop, I – I – we knew already that something’s gonna happen there.</span> <span id="s2397">We don’t – I use the word [indecipherable] you know, as I mentioned to you on the phone, that you didn’t know the expression –</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: – that we either will be freed going through a stack, though a chimney.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A: Or we wil – gonna be put to work for the Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: So when they moved the train from Weimar, Buchenwald, the next stop was, after a few days – at night, we travel at night, and we stopped at Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2404">The –</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: Oh, you were making all the tourist stops.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: The sightseeing tour, nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: Bergen-Belsen was a place well-known already.</span> <span id="s2409">That’s where they killed many, many Jewish people and international people that were kept in the – in this death machine.</span> <span id="s2410">So again, there was a segregation commission.</span> <span id="s2411">We were out in the field, you know, so latrines were dug up, so we could satisfy our physical necessities there.</span> <span id="s2412">And after medical commission, you know, they, luckily, put us into a group of people that can be still used for work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: And then Bergen-Belsen, they took us to camp.</span> <span id="s2415">This was near Hannover, Lehrte, Lehrte, l-e-h-r-t-e, Lehrte.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: Lehrte, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: And this was a junction, a railroad junction, important ra-railroad junction between Hannover and all the ruhrgebeit(ph) coming through Hannover toward Berlin [indecipherable] Berlin and all the other main cities.</span> <span id="s2418">So there – the camp was located on the – right by the railroad junction.</span> <span id="s2419">There were at least four or five railroad tracks, the main ones.</span> <span id="s2420">Inside was the reloading ramps, about seven or eight reloading zebs – that they were distributing the war material, packages on whatever the Germans stole in the western Europe, you know, that were sending over to their families in Germany.</span> <span id="s2421">So we worked for 12 hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q: So you – that’s what you would be doing, is – is reloading packages from one to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A: Yes, from one car, say that was sorted out that this car will go to Bremen, this car will go to Hamburg, you know, so we were distributing, we were getting the shipment orders, and we knew what to do.</span> <span id="s2424">In this camp, there was international society.</span> <span id="s2425">They were French, they were Belgians, they –</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">Q: Were you slave labor, or were you treated as prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">A: No, this was – th-this was a – a thing that the Germans didn’t know what to do with this, because on the 18, the pressure of allies in the west, exerted on the German government, forced the Germans to take all the AK people as allied army, and this was treated as the prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s2428">Since I was the younger one, and then I couldn’t be, and then I was as a slave laborer, put to work.</span> <span id="s2429">And this camp had the Frenchmen, Belgians, and there was a – a – Yugoslavs that – not the Tito guys, but Mikhailovich?</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">Q: That’s right, Mikhailovich [indecipherable] that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: Mikhailovich.</span> <span id="s2432">So Serbs were there, and the Russians were kept in a different –</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">Q: Place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">A: – section because they didn’t recognize the Geneva Convention, they didn’t have any Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2435">Some of the barracks were marked with the Red Cross sign on top, because of the importance of that railroad junction.</span> <span id="s2436">So they tried to show the allies up in the air, don’t bomb, because this is a hospital, or whatever they thought for a moment.</span> <span id="s2437">But we were put on these ramps, and we worked hard for a bowl of soup –</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: So was your –</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: – piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: Was your conditions worse because you weren’t considered a prisoner of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: I would say about even.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: Even, because, you know, the Reich at that time was already coming, in that agony, to an end; so they really didn’t know what to do with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: You were 15, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: You were 15 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">A: Four – 15 - 15, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">Q: Yeah, 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">A: So, working on that ramp, we were stealing food sometimes.</span> <span id="s2450">I’ll never forget when I ate the pound of butter because I – I took the piece, you know, brick of butter like this, and the German guard, he noticed that, you know, so he followed me, and he was waiting, and I went to satisfy my physical necessities, and I – to cover it up, I ate almost a pound of butter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: My word.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: Took a – I remember one Ukrainian there, he stole some tobacco leaves.</span> <span id="s2453">And we were checked on the end of the day, on – on our end of the day check-up, as we were leaving for the camp again, th-the poor Ukrainian, or Russian at that time, whatever was – he had a cap, and from the cap there’s some parts of the leaves sticking out.</span> <span id="s2454">And the Gestapo ask him now, did – what did you steal this time, Ivan?</span> <span id="s2455">He says, nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s2456">And then he lifted up his –</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">Q: Cap.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">A: – cap, and the leaves started flying down, and that was the end of the guy because they took him right away to the side.</span> <span id="s2459">There was a bunker, there was a bunker in the middle of the station that looked like a innocent building like, but the walls were about a yard thick.</span> <span id="s2460">During the unexpected alerts, when the big boys were coming over, and they were coming over by numbers, Americans were flying these fortresses, you know, that you would pray more and more, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A: They were the white streaks of their frozen exhaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">A: And this was a massive attack, you know, because that was the method that they were bombing was the carpet method.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Q: Carpet bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: They selected the certain [indecipherable] target [indecipherable] leveled off.</span> <span id="s2467">Germans –</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">Q: So did – so did they go into this bunker, the Germans, that you’re descry –</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">A: They used to save us by putting us at the very top.</span> <span id="s2470">The German civilian families were at the very safest bottom portion.</span> <span id="s2471">The transit military, Germans that were in transit, you know, going from place to place during the alert, they used to go in there.</span> <span id="s2472">And we were at the very top.</span> <span id="s2473">So some of the prisoners of war that signed the agreement that they would like to work for the – you know, as civilians, they were there.</span> <span id="s2474">So they put us in the very top.</span> <span id="s2475">We used to sing songs, and all the things that the Germans were getting so aggravated, you know, because we were happy when the bombing was going on.</span> <span id="s2476">Praying more and more.</span> <span id="s2477">That was one scene.</span> <span id="s2478">Another scene was that th – there were transports of cattle.</span> <span id="s2479">They pulled the cattle trains along the ramps, and they sounded the alert.</span> <span id="s2480">Sometimes alert lasted for three, four, or five days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">A: So they pulled the trains away, during the alert, they pulled the trains away so they would protect the material, whatever it was there.</span> <span id="s2483">But when the bombed the train, they opened up these cattle cars.</span> <span id="s2484">You know, there were so many cows out in the field, running away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">Q: Course.</span> <span id="s2486">Poor animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">A: That we started cutting the meat from these cows, and taking it to the barracks, and we smeared the smell of the meat all over the place, so when the German guards came over with the dogs, the dogs were going crazy, because we were hiding the meat in the attics of the barracks.</span> <span id="s2488">Then we had the meat for a couple days, cooking and eating and so on.</span> <span id="s2489">You know, this –</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">Q: And yet the dogs were only smelling the blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2492">They were going crazy.</span> <span id="s2493">Another scene I remember; we were in the movie barrack, movie barrack, they were showing us their victorious times.</span> <span id="s2494">Suddenly, explosion took place, a big explosion.</span> <span id="s2495">These covers that were closing the windows, you know, were blown out.</span> <span id="s2496">We saw flames all over the place.</span> <span id="s2497">We run out of the barracks, and we saw a plane that was shot down, and landed right between the two rows of barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">A: Yeah, the Germans said, oh finally, we shot one of the American planes, you know.</span> <span id="s2500">But we were forced to clean the remains next day, and the Germans told us to bring all these human parts, shoes, whatever.</span> <span id="s2501">Parts that were showing, and I – I found the German belt with the [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s2502">And – and the human leg and the – in the air force boots, you know, they were special boots, heavy, fur-lined, you know.</span> <span id="s2503">And they finally recognized that this was a German plane.</span> <span id="s2504">I think it was ME110, I think, Messerschmitt 110, two engine plane.</span> <span id="s2505">Though there was sadness among them, to see that there was their own plane.</span> <span id="s2506">What other scene I – I remember?</span> <span id="s2507">Oh, this was the times when we started – they remove us.</span> <span id="s2508">When the front was getting closer and closer, they decided to move us out from the camp, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">Q: So were you there for about half a year?</span> <span id="s2510">How long were you there for?</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">A: I’d say [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">Q: In that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">A: – October, November, December.</span> <span id="s2514">December, January, February, March, A-April.</span> <span id="s2515">So about seven, eight da – eight months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: In Lehrte, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: Yeah, yeah, Lehrte by Hannover.</span> <span id="s2518">This was important ta – important town, Lehrte, because of the railroad junction.</span> <span id="s2519">And Misburg was another town, Misburg, where they had the artificial – artificial gasoline plant, you know, and they were – dry distillation, whatever methods they were using, but they were making the gasoline.</span> <span id="s2520">This was very, very, let’s say sensitive [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2521">The Germans used to use a special fog in order to envelop and cover it up.</span> <span id="s2522">So we were getting the clouds of the fog sometimes into that camp, so we couldn’t breathe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A: Anyway, when they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: Did you speak German?</span> <span id="s2526">At that point, did you speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">A: Yeah, pretty – I could understand very well, and – because we were – we were taught German during the time of occupation among the Gray Ranks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">A: I had the teacher, she had the German name.</span> <span id="s2530">Not Benisz(ph), some other one.</span> <span id="s2531">But anyway, my German was pretty – pretty good, in all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">Q: So you – so in some ways that made it a little easier for you.</span> <span id="s2533">Or – or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">A: In a way – I don’t think so, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: No, no, cause I didn’t – I didn’t try to – to give them the privilege, you know.</span> <span id="s2537">So I was still at heart a – a bloody Pole.</span> <span id="s2538">So, when they marched us in the – that was near Senda(ph) when – when I woke up with that carbine at my belly – you know, th-the – the thing was that the American soldiers had no noise in their army boots, they were quiet at night, so they would – I had that carabiner at my belly, you know, they look at me, and – and there was a – a captain, I think, that spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s2539">He was from – he was from Detroit.</span> <span id="s2540">Hamtramck, as I recall, Detroit –</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Q: So, are you talking now when you’re liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">A: Yeah, yeah, the time –</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Q: Okay, so you were le – let’s talk about, you are marched from Lehrte –</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: From Lehrte towards – toward Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">A: And that was sent there on the way, near – near Hildesheim, somewhere along that route, that we were intercepted by Americans already.</span> <span id="s2547">That was the ni-ninth army.</span> <span id="s2548">There was Patton boys heading toward Pilsen, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">Q: It could very well be, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">Q: And so how did the – there’s – you happen to be sleeping, and you feel –</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">A: Because at night, you know, they kept us –</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">A: – to rest, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: The – the guards – the guards were German Volkesdeum(ph).</span> <span id="s2557">These were the units that are already ready for retirement completely, but in the last call they were put to action.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">A: So the guardsman, I don’t know where he was sleeping, but when we – when we got free, the Americans look at us and they said okay, okay guys, let’s – follow us.</span> <span id="s2560">And we went to the back.</span> <span id="s2561">And the first stop was some kind of a field kitchen, you know, so they started to feeding us, and then the pancakes come into picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">Q: So you’re saying this is your breakfast?</span> <span id="s2563">Your first –</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: It was the breakfast, yes, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">Q: Tell us about what was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">A: – first American breakfast.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q: Tell us what it consisted of.</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A: Consisted of, I had a stack of pancakes, about six.</span> <span id="s2569">You know, the army pancakes were big.</span> <span id="s2570">So six of them, and then the big, big glass of – not glass, I mean can of grapefruit juice.</span> <span id="s2571">We were so hungry and exhausted that I think I ate the whole thing, and then I bloated out, and then they took me to the field hospital.</span> <span id="s2572">To the field hospital because I was in danger of – of –</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A: – losing my life.</span> <span id="s2575">Because, you know, the stomach shrunk –</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: – during this starvation time.</span> <span id="s2578">So later on what happened is, from the camp, Lehrte camp, when they brought us back to the same camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">Q: Oh, did they bring you back?</span> <span id="s2580">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">A: But this time, the Americans –</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">Q: Are running it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2586">The show was in American hands.</span> <span id="s2587">And that gemeinschaft lager [indecipherable] Lehrte.</span> <span id="s2588">Then the Brits came over, British came over, and the units provided transportation to take us to Fallingbostel.</span> <span id="s2589">Fallingbostel was one of the largest POW camps in the British zone of Germany, so to speak, graphically, that was near – near Sella, Sella.</span> <span id="s2590">–</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">Q: Oh, that was in the ea –</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">A: Diepholz, Diepholz.</span> <span id="s2593">Coming –</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: So these must have been in what was – what became East Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: No, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: Sella?</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">A: – no.</span> <span id="s2598">Sella – Sella, no.</span> <span id="s2599">Sella –</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: Is West Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: No, that was West Germany, Sella, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: Okay, then I’m – I’m – I’m mixed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: Sella –</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">A: – Bergen-Belsen, yes, the [indecipherable] Dresden, Leipzig

id="s2609">A: I-In that camp we got under the command of Major Skwarnicki, who formed a special AK school units, because we were young guys.</span> <span id="s2610">So they – somehow we got new uniforms, the British uniforms.</span> <span id="s2611">We got armed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">A: Can you imagine this, we had the Enfield rifles we were use for patrolling different stores an-and – and camps for weekends.</span> <span id="s2614">But during the daytime, we were designated for schooling time.</span> <span id="s2615">So I finished the high school in Fallingbostel til 1947.</span> <span id="s2616">I was in military units.</span> <span id="s2617">This was the army of the Rhine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q: So tell me, how did

id="s2638">Q: Fallingbostel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: Yeah, because the war was still going on in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">A: So the May eighth.</span> <span id="s2644">And Dönitz was the guy that signed the armistice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: And this was in Flensburg, that’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">A: South of Denmark, maybe a little bit west.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: So my question is, you stayed there til ’47, did you tra – did you want to go home, did you try to find out what had happened to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A: No, this is – this is a de-delicate matter, because the allies were trying to convince us to return back – to – to remove us from their backs, because there was one and a half million refugees, slave laborers in Germany, and the countries of their origin were already under Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s2651">So we had no place to go.</span> <span id="s2652">So the only thing was saving, let’s say Polish necks, were that we had the units that were under British command, that were part of the allied army.</span> <span id="s2653">The General Marchuk(ph), and there was the paratroopers division, the Sosabowskis that were occupying certain parts of the British zone, was under Polish hands.</span> <span id="s2654">Wilhelmshaven was actually this was base of German – Dönitz submarines, Wilhelmshaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: Mm-hm, that’s right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">A: And this was freed by the Poles.</span> <span id="s2657">So they took care of us in a way, that we were part of the allied occupation forces of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">Q: So there was no pressure to send you back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">A: Th – no, no pressure to send us back, because the pressure we simply defied in a way, that the free Poles, free armed forces were protecting us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">A: But among the Russians, among the Ukrainians, many suicides were committed because people didn’t want to go back to their paradise, the Soviet paradise.</span> <span id="s2662">There were – they were decisively against it, and they knew that, according to the Russian rule, whoever was taken prisoner, he was a ta – traitor – traitor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">Q: So these former POWs, former slave laborers of Germany, who had been – who had been captured by the Germans, didn’t want to go back because they knew that they wouldn’t – they wouldn’t be treated as people who had suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">A: Repats, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">A: The – the Russians especially were afraid because the propaganda that they were fed, you know, that the west if inferior, west is so and so, and so and so, you know.</span> <span id="s2667">Suddenly they were witnesses to something different.</span> <span id="s2668">Many Ukrainians were hiding among the Polish DP camps.</span> <span id="s2669">Many Russians were trying to falsify their papers to – not to be forced to return back.</span> <span id="s2670">There was an agreement between, I think, Roosevelt and Stalin to return all the Russians prisoners of war back to their homeland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">Q: But you stayed.</span> <span id="s2672">Did you try to find out what was happening in Poland with your family, with your mother and your sister?</span> <span id="s2673">Were you able to write to them and fi –</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">A: No, no, my mother and sister were they ro – in – in – with me through the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">Q: Oh, I didn’t realize this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">A: Yes, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">Q: So they had come to Lehrte as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">Q: I see, I see.</span> <span id="s2680">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">A: We were all together til the liberation, and then when finally I – I was – I went through a verification from the Polish government, to prove who I was, and so on.</span> <span id="s2682">They immediately drafted me to the Polish armed forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">Q: Got it.</span> <span id="s2684">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s2686">So this was 1947, when they moved us from Fallingbostel.</span> <span id="s2687">We were demobilized in June, 21st of June, we were demobilized by the Poles, Polish officers from the first armored division, that finally we became civilians.</span> <span id="s2688">But we wanted to continue our schooling.</span> <span id="s2689">So the Camp Fallingbostel and schooling units were transferred to Lehrte, near Diepholz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">A: And that’s where I went to [indecipherable] that’s Lyceum.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">A: This is two years, where I got the matriculation, matura(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">A: This was 1949.</span> <span id="s2696">In ’49, I returned back to Fallingbostel, where my mother, with this DP civilian camp was there.</span> <span id="s2697">And returning back, I got job with the milita – Au-Australian military mission, because they needed translators.</span> <span id="s2698">My English was acceptable at that time, so I became an interpreter, followed my fa-father’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: Father’s footsteps, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: And then I worked for the military mi – Australian military mission, recruiting different people to go to Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">Q: Did you ever have temptation to do so yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">A: No, the consul that I worked, Mr. Dalton, he was a full Brit, I think, Dalton.</span> <span id="s2703">He was from India, he came from India, because when the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">A: – the Indian, let’s say, under the British rule –</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">A: – came to an end, they were all looking for work, so many of them found the jobs at – with IRO, International Refugee Organization, and the infamous UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: UNRRA, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A: UNRRA.</span> <span id="s2710">So this was – this was the case, that I was able to complete the matura(ph), and I got the work.</span> <span id="s2711">In the meantime, working for the Australians, I talked to my, let’s say superior, I said, Mr. Dalton, what do you think?</span> <span id="s2712">Should I sign a two year contract and go down yonder, and chase the rabbits for the government for two years, or should I go to U.S.A.?</span> <span id="s2713">He says, well, to Australia you can always go from U.S.A., but better go where – where you have some relatives there, and I had my uncle in Roebling, New Jersey, and I went to the promised land.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">Q: And did you go –</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">A: This was December – December 9th, 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">A: I arrived to New York on the 20th.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">Q: With your mother and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">A: No, my sister died after – let’s say, from exhaustion.</span> <span id="s2720">She died in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">Q: In Fallingbostel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">A: Not Fallingbostel, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">Q: Lehrte?</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">A: Lehrte, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">Q: When did she die?</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">A: This was – this was, let’s see, when we were liberated in – in April, there was about two months – two months later, I think, she passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: Oh, the poor thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">A: She was exhausted, she – you know, that was – experiences that we had, some people were weak, you know, and couldn’t – couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s2729">So she died, and the only survivor of this whole tragedy was my mother.</span> <span id="s2730">My father was executed in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">Q: You knew this at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2733">And we had many, many people that decided to return back to Poland, you know, about two, three months later they came back.</span> <span id="s2734">Because UNRRA cars were traveling back and forth, you know, bringing the aids, bringing – some of the Polish families were smuggled from Poland to join their husbands, brothers and sisters in the Polish units, free Poles army, and the – in – in the British zone.</span> <span id="s2735">So that was the havoc of the transition from war to peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2737">So, did your mother come with you to the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Q: She did.</span></p> <p><span

remembers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">A: And we moved to new yo – to Roebling, and from Roebling after about year

id="s2751">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2752">And what a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">A: Well, my – my kids are trying to convince me to write the memoirs, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2754">Maybe if I get the inspiration and health.</span> <span id="s2755">So far, so good, you know, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">A: – I’m 86, and

Home Army, and he was in the underscore in Italy.</span> <span id="s2767">Anyway, we started corresponding, you know, and then I figured when Gomułka opened the gates for Poland to allow the westerners to visit Poland – this was 1959, I took my friend here, Henrik(ph), a native – a native Indian, an American.</span> <span id="s2768">I said listen, come along with me.</span> <span id="s2769">He says, oh, I will, I will, I will.</span> <span id="s2770">I – I want to go.</span> <span id="s2771">So both of us went, and we got married in Poland.</span> <span id="s2772">He got
