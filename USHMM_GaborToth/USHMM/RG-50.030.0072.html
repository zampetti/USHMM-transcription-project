oh I have got some as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s25">I uh remember being very very angry at my father, uh and I gather the story is sort of funny.</span> <span id="s26">When I was two, my uh father had decided that I was - oh I was one and a half - my father decided that it was time for me to sit on the pot by myself, and I was, I gather, pretty stubborn, and my mother used to hold me up and he decided I was old enough to sit by myself, and he, so he said, he told me to sit down and I refused, I gather.</span> <span id="s27">Now I don't remember that, and according to the story, he pushed me down and I screamed bloody murder and he walked out - and these are all, this was all reported, and my mother cried and I cried.</span> <span id="s28">Well, what I do remember is that I was so angry at him that when he would come home on Fridays - he traveled - he uh was a representative for a clothing firm - I remember it and I must have been only two years old - hearing the key in the door and I remember even sitting at the table and exactly what I sat, and as soon as I heard the key in the door I would take my plate and I would walk out of the dining room and I would go to the kitchen and eat with our uh our uh our maid, and I just refused I gather, I refused to talk to him for months and I I have a lot of you know respect for that little two-year old with such strong principles.</span> <span id="s29">Uh and then I remember uh going with my mother to visit my aunt and uncle and my cousin was exactly my age in Assen.</span> <span id="s30">And they owned a clothing store there and I was spending a couple of weeks with them and getting to know her which is still a memory on my part because they were sent to Auschwitz and of course never came back and coming back and and reconciling with my father.</span> <span id="s31">I I decided to forgive him after all that time and I talked to him about that and and he said, I said how did you cope with that.</span> <span id="s32">how did you cope with this two year old just refusing to talk to you?</span> <span id="s33">He said, that was your choice and I respected your choice, and that's the kind of man that he is.</span> <span id="s34">Uh, you know, I think he was later on very sorry he had done it but in those days that's that was appropriate discipline.</span> <span id="s35">I remember that I was, interestingly enough, I was my father's favorite.</span> <span id="s36">I was a very bright child.</span> <span id="s37">Uh I was very eager to learn.</span> <span id="s38">I have a brother who is three years older than I am and my brother got into trouble early in the game uh in school, like he was accused of stealing some stealing some crayons when he was in first grade, so I must have been three.</span> <span id="s39">And the teacher called my father and I remember uh, oh my father just being furious at my brother and giving him spanking and sort of feeling, my feeling very sorry for him, and sort of you know wondering how he could be quote, a bad boy.</span> <span id="s40">Uh we lived in a in a we lived in a big house.</span> <span id="s41">My grandparents lived with us.</span> <span id="s42">Uh I don't remember my grandmother very much.</span> <span id="s43">She died in '39, but my mother is German and my father had, as soon as Hitler came to power as a matter of fact in 1933 or '34, my father got my mother's parents out of Germany.</span> <span id="s44">They lived with us in in this house so uh it was my parents, my grandparents and then four children.</span> <span id="s45">My youngest sister was, my younger sister was born in 1938 and then I had another sister born who was born in 1940 but she died in 1943.</span> <span id="s46">And I remember her being born.</span> <span id="s47">She was born just before the war, in 1940, and she was born in January and thinking that that's my baby.</span> <span id="s48">That was my little baby sister - uh like she was my birthday present, so I have had very warm memories of that.</span> <span id="s49">We had a, I remember just feeling very safe in my family.</span> <span id="s50">It was a loving family.</span> <span id="s51">It was a large family.</span> <span id="s52">And it was a family that that cared deeply for each other uh and so you know, just just thinking back to the little two-year old who stood up stood up to her father.</span> <span id="s53">I have a real sense that I was a a strong, competent little girl uh who knew what she wanted.</span> <span id="s54">Another memory I have is we had pictures, family pictures taken, and we had good friends who were photograp...he was a photographer and so I remember just having to sit and pose and finally saying, no more of that.</span> <span id="s55">I didn't want any more.</span> <span id="s56">And I just refused to participate.</span> <span id="s57">So again, uh memories of a little girl who had a strong sense of self, and I think that's significant because that that really changed uh . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Were there other Jews in this town that you lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s60">Yes.</span> <span id="s61">The the photographer as a matter of fact uh, Alter was his name, were Jewish.</span> <span id="s62">Holland I think uh before the war had about 110,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s63">This town we lived in, Breda, didn't, had over 200.</span> <span id="s64">It didn't have a large Jewish community, but it had a synagogue, an orthodox synagogue and my, as a matter of fact I remember my father and my my uh grandfather going to synagogue uh and I remember on Friday night they had services, Friday night, and we had our dinner and the candles on Friday night and uh it was it was a pretty tight Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And you family was a part of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Oh very much part of that.</span> <span id="s67">My parents were both raised in orthodox Jewish homes, my mother in Germany and my father in in Holland, but uh my father rebelled very early uh against orthodox Judaism so altho...although I'm not quite sure - we kept the kosh..., my parents kept a kosher home but I'm not sure whether it was mostly for their uh sake as it was for my grandfather's sake who was raised and had lived all his live in an orthodox family.</span> <span id="s68">But definitely part, strong part of the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Uh do you have any recollections of the beginning of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s71">I do.</span> <span id="s72">Uh I was four and the the the strongest recollection is when the Germans invaded because what happened was that we were told that they were going to bomb Breda and so all of us, and that was Jews, non-Jews, uh were told to leave Breda and my brother was hospitalized - he had a middle ear infection - and my mother was frantic because we were all told to leave.</span> <span id="s73">My mother was absolutely frantic, was trying to get him into a hospital and they were told that they had to keep the hospitals empty for the wounded that were expected, so all of us, uh all of us including my baby sister and my aunt - at that point my aunt, my mother's only sister and her daughter also lived with us, so it was a hugh family.</span> <span id="s74">My my grandfather who was oh 80 years, uh five small children - by that time my baby sister was born - five small children, uh the oldest of whom was seven, my parents, my aunt and her daughter, all had to leave Breda.</span> <span id="s75">I remember that.</span> <span id="s76">We were, we had to walk - we walked about I would say between twenty and thirty kilometers along a road uh trying to find farms where we could stay and I remember being strafed --the bombs, the Germans would bomb us.</span> <span id="s77">And uh there were seventy people killed just along that road and I remember uh a woman still standing over her baby carriage, protecting her baby who was killed.</span> <span id="s78">And every time the the airplanes would come, my aunt, my mother's sister, would pull us aside and and she was particularly fond of me and she'd literally cover me with her body.</span> <span id="s79">And then when the airplanes left then we'd walk again, and I remember stopping at farms and the farms would be full and finally - I think it was about 28 kilometers - we had walked 28 kilometers - uh getting to a farm where they had some room and we spent about five days there, sleeping in the hay, until the all-clear was sounded and then walking back - the having to walk back we were not strafed - I don't remember being strafed or bombed during that walk back.</span> <span id="s80">Uh and half way through some buses came and so mothers with children were allowed to go on the buses and so we didn't we didn't have to walk all the way back.</span> <span id="s81">And coming back to our town and founding, finding the town unscathed basically - so that was the first memory of the war.</span> <span id="s82">Uh then ...</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: When you returned to the town, was it already occupied by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s85">You see at that point the Germans - they they overrun, they overran Holland in five days, so I mean the the Dutch put up a strong resistance but you know, they were not prepared to deal with the masses and then of course the Germans bombed Rotterdam as punishment for German, for Dutch resistance.</span> <span id="s86">And uh so we were immediately occupied by the Germans and nothing much happened immediately but then my memories of those early years are pretty vague because they they started rounding up Jews - oh first from the coast.</span> <span id="s87">Now Breda is 50 kilometers north of Antwerp and 50 kilometers southeast of Rotterdam, and I gather they picked up Jews initially from the coastlines, so to prevent them from fleeing.</span> <span id="s88">That's why I think there were so many Dutch were murd... were massacred - they they just had no place to go.</span> <span id="s89">They couldn't leave.</span> <span id="s90">Holland was immediately occupied and all exits were basically uh closed and so you were trapped in, we were trapped in our own country.</span> <span id="s91">And the first memories I have uh I have is of wearing a yellow, having to wear a yellow star and I was four, so I wasn't ready for school yet, but uh I remember that because we wore a yellow star, we weren't allowed to ride the buses.</span> <span id="s92">I remember we weren't allowed to have radios.</span> <span id="s93">Uh and then we were told that when I was ready to go to school in 1942, well really it was 1941, uh we couldn't go to school anymore and so for a while there was a little Jewish school that they had in a - I remember it was on the second floor of a of a building down town Breda, and going there and sitting in a classroom with who knows - twenty other Jewish children.</span> <span id="s94">And the children just disappearing.</span> <span id="s95">I mean one after the other these children just disappeared until that school closed and then my father tried to teach us at home and I think that was in 1942 because Jewish children were not allowed to go to school anymore.</span> <span id="s96">And and then you know, getting strong messages that that something very bad was going to happen and it was scary and my parents being scared and just fear, fear enveloping the family pretty much.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: When you mentioned the children disappearing from the school, were were families at that point being deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s99">That's when they started.</span> <span id="s100">They started deporting the Dutch Jews, as I said they uh they started first deporting them from the coasts.</span> <span id="s101">They didn't - the reason we we survived is because they didn't get to us until 1942 uh so we lived in Breda until 19...until the fall of 1942 uh but had they come had they come to us earlier we would have we would have disappeared too.</span> <span id="s102">Uh see I have a memory still and this this was how close that it was.</span> <span id="s103">My aunt lived in the same town we did but in a suburb of it, and they picked her up oh I think a couple of months before they came to us, and I can remember, I mean I have a clear memory of standing in our doorway in the house that we lived in and waving goodbye to her and her daughter, and they were off to a Polish war camp.</span> <span id="s104">That's what I was told.</span> <span id="s105">And they went with a baby carriage to the train station where they were sent to Auschwitz and of course never came back.</span> <span id="s106">And that was the aunt who was very very close to me, my mother's only sister and her daughter.</span> <span id="s107">So uh, so they were sent to Auschwitz uh where we would have gone too uh but - oh yeah, because we lived in Breda so we were just far enough from the border that we were to be picked up later.</span> <span id="s108">And uh it just, and these children you know, may have lived on the on the outlying areas of Breda, the children, and then of course the schools closed because there were no children really left.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: During this period of the of the occupation, uh how did your parents tell you how to behave when you left the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Uh, to be very very careful.</span> <span id="s111">I mean we wore yellow stars and and the yellow...the way it worked in Holland is that everybody had to have an ausweiss.</span> <span id="s112">That was like a passport, and - including us children - and uh in order for us in order for one to have rationing cards you had to have an ausweiss, and Jews had a big J on their ausweiss.</span> <span id="s113">And, of course, we had to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s114">So you could be stopped at any time and asked for your ausweiss, and if you if you didn't have your ausweiss with you or and you wore a yellow star, you were shot almost you were shot immediately.</span> <span id="s115">So what basically happened is we, they didn't let us uh - we were young anyway - but they didn't, they they became extremely protective of us and they didn't let us be out on the street by ourselves.</span> <span id="s116">And when we would go out, it was with my grandfather.</span> <span id="s117">My grandmother had died in '39 but my grandfather would take us for walks.</span> <span id="s118">As a matter of fact that's one of the reasons we were saved.</span> <span id="s119">It's just incredible, incredible uh circumstance.</span> <span id="s120">When I ...</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Shoot.</span> <span id="s122">Why don't you go ahead and talk about that.</span> <span id="s123">We can go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s125">The uh uh so that that - what happened was that life became totally family-oriented, that uh they first picked up the Jewish men and I - that's another extraordinary situation - that my my mother's father uh had been very very wealthy, and lived in Zempelburg [Pol: S_pólno, or S_pólno Krai_skie] in Germany.</span> <span id="s126">And after the 1st World War, during the 1st World War, had contributed a lot of money to the German war effort, and after World War I when that part of Germany where he lived uh became Polish, and he opted to remain German and he moved to Berlin, and he got a Cross of Merit from the German Kaiser.</span> <span id="s127">Uh they picked up Dutch men first.</span> <span id="s128">They took them, Jewish men first and they took them to slave labor camps and my father had sort of been excused a couple of times one because he was head of the Jewish Council, or he was not perhaps not head but he was a member of the Jewish Council, because he had five children, uh and so on, but he had to, he was to report and I can remember it - my mother just being in tears.</span> <span id="s129">Well, the day before, the day before my father was to report, my mother, and she is an incredible woman really - she took that Cross of Merit to the Nazi commander of our town, and everybody said don't be ridiculous - it's not going to do you any good, and she said look at what my father did for you know the fatherland, and he actually acc...he actually excused my father, thanks to her.</span> <span id="s130">And again, that saved our lives because without my father we would not have been saved.</span> <span id="s131">And the next week, it turned out that was about a week before the rest of the family was going to be called out - we disappeared within that week.</span> <span id="s132">And the reason we survived is because a man who worked for City Hall, uh and I don't know - this this is what I was told - I mean that's not a memory I have.</span> <span id="s133">I remember walking with my with my grandfather of course, but what happened uh he would take us for walks and a man who worked for City Hall knew what was knew what was happening to Jews.</span> <span id="s134">By 1942 by the way everybody knew what was happening to Jews, so the the idea that people didn't know and America didn't know, and England didn't know is garbage.</span> <span id="s135">Because we knew and we had no radio.</span> <span id="s136">And everybody knew.</span> <span id="s137">Uh and uh this man had seen us because he worked for City Hall.</span> <span id="s138">He was familiar with what's happening.</span> <span id="s139">He had seen my father take us four children for a walk.</span> <span id="s140">My baby sister was too little.</span> <span id="s141">And he felt so sorry for us because he knew what was going to happen to us, that one day he came to our house, he came to my father's house and he basically said do you want to be killed.</span> <span id="s142">My father said no.</span> <span id="s143">He said well, why don't you do something about it.</span> <span id="s144">My father said what can I do - I've got five small children and an elderly father-in-law.</span> <span id="s145">And he said if I, if I promise to help you, will you try and get out, and within a week - and I remember a significant part of that - uh other friends, Dutch friends had given us names of people who were willing to take in Jewish children, and within a week we disappeared, and it turned out to be just in time, just before the whole family would have been deported to Auschwitz, because most Jews went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s146">Uh and what he did is he gave us false passports so the false ausweiss, so as our name was in Dutch "Magnus," uh he gave us authentic passports--because he had access to the blanks--and with new names.</span> <span id="s147">And our new name became "Wachness.”</span> <span id="s148">Of course, Magnus is spelled M - A - G - N - U - S. Wachness was spelled - it sounds the same.</span> <span id="s149">So if we would make a mistake, it wouldn't be as noticeable.</span> <span id="s150">But the spelling was totally different - it was W - A - C - H - N - E - S - S. And uh and I remember one day we were playing outside and my mother calling us in and saying, children, we want you all to pick a new name.</span> <span id="s151">And we had, because Anita is not a common Dutch name - uh we had always pretended we had different names, and I still feel bad about this because my sister Ingrid, the young...one just below me, her her play name had been Leesha (ph), but that's the one I had coveted, and mine had been Lanie (ph) and so when we got to pick new names, I said I want to be Leesha, and I remember Ingrid saying that's my name and I said well I got to be first again.</span> <span id="s152">You know, I was the older girl so I got to pick so that's how we picked the new name.</span> <span id="s153">My brother's name was Norman.</span> <span id="s154">He became Jan.</span> <span id="s155">I became Leesha.</span> <span id="s156">My sister Ingrid became Lenie (ph) and my other sister Helga became Hennie.</span> <span id="s157">And so we got to pick new names and that's that seemed like a big lark to us and then we were called inside, and in the meantime my parents had gotten names of people who were willing to take us - we were called inside and we were told that we were all going to go away.</span> <span id="s158">And that we were going to go to strange people, and uh my parents didn't know who they were, but that if we didn't go we would not...we would be killed.</span> <span id="s159">And that we were never ever to tell anybody that we were Jewish because that would mean that we would die.</span> <span id="s160">And that we would have our new names, we would live with these people, and that the story that they made up was - it's still a peculiar story that we had, we were Dutch but we had lived in a small town called Emden, which is near...it's a German town near the Dutch border, northwestern Germany, and that when the war broke out we decided we wanted to be in Holland - we didn't want to be, so we basically were refugees from Germany and my grandfather who's who's German, that he was Swiss - uh and uh and because we were refugees we couldn't live with our parents because my parents, our parents were looking for jobs someplace else.</span> <span id="s161">And that's why we were, that's why we had to be you know with strange people.</span> <span id="s162">That was the story that we were to tell people who would ask us uh you know why we weren't living with our parents.</span> <span id="s163">Immediately after that my brother and I were taken away and taken to a family in the same town we lived in, and we stayed there for two weeks and uh was, they lived in a house that - and again in Holland because it's so such a crowded country, several families would live in the in the same house, so we lived on the second floor of this house and there were another family living on the first floor.</span> <span id="s164">The family on the first floor did not know that we were on the second floor.</span> <span id="s165">So for two weeks we could not move.</span> <span id="s166">I remember we slept in the bathtub.</span> <span id="s167">We could not talk.</span> <span id="s168">We could not move.</span> <span id="s169">We couldn't do anything because we were told that if they, the people downstairs would find out that we were upstairs we'd be killed.</span> <span id="s170">And we, I remember also that sometimes they would take us out twelve o'clock at night just to give us some fresh air.</span> <span id="s171">So we'd we'd go outside and that was that was a very hard time because in the mean...you know, we had no idea where our parents were.</span> <span id="s172">I mean there is a six-year old and a nine-year old just taken away, totally, from parents, sisters, and everything else and and, and yet we knew - you know, there was no crying.</span> <span id="s173">There was no whining.</span> <span id="s174">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s175">There was just obedience.</span> <span id="s176">And then after two weeks we were taken by some other people to the middle of the country and we stayed for two years with a magnificent family called the Buchas (ph) in Bilthoven--uh, which is a small town north of Utrecht, which is in the middle of Holland.</span> <span id="s177">And they ran a very progressive school called the "Werkplatz (ph)," the "work place.”</span> <span id="s178">She was a daughter of the Cadbury family of the British chocolates Cadbury family.</span> <span id="s179">And they were Quakers; and because they ran a school, they took in other children who were not Jewish and so for them to have other children there was not as obvious as it would have been for you know for an ordinary family.</span> <span id="s180">So that was a very safe place for us to be.</span> <span id="s181">Now we were told never ever ever to tell anybody we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s182">That nobody knew and that we were never to let it be known, and so that was a horrendous burden on us.</span> <span id="s183">On me particularly and it's interesting that when my brother's much older, well three years older than I am, I think I was much more conscious of the whole situation than he was and uh and my earliest memory - I think when we we went to Bilthoven in in October - no in September of 1942, and again what surprises me in retrospect is that there was no questioning - it was it was real acceptance and real understanding of what was going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s184">There was no question about the fact that if we were discovered we would be killed.</span> <span id="s185">I mean that, we lived with that throughout the war, and I also - you know, now when I think about the horror of it, it blows me away.</span> <span id="s186">But I'm so grateful we were children because we accepted it - there was none of the the fear of the neurosis, or the neurosis or anything else.</span> <span id="s187">There was none of the pathology that that could have induced really uh because we just knew it was going to happen - that that was the way, you know, being very concrete still uh we just accepted that's the way it was and it was scary.</span> <span id="s188">Uh my father came to visit us in October; so after months, my father appeared.</span> <span id="s189">And it turned out he and my mother and my grandfather had gone to uh Limburg, which is in the southeastern part of Holland.</span> <span id="s190">We tried to go places where nobody knew us.</span> <span id="s191">My two younger sisters came about a month later and uh they had gone with my parents to Limburg but that was too dangerous, so they they leaved them with another teacher of the school in the same town that my brother and I were.</span> <span id="s192">And my baby sitter...sist...uh sister Rita went to _______ which is in the western part of the country; though she died of diphtheria in 1943, so I never never saw her again.</span> <span id="s193">Uh but my father came in October; and I'll remember his visit and it was incredible to see him.</span> <span id="s194">And he told us that uh he told us that uh our birthdays have been changed.</span> <span id="s195">That my brother, whose birthday was November 10th, was his new birthday was January 3rd.</span> <span id="s196">And my birthday, which is January 29th, was going to be January 21.</span> <span id="s197">And we accepted all that.</span> <span id="s198">You know, again, you didn't question - that was the way it was, because it turned out that those were the birthdays that were in our new ausweiss - our new ausweiss which didn't have a J on it.</span> <span id="s199">Of course, no J's on our clothes, no no stars on our on our, no yellow stars on our clothes.</span> <span id="s200">And uh one of the children of the family we stayed, the Bucha family, I remember saying to my brother, "Norman,"--I mean, "Jan, Jan, what's his name, Jan.</span> <span id="s201">You know, you have a birthday coming up pretty soon.”</span> <span id="s202">And I said, "Oh, no, no.</span> <span id="s203">His birthday's not until January 3rd.</span> <span id="s204">We confused his birthday with a friend of his.”</span> <span id="s205">Now unlikely story, but perfect logic to a six-year old.</span> <span id="s206">Uh and I I that's what I remember about me - an extraordinary competence - that sounds sort of conceited but in in dealing with the situation and making up stories and it also gives me today such enormous respect for for children - I, they're capable of infinitely more you know than we ever give them credit for, so uh because I have these strong memories still of myself when I was when I was six years old.</span> <span id="s207">Then the next major trauma was Santa Claus.</span> <span id="s208">Now Santa Claus comes on December 5 in Holland and he is, he comes from Spain and it's a non-religious holiday.</span> <span id="s209">It's not like Christmas here.</span> <span id="s210">It's Santa Claus who comes with his black moire (ph) - his name is Peter from Spain on his white steed with his miter and and his staff.</span> <span id="s211">Uh Peter has a big uh bag on his back and if you've been a good kid then you get candy and if you've been a bad kid you get put in the bag and sent, taken back to Spain, so ....(laughter) and I remember being in agony because you see I believed in Santa Claus and I was quite sure that Santa Claus didn't know that my name had changed, and I couldn't tell Betty Bucha that I really wasn't Leesha Wachness - that I really was Anita Magnus - because that would let her know that I was Jewish - I mean I didn't - of course they knew, but I didn't know that they knew.</span> <span id="s212">So I can remember being absolutely terrified of Santa Claus coming because the way Santa Claus is in Holland, he comes in and visits and he sits down and you know he says, well, you know, have you been a good girl and stuff like that, and uh I felt totally trapped - that's, talking about terror - I was in pure terror.</span> <span id="s213">Uh and I'll never never forget when he came and already trying to make up stories about what I would say to him if, when he called me Anita.</span> <span id="s214">I would tell him that he was making a mistake.</span> <span id="s215">But he came in, and because I was the youngest of the family, uh he said well, Leesha, have you been a good girl, and my relief - thinking my God, he knows everything.</span> <span id="s216">You know, because I so firmly believed - it was, I'll never for...you know, I'll never forget that intense relief of not being betrayed, because even a Santa Claus could betray us.</span> <span id="s217">So uh when my father left us, and I'm back-tracking a little bit - my father left us, my brother and I had to go to bed very early - I remember seven o'clock - uh we started to cry and that's probably the most intensive crying and I, in retrospect I think we we started with pre...pretend crying, and I'm not quite sure whether we did that because we really wanted to cry ..... [Phrase missing]...a loving, caring oh unbelievably wonderful woman.</span> <span id="s218">When she came upstairs, I was afraid we were going to be punished, but she she of course didn't punish us.</span> <span id="s219">She was very very nurturing and very loving and and seemed to understand why we were crying.</span> <span id="s220">But I learned early in the game during the war years uh I learned early that there was something very wrong with who I was.</span> <span id="s221">I mean that's probably one of the major lessons.</span> <span id="s222">I mean when you look at our lives I mean we were among the most fortunate of all Jews in Holland because we were not, we were out in the open.</span> <span id="s223">We were like Dutch children except we didn't live with our parents, and sure we were in danger and it turned out that several times they were very very close to catching us.</span> <span id="s224">I'll get in to that in a moment, but when you compare it to most, to most other kids who were, like Anne Frank who was hidden uh for years, you know, and they could not go out and we were infinitely more fortunate.</span> <span id="s225">Uh we were out.</span> <span id="s226">We were able to go to school.</span> <span id="s227">We, and the school was a magnificent school, very progressive.</span> <span id="s228">Uh we had friends.</span> <span id="s229">We could play, could breathe fresh air and yet we also knew that, and I knew very intensively uh intensely, that I could be betrayed anytime, and so I learned early in the game that I was not to draw any attention to myself.</span> <span id="s230">That I could not, I had to be a very good girl.</span> <span id="s231">I could not be naughty.</span> <span id="s232">I could not do anything that would make anybody notice me.</span> <span id="s233">And so I learned not to complain and I learned not to express any feelings and I learned not to be a bad girl and I learned not to ever disobey because anything - I didn't dare do anything that again would make people angry at me because if they were angry at me they might betray me.</span> <span id="s234">So it it put this this vice around me, basically, and when I compare that to the little girl who snubbed her father you know I I am aware of what a dramatic impact that war had, uh and at and it was really the most the most poignant memory I have was oh in 1943 I think it was, uh we were riding on what's a [bock... (ph)] - it's a bicycle with a big sort of uh box in front of it and that's how they would transport vegetables and stuff like that - and somebody was riding it and my brother and I were sitting in it, on the edge and I was holding on and then I noticed my brother was not holding on and I of course being you know wanting to be just as brave as he, I decided not to hold on just at the worse possible time as he was going around the corner, and I fell off the [bock... (ph)], hit my head on the on the asphalt, on the pavement.</span> <span id="s235">I'm sure I had a concussion, but I thought I'd done something very bad, and I had the most blinding headache that I can imagine and I I went back.</span> <span id="s236">I didn't say anything because I thought I'd done something very bad.</span> <span id="s237">I didn't say anything to Betty Bucha, but I was in such pain that I would just start crying and I'd just walk out of the room, and would come back and then I would just be in so much pain again and I would just walk out again.</span> <span id="s238">I remember I just was going in and out, just terrified of being noticed, so I never told her.</span> <span id="s239">And another time I was running and I ran into a wall, and I got a a big uh cut on my forehead.</span> <span id="s240">My terror was about being betrayed to the Germans.</span> <span id="s241">It wasn't about hurting.</span> <span id="s242">It wasn't about, you know, having fallen.</span> <span id="s243">It was that I had done something bad, and I was, this could meant the end of my life.</span> <span id="s244">I mean crazy associations.</span> <span id="s245">But basically I learned that uh I, you know, I I was not to ever do anything that in anyway would make anybody mad at me or upset at me or or would draw attention to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Were there many Germans in the this town where the school was located?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s248">Oh there were Germans all over the place.</span> <span id="s249">They were not, in Holland they were not as as obvious I mean you know that, during the war during the war itself because they they felt the Dutch were also Aryans so the Dutch except for the Jews were just fine and they really believed that the Dutch would eventually cooperate with them.</span> <span id="s250">And so for the first four years, except they did pick up a lot of Dutch men, they were quite quite lenient with the Dutch population itself and no where as vicious and brutal as they were for example with the with the Poles or with the uh with the Russians, particularly the Ukrainians because they were the untermenschen.</span> <span id="s251">The Dutch were supposedly part of the great Aryan race - the the super race, and it was just the Jews who were you know the vermin, according to their uh philosophy.</span> <span id="s252">So the Dutch, Holland didn't really - no, that's not true - the underground of course suffered.</span> <span id="s253">I mean they, when you were caught helping Jews or if you were caught working underground but the but the but the actual occupation did not become very serious until 1944 when they finally convinced uh were convinced the Dutch were not going to join them in their uh lunacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: What what happened next in in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Well, we stayed in that school for two years.</span> <span id="s256">Uh and I I did well and we stayed with this wonderful family for two years.</span> <span id="s257">We were again very fortunate - my two younger sisters were not as fortunate because they were shifted from one family to the next.</span> <span id="s258">But we stayed with the same family.</span> <span id="s259">We moved several times but that's because the Germans the Germans uh took over.</span> <span id="s260">I mean they, we lived in a house near the school and the Germans requisitioned that, and then we moved to another house and then we moved to another house, but that was because the Germans just you know, when they when they wanted houses they just kicked people out.</span> <span id="s261">But we just lived with the family.</span> <span id="s262">We would go and we visited our parents once during Christmas and uh there was there was uh and that was the first time that I had seen....I can't remember whether - that was not Christmas of '42.</span> <span id="s263">I think we visited them Christmas of '43.</span> <span id="s264">Uh I can remember in '43 I saw my mother I think for the first time because my baby sister died, uh Rita died in _____ and she came and told us that Rita had died and I remember just crying, being incredibly unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: So your mother came to the school, or to the house....?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes, to the house where we were staying, yeah, to tell us that Rita had died.</span> <span id="s267">And then I just remember just being very sad and crying.</span> <span id="s268">But the the most amazing thing was that we just sort of accepted it.</span> <span id="s269">You know, we never whined.</span> <span id="s270">We never demanded.</span> <span id="s271">We never we never did anything I think to betray our family or or even endanger our family.</span> <span id="s272">The the biggest danger to us came, well there were lots - it turned out there were lots of times when my parents were very close to being discovered - and the reason we survived is because the Dutch that, who encountered us didn't betray us.</span> <span id="s273">It was just the unbelievable luck that all the Dutch who discovered our Jewishness were good were good people.</span> <span id="s274">And that included the Dutch police.</span> <span id="s275">And you know again most Jews were not that fortunate.</span> <span id="s276">But the most dangerous time for us came in 1943 when uh my sister stayed with some teachers at that school and one of them was caught with some communist books, and when she was asked who else lived in that house, uh she said well, two little girls.</span> <span id="s277">And they said immediately now that those are Jews.</span> <span id="s278">I mean they they assumed that any children who who weren't, who didn't live with their parents were Jewish children.</span> <span id="s279">So that was the first time that we were going to go and visit our parents so we, the first time that I must have visited them was in the summer of '40...'43.</span> <span id="s280">Uh and the Germans uh we were told were going to accompany us on the train and they were going to interrogate us on the train and that would have been the end of us because there is no way that we were sophisticated enough to to make up enough of a story uh particularly my younger sisters wouldn't have.</span> <span id="s281">They, who are one and two years younger than I am, but German thoroughness of course demanded that they could look at these Jewish children and it so happened that my younger sister and I were standing in front of the house.</span> <span id="s282">Now uh I was quite, much lighter and I have blue eyes and you know, I don't, I'm not typically Jewish - I don't have a semit...I don't have Semitic features and my sister, my younger sister has blonde curly hair, blue eyed.</span> <span id="s283">I mean, and they looked at us and said, _______________________.</span> <span id="s284">You know, "They can't be Jews.”</span> <span id="s285">So...because we didn't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s286">And that was one of the reasons, as a matter of fact, that we were saved is because the man who gave us, _____________ was his name, who gave us the false passports, said that he he had selected us to help because we did not have Semitic features.</span> <span id="s287">I mean it's just a horrifying thought when you think about it, but it allowed us or the fact that we were not quote "typically" whatever typically Jewish is.</span> <span id="s288">Of course we didn't look typically Jewish - uh that's how come we survived.</span> <span id="s289">And again we didn't fit the German stereotype of you know typical Jews.</span> <span id="s290">So again we were miraculously saved.</span> <span id="s291">Uh I mean we miraculously not not trapped.</span> <span id="s292">Uh my parents had, I gather, they told me they had razor blades ready.</span> <span id="s293">They were not going to be caught alive.</span> <span id="s294">They were not.</span> <span id="s295">They knew what was going to happen to them and they weren't uh...and they also, they would have killed themselves because they also knew if they were caught they would betray us and so again you know there were all all these very conscious decisions were made as to trying to have as many of us survive as possible.</span> <span id="s296">And we were able to visit them in in the summer.</span> <span id="s297">I spent I think a week with them and then we visited them again in the following Christmas and there we had an accident happen to us.</span> <span id="s298">We were standing at a, they were they were sledding down a slope, a snowy slope, and mother and my sister and I were standing too close and a sled ran over us.</span> <span id="s299">My mother had high boots on but I didn't and I got a deep wound which became severely infected and I got boils all over my body.</span> <span id="s300">And that was on two of my legs and which which didn't heal for months until until the following spring.</span> <span id="s301">Again lucky that I was strong enough, we survived - you know, there wasn't any penicillin and uh so on.</span> <span id="s302">But basically in 19...for two years we lived as school children and we lived without our parents and we lived with fear and I can remember saying to one of the other girls, the daughter of the family, I said I have a very big secret but I can't tell you until the war is over.</span> <span id="s303">(Laughter) I, it was like, you know, I was like I knew the war one day would be over, so I must have a lot of hope uh and a lot a lot of optimism.</span> <span id="s304">I guess I must have felt that we would live.</span> <span id="s305">Uh and at the same time I remember my major mission was not to do anything that would betray us.</span> <span id="s306">And my middle, my younger sisters would sometimes really do dumb things like well, dumb things, what do you expect of a - I was six, so they were four and five.</span> <span id="s307">I remember Ingrid at one point, we were walking and she said oh she said oh Leesha - I was Leesha - Leesha, you know I met a I met a girl whose name was Ingrid and I told her that used to be my name.</span> <span id="s308">And I said don't ever say that (laughter) - I remember having to remind her that she was not to not to ever ever uh uh you know remind anyone or tell anybody that that Lanie wasn't her real name.</span> <span id="s309">But what's remarkable is that we played we the game right on until the very end.</span> <span id="s310">Uh and again turned out that the only people knew we were Jewish was the family itself.</span> <span id="s311">Their children didn't know we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s312">And, but we made friends and we saw our parents every once in a while and uh again unbelievable fortune fell our way because uh at in 1944 my, when after the Normandy landing uh things became very tight and that's when the Germans became more vicious towards the Dutch.</span> <span id="s313">We had gone with the family to a farm in ______ and there was a lot of bombing, a lot of strafing, and the family told my parents they could no longer be responsible for us.</span> <span id="s314">So that was, that was August of '44 and my mother came - my mother has always been very brave.</span> <span id="s315">My father has said if it weren't for my mother and her courage we would never have survived the war, because she again and again and again, she would be the one who who said to my father, you know, it's going to work out and she would she would take on the police who came to the house and questioned them and interrogated them, cause see from their perspective they were interrogated many times about who they were and what they were doing.</span> <span id="s316">Now they were out in the open too, but my father wasn't working and so their story was a more difficult one than ours, and so they had continual contact with [Pinkstrum (ph)], the one who gave us the false papers, and he again throughout the war continued to help us make up stories supporting my parents' stories and so on so that if we had had one NSB--which was the Nazi...which was the Nazi support group in Holland.</span> <span id="s317">If we had had one real Nazi supporter, we would never have made it.</span> <span id="s318">But uh somehow, again, we...we didn't.</span> <span id="s319">But in 1944, my mother came to get us.</span> <span id="s320">She got my brother and me; and my two younger sisters already were with her.</span> <span id="s321">And incredibly, in September of 1944, we were liberated by the Americans.</span> <span id="s322">Uh they came up, they had landed in Normandy, and they came up through Belgium and just through a tiny part of Holland.</span> <span id="s323">And they were supposed to meet up with the British at Arnhem.</span> <span id="s324">They made a movie, "The bridge...", "A Bridge Too Far.”</span> <span id="s325">And, of course, there was a German panzer division at Arnhem; and the British were defeated there.</span> <span id="s326">So instead of liberating the rest of Holland, they went into Germany.</span> <span id="s327">Had we stayed in the middle of Holland we would not have been liberated until May of 1945.</span> <span id="s328">But we were liberated uh uh - as I said we we went back to Limburg in August.</span> <span id="s329">And in September, I'll never forget that in September of 1944, lots of bombing, lots of explosions.</span> <span id="s330">Was a Sunday and my mother came - we were sleeping on the attic, and we slept, we stayed in a house but my parents had rented the front room and a couple of bedrooms of a very nasty, ugly woman uh who turned out... She said, "If I had known you were Jews, you would never have lived.”</span> <span id="s331">______ horrible woman.</span> <span id="s332">Her name was [Bilders (ph)].</span> <span id="s333">Anyway, we, my, there was so much bombing that my parents, my mother came to get us and we were standing in the in the front living room, and my mother was combing my hair, and there was a table here - my mother was standing here and I was standing right there - and there was the window.</span> <span id="s334">And a grenade exploded.</span> <span id="s335">And a big piece of the grenade flew right between my mother and me and scorched her nose.</span> <span id="s336">And it bounced against the wall, and it bounced back on the table and a pair of pajamas and the pajamas burst burst into flames, but again you know death was so close.</span> <span id="s337">Uh it's it's just miraculous - a few inches either direction would have killed either my mother or me.</span> <span id="s338">Uh so we got out of the living room and we spent the day in the cellar, and we heard all the shooting.</span> <span id="s339">My mother again was very brave.</span> <span id="s340">She would go upstairs and I'm I'll never forget at four o'clock, it was about four o'clock and she would go upstairs.</span> <span id="s341">At four o'clock she screamed - she said the Americans are here.</span> <span id="s342">And I, if there's anything that stands out in my memory it's it's those words - the Americans, the Americans were here.</span> <span id="s343">And the Americans coming up on the hill - uh we lived sort of on a hill, and the Amer...the Germans were retreating up the hill, and they were shooting down at the Americans.</span> <span id="s344">Of course we were dying to go upstairs, and uh see what was happening, uh and we were allowed to, after a while we were allowed to go up, and I cannot tell you what that meant.</span> <span id="s345">I, it's a memory that you know will never cease in my mind.</span> <span id="s346">As, I think America has always had such a close place in my heart because it meant it meant life for us, and in all sorts of ways, and that was before we had any idea we would ever come here.</span> <span id="s347">Uh but there were the American soldiers and they were being shot at by the Germans but it didn't seem to bother them very much.</span> <span id="s348">They were ducking the bullets.</span> <span id="s349">And then after a few days when we were allowed to go - perhaps two days I think - we were not allowed to go out because there was so much shooting going on, but after a few days we were allowed to go out - one of the best sights I remember seeing was Germans with their arms, you know, over their head and the feeling that they no longer present the threat to us and that we no longer were in danger was just a relief and an over-whelming sense that, you know, it's hard to describe.</span> <span id="s350">I mean talking about freedom and I was then eight years old and I'll never forget that immense relief.</span> <span id="s351">What was amazing was that uh in December of course we had the Battle of the Bulge, and at that point everybody knew we were Jewish - some, everybody knew - that little town that we lived in was uh ______, a little town near _______ in Holland.</span> <span id="s352">Of course then it was clear you know, we made it and let people know that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s353">Then we had the Battle of the Bulge, and that - I remember being terrified of that because if the Germans had won that, I knew that would be the end of us again.</span> <span id="s354">So there was was some more fear then, but then when the Americans won, the Allies won, then I think we really felt that we had survived uh and just that we would live.</span> <span id="s355">And then one of the hardest things was for my poor mother to get back to our original names.</span> <span id="s356">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Well, I mean all of a sudden instead of being Jan and Leesha and Lanie and Hennie, we had to...we were again Norman and Anita and Ingrid and Helga.</span> <span id="s359">And I can remember her saying Leesha, _____, Lanie - oh, whatever your names are, you know, come inside.</span> <span id="s360">We uh we uh it was it was unbelievable to go back and be with our parents again.</span> <span id="s361">Uh and I can remember thinking I will never ever ever leave them again.</span> <span id="s362">It was just like, it was like having a whole new life.</span> <span id="s363">Uh we had some very, some interesting times because we that's the first time that I saw black people.</span> <span id="s364">Uh we were liberated by the American Army; and the blacks were separated, segre...segregated.</span> <span id="s365">So they lived in tents in the field, and the Ameri...and the whites were uh in a hotel.</span> <span id="s366">And I can remember asking my mother, "Why are they so black?</span> <span id="s367">," you know.</span> <span id="s368">I couldn't understand that skin could be black, because we...the Holland didn't have any dark people.</span> <span id="s369">And I, I remember saying to her, you know, "Why don't they use clorox?</span> <span id="s370">Perhaps that would...” (Laughter) Just didn't seem... it didn't...didn't make any sense to me.</span> <span id="s371">And we were scared of them.</span> <span id="s372">But then we were fascinated by them; and they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s373">We would go and sort of talk to them, and they'd give us big chocolates.</span> <span id="s374">And uh the Americans who...the American soldiers stayed in a hotel; and I remember we would go down there.</span> <span id="s375">My parents had told us you never ask for anything.</span> <span id="s376">Now the Dutch kids, you know, I mean that had had nothing for a long time... I mean, that's the first time we saw oranges, the first time we had candy--all of that stuff.</span> <span id="s377">Food had been rationed.</span> <span id="s378">Food was mini...had the minimal.</span> <span id="s379">So we'd go there; and we'd stand there and look at them with our big eyes.</span> <span id="s380">And, of course, the soldiers just loved us because we never asked for anything.</span> <span id="s381">We always ended up with the most.</span> <span id="s382">(Laughter) And my youngest sister, Helga, would pick up soldiers, which was fine because she was six years old.</span> <span id="s383">And one day she came home with a chaplain - said, "Mommy, that's the best I could find.”</span> <span id="s384">(Laughter) So we ...that was our first encounter with Americans.</span> <span id="s385">We met uh a Jewish soldier - a guy name ______ from California, who became a very good friend of ours, and uh it was almost like we had to get used to being out in the open again and regaining our own identity.</span> <span id="s386">And it's only in retrospect that I now realize what a hugh price we paid.</span> <span id="s387">Because you know when you're going through this as a child that's the way life is.</span> <span id="s388">You don't really question it.</span> <span id="s389">You do what you have to do, and given those circumstances, children will follow the rules.</span> <span id="s390">At least all of, we did.</span> <span id="s391">But uh right smack after the war you see, I mean not even after the war because the rest of Holland wasn't liberated, some very bad things started to happen.</span> <span id="s392">Uh the part of Holland that we lived in was all Catholic - one hundred percent Catholic - and so as soon as it became known that we were Jewish, we got things like Christ killers, dirty Jews, uh - Holland which really had not known anti-Semitism before the war, the horror of of World War II is that it awakened in Holland I think an awful lot of anti-Semitism, a tremendous amount.</span> <span id="s393">And we started encountering that - I mean in retrospect it just blows me away to think that uh there was no debriefing.</span> <span id="s394">Nobody ever ever talked to us about what had happened.</span> <span id="s395">There was no counseling.</span> <span id="s396">There was no support.</span> <span id="s397">It was as if we now were, we had to enter a new but it was a foreign society - it wasn't Holland the way we had known it because we became we became dirty Jews.</span> <span id="s398">Now not by officialdom necessarily, but the children uh I remember that soon after - because we hadn't gone to school and you know in the meantime you can imagine what our schooling must have been like, uh very interrupted, very sporadic, and the first four years if I had, if I went to school two years it was a lot.</span> <span id="s399">Uh by the time I was eight, let's see, nine - by the time I was nine I think I had been to school about two years at the most.</span> <span id="s400">So my father taught me a lot at home.</span> <span id="s401">But I remember going to school again after not having been in school for six months or so, and there was a birthday party and we were the only ones who were not invited to go to the birthday party, and my father took us on a big walk and he consoled us.</span> <span id="s402">But it was just, see we had to come, we had been non-people, and then we remained outsiders.</span> <span id="s403">Uh we stayed in that town uh we that we left the family and went and stayed with a woman whose husband had been a a Nazi, and so he was imprisoned and she was forced to take us.</span> <span id="s404">Now she was scared of us - she thought that we would, I don't know what she thought we would do, but uh so we lived there you know for a couple of months, because we could not go back to Breda because the Germans were still occupying so much of Holland.</span> <span id="s405">And even though Breda was also liberated pretty soon after we were in Limburg, uh it still wasn't safe to travel.</span> <span id="s406">So uh, we kept on going to - and all the schools were Catholic.</span> <span id="s407">I mean, that that again talking about the intense necessity for free...you know, for separation of church and state - uh I'll never forget the experience we had having to go, having no choice but to go to Catholic schools, and and being called Christ killers.</span> <span id="s408">Now that only intensified the feelings that the war had fostered in me - the feelings that there was something wrong with me and being a Jew was a bad thing.</span> <span id="s409">Uh ashamed of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s410">Uncomfortable being Jewish.</span> <span id="s411">Uh something that you wanted to hide.</span> <span id="s412">It wasn't OK to be who you are.</span> <span id="s413">You were different and you know how bad it is for children to be different - I mean how hard it is for them to be ______.</span> <span id="s414">It's bad for kids to be different.</span> <span id="s415">It's hard for kids to be different.</span> <span id="s416">Uh and so we felt that we never, we just never fitted in and as soon as we could we went back to Breda which was not until I think April of 1945, so for about four months we lived very tightly with our family but the best thing was that our family was back together.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s418">We have to stop now.</span> <span id="s419">We have to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Can you tell me what happened when you returned to Breda?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s423">We we finally were able to leave, I think we went back to Breda in April of '45.</span> <span id="s424">We were, all of you know the war ended in May of '45, May 5, 1945 in in Europe and we went back to - we had nothing.</span> <span id="s425">Of course what had happened is my parents had left the house we lived in and my mo..</span> <span id="s426">.</span> <span id="s427">my mother had had oh just her her dowry had been this gorgeous stuff and and of course everything was left behind and we came back with nothing.</span> <span id="s428">We stayed for about six weeks with a family where my aunt had stayed - the one who, my mother's sister, the one who was killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s429">We stayed there and then uh after six weeks the woman said to us, well you can't stay here any more.</span> <span id="s430">And we had no place to go.</span> <span id="s431">So we moved into a house that had been bombed and the whole backside of the house - there was no backside of the house at all.</span> <span id="s432">There was one room that had windows.</span> <span id="s433">It was a large house but you know it was uninhabitable.</span> <span id="s434">It had no gas and electricity.</span> <span id="s435">It had no water and uh again we had no place to go so we moved in.</span> <span id="s436">We basically squatted into that house with the one room with the windows.</span> <span id="s437">And the the water just poured in and it just because it had no backside, uh just poured in.</span> <span id="s438">So my father just made holes in the floor so the water would run down.</span> <span id="s439">He boarded up some of the other uh rooms with uh planks so that we could at least sleep there.</span> <span id="s440">And for a couple of weeks we would go to neighbors to get water and so on.</span> <span id="s441">It was just, there was no place for us to go and we had absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s442">My father didn't have a job.</span> <span id="s443">We didn't have any money, so he got a job with the British censorship in Germany so, so in 19... uh ... 1940 ...I think, that was '45 I think - it was almost immediately after the war uh after we were liberated, he went off to Germany and worked for the British censorship there.</span> <span id="s444">So my mother was left alone with four children and her aging grandfather--her aging father, my grandfather, who lived across the street.</span> <span id="s445">Some friends uh had given him a room.</span> <span id="s446">And so we lived in this house, in this bombed-out house for about six months.</span> <span id="s447">In the meantime my mother was alone.</span> <span id="s448">My brother could not adjust to the school system in Breda anymore.</span> <span id="s449">We...the closest school to us was a Protestant school; so instead of going to a Catholic school, we went to a Protestant school.</span> <span id="s450">And again being the outsider was so obvious because of religion.</span> <span id="s451">We did not belong in a religious school, and it was uncomfortable and it made us feel uh unwanted.</span> <span id="s452">Now we did not encounter there any uh of the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s453">I mean nobody there called us Christ killers or any of that stuff but we were not accepted either.</span> <span id="s454">Well, finally my - the only way you could get a habitable house was by finding a place that people would move out of.</span> <span id="s455">And then you had to present it to the ______ Notes Commission, which is the housing need commission and then they would rule on whether you were eligible to move into that house.</span> <span id="s456">And several times my mother would find a place and we would never get it and it would, the situation got to be pretty desperate.</span> <span id="s457">Well, finally we found a very nice house on the Juliana (ph), and it was uh next to a little office of the conservation company.</span> <span id="s458">And we were, and the way that it went was that you had to uh tell the tell the commission where the house was and uh then they would decide.</span> <span id="s459">But because they continually took, wouldn't let my mother move into the house, my mother said you know, I'm not going to tell you where it is unless you let me know that I can have it, and they would, she finally was promised that that they could have the house.</span> <span id="s460">And we were assigned that house, and just before we were supposed to move in, the head of that conservation company wanted that house because it was right next to his office.</span> <span id="s461">And again we were, they told that, we were told we couldn't live in that house.</span> <span id="s462">In the meantime you know we lived in an unhabitable, uninhabitable place which was, just made the situation terrible.</span> <span id="s463">My mother was alone.</span> <span id="s464">She was close to a nervous breakdown I think.</span> <span id="s465">She had been so strong during the war.</span> <span id="s466">She was, she had crying spells and she was in agony over _______.</span> <span id="s467">It's hard for me to fathom now really she survived as well as she did under the intense kind of suffering.</span> <span id="s468">I mean she came back and it was very clear to us that almost our whole family had been wiped out.</span> <span id="s469">Her only sister and her...her daughter were wiped out.</span> <span id="s470">My father came from a family of seven brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s471">Only he and his oldest brother survived; and my uncle's only son, Bert (ph), had been killed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s472">We had two cousins who survived.</span> <span id="s473">They escaped the concentration camp in Holland, but their parents and their...that was their sister, that was the girl that I visited before the war - the family I visited.</span> <span id="s474">They were killed.</span> <span id="s475">They were dragged out of _______ and _____.</span> <span id="s476">They died probably en route to Auschwitz, and we, I don't know really what happened to ______.</span> <span id="s477">So after the war you know, there we were.</span> <span id="s478">And of the Dutch, the Jews in Breda, I think a total of twenty survived.</span> <span id="s479">Two young men survived the labor, the slave labor camps - young, strong men.</span> <span id="s480">And the Alters, the...the photographer - he was killed and she survived with her two daughters.</span> <span id="s481">But for the rest, just we were alone.</span> <span id="s482">And so anyway so she, under those circumstances again, and then living in this this house which wasn't a house, and again being denied that denied that house uh, what in effect we did is that the school that that we had gone to became a very fashionable school after the war and the Dutch princesses went there.</span> <span id="s483">Juliana's daughters went there; and uh when again we were denied that house my mother went to uh the friends who where my fath...where my grandfather was staying, and he had some, he knew some people who were higher-ups and basically they, he said to that commission, he said unless Mrs. Magnus, ________, gets that house, this is going to go straight up to the Queen, and these, the response was oh those damn Jews - they want so much again.</span> <span id="s484">And I just, the anti-Semitism which really had been dormant I think, or had, I I just don't think Holland was anti-Semitic before the war.</span> <span id="s485">If it was anti-Semitic it was well-hidden, but the Germans - and that's one of the horrors for me - in some ways the Germans won the war, because they succeeded.</span> <span id="s486">They made the Europe Judenrein; they made it Jew-free.</span> <span id="s487">And there is uh, I still pick it up when I go to Europe.</span> <span id="s488">There is an awful lot of anti-Semitism in Europe and they awakened the viciousness.</span> <span id="s489">So that you see, that's what we had to live with then after the war.</span> <span id="s490">And it was never overt - well, that's not true.</span> <span id="s491">It was overt.</span> <span id="s492">I mean you know - those damned Jews - they want so much again basically was the response to us.</span> <span id="s493">Uh but we did get the house.</span> <span id="s494">I mean the threat of using, of going straight to the queen and of using some some influence there - in effect we were assigned that house so in December of '45, it was very tragic because my grandfather died of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s495">My mother tried to get him in a hospital.</span> <span id="s496">They wouldn't take him to a hospital.</span> <span id="s497">And he died of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s498">So there was mother just with her father just dead and the horror of the war, moving... Uh, my brother had gone back to the school that we had gone... He...he could not adjust to to the school in Breda, and he went back to Bilthoven.</span> <span id="s499">He stayed with the Buchas.</span> <span id="s500">So there were just the three girls and my mother; and we moved into that house in Julianalan.</span> <span id="s501">And uh I gather my father just sent us some money from Germany, and we also got some reparation.</span> <span id="s502">We never got much but we got probably a couple of thousand dollars, which allowed us to buy some furniture because of course everything had been stolen.</span> <span id="s503">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s504">But we had come back to some clothes.</span> <span id="s505">And so my, slowly but surely my mother was able to to furnish the house and to to buy some of the necessities and get us some things and uh my father came back from Germany I think in 1946.</span> <span id="s506">And sort of a resumed - my brother came back from Bilthoven and we resumed a normal, quote normal family life.</span> <span id="s507">But even right there in _______, I remember one day in front of our sidewalk - dirty Christ killers.</span> <span id="s508">I mean, there again; and it just made absolutely no sense.</span> <span id="s509">Now I must stress that my my parents, my father went to the school - uh we lived we lived close to a a a sort of a lower class wor...neighborhood.</span> <span id="s510">Our our street was very very nice and very middle, middle-class, but we lived next to a heavily Catholic uh lower class neighborhood and uh my father went to the school, and - because we knew we knew that which kids had done it - and they did reprimand those kids.</span> <span id="s511">I need to stress that there was no official support for this, but again, these were messages that the children had gotten from somebody, from some place and some bo...some body and I don't know who gave them those messages.</span> <span id="s512">But it just reinforced that whole sense of not OK-ness.</span> <span id="s513">Of something being wrong you know.</span> <span id="s514">Now there were no Jews left and there were just, as a matter of fact, only four of us plus the Alter children - I think we were the only Jewish children who survived.</span> <span id="s515">And we were, you know, strangers in our own land.</span> <span id="s516">And I felt that.</span> <span id="s517">That, I don't know that my sisters felt it as much I did, but I think they did too.</span> <span id="s518">I think all of us felt it very very strongly.</span> <span id="s519">It was never the way it used to be.</span> <span id="s520">It was it was, Holland ceased being in a way our home.</span> <span id="s521">Uh now we went uh, after we moved we went to a school called the [Nutschool (ph)], the nut school.</span> <span id="s522">And after that I went to the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s523">Uh, but my learning was inhibited.</span> <span id="s524">This may sound crazy - uh there was something in me and I think that's perhaps the little two-year old rebel still was operating because uh even though I had always been a very very bright child, I started progressively doing worse in school.</span> <span id="s525">And there was something in me that that just wasn't coping well with with the Dutch school system.</span> <span id="s526">It just wasn't working.</span> <span id="s527">My youngest sister, Helga, developed a terrible thyroid condition.</span> <span id="s528">She...uh she got a hyper-thyroid--she had a throat like that, and her eyes were bulging from it.</span> <span id="s529">A very very bright little girl.</span> <span id="s530">She just became practically non-functional.</span> <span id="s531">Uh my middle sister, Ingrid, cried a lot.</span> <span id="s532">My my brother Norman uh flunked out of school.</span> <span id="s533">We all became non-functional.</span> <span id="s534">And yet we had loving parents, lots of support.</span> <span id="s535">I mean, my parents--if it hadn't been for them, I..</span> <span id="s536">.</span> <span id="s537">I cannot imagine what would have happened to us.</span> <span id="s538">But miraculously, my parents, notwithstanding everything that they have gone through, provided us with love and support and caring and...and a feeling of belonging.</span> <span id="s539">And if it hadn't...as I said if it hadn't been for them, I think we would all have gone down the drain.</span> <span id="s540">But there was no recognition on the part of anybody uh what the consequences were of...of our experiences, of the war experiences.</span> <span id="s541">It was never discussed.</span> <span id="s542">It was never dealt with.</span> <span id="s543">It was never acknowledged.</span> <span id="s544">And so there we were, four children who basically weren't functioning very well at all.</span> <span id="s545">I..</span> <span id="s546">.</span> <span id="s547">I flunked the uh...I flunked uh my second year.</span> <span id="s548">Now the gymnasium is a college preparatory school, and it is pretty select.</span> <span id="s549">I mean, you learn...by the time you go to seventh grade, which is the first year of the gymnasium, then.</span> <span id="s550">I think that the system has changed.</span> <span id="s551">But I started studying Latin and uh Algebra; and by the second year of that school, the eighth grade, I added Greek and uh Chemistry and English.</span> <span id="s552">And by the time I was...before, just before coming to America, I was studying English, German, French, Latin, Greek, physics, chemistry, math....</span> <span id="s553">I mean, just this intense array of subjects; but I wasn't doing well.</span> <span id="s554">It was like I could not study.</span> <span id="s555">I wasn't absorbing the material, and it was like my mind was blocked.</span> <span id="s556">And I could never - you know, it's funny - it's only now all of a sudden while I'm talking to you I'm beginning to recognize why my mind was blocked.</span> <span id="s557">Because my whole life was blocked.</span> <span id="s558">Because we were non...we were non-people.</span> <span id="s559">We could not be who we were.</span> <span id="s560">And we never told anybody we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s561">That was just not acknowledged.</span> <span id="s562">Uh, I remember we had one Hanukkah party, I think in 1948; and it was just like sneaking.</span> <span id="s563">It was at night - we, I think the whole Jewish community of Breda--what little was left of it.</span> <span id="s564">Of course, the synagogue...there, there was no no synagogue anymore because there were no Jews left.</span> <span id="s565">But I think the few Jews that were left all went to the Hanukkah party; and I remember learning some songs.</span> <span id="s566">And that was my first exposure to Judaism, was that one Hanukkah party.</span> <span id="s567">And I remember still some of the songs, and there was a _____ and that was it.</span> <span id="s568">That that was about the only Jewish part of me that was even acknowledged.</span> <span id="s569">My parents, I think, must have gotten the same message: you don't acknowledge it, you don't deal with it, you don't recognize it, you don't... it wasn't discussed.</span> <span id="s570">You go on with life.</span> <span id="s571">And uh Holland, you know, being in Holland as I even mentioned to you earlier, became like being in being in a foreign land.</span> <span id="s572">Uh I need to stress, though, that since we didn't mention Judaism, that didn't come up.</span> <span id="s573">And I had friends.</span> <span id="s574">It wasn't that I was an outcast.</span> <span id="s575">I mean, I had friends.</span> <span id="s576">Uh, I was invited to homes.</span> <span id="s577">You know, I was not...it was not at all like in Limburg.</span> <span id="s578">In Breda, on the contrary, I made some very very dear friends and best friends who of course were non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s579">Uh, so it wasn't that I was isolated and alone.</span> <span id="s580">Nothing like that.</span> <span id="s581">But emotionally and intellectually, I think, all of us were stunted.</span> <span id="s582">Uh and my parents...in 1950, I think, my father changed jobs.</span> <span id="s583">I think he decided that just Holland...we'd had it there.</span> <span id="s584">And he wrote to our friend, Henry Koster (ph).</span> <span id="s585">Now Henry Koster uh was a movie director here in this country; and he...it seemed that he met my father before the war.</span> <span id="s586">In the 1920's, when Germany was suffering from this tremendous inflation before Hitler, my father was...had traveled in Germany for business, and that's how he met my mother also in Germany.</span> <span id="s587">And he had helped Henry Koster several times.</span> <span id="s588">I gather, financially; and they had stayed in touch.</span> <span id="s589">And Henry Koster was Jewish.</span> <span id="s590">Came to America in the 1930's, and became very successful in the movie industry.</span> <span id="s591">He directed _____ German pictures; and uh it was, you know, made it in the movie industry.</span> <span id="s592">And after the war, my father was able to contact him again, and he sent us care packages.</span> <span id="s593">As a matter of fact, a funny story - you know the Germans, you know the Dutch too, took everything we had but uh we were, I told you we were liberated by Americans and they went to Germany afterwards and those soldiers would send us big boxes full of clothes.</span> <span id="s594">In a way, I'm sure they they robbed the Germans to send us those those clothes; because we had no clothes.</span> <span id="s595">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s596">And so, for a while, we were clothed in German clothing that they sent us.</span> <span id="s597">We didn't...didn't go beyond that.</span> <span id="s598">Uh but but when when Henry Koster found out that we had survived, he they sent us care packages.</span> <span id="s599">So then aft... instead of being dressed in German clothes, we were dressed in American clothes.</span> <span id="s600">We got lots of packages from the United States with food and clothing.</span> <span id="s601">It was enormously helpful; because, of course, there was nothing to be had in Holland.</span> <span id="s602">And uh and Holland was in very very bad shape.</span> <span id="s603">They not only had been terribly terribly damaged uh but the economy was wrecked.</span> <span id="s604">In 1944, when the Germans finally recognized that the you know the Dutch were not going to join them in their Aryan lunacy, uh uh they starved the Dutch.</span> <span id="s605">And about a hundred thousand Dutch died during the starvation [winter (ph)] of 1944.</span> <span id="s606">Again, that was when we were in the southern part.</span> <span id="s607">We were liberated.</span> <span id="s608">Incredible when you think about it.</span> <span id="s609">And uh although there was hunger there, too.</span> <span id="s610">I mean, there was no food there either; but nothing like the suffering that the Amsterdamers and the Rotterdamers experienced at all.</span> <span id="s611">So anyway, we were...we were... he contacted Henry Koster.</span> <span id="s612">And Henry...in those days you had to have sponsorship; and he decided...he agreed to sponsor us and became our sponsor.</span> <span id="s613">And our number...our number came up in 1952.</span> <span id="s614">Uh, our opportunity came to come to America; and we we we left Holland.</span> <span id="s615">Because Holland had ceased being uh our land, our country, basically.</span> <span id="s616">And uh we came to America; which was the best thing that could ever have happened to us.</span> <span id="s617">There's no no question about that.</span> <span id="s618">It it freed every single one of us, in in the most intense way.</span> <span id="s619">Uh my little sister Helga...the Dutch had no idea, the Dutch doctors; she was sent from one doctor to the next.</span> <span id="s620">And she was...she was just in terrible problems.</span> <span id="s621">Terrible, terrible problems.</span> <span id="s622">Because she couldn't learn, she couldn't remember.</span> <span id="s623">She had a violent temper.</span> <span id="s624">She was just unmanageable.</span> <span id="s625">Uh, my parents moved to St. Louis; and in... We arrived in America December 7th, 194...1952; and in June of 1953, a Jewish hospital--a Jewish hospital in St. Louis--they operated on her for free.</span> <span id="s626">And they took out, thank God, a benign huge tumor out of her.</span> <span id="s627">And uh she just blossomed.</span> <span id="s628">Right now, she is uh a nurse advisor for the International Council of Nurses in Geneva, Switzerland.</span> <span id="s629">I mean, she has an incredible job in Geneva, Switzerland; and has just accomplished enormous things.</span> <span id="s630">Uh the same with...I, uh interestingly enough... Uh, we came to America; and our Henry Koster happened to be in New York when we arrived - he knew we were arriving - and he greeted greeted us in Hoboken.</span> <span id="s631">He was at...at the ship.</span> <span id="s632">Uh, and we didn't know he was going to be there, but I I recognized him from his pictures.</span> <span id="s633">It was amazing.</span> <span id="s634">I remember going up to him and saying, "Hey, are you Henry Koster?"</span> <span id="s635">He said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s636">I mean, like it was just again one of these intuitive things.</span> <span id="s637">Anyway, he asked one of us to come to be like a baby-sitter for him and his...uh for his children; not for him, for his children.</span> <span id="s638">He had a nine year old and a six year old.</span> <span id="s639">So because I was the oldest of the girls... uh I went with my parents to St. Louis, and after we took the bus from New York to St. Louis, and my parents...we had...my mother had some distant cousins in St. Louis.</span> <span id="s640">And I, I think six days later, took the bus by myself at age 16 in December all the way from St. Louis to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s641">You know, we had no idea about America.</span> <span id="s642">I mean, I'm not sure I'd let a 16 year old go by herself now.</span> <span id="s643">But what did we know?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Did anything happen on the bus?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No.</span> <span id="s646">People were very nice.</span> <span id="s647">Although a very funny thing is, we came through Albuquerque--where I now live--we came through Albuquerque, and it was absolute desolate and barren and it was December.</span> <span id="s648">And I said to myself, "That's the last place I'll ever live!"</span> <span id="s649">And that's where I've ended up.</span> <span id="s650">(Laughter) Turned out to be very nice.</span> <span id="s651">But I went to...I went and I moved--of all the insane places--to Beverly Hills, California.</span> <span id="s652">And I..</span> <span id="s653">.</span> <span id="s654">they lived in this gorgeous home on Whittier Drive in North Beverly Hills; and they had a butler and a maid, and--good heavens!</span> <span id="s655">--a three car garage and a swimming pool.</span> <span id="s656">Unbelievable luxury.</span> <span id="s657">You know, no greater contrast than uh Holland--which was barely beginning to recover from the war for the Marshall plan was just beginning to take effect--and going to Beverly Hills, California--which has got to be one of the extremes of American affluence.</span> <span id="s658">Uh it was a devastating time for me; and that sounds terrible, but I had just, you know - the only thing I had going for me was my family.</span> <span id="s659">There was no self there.</span> <span id="s660">There was very little self left after the war.</span> <span id="s661">And again, from that little girl who was able to dare to stand up to her father, I pretty much had learned that it was my job to be a good little girl and to please and to take care of others and not to...not to pay any attention to my needs.</span> <span id="s662">And basically the worst of it was I I had learned not even to know what my needs were.</span> <span id="s663">My job was to please others.</span> <span id="s664">My job was to go along.</span> <span id="s665">My job was to be invisible.</span> <span id="s666">My job was to not cause any trouble.</span> <span id="s667">And again, I need to stress that's not what my parents told me.</span> <span id="s668">On the contrary.</span> <span id="s669">If anybody gave me support, it was my parents.</span> <span id="s670">But that's what I'd learned, and that's something I..</span> <span id="s671">.</span> <span id="s672">my parents were not able to undo for me.</span> <span id="s673">I mean, again, since the war was never discussed and these issues were never dealt with, all of that was hidden.</span> <span id="s674">And all I knew about myself was that I was whoever I was, which was Jewish, was not OK.</span> <span id="s675">It was something to be ashamed of.</span> <span id="s676">It was something to be hidden.</span> <span id="s677">It was something not to talk about, and that I had no basic rights either.</span> <span id="s678">So this girl goes to Beverly Hills, California--of all ridiculous places.</span> <span id="s679">And I don't mean to be ridiculous, but you know what I'm talking about.</span> <span id="s680">And I enter this, and I'm fully aware that most of Beverly Hills is not the movie industry.</span> <span id="s681">Uh on the contrary.</span> <span id="s682">But I happened to enter the the movie...the movie uh life; and that's an artificial, superficial in those days uh environment.</span> <span id="s683">I mean, even naïve as I was and ignorant as I was, I knew those people weren't real at all.</span> <span id="s684">As a matter of fact, I think the only real man I met was Marlon Brando.</span> <span id="s685">And I met a whole bunch of movie stars.</span> <span id="s686">And I remember the one that I really felt good about was Marlon Brando, 'cause he was...he...he... I broke my leg; and he came to visit me, while he was in the house.</span> <span id="s687">That...that's when Henry Koster was making the movie named "Desirée", and Jean...Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando and a whole bunch of others came to the house.</span> <span id="s688">And he came up to see me; and I remember thinking, "Now, there.</span> <span id="s689">He...at least, he seems to be somebody that seems authentic.”</span> <span id="s690">But for the rest, I entered an environment that was was fake and artificial; and I did not know about that, either.</span> <span id="s691">Because I thought that was real, and again I thought there was something with me.</span> <span id="s692">Uh so I gained fifty pounds.</span> <span id="s693">The only...the only the only uh the only pleasure I had was eating.</span> <span id="s694">And within about six months, I gained fifty pounds.</span> <span id="s695">And ended up, you know, a hundred and seventy-five pounds fatso.</span> <span id="s696">Which, in a way, was perfect; because the meant that my nothingness now was really real.</span> <span id="s697">Because who wanted a 175-pound, you know, "blimp" uh in this...in this environment that so prized beauty and exterior and facade?</span> <span id="s698">It was...in a way, it was just right; because it meant that I could hide behind that.</span> <span id="s699">And this feeling of nothingness and of being worthless was, sadly enough, uh reinforced by my being in in...in California.</span> <span id="s700">Uh, one of the most poignant for me uh circumstances was that I was very lonely.</span> <span id="s701">And I..</span> <span id="s702">.</span> <span id="s703">I went to Beverly Hills High School, and again they were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s704">I am in no way blaming the kids, because in retrospect I did not encounter any unkind children...kids at Beverly Hills High School.</span> <span id="s705">I..</span> <span id="s706">.</span> <span id="s707">I'm amazed at how how how kind they were; but I was an outsider.</span> <span id="s708">And I didn't belong.</span> <span id="s709">And they all lived at home with their parents.</span> <span id="s710">And they, of course, had all these material things; which didn't matter, but I didn't have my parents and I didn't belong.</span> <span id="s711">And uh within about a month, I was so desperately unhappy that I remember just thinking, "God, I wish something would happen to me so I wouldn't have to go to school.</span> <span id="s712">So I wouldn't be so alone, and so...again, so much of an outsider.”</span> <span id="s713">And yet, the most insane thing was, when I went to Beverly Hills High School, I was all of a sudden--you know, because it's so heavily Jewish--all of a sudden, I was there with fellow Jews.</span> <span id="s714">Except I didn't belong with them either.</span> <span id="s715">I didn't fit in with them, either.</span> <span id="s716">I didn't fit in anywhere.</span> <span id="s717">So, I uh kept on hoping something would happen so I wouldn't have to go to school, so I wouldn't be so lonely and so miserable.</span> <span id="s718">And I broke my leg, and I was so happy.</span> <span id="s719">I played...I broke my leg playing hockey... hockey; and instead of worrying about pain, I just was so grateful that I didn't have to go to school.</span> <span id="s720">And that's when I met Marlon Brando.</span> <span id="s721">He happened to come to the house.</span> <span id="s722">But...and that's also when I gained all that weight.</span> <span id="s723">That was a good way of hiding myself.</span> <span id="s724">And I mean, I was desperately unhappy, desperately lonely; and uh something that reinforced my worthlessness--my sense of worthlessness, I should say--was I..</span> <span id="s725">.</span> <span id="s726">I was promised that I would go... The first thing, the first big outing that we would have, is that Henry Koster uh had directed--I think it was "The Robe.”</span> <span id="s727">It wasn't "Desirée.”</span> <span id="s728">I don't know, it was one movie.</span> <span id="s729">And and uh he told me I could go to the premiere.</span> <span id="s730">And I was looking forward to that.</span> <span id="s731">I thought that was just going to be the greatest.</span> <span id="s732">Well, two days before the movie--before the premiere of the movie--uh uh Peter got sick.</span> <span id="s733">The little, the youngest one got sick.</span> <span id="s734">And I was told I had to stay home with him.</span> <span id="s735">And for the only time that I can remember, I went to Peggy, Henry's wife.</span> <span id="s736">And I said, I..</span> <span id="s737">.</span> <span id="s738">I quote, I complained.</span> <span id="s739">I said, "Peggy, you know I have really been looking forward to this.</span> <span id="s740">Is there anything we can do?</span> <span id="s741">Can we find anybody else to take care of Peter?</span> <span id="s742">Uh, you know, I would really like to go.”</span> <span id="s743">I think that's the most that I said.</span> <span id="s744">Well, I was told that there was no choice; there was nobody else to take care of Peter, and I had to stay home.</span> <span id="s745">And I stayed home with Peter.</span> <span id="s746">And two days later, I was called on the carpet by Henry Koster--who told me that it was my job to take care of Peter, and I was not to make Peggy unhappy.</span> <span id="s747">That I had made her very unhappy with my complaining.</span> <span id="s748">And that absolutely devastated me.</span> <span id="s749">Just...it confirmed everything that I had subconsciously believed about myself, that I had absolutely no rights.</span> <span id="s750">That who I was, what I needed, what I felt, what I wanted, was absolutely unimportant.</span> <span id="s751">And that I was...I was a non-person.</span> <span id="s752">And because I'm the kind of person that I am, uh I accepted that about myself.</span> <span id="s753">I didn't fight it.</span> <span id="s754">I just became a worthless person.</span> <span id="s755">And this may sound crazy, because right now I'm the exact opposite.</span> <span id="s756">And and what I recognize, I've come...I'm like the topsy-turvy dolls.</span> <span id="s757">I, I'm one of those who you can push me down, but I won't stay down forever.</span> <span id="s758">I..</span> <span id="s759">.</span> <span id="s760">I'm back to that little two-year old who stood up to her father.</span> <span id="s761">Uh, but it devastated me.</span> <span id="s762">And I graduated from Beverly Hills High School; and immediately went to St. Louis, went back to my parents and went to Washington University.</span> <span id="s763">After Washington University, I got my... Never made friends, never.</span> <span id="s764">Never dated.</span> <span id="s765">Uh, and the only thing I had going for me was that and so the the rector of the University sent a letter to the uh to to Beverly Hills High School.</span> <span id="s766">And I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s767">It said, "What she may be lacking in intelligence, she'll make up through industriousness.”</span> <span id="s768">I mean, those were the exact words.</span> <span id="s769">And I remember thinking, even then, "You know what?</span> <span id="s770">They've got me all wrong.”</span> <span id="s771">One thing - I've never been stupid, but I've also never been particularly industrious.</span> <span id="s772">(Laughter) And I knew intuitively they...they knew nothing about me.</span> <span id="s773">But that's typical, isn't it.</span> <span id="s774">I'd hidden myself so well that nobody knew me.</span> <span id="s775">Uh and I kept myself hidden, because I was a non-person, throughout...throughout my college years.</span> <span id="s776">Although I became very active in organizations.</span> <span id="s777">I mean, I was always such a good girl - I helped and I was active.</span> <span id="s778">And academically I just did better and better and better and better.</span> <span id="s779">I mean, that was the one area where I allowed myself to be unblocked; because I figured that's the only thing I had going for me was my intelligence.</span> <span id="s780">And the other thing I had going for me--and I can remember saying that to me--"OK.</span> <span id="s781">Even if nobody loves me, at least my parents love me.”</span> <span id="s782">I'm so aware [that] if it hadn't been for their love for me, if I hadn't been so sure of their love for me, I wouldn't have made it.</span> <span id="s783">And I often wonder how people make it who don't...who don't have that.</span> <span id="s784">Uh, and I..</span> <span id="s785">.</span> <span id="s786">I mean, I graduated from Washington University a Phi Beta Kappa, got a Woodrow Wilson Scholarship to Harvard, got a Masters in Russian studies from Harvard--but still as a non-person.</span> <span id="s787">That's a crazy thing.</span> <span id="s788">Still a non-person.</span> <span id="s789">Still somebody who...who was not in touch with any of her needs, her wants, her feelings.</span> <span id="s790">I didn't date.</span> <span id="s791">Had a hard time making friends, even though every... You know, people liked me because I'm such a nice person.</span> <span id="s792">But there was...there was a non-person.</span> <span id="s793">And I started working for the Rand Corporation, after my Masters, in Santa Monica.</span> <span id="s794">I went back to California.</span> <span id="s795">My parents, in the meantime, moved to California.</span> <span id="s796">And I went back to California, and I worked for the Rand Corporation.</span> <span id="s797">And I remember my boss saying to me...he said, "Anita, you're the most non-aggressive person I have ever met.”</span> <span id="s798">It was true.</span> <span id="s799">I mean, if you...if the sky was blue, and if you said to me, "Gee, the sky looks sort of grey.”</span> <span id="s800">I said, "Yeah, you're right.</span> <span id="s801">The sky is grey.”</span> <span id="s802">I didn't dare disagree with anybody.</span> <span id="s803">I didn't dare argue with anybody.</span> <span id="s804">I was afraid that if I would, you know, uh oppose something you would say that you would stop liking me.</span> <span id="s805">Uh or you would not, you know, you would disapprove of me.</span> <span id="s806">I was just...it's unbelievable in retrospect how trapped I was in my non-entity.</span> <span id="s807">Uh, and interesting that Becky--Betty Bucha, uh the the woman who who with whom we stayed during the war, came to visit us.</span> <span id="s808">And she...she knew that I had changed.</span> <span id="s809">I mean, even from the time she knew that that uh I had become a very different person.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: When did she visit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: She visited us in St. Louis, so... While I was in college, so in the 19...I graduated from Washington University in '58, so...so 1956, or so.</span> <span id="s812">So about ten years after the war.</span> <span id="s813">So I was...I was about nineteen.</span> <span id="s814">And she she told me that I had changed, even from the little girl that she had known.</span> <span id="s815">Uh, and and and now in retrospect it was all cumulative.</span> <span id="s816">It was all cumulative, too.</span> <span id="s817">From being this this very strong little competent girl to becoming a..</span> <span id="s818">.</span> <span id="s819">just a nothing, nothing person.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s821">You were, you were telling us about your working at the Rand Corporation.</span> <span id="s822">What...what happened to you after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s824">Well, that's the wonderful thing, when things started to happen.</span> <span id="s825">Uh, I went to the Soviet Union as a guide in the American Exhibit.</span> <span id="s826">And in the Soviet Union, uh the director of that exhibit was a man named John Dixon.</span> <span id="s827">And I met his, his ...he had taken his wife and his children there.</span> <span id="s828">And, mind you, we had been in America ten years.</span> <span id="s829">And Elizabeth and I became very good friends.</span> <span id="s830">She was there with her two chil....two small children.</span> <span id="s831">I sort of latched on to her, and she was the very first person in America--and this may just in retrospect seem so strange...uh, this was 1960...1962--that I felt really valued me.</span> <span id="s832">She liked me.</span> <span id="s833">And I can remember my very conscious thoughts; thinking, "Well, if Elizabeth likes me, and I value her, there's got to be some value to me.”</span> <span id="s834">Because I truly believed there was no value to me.</span> <span id="s835">And so it was a very conscious process, and I was I was very dependent on her friendship.</span> <span id="s836">Uh when I went back to California, because I worked for Rand in California, I was able to get transferred to to the Rand Corporation here in uh in uh Washington, DC.</span> <span id="s837">And my friendship with her was incredibly important to me, because it was the first.</span> <span id="s838">As I said, the first time in ten years, since coming to America, that I felt valued by anybody outside of my parents.</span> <span id="s839">Even though my teachers had, you know, my my professors at Washington University had been wonderful.</span> <span id="s840">They valued me.</span> <span id="s841">But this was the first time I felt that somebody valued me as a person.</span> <span id="s842">And that was sort of the beginning of my recovery.</span> <span id="s843">I mean, I never had psychological help or anything like that.</span> <span id="s844">I, I--in retrospect, had I known then what I know now, I probably should have.</span> <span id="s845">I probably should have gotten help.</span> <span id="s846">But what did I know?</span> <span id="s847">Uh, but that was the beginning sort of my recovery; in which I began to to appreciate the fact that I was a person after all, and I had...I had some value, probably.</span> <span id="s848">But it's taken me years to get to the point where I am now.</span> <span id="s849">Where, I mean, I know I am a person of value.</span> <span id="s850">You don't have to tell me.</span> <span id="s851">And and crazy enough, it's taken me years to be comfortable with being Jewish.</span> <span id="s852">I am still...I am still not totally comfortable with being Jewish.</span> <span id="s853">I'm almost... I'm ashamed of it.</span> <span id="s854">I'm...I'm comfortable with... I remember at Washington University, because it had a strong Jewish population, feeling embarrassed if any of the Jewish kids were loud or obnoxious.</span> <span id="s855">My immediate reaction was, "Don't do that.</span> <span id="s856">Don't draw attention to yourself.”</span> <span id="s857">Not wanting to associate with them.</span> <span id="s858">Not wanting to be known as one of them.</span> <span id="s859">So that fear of association is overwhelming.</span> <span id="s860">Overwhelming that if they draw attention to themselves, and they found out, you know, they'd be identi...they're identified as Jews, that that may be the end of them.</span> <span id="s861">And that'll be the end of me again.</span> <span id="s862">Uh, I can remember going to Harvard; and being so pleased, because Harvard has a huge Jewish population, but I did not pick up that--uh this sounds terrible on my part, but there is uh, you know, what what will be...what might be stereotypically interpreted as as some loudness and some obnoxiousness.</span> <span id="s863">Which just - I didn't notice it at all.</span> <span id="s864">Harvard was a more sophisticated situation.</span> <span id="s865">I had never noticed Beverly Hills, either, by the way.</span> <span id="s866">But it was...I felt that it was present at Washington University; so at Harvard I was more comfortable.</span> <span id="s867">I fitted in a little bit better.</span> <span id="s868">But there, that whole - I'm so aware of that whole fear still that if Jews do something bad, it's going to be the end of us.</span> <span id="s869">That if...and if I'm identified as a Jew, then I'm going to be.</span> <span id="s870">And if Jews do something negative, then I'm going to be bad.</span> <span id="s871">And that, you know, I'm 53 years old.</span> <span id="s872">I still am not at peace with it.</span> <span id="s873">I'm still not comfortable with it.</span> <span id="s874">And that's sort of scary, isn't it?</span> <span id="s875">Because you know rationally, intellectually, I know this has nothing to do with me.</span> <span id="s876">I mean, we had a terrible thing happen in Albuquerque.</span> <span id="s877">We had a Jewish man who killed...he killed two... He went into a bagel shop, and he killed the the owner and his son-in-law.</span> <span id="s878">He was just crazy.</span> <span id="s879">And then he went to California.</span> <span id="s880">I don't know whether you've read about it.</span> <span id="s881">He went to California, and he killed one of the guards at the Warner...at uh the Universal Studios.</span> <span id="s882">I mean, this was an insane man; and he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s883">My immediate reaction was, "Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s884">What is that going to mean?"</span> <span id="s885">Not only the horror of the poor people who were his victims, but are they going to make an issue out of this.</span> <span id="s886">Is this going to give rise to anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s887">Uh, you know, what is that going to mean to the rest of us?</span> <span id="s888">I still have that fear.</span> <span id="s889">And I know it's irrational, because nobody made anything out of it.</span> <span id="s890">It was never ever an issue.</span> <span id="s891">Not in Albuquerque, not in California.</span> <span id="s892">But it was an issue with the movie "The Last Temptation of Christ," you know.</span> <span id="s893">When some ministers, uh--they later recanted; but basically said, "Well, don't...you know, you're the cause of anti-Semitism.”</span> <span id="s894">Because some Jews--I gather uh it was the the head of the studio in which the movie was made--and they there that anti-Semitis.</span> <span id="s895">.</span> <span id="s896">anti-Semitism did raise its ugly head.</span> <span id="s897">But I'm still aware of those, that fear of association and fear that that association is going to bring disaster.</span> <span id="s898">And the other thing that I'm also aware of, and that's still something that's staying with me, is I don't take anything for granted.</span> <span id="s899">Uh, when our son--we have a seventeen year old--uh when he was little, I wanted to make absolutely sure that nobody would ever do him any harm.</span> <span id="s900">I..</span> <span id="s901">.</span> <span id="s902">I guess I still don't really trust the outside world not to not to harm the innocent.</span> <span id="s903">And so I like to think I'm not too over-protective a mother or so - he might argue with me.</span> <span id="s904">But I would not play, let him play out alone by himself when he was little.</span> <span id="s905">Uh he's always gone to private schools, so I never had to worry about him walking on the streets alone.</span> <span id="s906">I couldn't, I don't think I could have stood the thought of my little boy potentially being accosted or or hurt by by any outsiders or being hurt by a car, so there is an intense feeling of my wanting to protect him from any harm that might come his way.</span> <span id="s907">Not so much - I mean he could climb trees and he could do all sorts of wonderful things and my husband is magnificent and he he just has encouraged him to do all sorts of wild things, so it's not that he's a protected, smothered little boy.</span> <span id="s908">On the contrary, not at all.</span> <span id="s909">But I know that in my own behavior I wanted to make sure that no outsider could ever hurt him - that I never wanted to be in a position where I could, where I would could ever have done something that might have uh prevented harm coming to him.</span> <span id="s910">And that immense relief that I have, feel, now that he's seventeen - he's taking karate and he's you know, gorgeous kid.</span> <span id="s911">Uh but I feel in in in knowing that he can take care of himself the intense - that that strong feeling.</span> <span id="s912">And it's interesting because my cousin, her daughter was born in 1942 and she was, she was shifted around to thirty different families and her parents were in hiding when she was born, and this little baby was just shifted to - they survived.</span> <span id="s913">Uh, and she is, she's 46 or something like that - she's younger, about six years younger than I am, and she and I have exactly the same reactions as we don't, we we saw each other last uh September - we don't take anything for granted.</span> <span id="s914">We don't believe that everything is just going to turn out OK.</span> <span id="s915">We feel strongly that we need to do whatever it takes to make sure things do work out.</span> <span id="s916">Uh when after I I when after I married in '69 uh my husband uh when he would come home late or it was or not appear when I had expected him, I would just be terrified that something had happened to him.</span> <span id="s917">Irrationally.</span> <span id="s918">Just not really believing that I could be this lucky.</span> <span id="s919">Not really believing that my life could be so rich and so full, that I could be so lucky to have a wonderful husband and then this incredible child that we do have and we have, you know, we have a wonderful kid uh who's just just everything I could possibly hope for in a child.</span> <span id="s920">And and and it's still hard for me to believe that I should be so lucky as to have all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: How did you come to move from Washington to uh Albuquerque?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Well, my husband - I uh, after I met Elizabeth and after I began to sort of establish a sense of self - let's see, I was 26 years old - uh I moved to Washington and in Washington I was with the Rand Corporation here, and then I worked for the Xerox Education Division, and I went back to the Soviet Union uh in 1965 as a guide in the American exhibit, and I just started to blossom.</span> <span id="s923">I mean it was just like life just - I really took hold of life.</span> <span id="s924">And I started to date, and I started to enjoy life and I started to make lots of friends - I mean it's just my life just turned around slowly but surely.</span> <span id="s925">And uh I moved to New York.</span> <span id="s926">I I worked for Xerox in Washington and then New York, and then got - I didn't like New York at all - moved back to Washington, DC and my last job was as associate director of the ________ Clearing House on Higher Education.</span> <span id="s927">I started the clearinghouse here as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s928">And didn't have a director, so I got to do a lot of traveling, and I met my husband uh in Albuquerque, on a trip to Albuquerque.</span> <span id="s929">Uh he had just - he's a psychiatrist and he had just started uh work at the uh Medical School at UMN uh in Albuquerque, and he and I met and uh I was 32 years old and I had just decided I probably was never going to get married, and that was OK because I was having a wonderful time (laughter) and so I met him and within a very short time we decided to get married, and so I sort of gave up my job and my friends and everything and I really had a wonderful life in Washington.</span> <span id="s930">Loved it out here.</span> <span id="s931">Gave all that up to go to that that one place I said I would never go to which was Albuquerque, New Mexico.</span> <span id="s932">And uh I did.</span> <span id="s933">Of course there wasn't much I could do there with uh my Master's in Russian studies, so I figured if you can't fight them you join them and I decided to go back to school and I got a Ph.D. in, with a focus on child development/family relationship and I have - we've been there for the last 21 years uh and I teach at the University part-time and and I do some counseling part-time and it's amazing because my whole focus on family relationships/child development has made me so aware of the horrendous impact of the war years and all the things that ideally should have happened after the war that didn't happen, how much pain could have been prevented if people had been more aware of the horrendous impact of - even the, let me compare...our experiences are nothing compared to concentration camp experiences.</span> <span id="s934">They're nothing compared to the experiences of an Anne Frank living in in hiding for two years.</span> <span id="s935">I I, we've got to be among the most fortunate Jewish survivors.</span> <span id="s936">Uh there's no question in my mind and even with that unbelievable fortune uh the damage that was done and then the - and this may sound so corny but the unbelievable blessing of coming to America, which for every single one of us has been a God-send.</span> <span id="s937">As you know, I mean we came to America and we were truly freed here.</span> <span id="s938">And even though I went through a difficult time, that was not America's fault.</span> <span id="s939">That was just a you know continuation of of bad patterns but it was - America freed us up and America helped us prosper.</span> <span id="s940">Not financi...not just financially because we're all doing just fine, but emotionally and spiritually and in every every way possible.</span> <span id="s941">Uh I just, you know, I just I still cannot believe our our our our unbelievable fortune.</span> <span id="s942">Then I met a man which is really interesting, because Alan, uh although we have our differences because we're very different people, but he was just the ideal person for me because he let me know from the very beginning that uh I was going to be responsible for my own life, and he's a psychiatrist, and he wasn't about to quote "take care" of me.</span> <span id="s943">He wasn't about to uh you know quote "make me happy" or be responsible for my well-being.</span> <span id="s944">What I mean by that is he let me know that I was in charge of me, and that was the best thing he could have done for me.</span> <span id="s945">He never he never enabled me, he never uh fed into my feeling sorry for myself or my feeling inadequate or my feeling ineffective or my feeling not valuable.</span> <span id="s946">On the contrary, he he just uh you know unlike many men he never expected me to serve him.</span> <span id="s947">He never expected me to cater to him.</span> <span id="s948">He respected me and he expected me to respect myself.</span> <span id="s949">Now sometimes he's a little bit too tough with that, but but the basic message was and I remember early in the game, I I knew that either we would get divorced because uh you know he didn't play my game the way I thought most men do.</span> <span id="s950">I mean a good example is oh soon after we were married uh oh I was unhappy about something he had done - I don't remember - and I was crying and I was in bed and he woke up and he said what's the matter.</span> <span id="s951">I said, na, you don't love me, or something like that.</span> <span id="s952">He said I'm tired, ____, I'm going to sleep.</span> <span id="s953">And I walked out of the bedroom and I went to the bedroom at the other end of the house, and I waited for him to come.</span> <span id="s954">He never showed up.</span> <span id="s955">And I was furious.</span> <span id="s956">What do I do now?</span> <span id="s957">He's not following my game plan.</span> <span id="s958">And I thought well, you know, he didn't know what I expected him to do, and so I thought OK - I'm going to you know I'm going to pull one on him, so I got a cup of coffee and I served him a cup of coffee, which surprised him, because I wasn't following the rules, and I asked him, I said after we had talked, I said why didn't you come after me.</span> <span id="s959">He said look, you made the decision the decision to leave the bedroom.</span> <span id="s960">I respect your decision.</span> <span id="s961">I assumed you didn't want to be with me.</span> <span id="s962">I wasn't going to impose my personality on you by being on you.</span> <span id="s963">I said well didn't you know that I wanted you to come after me.</span> <span id="s964">He said no, I knew none of that.</span> <span id="s965">The only thing I knew was that you left the bedroom.</span> <span id="s966">You wanted to be alone.</span> <span id="s967">One of the most valuable lessons I learned in our marriage.</span> <span id="s968">It meant don't play games with me.</span> <span id="s969">And I learned - you see that's where self-respect comes in, is you you act honestly and you're straight.</span> <span id="s970">You're real.</span> <span id="s971">You're open.</span> <span id="s972">And you're, you're honest.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Can you tell me briefly about what happened to the rest of your family, ...</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: ...your siblings and your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Well, my parents--again incredible.</span> <span id="s977">My parents went to St. Louis.</span> <span id="s978">My mother, who had never worked outside the home, immediately got a job in a purse factory as a laborer.</span> <span id="s979">My father, who had been in business in Holland, worked in a paint factory in St. Louis.</span> <span id="s980">Got terrible lead poisoning - horribly sick.</span> <span id="s981">Survived, thank God; but we knew nothing about Workman's Compensation, so we never got anything for it.</span> <span id="s982">Uh, then worked for years as a custodian in a school in in in uh University City and worked as a gardener.</span> <span id="s983">I mean, they...and my mother worked as a nurse's aide.</span> <span id="s984">They both went to the lowest level uh jobs basically uh that that...you know; because they weren't... My father was in business.</span> <span id="s985">He wasn't trained for anything else.</span> <span id="s986">But with that uh the value wasn't on education so we all you know pooled our money together.</span> <span id="s987">I went to Washington University, got some scholarships and uh got through there with a little bit of their help.</span> <span id="s988">But mostly, earning money during the summer myself and then the scholarships to Harvard.</span> <span id="s989">My, yeah, two younger sisters both went to Jewish hospital nursing school and got their RN's from...from the hospital.</span> <span id="s990">They went...didn't go to college.</span> <span id="s991">My brother is an interesting story.</span> <span id="s992">He had to join the Air Force uh and immediately after we arrived because he was of of uh military draft age.</span> <span id="s993">He went to Japan.</span> <span id="s994">Met a Japanese girl.</span> <span id="s995">Wanted to marry her.</span> <span id="s996">The rabbi refused to marry her, them, because she wasn't Jewish, and he converted and he became a very religious Christian.</span> <span id="s997">Uh still is.</span> <span id="s998">He, that caused a big rift in our family initially because he was pretty fanatic about it and he wrote things like, you know, you if you Jesus you know what was Jews were damned if you don't believe in Jesus you're damned and all that other stuff.</span> <span id="s999">Didn't endear him to me but uh he has just totally changed.</span> <span id="s1000">He's still a very strong believer.</span> <span id="s1001">He has two children, both of whom are very religious Christians, but there is full acceptance now of the fact that that's not not anything that I can go by, I mean that I, under no circumstances do I uh do I follow any kind of Christian beliefs and uh he respects our position and we respect his position so our relationship now is is a wonderful one.</span> <span id="s1002">It, for him it was the right thing.</span> <span id="s1003">He was the most lost of all, because he had nothing.</span> <span id="s1004">He didn't do well in in high school.</span> <span id="s1005">Anyway I was the more successful one, and and again with no understanding of the psychological uh after-affects he he was really damaged enormously I think by the war and that whole sense of self and he got a lot of support through his religion and I'm very happy that he got that.</span> <span id="s1006">And so now he has his own church in Denver, Colorado.</span> <span id="s1007">He, both his children are married.</span> <span id="s1008">He has got six grandchildren - three each.</span> <span id="s1009">My un middle sister, Ingrid, has her own little business - it's Delight Punch (ph)- in Orlando, Florida.</span> <span id="s1010">She's an extraordinarily enterprising young woman.</span> <span id="s1011">Uh has three, but really two children.</span> <span id="s1012">She adopted a little girl in in Thailand.</span> <span id="s1013">She and her husband were both in the Air Force.</span> <span id="s1014">She is a nurse.</span> <span id="s1015">Went back and got her respiratory therapy degree and uh uh she has two natural born children - I'm saying the third one has not been a very happy experience sadly enough, but the two children that were born to her and her husband uh are now nineteen and seventeen, and one is pre-law and the other one is pre-med.</span> <span id="s1016">And my youngest sister, Helga, uh has married young.</span> <span id="s1017">She was 21, married uh also a doctor.</span> <span id="s1018">Uh, and has four children.</span> <span id="s1019">She...she's the one who had that horrible thyroid disease.</span> <span id="s1020">She is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1021">She uh I think graduated from high school with one year of high school.</span> <span id="s1022">I mean, just; but was able to... After nursing school, she married Dick, bore four children, went back to college, got her BS degree, got her Master's degree as a pediatric clinician.</span> <span id="s1023">And Dick, her husband, is an internist and he's now a ________.</span> <span id="s1024">And they traveled throughout Africa.</span> <span id="s1025">He, he's been...he's been in Ghana.</span> <span id="s1026">He's been in Uganda; and now, for the last ten years, they've been in Geneva, Switzerland where he's with the World Health Organization uh doing extraordinarily well and she works with the International Council of Nurses uh setting up workshops, primary care workshops for nurses all around the country, uh all around the world.</span> <span id="s1027">Phenomenal.</span> <span id="s1028">I mean, she has blossomed intellectually, emotionally, socially.</span> <span id="s1029">They have four children.</span> <span id="s1030">Her oldest son is getting his Ph.D. in immunology at Case Western.</span> <span id="s1031">Her second, her daughter...her oldest daughter, is a nurse.</span> <span id="s1032">The second daughter probably will get a Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1033">She has a Master's in Medical Anthropology, and will get her Ph.D. in Public Health.</span> <span id="s1034">The youngest one is in medical school.</span> <span id="s1035">So they're all in the field.</span> <span id="s1036">And our son is uh seventeen; and he is a wonderful, is a brilliant student.</span> <span id="s1037">Is going to go to Carlton.</span> <span id="s1038">He got an early decision to Carlton College, and probably will study uh uh physics and philosophy.</span> <span id="s1039">So our children have done extraordinarily well.</span> <span id="s1040">Uh they're magnificent - all of our kids are just magnificent kids.</span> <span id="s1041">You know, and I think of all the children who are not born.</span> <span id="s1042">I'm thinking of all the millions who are not born and who you know have never had a chance to... We treasure our children, you know; and I think that's also part of our past.</span> <span id="s1043">To all of us, tremendous value in our children.</span> <span id="s1044">And all of our children have ...are just extraordinary kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Well, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: OK.</span> <span id="s1047">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">This battle took place September 17-25, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*72 page \* arabic1 USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0072 page \* arabic27</span></p></body></html>
