but my father always wanted to be a businessman, and he wanted to get out of Lambsheim to go into the big city.</span> <span id="s18">So what, about a couple...</span></p> <p><span id="s19">And my mother was a businesswoman also.</span> <span id="s20">In fact, that's how they met--while in business.</span> <span id="s21">And they were working together, and that's how they met.</span> <span id="s22">And we moved to Lambsheim.</span> <span id="s23">No.</span> <span id="s24">We moved to Mannheim, a big city.</span> <span id="s25">I was about a couple of years old.</span> <span id="s26">And we were there.</span> <span id="s27">I started to school.</span> <span id="s28">I started first grade there.</span> <span id="s29">And uh soon after that the war broke out.</span> <span id="s30">And my father was sent to Dachau, first, while we were still at home.</span> <span id="s31">And my mother and I-- I was the only child that my parents had--my mother and I, and my grandparents.</span> <span id="s32">And they closed my father's business, and no one could touch it, handle it.</span> <span id="s33">Was padlocked.</span> <span id="s34">I remember that.</span> <span id="s35">And my father came back from Dachau, and he was home for awhile.</span> <span id="s36">And then uh...we had to wear armbands that said "Jude"--Jew--on it.</span> <span id="s37">We all had to wear armbands.</span> <span id="s38">And uh...children stopped playing with me.</span> <span id="s39">And they would call us names.</span> <span id="s40">And then one day, a big guard truck pulled up in front of our house.</span> <span id="s41">Uh, the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s42">Many of them--5, 6 with the pistols out.</span> <span id="s43">And they came and told us that they were picking us up and taking us to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s44">We were not allowed to take anything with us.</span> <span id="s45">As we were.</span> <span id="s46">I remember them tearing our house apart.</span> <span id="s47">I remember very well.</span> <span id="s48">I was only 6 years.</span> <span id="s49">But two of them just pulled one of the beds apart.</span> <span id="s50">They...they just demolished the apartment.</span> <span id="s51">And then they put a lock on the door, after we left.</span> <span id="s52">And uh...we were all piled into the big truck, like an Army truck; and we sit on the wooden benches in the Army trucks, and they made different stops.</span> <span id="s53">They picked up different families until the truck was full.</span> <span id="s54">And then when the truck was full, we were driven to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s55">Gurs was the first concentration camp that we were there.There we were all uh together.</span> <span id="s56">Uh, men and women, children in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">They kept the families together.</span> <span id="s58">Uh, Gurs was a very dirty place--uh, muddy, rainy.</span> <span id="s59">I remember walking in mud all the time.</span> <span id="s60">Uh, very cold.</span> <span id="s61">We...we slept in barracks on the floor, on...on uh straw.</span> <span id="s62">We slept on straw.</span> <span id="s63">And I remember getting very ill.</span> <span id="s64">I became very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">And I had a terrible, terrible ear ache and a high fever.</span> <span id="s66">And my mother tried everything.</span> <span id="s67">She couldn't break my fever.</span> <span id="s68">And they took me to the infirmary on the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s69">And uh...I remember only because they put me in a bed.</span> <span id="s70">I wasn't lying on the floor anymore.</span> <span id="s71">I was actually in the bed.</span> <span id="s72">And I was then later told that I had mastoid, which is a very bad ear infection that goes with the ear drums and that caused a lot of my hearing loss that I have now caused by that.</span> <span id="s73">And I don't remember, but I was told... My father told me later on that they told him I would not live through the night.</span> <span id="s74">And they told him to go out and build a casket for me.</span> <span id="s75">And he refused to do it.</span> <span id="s76">And he stayed there, and my mother was there; and I remember being wrapped in cold towels and cold...white sheets, cold white sheets.</span> <span id="s77">And the fever broke through that night.</span> <span id="s78">And I survived.</span> <span id="s79">Obviously, it was not meant to be.</span> <span id="s80">And I did 1 Located in Southern France.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">get better.</span> <span id="s82">But my hearing was impaired from then on.</span> <span id="s83">And uh...the men worked.</span> <span id="s84">And I remember my father had to go out to work, but...uh we were surrounded by barbed wire and by soldiers with...with pistols and guns.</span> <span id="s85">And uh...very little to eat.</span> <span id="s86">I remember that.</span> <span id="s87">And then one day, they came and put us back in the trucks; and were told we were going to another concentration camp called Rivesaltes near [NB: in] France by the border, French border.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">That was completely opposite of Gurs.</span> <span id="s89">It was hilly and stones and dry.</span> <span id="s90">I remember falling many times, hurting my knee.</span> <span id="s91">And uh...I was a child.</span> <span id="s92">Six, seven years old, and running around and everything.</span> <span id="s93">And what comes to mind now in Rivesaltes, there was a lot of Gypsies.</span> <span id="s94">And Gypsies were also put in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s95">They were prosecuted just like the Jews were.</span> <span id="s96">And I was very interested and I was always told never to go to the Gypsy camp.</span> <span id="s97">Of course, the more I was told not to go... And one day I went.</span> <span id="s98">And what the Gypsies did, they kept the children and they would sell them--literally, sell children.</span> <span id="s99">Well, I was missing.</span> <span id="s100">And my parents were going absolutely crazy looking for me; but my father knew exactly where I was.</span> <span id="s101">And he went to the Gypsy camp, and I was there and he took me back.</span> <span id="s102">I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s103">And there, the men and women were separated.</span> <span id="s104">I was with my grandparents and my mother.</span> <span id="s105">The young men were in a different...uh barracks.</span> <span id="s106">They had to work.</span> <span id="s107">And the toilets were outside and everything; and we had to stand in line for a bowl of soup and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s108">I don't remember too much more about that.</span> <span id="s109">Uh, I do remember people talking always about what lay ahead and what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s110">And uh...then one day...uh my father approached me.</span> <span id="s111">And my parents...and they told me that...I remember my father saying to me that he doesn't know what lays ahead and what will become of us, but he would like me to go with some nice people.</span> <span id="s112">And it turned out to be the French Red Cross.</span> <span id="s113">And uh...I also think that a lot of people were against my parents.</span> <span id="s114">It was like giving their child away.</span> <span id="s115">But they didn't know.</span> <span id="s116">They thought that was best for me.</span> <span id="s117">Uh, they thought that if they could save me or do whatever, they would do anything.</span> <span id="s118">So uh they took us away.</span> <span id="s119">The last...I don't remember saying good bye to my father; but I do have a picture of my mother.</span> <span id="s120">I..</span> <span id="s121">.</span> <span id="s122">the last time I saw my mother was behind barbed wires.</span> <span id="s123">I was on one side, she was on the other side.</span> <span id="s124">And we said goodbye.</span> <span id="s125">And that['s] the last I heard or seen of her.</span> <span id="s126">That was my last picture of my mother.</span> <span id="s127">And many years later, I found out that a few days after I left with by ten other children to get to France that all that transport went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s128">The reason that my father did not get to Auschwitz is that he was young.</span> <span id="s129">And halfway to Auschwitz... He told me that later, since he survived, too--that half way to Auschwitz, they stopped the train and they asked...all the young men had to leave the train.</span> <span id="s130">And women and children and old men had to stay in the train.</span> <span id="s131">So my father had to leave my parents... leave my mother and grandparents, and leave the train.</span> <span id="s132">And he said...then he saw a big sign to Auschwitz, and he saw the train leave.</span> <span id="s133">And that's the last he seen or heard of his family.</span> <span id="s134">And uh...then uh...he was in several concentration camps, which he told me after, which I don't remember the names.</span> <span id="s135">Uh, I was taken with the other children to a children's home in France.</span> <span id="s136">And we were there for a short time.</span> <span id="s137">Not very long.</span> <span id="s138">I remember bombs falling, and the sirens always, and running into shelter.</span> <span id="s139">And I can remember we would be running to the shelter on one side, and buildings falling on the other side with bombs.</span> <span id="s140">And the children's home was hit and was bombed.</span> <span id="s141">And so we had to be separated.</span> <span id="s142">And the best thing was to take us to a convent in southern... It was in the southern part of France.</span> <span id="s143">And everyone knows that the...the French, the Southern French were wonderful.</span> <span id="s144">They were always helping Jewish people, displaced people.</span> <span id="s145">They were always helping them.</span> <span id="s146">And the nuns were just...just wonderful to us children.</span> <span id="s147">And uh...we were so young, it was almost fun for us.</span> <span id="s148">Here was a convent full of nuns, no men.</span> <span id="s149">Uh, one nun was a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s150">One was a cook.</span> <span id="s151">One... I mean, they each had their own profession.</span> <span id="s152">They all did.</span> <span id="s153">And...and we learned, and slowly we all learned French.</span> <span id="s154">I started to forget my German.</span> <span id="s155">And uh...we were there for awhile.</span> <span id="s156">And they had beautiful grounds and trees.</span> <span id="s157">They had fig trees.</span> <span id="s158">I remember that very well (laughter).</span></p> <p><span id="s159">And I do say that, being so young, I think you forget.</span> <span id="s160">You...you forget the bad things so quickly.</span> <span id="s161">And we were there long enough to be placed.</span> <span id="s162">Everyone was placed...uh to a different uh foster home.</span> <span id="s163">And I was placed to a foster home in Noyers, France--southern part of France.</span> <span id="s164">It was a Christian family, Catholic family.</span> <span id="s165">There was a husband, wife; and they had a grown daughter, and they had a very small farm.</span> <span id="s166">They had one cow, few chickens, a little garden.</span> <span id="s167">And they took me in as their foster child.</span> <span id="s168">And uh...then they told me that my name, Freya, was too German and I could not have a German name, a Jewish name, anymore.</span> <span id="s169">I had to become uh...a Catholic, if I wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s170">They talked to me, and they made me Frieda.</span> <span id="s171">So I went from Freya to...to Frieda, and they sent me to Catechism school.</span> <span id="s172">We went Sunday school.</span> <span id="s173">We went to church.</span> <span id="s174">And uh...they also sent me to school.</span> <span id="s175">I really did not lose schooling.</span> <span id="s176">I learned French so good, in fact, that I forget my German.</span> <span id="s177">I couldn't speak German anymore.</span> <span id="s178">I was a French little girl.</span> <span id="s179">I was a French little girl.</span> <span id="s180">My name was Frieda, and I used to help with the chores.</span> <span id="s181">We all, you know, we all had to help.</span> <span id="s182">And I used to herd one cow, and uh...feed the chickens and go to school and come home and do my chores.</span> <span id="s183">And after a few months of...I was there, she informed me that the money--she was getting money from the Red Cross, in fact.</span> <span id="s184">I think the Red Cross was paying foster homes to take care of us children.</span> <span id="s185">And uh...she said that even with the money she just couldn't take care of me anymore.</span> <span id="s186">She just didn't have enough food, you know, to feed me and them, too.</span> <span id="s187">And they were getting older and... Uh, their name was Godin, Mr....Madame and Mr. Godin.</span> <span id="s188">And they said I would have to leave.</span> <span id="s189">So someone came from the French Red Cross, and they were going to take me to another town.</span> <span id="s190">But it just so happened that in the same town, a larger farmer in the same town, Noyers, said that she would take me.</span> <span id="s191">That she could use an extra hand to help.</span> <span id="s192">There was a big farm, big orchards; and so she took me in.</span> <span id="s193">So I never had to leave the city.</span> <span id="s194">I just moved to another family.</span> <span id="s195">And she didn't have just me.</span> <span id="s196">She had other children that she took care of.</span> <span id="s197">And she was hiding a Jewish family, actually.</span> <span id="s198">And I will never forget that red brick house.</span> <span id="s199">Two red brick houses next to each other.</span> <span id="s200">And in the other house, lived a Jewish family that she was hiding.</span> <span id="s201">But, unfortunately, someone found out.</span> <span id="s202">And they came...the Gestapo came and got the family, and never was heard from them again.</span> <span id="s203">And I lived there, and uh...I went to school.</span> <span id="s204">I was very, very religious--very Catholic.</span> <span id="s205">I had little Jesus over my bed at night.</span> <span id="s206">And we prayed; and, in fact, uh when my classmates had their communion, I wanted to have communion, too.</span> <span id="s207">After all, you wore a pretty white dress and you walked down the church.</span> <span id="s208">And uh...Madame Didier was the lady that...uh was the farmer lady.</span> <span id="s209">She said uh...that I couldn't have my communion, because she didn't want to deprive my parents of seeing me become communion.</span> <span id="s210">She didn't tell me why--that I was Jewish and that I couldn't have communion, that I was only acting that out.</span> <span id="s211">So she told me that I couldn't.</span> <span id="s212">I had to wait for my parents to come home, so they could be there.</span> <span id="s213">Of course, I cried.</span> <span id="s214">I was very hurt.</span> <span id="s215">I was upset, because I didn't know anymore that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s216">I didn't know any different.</span> <span id="s217">And uh...but we worked.</span> <span id="s218">We worked in the fields.</span> <span id="s219">We made our own bread, our own flour.</span> <span id="s220">They had big machines.</span> <span id="s221">Uh...wheat, they had wheat fields; and when harvest time came, we walked...the children with baskets behind the machines and we picked up the wheat that the machines dropped.</span> <span id="s222">And we put in our basket; and uh...and that's how we helped.</span> <span id="s223">And she had big orchards with apple trees and cherry trees--everything.</span> <span id="s224">And we worked.</span> <span id="s225">And she taught me how to knit.</span> <span id="s226">She taught me how to sew.</span> <span id="s227">She taught me how to darn socks.</span> <span id="s228">We had to darn our own socks.</span> <span id="s229">We only had one dress; so when that dress was being washed, we missed a day of school.</span> <span id="s230">Because we each had just one... one dress, and we had to miss school when we had our clothes washed.</span> <span id="s231">Uh, learned how to make fire in the wood stoves and everything; and uh...when we came home from school... The highlight of coming home from school was to a glass of milk and jam sandwich.</span> <span id="s232">We made our own jam.</span> <span id="s233">And we had enough to eat, and never needed... I never went hungry, the children.</span> <span id="s234">But a lot was expect of us.</span> <span id="s235">We had our chores to do.</span> <span id="s236">We had our homework.</span> <span id="s237">We had to go school.</span> <span id="s238">We had to get good grades.</span> <span id="s239">And by that time, I was uh very uh... French girl that...French Catholic girl; and I didn't know any...anything else.</span> <span id="s240">That...that was my way of life.</span> <span id="s241">Well, what I didn't know is someone found out that Madame Didier was harboring a Jewish child, and went to the Gestapo and told them.</span> <span id="s242">Well, what happened... One day, she sent me away to get something.</span> <span id="s243">I don't even remember what it was.</span> <span id="s244">I was out of the house, and the Gestapo came.</span> <span id="s245">She said 4, 5 Gestapo with the guns.</span> <span id="s246">One was guarding the outside of the house.</span> <span id="s247">And they went through the house from cellar to attic.</span> <span id="s248">And in France, they have the cellars outside--you know, the stone cellars.</span> <span id="s249">They...I mean, they checked.</span> <span id="s250">They even slashed the mattresses.</span> <span id="s251">I mean, they went through that house with a fine tooth comb.</span> <span id="s252">And she kept saying, "I don't have a Jewish child here, and I don't.”</span> <span id="s253">And they left.</span> <span id="s254">They didn't find me.</span> <span id="s255">I came home to the disaster of the house.</span> <span id="s256">And uh never...she never told me what happened; and it was because of...of me.</span> <span id="s257">And uh...but time went by the same, you know, the everyday routine.</span> <span id="s258">Again, for some reason, I wasn't home.</span> <span id="s259">She sent me to get something.</span> <span id="s260">Gestapo came a second time.</span> <span id="s261">The same thing happened.</span> <span id="s262">They didn't find me, and they never came again.</span> <span id="s263">It was the last time that they came.</span> <span id="s264">And time went by.</span> <span id="s265">It was already wintertime--must have been in...near '40...1944, I guess.</span> <span id="s266">And one day after school, Madame Didier was sitting in the kitchen with a lady.</span> <span id="s267">And I walked in.</span> <span id="s268">And she said that this lady came to pick me up and take me away to a children's home.</span> <span id="s269">I could not stay there anymore.</span> <span id="s270">Well, I cried.</span> <span id="s271">I was very upset.</span> <span id="s272">This was my life.</span> <span id="s273">I didn't know any...anything.</span> <span id="s274">And the lady sat down, and she told me that I was not a Catholic child.</span> <span id="s275">I was a Jewish child, and I had to go back with...with my people.</span> <span id="s276">And in Saint-Étienne was a children's home that was run by a Polish rabbi and his staff.</span> <span id="s277">And he was gathering Jewish children from all over France, wherever they could find us; and bring us together again under...under one roof.</span> <span id="s278">So I had no warning or anything.</span> <span id="s279">And I just packed my little suitcase.</span> <span id="s280">I really didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s281">And I had to say goodbye.</span> <span id="s282">And I..</span> <span id="s283">.</span> <span id="s284">I..</span> <span id="s285">.</span> <span id="s286">I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s287">It was on a Friday, on a Friday afternoon.</span> <span id="s288">And I left with the lady.</span> <span id="s289">I think what actually saved my life through all this was I was a very passive child.</span> <span id="s290">I never asked any questions.</span> <span id="s291">I might have cried or been unhappy, but never [said], "Why is this happening?</span> <span id="s292">," or "Why that?"</span> <span id="s293">I think now, in later years, maybe that saved me.</span> <span id="s294">Because I just did whatever told to do.</span> <span id="s295">I was told to be Catholic.</span> <span id="s296">I was told to learn French.</span> <span id="s297">And I did whatever I was told to do.</span> <span id="s298">So being that it was a Friday afternoon, we arrived at the children's home... Went by train, I remember; and we arrived there, and it was Friday night and we had to say our prayers.</span> <span id="s299">And she told me on the way there that I must forget about my life to that point, that I was now...I was a Jewish child.</span> <span id="s300">I had to become Jewish.</span> <span id="s301">I had to forget what I was taught in my foster home.</span> <span id="s302">And I would have to learn the Jewish way of life.</span> <span id="s303">My...my name was still Frieda.</span> <span id="s304">You know, they never changed my name.</span> <span id="s305">And when we arrived there, very few children were there.</span> <span id="s306">I was one of the first few youngsters that arrived there.</span> <span id="s307">And, you know, months later children kept coming in from...from all over.</span> <span id="s308">Whoever they could find.</span> <span id="s309">And it was a very Orthodox home.</span> <span id="s310">Uh, the boys on one side.</span> <span id="s311">The girls on the other side.</span> <span id="s312">Uh, the girls slept on one floor, the boys on the other floor.</span> <span id="s313">Uh, we went to school.</span> <span id="s314">We had Hebrew school in the morning, and our regular schooling in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">So we went to school all day.</span> <span id="s316">I learned how to read and write Hebrew.</span> <span id="s317">I could translate French into Hebrew, Hebrew into French.</span> <span id="s318">I could read.</span> <span id="s319">And uh...again, I did what I was told.</span> <span id="s320">And being that the day I arrived there on a Friday, so she said, "Well, now you have to learn our way.</span> <span id="s321">So you have to wash your hands before we eat.”</span> <span id="s322">Showed me how to wash my hands.</span> <span id="s323">"You cannot talk 'til you say a prayer, 'til you eat a piece of bread.”</span> <span id="s324">So...she said, "Whatever I say, you repeat after me.”</span> <span id="s325">So she said the prayer over the bread, and I repeated.</span> <span id="s326">No questions asked.</span> <span id="s327">I repeated it.</span> <span id="s328">And then we ate.</span> <span id="s329">And uh...we had to pray after dinner, and we prayed before we went to bed.</span> <span id="s330">Uh, wasn't much different as praying when I was Catholic; and it was Hebrew, and I settled in just like I did everywhere else.</span> <span id="s331">And I became, in fact, very religious.</span> <span id="s332">Now, that was my whole life.</span> <span id="s333">I knew every prayer by heart.</span> <span id="s334">I..</span> <span id="s335">.</span> <span id="s336">when we went Saturday to synagogue, before long I didn't need the book anymore.</span> <span id="s337">I am ashamed to say I forget everything now.</span> <span id="s338">But then, I became very, very religious.</span> <span id="s339">And uh...we talked...I talked to the rabbi, and I wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s340">And he said that...he told me that when the war is ever over and everything is alright, and if no one [in] my family claims me and comes back, I could go to Israel.</span> <span id="s341">And uh...so uh...you know, time passed and went on like that.</span> <span id="s342">Uh, war was over.</span> <span id="s343">I remember, because everybody was singing and...and dancing on the streets.</span> <span id="s344">In 1945, I remember.</span> <span id="s345">I was about 10 years old.</span> <span id="s346">And uh...we knew that the war was over.</span> <span id="s347">And uh...so I thought, "Oh, I'm going to get ready to go to Israel.”</span> <span id="s348">I had already talked with the rabbi.</span> <span id="s349">And uh ...he said that he would put things in motion, and when people could travel to Israel I would be one of the first to go.</span> <span id="s350">And then one day, I was called into the office.</span> <span id="s351">And I was told that they had a letter from my father; that he had survived, and that he lives now in Heidelberg, Germany.</span> <span id="s352">And that when he was liberated by the Russians in his concentration camp, he was looking for me.</span> <span id="s353">And he contacted the French Red Cross, because that's the last he remembered.</span> <span id="s354">He remembered me...giving me up to the French Red Cross.</span> <span id="s355">So he thought he'd get in touch with them.</span> <span id="s356">He didn't know whether I was alive or dead, or what happened to me.</span> <span id="s357">Nothing!</span> <span id="s358">So they traced me, obviously; and they found me in Saint-Étienne, in the children's home.</span> <span id="s359">And there was a big letter in German written from my father, and they translated it to me.</span> <span id="s360">And he just said that he was looking for me.</span> <span id="s361">Nothing was ever mentioned in the letters about my mother and my grandparents not surviving.</span> <span id="s362">Uh, I became...I asked ... When I wrote to him, I would ask about my mother and everything; and he would never answer...never uh... Obviously, I found out, you know, after.</span> <span id="s363">And uh...one thing what surprised me was the rabbi tried a little bit to sway me not to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s364">He wanted me to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s365">I mean, I was a good candidate for the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s366">I would have made a good (ph).</span> <span id="s367">But I said, "No.”</span> <span id="s368">I said, "I want to see my father.”</span> <span id="s369">And uh...what child doesn't want a parent?</span> <span id="s370">And uh...so things were put in motion.</span> <span id="s371">It took one year, uh until...I needed a passport.</span> <span id="s372">I needed permission to leave France to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s373">We were lucky that we were in an American occupied zone in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s374">If it had been East Germany, I would have never been able to go back.</span> <span id="s375">I would probably [have] ended up in Israel.</span> <span id="s376">But being [the] American [zone], it was...was alright.</span> <span id="s377">So uh...they got...I got passport, and I got permission.</span> <span id="s378">And all this time, my father would always write to me in German.</span> <span id="s379">Someone would translate it to me; and I would write a French letter.</span> <span id="s380">And my father had a very good friend.</span> <span id="s381">They helped each other in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s382">They saved each other's lives.</span> <span id="s383">And he was very fluent in...in French.</span> <span id="s384">So he would translate my letters to him, and uh...he would, you know, answer.</span> <span id="s385">And that went on for a year.</span> <span id="s386">And then, finally, I was told that I could pack up and uh go to...go back to my father, go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s387">And I remember a young soldier that came to pick me up, and I was very scared.</span> <span id="s388">A uniform scared me terribly.</span> <span id="s389">Even though I didn't know the difference between the American uniform and the Gestapo uniform.</span> <span id="s390">It was a uniform, and I was scared.</span> <span id="s391">And I had to [be] told that there was nothing to be scared of.</span> <span id="s392">And in fact, when I got back to Germany, uh the towns were full of American soldiers, you know.</span> <span id="s393">And uh...it took a long time for me not to be afraid or to shy away.</span> <span id="s394">Because uh...I thought they were coming.</span> <span id="s395">You know, that is all I could...could remember.</span> <span id="s396">Can I stop?</span> <span id="s397">Can I stop a little bit?</span> <span id="s398">(Pause) Do You want to ask me something?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: What was Saint-Étienne like?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Well, uh I don't remember too much.</span> <span id="s401">Uh, because we were mostly in the children's home.</span> <span id="s402">It was a beautiful home, with big grounds.</span> <span id="s403">And uh...everyone that uh...that worked there was Jewish.</span> <span id="s404">And uh...in fact, uh it comes to mind now we did everything ourselves.</span> <span id="s405">Uh, for Passover, we made our own matzah.</span> <span id="s406">So we made our matzah.</span> <span id="s407">We bake our challah for Friday night.</span> <span id="s408">And uh...we pretty much stayed within the confines of the...the children's home.</span> <span id="s409">We did go sometimes into Paris.</span> <span id="s410">It wasn't far from Paris.</span> <span id="s411">And I know I've been to Paris; but I really don't recall much about it, you know.</span> <span id="s412">I..</span> <span id="s413">.</span> <span id="s414">I think I would get much more if I could go now.</span> <span id="s415">(Laughter) But uh...we would go there, and also I remember uh...being uh...we were so religious.</span> <span id="s416">Uh, we would do everything before the Sabbath would start.</span> <span id="s417">We would uh...cut toilet paper, uh that Friday morning.</span> <span id="s418">Uh, we would uh put the lights on, and uh...we would... If you went out...out uh...out of the home on Sabbath, you could not carry, you know, no money.</span> <span id="s419">In fact, you were not able to carry anything.</span> <span id="s420">You uh couldn't ring a doorbell or answer a telephone, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s421">So uh...but that became second nature to me.</span> <span id="s422">And uh...so it was just uh daily living, going to school and learning.</span> <span id="s423">And I think I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s424">I am sorry to say I['ve] forgotten so much in past years already.</span> <span id="s425">It was a great experience.</span> <span id="s426">And I think always a little bit afraid.</span> <span id="s427">Always a little bit afraid of the unknown at that time.</span> <span id="s428">I still...was still afraid with strangers.</span> <span id="s429">They're still not family, uh and everything; 'til I heard, you know, from my father.</span> <span id="s430">But I think there was always...like, "Where will they take me next?</span> <span id="s431">When will someone come and take me away again?"</span> <span id="s432">I was always being taken away.</span> <span id="s433">And I always gotten a foothold on the place when someone would come and take...take me away, and take me somewhere else--another home, another children's home, and everything.</span> <span id="s434">So I think a little fright was...was there.</span> <span id="s435">But uh I..</span> <span id="s436">.</span> <span id="s437">I remember that.</span> <span id="s438">Yet, I was...wanted very much to see my father, and wanted very much to go back to him.</span> <span id="s439">And uh...in April of 1946, I was able to do that, uh by train...uh...we went to Heidelberg from Saint-Étienne.</span> <span id="s440">And uh they took me... My father and his friend had an apartment together.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">And what happened was, since my father was a businessman before the war and so was his friend, when they came back from the war uh... What the American soldiers did, they put all the Jewish men, the businessmen, in business.</span> <span id="s442">And all the people who ran the big factories, and--they were Nazis, or they were German--and they were all let go from their jobs.</span> <span id="s443">And my father had a wonderful job.</span> <span id="s444">Uh, I mean, he was like the owner of a factory that manufactured men's clothing.</span> <span id="s445">And uh...his friend had a..</span> <span id="s446">.</span> <span id="s447">was running a factory, a leather goods--suitcases, you know.</span> <span id="s448">So they...they were very well-to-do after the war.</span> <span id="s449">I..</span> <span id="s450">.</span> <span id="s451">I know that.</span> <span id="s452">Uh...uh, the Americans made up for what they went...what they went through, and all that.</span> <span id="s453">The stories and all that come back to me.</span> <span id="s454">Uh, anyway, I came back; and they played a trick on me.</span> <span id="s455">They took me to my father's friend's office.</span> <span id="s456">And they told me that my father would come shortly.</span> <span id="s457">He would come.</span> <span id="s458">What they wanted to see is if I recognized my father.</span> <span id="s459">They were really playing a joke on me, but I didn't know.</span> <span id="s460">And I sat there in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Beautiful office--leather chairs.</span> <span id="s462">And men kept walking in and out.</span> <span id="s463">You know, men with all different wear.</span> <span id="s464">And I was ll and a half years; and I am sitting there in the chair, waiting.</span> <span id="s465">And men are walking in and out, and I am sitting.</span> <span id="s466">And amongst...all of a sudden, amongst the men walking in and out was my father.</span> <span id="s467">Well, it took [a] second.</span> <span id="s468">I recognized him right away.</span> <span id="s469">I mean, there was just no... Here I am.</span> <span id="s470">Spoke only French.</span> <span id="s471">He spoke only German.</span> <span id="s472">And we were hugging and crying, and his friend was trying to interrupt and everything.</span> <span id="s473">And uh...it was just [a] wonderful, wonderful reunion.</span> <span id="s474">And uh...then he took me to the aparmtent where...where they...where they lived.</span> <span id="s475">And what happened was, uh my... They dealt a lot in those days to...uh you weren't able to buy food, things like that, right after the war.</span> <span id="s476">Uh, a lot of black market going on.</span> <span id="s477">"I'll give you a raincoat, if you give me a dozen eggs.”</span> <span id="s478">You know, that type of thing.</span> <span id="s479">And my father was well in the position to do that, having a big manufacturing factory.</span> <span id="s480">He was dressed very well, and he drove a car--[a] black Mercedes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">And, oh, I remember [for] years after, [if] you saw a black car coming down the street that was my father.</span> <span id="s482">Because nobody else had a car, you know.</span> <span id="s483">And they had a housekeeper for them.</span> <span id="s484">And it turned out--which I didn't remember--she helped my parents.</span> <span id="s485">She was housekeeper for my parents in Lambsheim when I was a baby.</span> <span id="s486">Her husband was a soldier in the war.</span> <span id="s487">He got killed.</span> <span id="s488">She was a widow.</span> <span id="s489">And when my father went back to Lambsheim after the war and...to see how the...the home is and everything, he ran into her.</span> <span id="s490">And she came back with him to Heidelberg, and she kept house for him and...which...and my father's friend--which I then called "uncle," you know.</span> <span id="s491">And, of course, she knew me; but I didn't... She knew me as a baby; and uh...she was very, you know, very good me to me.</span> <span id="s492">And she tried to understand me.</span> <span id="s493">I'm talking French to you, and she's trying to understand.</span> <span id="s494">So she would go into the telephone and call my father's friend and...and give...hand me the phone.</span> <span id="s495">I would tell him what I want, and he would tell her, you know.</span> <span id="s496">And uh...she didn't even understand I wanted to go use the bathroom.</span> <span id="s497">And, see, in France, it's different.</span> <span id="s498">They have the bidets and the wash basins.</span> <span id="s499">And there was completely different.</span> <span id="s500">I didn't know what I could use.</span> <span id="s501">We couldn't even understand each...each other, you know.</span> <span id="s502">So uh...what they did, I got a tutor.</span> <span id="s503">My father got a tutor, uh...to learn German again.</span> <span id="s504">I..</span> <span id="s505">.</span> <span id="s506">you know, because I was uh...uh only 11 and a half years old, and uh...still had to go to school.</span> <span id="s507">And uh...I went.</span> <span id="s508">I went back and went to school.</span> <span id="s509">But in the meantime, what had happened even before I came back, he had met a woman who had lost her husband in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s510">And my father and his friend were at one of the Red Cross gatherings where the American soldiers would go; and this woman's two daughters were there.</span> <span id="s511">That's what I was...that's all I was told, because I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s512">And they started to talk to my father and his friend.</span> <span id="s513">And they found out that my...they told them their name.</span> <span id="s514">The last name was Hollander (ph).</span> <span id="s515">"And do you know... Did you know my father?"</span> <span id="s516">His name was also Fritz, their father's name.</span> <span id="s517">My father's name was Fritz.</span> <span id="s518">And uh...he did not know the father; but they...my father knew their uncle, their... their father's brother.</span> <span id="s519">And so the girls said, "You have to come home with us and meet our mother, and tell her that you were with our uncle.”</span> <span id="s520">And that uncle, I think, survived and went to Israel, as far as I know.</span> <span id="s521">And uh...so that's how they...how they met.</span> <span id="s522">And he told her about me and everything.</span> <span id="s523">So they already knew each other, uh I think, for at least a year or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Uh, and I am pretty sure that they knew...uh once they knew that my mother wasn't coming back and that her husband wasn't coming back, that they wanted to marry.</span> <span id="s525">But I also think they wanted to wait for me to return.</span> <span id="s526">They didn't want to marry without me, you know, being there.</span> <span id="s527">And uh...so I was told about my father's lady friend.</span> <span id="s528">Uh, they put a great big bouquet of flowers in my arms; and I was to give her that when met her.</span> <span id="s529">Her name was Paula.</span> <span id="s530">And uh...she had her own home.</span> <span id="s531">My father and I, he drove there.</span> <span id="s532">And we went in the door, and she came down the stairs.</span> <span id="s533">She had on red slacks, beautiful blonde hair, red fingernails-- beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s534">And here comes that beautiful woman walking down the stairs; and I am standing there with flowers bigger than myself, and hand them to her.</span> <span id="s535">And I was introduced and everything.</span> <span id="s536">My German was coming back, little by little, with the help of...of the tutor.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">And I think I was...uh...probably knew more.</span> <span id="s538">I was just afraid I would make a mistake.</span> <span id="s539">That's why I wouldn't talk; because the same thing happened when I learned English.</span> <span id="s540">I knew more English sooner than I realized, and I was afraid to express myself.</span> <span id="s541">And uh...from then on, this lady was always in our lives.</span> <span id="s542">And I met her two daughters, Ruth and Margot.</span> <span id="s543">And...I mean, we took to each other like fish to water.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: How did you feel, uh...about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: How I felt?</span> <span id="s546">I always waited for her.</span> <span id="s547">I never wanted to believe that my mother was dead, for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s548">I always thought one day there'll be a knock at the door and she'll be standing there.</span> <span id="s549">That was my fantasy.</span> <span id="s550">I don't think anybody even knew.</span> <span id="s551">I might have told my husband or my children, but I don't think anybody knew that.</span> <span id="s552">Uh, yes, I was always waiting for her.</span> <span id="s553">My mother will come back.</span> <span id="s554">Because the last picture of her between barbed wire, I will never erase that thought from my mind.</span> <span id="s555">And uh...by then uh ...I was given pictures of her which I..</span> <span id="s556">.</span> <span id="s557">you know, I have the pictures and everything.</span> <span id="s558">But I was always waiting for her.</span> <span id="s559">And uh...and uh...and then again, on the other hand, when I was told that my father was going to remarry I was happy; because I wanted a mother.</span> <span id="s560">That was very important to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">And uh...what they...what Paula did, uh--and also my father--they uh took in uh...people, they came...young girls that uh...uh that lived through...through Auschwitz, and through the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s562">And they had numbers on their arms, which we never did.</span> <span id="s563">We don't have a number.</span> <span id="s564">Uh, so the two girls--Paula's two girls--had lots of girlfriends that had survived the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s565">And they were always in their home, and they were always there and they were always happy.</span> <span id="s566">And they called Paula "Mommy," like her daughters did.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">And I wanted...I was told "Aunt Paula," you know; but I wanted to say "Mommy" also.</span> <span id="s568">I wanted to be...even though they were 5 and 6 years older than me--they were young ladies, and I was still a young child--I wanted a mother, too.</span> <span id="s569">I wanted...wanted that, you know, very much.</span> <span id="s570">Uh, so I think I compensated one with the...with the...with the other.</span> <span id="s571">And uh...the girls are ...were absolutely, I mean, wonderful.</span> <span id="s572">Uh, I'd be... Then they wanted to marry; and my father took ill, very ill.</span> <span id="s573">Uh, kidney problems.</span> <span id="s574">Kidney infections.</span> <span id="s575">And in those days, the penicillin.</span> <span id="s576">I think he had to get it from Americans, because there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s577">And they weren't married then, but uh...my mother stayed with him day and night in the hospital.</span> <span id="s578">And she was told that they didn't think he would live.</span> <span id="s579">And he knew that, and he asked her... When they told her that he may not live through the night, he asked her that "When you go to America, would you take Freya with you?"</span> <span id="s580">And she said she would.</span> <span id="s581">She promised that she would.</span> <span id="s582">Even though they weren't married, that she would take me.</span> <span id="s583">But he lived.</span> <span id="s584">And they got married.</span> <span id="s585">Beautiful, beautiful wedding.</span> <span id="s586">And my father also was very active in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s587">How many Jews?</span> <span id="s588">Handful of Jews in Heidelberg, you know, after the war.</span> <span id="s589">And uh...he was a wealthy man at the time, you know.</span> <span id="s590">And uh...they married.</span> <span id="s591">Uh, she give up...</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Paula gave up her home and they moved into a bigger home--beautiful, beautiful home.</span> <span id="s593">And they had help.</span> <span id="s594">They had maids, 'cause they had...they did very well.</span> <span id="s595">And they really gave everything up to come to America.</span> <span id="s596">Nothing.</span> <span id="s597">They started to come to America with nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: How did you all come to America?</span> <span id="s599">.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: How we came to America?</span> <span id="s601">Uh, my father had a brother in New York.</span> <span id="s602">They came here in 1938, with his wife and two children and my grandmother Lang--my father's mother.</span> <span id="s603">And he sponsored us.</span> <span id="s604">We needed to be spons...sponsored, affidavit.</span> <span id="s605">He sent the affidavit, and that's how we came to America.</span> <span id="s606">But we didn't come 'til 1949.</span> <span id="s607">So uh...but uh...my sister Ruth came a year ahead of us.</span> <span id="s608">She didn't...she didn't want anything to do with...with Germany anymore.</span> <span id="s609">She just wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s610">And we just... My parents were not quick enough for her.</span> <span id="s611">She just wanted to get out of there.</span> <span id="s612">And so she came to New York a year before we did.</span> <span id="s613">And uh...then, by the time, we came to America, she had already had a job and she...she had some family here, too, on her.</span> <span id="s614">I think, on her father's side, they had cousins that lived in New York.</span> <span id="s615">I don't remember it very uh....too well, you know.</span> <span id="s616">And uh...I was always kept a child.</span> <span id="s617">That's one thing I think my parents made a mistake.</span> <span id="s618">They were very, very strict, uh more so with me than with the older girls.</span> <span id="s619">And uh...they felt that I had no parents from the time I was 6; and they looked at me like I was 6, not 12.</span> <span id="s620">And those 6 years never gapped together.</span> <span id="s621">I think they never recaptured those 6 years.</span> <span id="s622">They always kept their child.</span> <span id="s623">I was only to be seen and not heard.</span> <span id="s624">My opinion didn't count.</span> <span id="s625">I was never asked anything; just, you know, told.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">And, in fact, that brings to mind... I want to go back on something.</span> <span id="s627">When I first came back to Germany, my parents were not Orthodox.</span> <span id="s628">They were Jewish.</span> <span id="s629">They went synagogue on holidays, but they were not religious.</span> <span id="s630">They did not keep a kosher home.</span> <span id="s631">I was lost.</span> <span id="s632">I didn't want to eat; and then if I did eat something, it had to be out of glass dish or glass bowl.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Because that's considered neutral.</span> <span id="s634">And I was just told blankly, "You do as we do, or you don't.”</span> <span id="s635">I mean, that's how it was.</span> <span id="s636">"This is how we live.</span> <span id="s637">This is how life is now, and you conform to our way of living.”</span> <span id="s638">And what did Alice do?</span> <span id="s639">Freya do?</span> <span id="s640">You conform to their way of living.</span> <span id="s641">And again, very shy child--very shy, passive, quiet.</span> <span id="s642">I went to school, uh...and I learned how to speak German again.</span> <span id="s643">It came back.</span> <span id="s644">I think it was back here.</span> <span id="s645">It was never really forgotten.</span> <span id="s646">It was just never used.</span> <span id="s647">And it came back very well and everything.</span> <span id="s648">And I'd like to say that I sat next to a young girl.</span> <span id="s649">I was the only Jewish girl in school, by the way, (laughter) again.</span> <span id="s650">And I sat next to a very nice girl--Martha Mayer (ph)--and we became friends.</span> <span id="s651">And I was then in the sixth grade.</span> <span id="s652">And I went to school for 3 years.</span> <span id="s653">And we stayed friends all that time.</span> <span id="s654">I have been in America going on 41 years.</span> <span id="s655">We still correspond.</span> <span id="s656">Gentile girl.</span> <span id="s657">We grew up.</span> <span id="s658">We wrote to each other.</span> <span id="s659">We're still in contact.</span> <span id="s660">In fact, twice she called me from Germany to talk to me.</span> <span id="s661">We're still friends.</span> <span id="s662">I keep up my German by writing German to her with my German/English-English/German dictionary next to me.</span> <span id="s663">We still correspond.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">We send pictures of our children, grandchildren.</span> <span id="s665">And there was wonderful.</span> <span id="s666">I made new...new friends.</span> <span id="s667">Everything was...you know, in that respect was very good.</span> <span id="s668">But uh...things were hard at home, because I was not allowed... I had to come home, and I wasn't allowed to hang around with my...with my with friends.</span> <span id="s669">And it followed through.</span> <span id="s670">And I tell you, if not for Margot and Ruth, I don't know what would happen to me.</span> <span id="s671">Because they were always on my side.</span> <span id="s672">Always stood up for me, always uh interferred, tried to help me.</span> <span id="s673">It was hard, because they were 5 and 6 years older.</span> <span id="s674">When I was 12, they were 17 and 18, you know.</span> <span id="s675">And uh...they were already working or going to school; and Ruth came to America.</span> <span id="s676">So it was...I found it to be very hard to...to live with my father and new-found, you know, mother.</span> <span id="s677">And uh...the word "stepmother" and "stepdaughter" or "stepsister," "stepchildren" was not allowed.</span> <span id="s678">It was a word that was not allowed in our family.</span> <span id="s679">My mother always said, "We have three girls, three daughters; and they are all ours.”</span> <span id="s680">People would stop my parents on the street, and they would say, "Now, whose girls are yours?</span> <span id="s681">And who are Paula's, and who are Fritz's children?"</span> <span id="s682">And my mother would say, "We have three daughters.”</span> <span id="s683">And I don't doubt that she loved me.</span> <span id="s684">I am sure she did.</span> <span id="s685">And she always said everything she did for me was for my own good.</span> <span id="s686">And I always thought so, and I still think--not always--that way.</span> <span id="s687">But that's how they felt.</span> <span id="s688">You know, they...they felt very stongly.</span> <span id="s689">And once, I misbehaved very badly.</span> <span id="s690">And I talked back to my mother; and I said, "If my mother were alive, I would not have said that.”</span> <span id="s691">I don't even remember what I said or did.</span> <span id="s692">And my father was in the room when I said that.</span> <span id="s693">That was the only time, first and only time, he ever slapped me.</span> <span id="s694">He slapped me across the face so hard that I fell across the room.</span> <span id="s695">Literally, fell across the room.</span> <span id="s696">And then I never ever brought up my mother again from that time on.</span> <span id="s697">And uh...I never said anything, you know, anymore; but I did do that.</span> <span id="s698">But I was a child, you know, and I was...by then... When they married, I was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s699">And uh...a young 13, very young 13.</span> <span id="s700">And uh... So then we... Oh, and then in the meantime, my youngest sister, Margot, was seeing a young man--a soldier, American soldier--who uh... In fact, he originally was born in the city of Auschwitz [Pol: Oswi_cim] in Poland when he was a young child, and came to America way before the war when he was 8 years old.</span> <span id="s701">And he was at the tail end of the Second World War, and Margot... They met each other, and they fell in love.</span> <span id="s702">And when when his term of duty was up, he went back to Chicago.</span> <span id="s703">And they wrote to each other later, of course.</span> <span id="s704">And he was like my big brother.</span> <span id="s705">He was wonderful.</span> <span id="s706">Uh, he took us for ice cream to the American P.X., you know; and that's where I got first candy bar, first movie, ice cream.</span> <span id="s707">He used to bring jars of ice cream.</span> <span id="s708">My father loved [the] ice cream he would bring.</span> <span id="s709">And the house was always full of young men--soldiers that my sister knew.</span> <span id="s710">Young people.</span> <span id="s711">And there was a lot of people, young people, there.</span> <span id="s712">But I always felt...I was always singled out to where I didn't quite belong, because I was so much younger.</span> <span id="s713">And everything was always kept from me.</span> <span id="s714">I don't have to know this, and I don't have to know that.</span> <span id="s715">And they just tried to keep me little.</span> <span id="s716">They didn't let me grow up.</span> <span id="s717">And, unfortunately, that continued through my...through my life, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s719">Is there anything else you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: No.</span> <span id="s721">I want to say that uh...I think I am very fortunate to be able to be here today, and to make this tape.</span> <span id="s722">And for the young people now growing up that don't know what World War II meant, what they do not learn in books and high school.</span> <span id="s723">My own children did not learn what I said today in high school.</span> <span id="s724">It is only what I taught them.</span> <span id="s725">Uh, people cannot believe.</span> <span id="s726">There are still people out there today that.</span> <span id="s727">.</span> <span id="s728">that don't believe what happened yet.</span> <span id="s729">And uh...this should be shown.</span> <span id="s730">And it should be shown in school.</span> <span id="s731">It should be shown in high school, where they're old enough to understand that World War II should never happen again and that something like that should never, ever happen again.</span> <span id="s732">And I thank you for inviting me today, and...and letting me tell my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s734">That's it.</span> <span id="s735">Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
