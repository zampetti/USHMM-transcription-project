what – you know, what I did, but I also – I was working as a butcher in a grocery store.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: That was before 1939, before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Oh no,

<p><span id="s93">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: When did you notice that things were changing?</span> <span id="s95">A: The change, it started – as far – as far as the people toward us, it didn’t change, because even the last minute they were supportive and they even asked me if they want to – if – i-if I want them to hide me in – in so – some places.</span> <span id="s96">Which, I couldn’t do that because of my parents being old and the rumor was going that we have to go with them to be able to support them.</span> <span id="s97">So we didn’t know that that was nothing but a false story.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Could you tell us more about that?</span> <span id="s99">Could you describe [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: I mean, they came – they came – they – they – first they said that we have to go into the ghetto, which – that was 1944, oh around February.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What happened before 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Be a – there was no problem other than working.</span> <span id="s103">We had the Star of David and we had to be – we could not go out before eight o’clock, nor stay out after six o’clock.</span> <span id="s104">That’s the only restriction we had.</span> <span id="s105">Otherwise, we were not abused by anybody.</span> <span id="s106">But we heard about Poland, that what’s going on there, that they were massacring and – and – and killing, and – the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: How did you hear about that?</span> <span id="s108">The radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Through – through radio, and through what you call rumor in the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: When did you start wearing the Star of David?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: The Star of David started, I – I think, if I’m right about it, it’s – either was end of ’42, or you know, ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: So in other words, you wore it for about a year before you were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: About a year, a year – a year and a half, somewhere around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Okay, what happened in 19 – 1940, the Hungarians were there?</span> <span id="s115">A: No, the Hungarians were there, and like I said, we had – our police chief was a local man who lived in Hungary.</span> <span id="s116">They sent him back to be the chief of the police, and he was a very fine, gentle gentleman that we had no problem, or picking on the Jewish people or anything like that.</span> <span id="s117">So as far as that is concerned, we had no problem, and – and – and the people – and the people there were very, very friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Was your neighborhood a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: No, it was a mixed neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s121">What happened in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Oh, was just about the same thing, 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: The same.</span> <span id="s124">So when did things really start to change for –</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: That’s – when they started to change was in ’40 – was end of ’42 and ’43 when – already in – in Poland, they were saying that they had the establishment of the Warsaw ghetto, and then they were killing the Jewish people in what you call, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: That was in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Three, 40 – end of ’42 and – and ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s129">What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: There was – that’s when they told us to wear the Star of David and we were going to war.</span> <span id="s131">Matter of fact, the Germans took over some of the what you call group, and told them what to do and when to do and how long to do it, and not the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s132">It was strictly the German – it was not the SS, it was the army, so they were not too violent as far as reprimand us or – or beating us.</span> <span id="s133">But they told us –</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Could you continue – did your father continue in his own business during the period –</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes, yes, he was.</span> <span id="s136">He was.</span></p> <p><span

was in what they call a army labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: They were taken away, they were older.</span> <span id="s141">And one of my brother went away and went to Yugoslavia, he joined the Yugoslavian partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Which brother was –</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: He was not – he did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: His name was Alexander.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Alexander.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Wa – you know, they didn’t call him Alexander, they called him Sheeu(ph) – Shia(ph), you know what, in – in Hebrew name.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Mishayel.</span> <span id="s149">Mishayel?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: No, no, Shiahersch(ph), Shiahersch(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Hersch?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s154">[indecipherable] All right, could you start to describe how things got worse and worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Now when we – wh-when they took us to the camp –</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: That was already beginning of ’44, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: When did you get the announcement that you have to go to camp?</span> <span id="s159">Could you tell us how you were told that you –</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: They were told – they told us – that was end of ’43, that we will have to move out in one camp.</span> <span id="s161">Now, we knew what the ghetto is because we – they – we heard what –</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Who told you?</span> <span id="s163">Who told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: The – the older people, you know, that they knew what the ghetto was in the old days, that you know, when I say the Jewish people lived in ghetto in many countries.</span> <span id="s165">That means combined in one place all the Jewish people, and that’s what they called the ghettoes.</span> <span id="s166">But that time I didn't know it, because we never had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Are you talking about a ghetto in Užhorod, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: N-No, there was – they were talking about what a ghetto is.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: But the ghetto in Užhorod was nothing but a brick manufacturer – big buildings.</span> <span id="s171">So that was not a place that it was living around in a whole area in houses.</span> <span id="s172">It was just in a big, brick manufacturing place with nothing but concrete buildings.</span> <span id="s173">And that was all over the city like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Did you live in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: So when did you have to move from your home to this ghetto in Užhorod?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: That was in – in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Were you allowed to take anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: They just said to take clothes and – and – and blankets, because it’s – was still cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: What did you do with your property?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: We didn't do nothing, you couldn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s182">You couldn’t buy it, sell it or – or give it.</span> <span id="s183">It – we just walked out and left everything where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: And that was in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: When in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: I’m not sure but I was be – it’s either January

thought, you know, that we gonna stay around in the area, in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s283">But they didn’t tell us.</span> <span id="s284">When we were going and looked out the train, we saw that we crossed the Polish border, so we knew that we – they taking us to Poland and there is trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: You had no idea that all those horrible things were happening throughout Europe concentration camps –</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: There was – there was no radio information about what’s was going on in Europe other than people who had radios and then had war stories, but they never said anything about the killing of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: And you felt sufficiently secure –</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: – you and your family, that you didn’t think of leaving the –</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: No, because I felt that I was strong enough, and my brothers, that we could take care of the families, as far as work is concerned.</span> <span id="s291">But it just didn’t happen and turned differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s293">All right, so you’re now going from Užhorod to –</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: – to Poland.</span> <span id="s296">And that was in April of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Where in Poland did they take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Now, they took us – they took us to Auschwitz, was Oswiecim, you know, actually what they call it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s301">Can you describe the train trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: How long did it take?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: It was so full that if you stretched out, you couldn’t pull your leg back, or vice versa, if you pull it in, it was almost impossible to put it in there.</span> <span id="s305">And every day when the train stopped, they opened the door and threw the dead bodies out.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: And how long did the trip take?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: About three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Did you have any food and water during those three days?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: No.</span> <span id="s310">None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: So for three days there were no –</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Water, we – when we got out, people – they allowed you to get out, water we had at – at the train station, but no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So the train would stop periodically?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Yes, to unload the dead body and if people wanted to go into – in a washroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s316">And how was the sanitation on the train itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: There was no s – there was no such a thing as sanitation.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: So in other words you had to wait until you got to the train station where they would allow you down –</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s320">Wherever they stopped, allowed me to go down, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s322">How many people would you estimate were in each –</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Sometimes as ma – as ma – as many as a hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: How did the people feel at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Nobody talked for the simple reason, the worry was so great that it was no time, no place to say, how you feel or what you think or – or what.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: No, no, but the whole situation, I mean, were you frightened, or were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: The whole situation – yes, everybody was afraid what – you know, there was no answer and no question.</span> <span id="s328">We couldn’t ask because nobody knew anything.</span> <span id="s329">Because like I said, there was no information as far as the Jewish people were in – in a concentration – or other than what we heard in Poland, which it was close to us, that there is Germans – the SS was killing Jewish people.</span> <span id="s330">But the Warsaw ghetto uprising, we did not her – we didn’t hear anything.</span> <span id="s331">Matter of fact, I don’t think even the free world heard anything about it because n-nobody – otherwise we would have known – the BBC we listened, sometimes at night they ha – talking about the war, and we didn’t hear nothing.</span> <span id="s332">Nothing whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Who – who – who – who – who brought those rumors about the – the Germans killing Jews in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Oh, some people, I couldn’t tell who, but they were talking about it, what they heard, that people coming from Poland over the border that – that they’re killing the Jewish people in – special in – they were talking about Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: All right, so after three days on the train you arrived at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Can you tell us about it, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yes, they told us to get out.</span> <span id="s339">One who could get out, because there was still dead bodies in the train.</span> <span id="s340">And then they said men and boys on one side, women and children on the other side.</span> <span id="s341">And as we were going, there were overseers, which we – they called them kapos and they were Jewish people and they said, you see that smoke?</span> <span id="s342">Do you smell it?</span> <span id="s343">And they said, that’s gas chamber, okay?</span> <span id="s344">We didn’t know nothing about it, we never even heard there’s such a thing as gas chambers.</span> <span id="s345">So he said, they’re burning bodies.</span> <span id="s346">One who died and one who was killed.</span> <span id="s347">And as we walked in on the right side into the camp, we looked back and we saw my parents, my father, my mother and sister with the little children, well that was the last time I did see them.</span> <span id="s348">And when we got into the camp, the – well, they call it the living camp.</span> <span id="s349">And as – we stayed there a couple days when a kapo man came over and he said, when you want to get out of here, if somebody asks for volunteers, say yes.</span> <span id="s350">And if they tell you that you want a what – what – you know, what trade, carpenter, bricklayer, whatever they’re – tell them that you know all of it.</span> <span id="s351">You are a carpenter, you’re a bricklayer, you’re everything.</span> <span id="s352">If that’s what they ask for it, because they didn’t use you what they asked, they just wanted volunteers.</span> <span id="s353">And that’s when we were shipped out, not that, you know, it was a couple weeks later, they shipped us out to ow – to Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Let me backtrack a little bit.</span> <span id="s355">When you arrived at the gate, you describe men and boys –</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: – on one side and women and children on the other side, did they take you – did you get any prisoners clothes, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: No, not there.</span> <span id="s359">No, not there.</span> <span id="s360">There – when we were inside, in the camp, they told us to go in a – a room, and undress completely naked.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: But that was not right when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Oh, it was in the same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: But it was in the camp when they told us to take off the clothes and just put everything else in there and come out naked.</span> <span id="s365">Then they gave us – a little bit later they gave us what you call a pair of pants and a jacket.</span> <span id="s366">That’s all we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: When was the last time you saw your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: When we separated on – on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: When you arrived at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: When you got – when we arrived to Auschwitz and got off the train, that’s the last time we see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: How come you and your father were not put in the male column?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Because my father was old and had a beard and you could tell that he was not a working man.</span> <span id="s373">He was too old to – you know, to work.</span> <span id="s374">He was in his 60’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So your mother and father were in one –</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: One, and my sister, because she had a little child in her hand.</span> <span id="s377">So she was on – on – on the left hand side.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: And who stayed with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: My younger brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: What’s his – what’s the name of your younger brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Yeah, Sol.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Saa?</span> <span id="s383">S-a-a?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: S-o-l.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Oh, Sol.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Only in Hungarian they called him Zolly(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: And your sister’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: My sister name what – whi-which survived, was Mulvina(ph) and Helen.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Yeah, I – no, no, the one that –</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: And they were – they – they were also –</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: – the one that [indecipherable] your pra –</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yeah, they were also on the left hand side because women were separated from the men right then and there.</span> <span id="s395">Well, they went into – further down, and they separated the young ones from the old ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Uh-huh, so there were like three lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: The – yeah, there was two lanes, but a little bit further down where the women were, they’re not in the same camp as the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Where did you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: On the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Can you describe?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Ho, you see, there was no problem for me for the simple reason, we were a big family and we only had three rooms, a kitchen, a – a – a bedroom, a living room and a dining room all in one, so we slept all on the floor.</span> <span id="s402">Only my mother, my father and my oldest sister slept in bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: But that was at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: That was home, but we slept on the floor, so I was used to it and – and – and food, what we ate, sometimes there was none, it didn’t bother, and that’s why we could take the condition, because we were used to it.</span> <span id="s405">And let’s say this much, that we were not picayune about what we ate.</span> <span id="s406">We ate as long as it was food, edible and good.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: How many people were in your cabin at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Now a – that I couldn’t tell you because it was a big cabin and there was hundreds of them in there.</span> <span id="s409">So I couldn’t tell exactly what it wa – how many it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s411">And how often did they give you food?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Now they have – in – in there, in Auschwitz, there was not so bad that th-the – the – a few days that we were over there we gave every – you know, everyth – we had sometimes once, sometimes twice a day we had food.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: How long did you stay in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: No, we didn't stay too long.</span> <span id="s415">I mean, I’m not sure exactly what it is, but I would say, you know, at least between a one month or two months, you know, that’s all.</span> <span id="s416">That’s why we are not tattooed, because they said that one who is there four or five or six months, they tattooed those people.</span> <span id="s417">Now my friend who was from my area in – in Czechoslovakia, she stayed there almost eight months.</span> <span id="s418">She – they put her to work in the crematorium and she got the numbers and she told me that – that she cannot talk to nobody because she saw her mother and father coming down on a ramp, dead, and it – she explained it why I did not have the what you call, the tattoo.</span> <span id="s419">And after that other people told me why we don’t, but I have the number.</span> <span id="s420">I never forget that, it’s 88841.</span> <span id="s421">And my brother had 8842.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: How come you know your number and how come it wasn’t tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: No, tha-that tha – they gave you the number on your shirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: But they didn’t give it to me on my hand, because like I said, I was a very short time there.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: [indecipherable] only after six months that they would –</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yes, then they tattooed.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Neither my sisters are – two sisters have – are tattooed because they were taken in a different section.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Now what did you do – did you work in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s432">Not – no, in Auschwitz we didn’t work, no.</span> <span id="s433">In Auschwitz we just stayed in a barrack and always called roll call back and forth just to keep you occupied.</span> <span id="s434">No, only in Warsaw ghetto we were working.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: No, let’s not – le-let’s just stay in – stay on this point.</span> <span id="s436">So you didn’t do no work in – in the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Not in Auschwitz, we didn’t work, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: In Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s439">Were you aware of the bodies being –</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yes, we saw it – one, and we were inform by the people already there what’s going on.</span> <span id="s441">They said look, the chimney, the black, the smoke, the smell.</span> <span id="s442">That’s where they put the bodies, they’re burning it, because there’s no place to put them.</span> <span id="s443">That’s when we knew that that’s a death camp.</span> <span id="s444">And that’s all, we couldn’t do nothing, so we stayed there on in the barracks, or – outside we couldn’t roam around, only when they called us the roll call, and they called us quite a few times a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: And you were the whole time with your brother together?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: But you didn’t see your parents again?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: You stayed there for four months?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, just in between one or two months.</span> <span id="s451">I’m not exactly sure, but we were a very short time over there, cause we wanted to go what – what the kapo said, volunteer to get out.</span> <span id="s452">So I couldn’t say that – no, [indecipherable] would say between one or – or – or two months, somewhere around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: And when did you find out that you were going to be transferred elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: No, when they – when they called out for volunteers and the kapo told me to do exactly – go and say you are a bricklayer or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s455">And so my brother did the same thing.</span> <span id="s456">I had a brother who was a painter, so he said he was a painter, and we were accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: And then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: And then, in a few days, they put us on a train taking us to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: How long was the train ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: No, I couldn’t describe, but I think we made it in – i-i-in – in one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: How were the condition on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: That time they gave us food before we entered that, you know, the boxcars, and then when we got to Warsaw, in be – i-in between there they stopped and they gave us some water and they told us to get out and – and use a washroom, whatever it is and then we had water.</span> <span id="s463">That’s all we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: How many people were taken from Auschwitz to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Now on that trip, about 800.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s467">Only men?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Only men, only men.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: And were you still wearing your prisoner uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Yeah, by then we had the prisoners’ uniform on.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Ah, you didn’t get them as soon as you got to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Oh yes, that’s what I said, you know, we had to be naked.</span> <span id="s473">We got that, but like I said, you know, we had it on, uniform, the first day we arrived in Auschwitz, they – they changed.</span> <span id="s474">They took all – everything we had, civilian clothes and threw it in one box.</span> <span id="s475">And then they told us to go outside and we stayed there naked til they called and – and gave you their uniform, striped uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: And with these uniform you came to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: When did you arrive in Warsaw, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: It was in – I think it was May or end of May.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Can you tell us about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Oh, we just got with the train and – and – and – and from the train they told us – we arrived there, destination and we walked into the camp.</span> <span id="s484">And to – and after the camp they said separate men and go in – in different barracks and take a place where we gonna sleep.</span> <span id="s485">So there was nothing but wooden bunkers, you just took a – a – a space.</span> <span id="s486">There was two on the bottom and two on the top and my brother and myself, we took the bottom part and that’s where we stayed til we had to walk to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s488">Could you tell us about the period that you were in Warsaw?</span> <span id="s489">Did you then learn about the Warsaw uprising, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes, there first –</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: And where was – where was the camp that you stayed within Warsaw actually?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Did you know it was the former ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Well, they told us while we walked in there and you could see the houses all demolished and we learned that already in Auschwitz that the Warsaw ghetto was destroyed.</span> <span id="s495">It was an uprising.</span> <span id="s496">So when we walked in there you could tell because every building was destroyed, every one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: What was the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: There was no name, that – that was just the Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s500">And it was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: The only name I know is Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: And what did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: We were working at tearing down houses and a bricklayer – and the bricks, we pile them in the front and they said they were sending it to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: And how were the living conditions, I mean, in terms of food, did you get enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Now there they gave us food while we were working.</span> <span id="s506">They gave us food.</span> <span id="s507">They gave us breakfast and lunch and supper, they gave us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Could you describe a typical day there?</span> <span id="s509">I mean, what time you got in the morning –</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Oh, in the morning we got up about six o’clock and then we had to line up and –</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: For a roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: – and wait for breakfast.</span> <span id="s513">Once you were through with it, within an hour we were in line to go to the workplace, which was – it depends what section they took.</span> <span id="s514">Sometimes, you know, about maybe 30 minutes or an hour we – we got there, sometimes two hours, as – depends the distance we had walk, you know, do the cleaning.</span> <span id="s515">But I also have – we had good news.</span> <span id="s516">While I was working in the house, we found money.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Which house?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Go – in a – a – the buildings that was destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: The building in the ghetto that was des –</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Not in the ghetto, outside the ghetto, we didn't work in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s521">Outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s522">And we found gold pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Oh, can you tell us about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s525">It was quite a few thousand gold – 20 dollar gold pieces, but you couldn’t take it in because the guard or – there were – law was, when you come in, you keep the shoes and your belt and the clothes you leave it on the ground, and the guard went through with it, feeling what you got in your pocket.</span> <span id="s526">So I couldn’t bring nothing in til I met a Polish what they call a worker, who was bringing in [indecipherable] supplies, whate – whatever it is, horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s527">And we stopped him and we ask him can we get a belt, wide and double thickness.</span> <span id="s528">And he said oh yes, he said, but it would cost you a thousand dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: A thousand dollars?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: A thousand dollars, and we had paper money, which we u – we gave him a thousand dollars and I put the 20 dollar gold pieces in the belt, which went in 40 dollars at a time.</span> <span id="s531">40 20’s, but – you know, 40 gold pieces you could put in the belt.</span> <span id="s532">And that’s how I went in to the camp.</span> <span id="s533">And one guard asked if he found anything, he would give us bread.</span> <span id="s534">So I told him I had – I found one gold piece, what would I get?</span> <span id="s535">He said a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s536">And I was buying bread for a 20 dollar gold piece, a loaf of bread, which was enough for my brother, myself and my brother-in-law who was with us there too.</span> <span id="s537">Oh my bra – what I call him brother-in-law because he’s wa – was my brother’s brother-in-law, but we called him brother-in-law anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: You always worked outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: And always –</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Not outside the ghetto, outside of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Outside of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s544">The camp was in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, so in other words, you lived in –</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yeah, in – i-i-in – in the ghetto –</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: – the ghetto, but you went outside –</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: – that’s right, working, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Because our was what you call encircled camp with high wires and guards at every section; there was machine guns set up, so we couldn’t do nothing or try to even get out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s552">How many hours a day did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Sometimes 10 - 12 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s555">Was there any kind of organization, like the Jewish organization [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: You could not – you could not, other than in the, what you call, barracks, you could talk to each other.</span> <span id="s557">Outside you could not get a – an – an – and form like a group.</span> <span id="s558">You couldn’t do that, that was not allowed.</span> <span id="s559">Inside, yes, but you couldn’t form no group.</span> <span id="s560">Only thing we did is people were trying to do is make up a – what you call a song and do – keep us what you call, happy.</span> <span id="s561">Which we learned that few of them, I don’t know if you ever heard about it [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s562">Did you ever hear about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Okay then.</span> <span id="s565">And that’s what we were singing all the time.</span> <span id="s566">And it kept us a little bit more excited and the feeling as – as otherwise, you know, it would be just the other way around, would drag you down, but that song really kept us going.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: And how long did you stay in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: In the Warsaw we stayed til about September or October, because we heard the rumor also – rumor, that the Russians are closing in on Poland, getting closer and closer to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s569">So they told us to get together and take what you got, which we didn’t have nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Who is they, the – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: The SS, or the guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: And we will march.</span> <span id="s574">What they didn’t tell us where or how long, but we marched and we marched.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: And that was in September 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: That was in September or October, somewhere around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: In the autumn.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Yeah, in the autumn, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: And you started to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Yes, we walked.</span> <span id="s581">And as we were walking, people were falling out.</span> <span id="s582">If he was alive, he was shot.</span> <span id="s583">If he pretended he wasn’t alive, he was shot anyway to make it sure that he was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Did you know which direction you were walking towards?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: No, they told us we’re walking toward Germany, that’s all we knew.</span> <span id="s586">And I didn’t know Poland or Warsaw, anywhere, which way we going.</span> <span id="s587">All I knew is that we were walking toward Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: How many days did you walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: I couldn't tell you that, but it was quite a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: How many hours a day did you walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: From sunlight to almost darkness.</span> <span id="s592">Sometimes we stopped earlier and just like the man was saying, we were using whatever y – tools you had to make a hole and get some water out of the field to drink it because there was no water.</span> <span id="s593">And if you walked on the main line, there was the sewer – not, I wouldn’t say sewer, but water drainage, and – and we used to drink water.</span> <span id="s594">Whether it was clean or dirty or infected, we didn't think about it, nor did we care about it.</span> <span id="s595">All we knew because we were thirsty.</span> <span id="s596">And then one time, one – one time we got to a water and we just ran into the water and – clothes and all and drinking and – an-and bathing and just name it, we did in the water.</span> <span id="s597">Then they wa – some of them wanted to swim away from it, and they were killed in the water.</span> <span id="s598">We got out of it, and I think that was the last time that we had water that I know of, is when we were at the river.</span> <span id="s599">And then we walked about a couple more days.</span> <span id="s600">And they said pretty soon we going to go into a – no, I think – I think we were about – I would say about maybe three or 400 mi – kilometers we walked.</span> <span id="s601">Then they put us on the train.</span> <span id="s602">Where it was, I couldn’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: When you were walking, until they put you on the train, did you come across villages or little towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: No, we did not, we used strictly the roads.</span> <span id="s605">There was never villages or towns, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: So you didn’t see any of the local population?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: None whatsoever, no, none whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Who gave you food to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Whatever they – what you call th-the trucks or cars were bringing it out there, what little it was, because you know, I – I was told there was 11,800 people that walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: 11,000 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: All of them from the Warsaw –</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Ghetto.</span> <span id="s614">I mean, there was also other buildings, you know, other than ours.</span> <span id="s615">And th-that’s what they told us.</span> <span id="s616">Now, I cou – I-I only go what people said and – and we were – arrived very few of them in – in what you call, Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Now, before we get there, how did people react to one another during this march?</span> <span id="s618">Were they helping each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yes, myself and my brother was hel-helping a-an older gentleman who so – who – it just so happened he was a rabbi and we carried him so long, so far.</span> <span id="s620">After that he could not even walk and we dragged him a little bit, but he just fell down and you couldn’t bend down and try to help him, cause they would kill you the same way.</span> <span id="s621">And so we walked, and I – we heard a shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Okay, we were – we were talking about your marching from – from Warsaw towards Germany, and I asked you if people were helping each other and jus –</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Yes, e-e-everybody, you know, who – who needed some help, they had an arm, you know and – and try to support him by walking.</span> <span id="s625">One who could not, like I said, fell down –</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: – Fell down.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: – and you could not do anything, we had to just walk and leave him behind.</span> <span id="s628">And I heard – this is just what I said, I heard that only about 11 – 1800 or 2800 survived and all the rest of them died on the way.</span> <span id="s629">This is what people told us.</span> <span id="s630">Now, I couldn’t say whether I counted them, because I didn’t, you couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s631">But I just going by them and – and like the gentleman said, that he – you know, when he walked into Dachau that the – the whole street was lined up with dead people on the floor.</span> <span id="s632">So I couldn’t tell you that, but he said and then they said that it’s about 180 people survived.</span> <span id="s633">Now I – I – I couldn’t say that I counted them, but I just go what people told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Yeah, but – but you’re pretty c-certain there were about 11,000 who were there –</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: That’s what they told us, and now that’s – we – we had 11,800 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: And how many arrived in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Well, you see, there was more than one group, but that – in the group that I came in –</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: In your group.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: – there was 18 – 180 people survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Out of how many?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Of 11,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: 11,000, my goodness.</span> <span id="s643">How did people feel during that march?</span> <span id="s644">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: You know, we wasn’t talking to each other, other than what’s going to happen to us, and many times you were thinking about just hide in the bushes, maybe some Polish farmer, or Polish partisans will come and help.</span> <span id="s646">And – but nobody was daring enough to do that because, like I said, some people wanted to do it in the water, and they shot them.</span> <span id="s647">So everybody was afraid to do anything, and I wa – just so happened I was with my brother and I just couldn’t take a chance on anything.</span> <span id="s648">We figure we gonna survive one way or the other.</span> <span id="s649">And thank God we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: So you were hopeful for –</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: You said that you walked and then they put you on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: On the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: For how many days did you walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: I couldn’t tell exactly because you know, that time, the counting wasn’t there, but it was quite a few days, was quite a few days.</span> <span id="s656">We slept outside in the cool weather, but we slept good because we bundled up among each, you know, instead of being just one or two of them, was eight, 10 people got together and – and warmed each other up.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: What was the name of the town from which you took the train?</span> <span id="s658">You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Like I said, we were not even close to the town so we couldn’t even see what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Ma –</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: The on – the only thing we knew, that we saw some buildings, but where or what, I couldn’t tell.</span> <span id="s662">Nobody, I mean anybody was on that trip, could tell you what the town’s name is.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: And so you got on the train, how long was the train ride?</span> <span id="s664">This – this train ride to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I would say from – tha – to Dachau was a couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: And how was your physical health during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Mine was good because as a kid I was a hard worker and – and – and good condition, because we were working all day and so my physical condition was good because I was used to hard life at home, like I said, we lived that way.</span> <span id="s668">And so I had no problem in that respect.</span> <span id="s669">Many people are – were passing out because they had no – also I, as a – as a young man I was a sportsman.</span> <span id="s670">I was a soccer player, I was a runner and so on, so I was in good condition in that respect, and so was my brother.</span> <span id="s671">But other people was with us, they were just falling out.</span> <span id="s672">Naturally, some were older than we are.</span> <span id="s673">We were that – you know, I was – that was what, about 20 years old, and so I wa – I – like I said, in my prime, in that condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: I meant to ask you when you went from – from Užhorod to – to Auschwitz –</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: – and then from Auschwitz to Poland and now to Dachau, were you the whole time with the same people that left Užhorod with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: No, not the same people.</span> <span id="s678">There was – you see, in – in that train was other than Užhorod.</span> <span id="s679">There was surrounding areas and they brought them also into the camps, so let’s – I would say surrounding area, yes.</span> <span id="s680">And that’s – that’s the people who was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: And these are the people that eventually you got to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Tell us about Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Now, in Dachau –</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Tell us when you arrived there, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: When we arrived to Dachau, there was people greeting us and some of them said welcome to death camp.</span> <span id="s687">And I said, what camp?</span> <span id="s688">He said, death camp.</span> <span id="s689">Well, I didn’t know what he is talking about it til I found out, you see that chimney over there?</span> <span id="s690">He said that’s where all the people wind up who stays in here.</span> <span id="s691">Well, we didn’t know nothing, they gave us a bed, and they allowed us to go in a bath house.</span> <span id="s692">Warm, hot water bath.</span> <span id="s693">And then they said if e – you know, we gonna have some food in the kitchen – which, they gave us food.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Who were the people who greeted you in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: So the prisoners told you it was a death camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Were the prisoners Jewish, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: They were mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: He was a – a – a – what you call a preacher I wasn’t sure, a Catholic, or whatever it is, but that was a preacher, cause he still had that collar, only the collar on his neck.</span> <span id="s704">Otherwise he had the same striped uniform, you know, and – and he greeted us and he said I’m not Jewish, he said – he told us right away that he wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s705">There was many over there i-i-in a religious group that were arrested by the German government.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: All right, so tell us some more about Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: And then we st – like I said, we stayed a few days, I’m not so sure how long because we were so tired, and – and as – a – if they allowed us, we were just laying and sleeping.</span> <span id="s708">Then one day they called and they said, where anybody wants to volunteer to go work in – in the underground factory – building, a factory.</span> <span id="s709">And no one experienced what the man in – in Auschwitz said, the first thing you do is get out a ca – a death camp.</span> <span id="s710">And exactly that’s what we did, and we got to a small town, what they call Mildorf(ph).</span> <span id="s711">And from Mildorf(ph) we had to walk to the camp, which was in the forest, I would say maybe five, no more than eight kilometers from there, and they had the cabins.</span> <span id="s712">You know, I – we call them bunkers, cause all it was i-is – is a roof over it and concrete, everything else concrete.</span> <span id="s713">The place that you sleep and – and sit, or whatever, or walk, it was nothing but concrete.</span> <span id="s714">And we stayed there a few days you know, til they took us working out the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Outside of Mildorf(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Outside of Mildorf(ph), yeah, that was also outside Mildorf(ph).</span> <span id="s717">There was an underground factory they were building, and we were –</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: And what were they doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: We didn’t know that because it was just in the process of building that – the place up.</span> <span id="s720">And what it is – was, that people were standing on steel, what you call –</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Beams?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: – platform, or – or – or shape, then we poured concrete.</span> <span id="s723">And if you were not careful and you fell in there, the concrete buried you instantly because it was flowing, the concrete, continuously.</span> <span id="s724">And it – that’s the place where I got badly hurt, when a train, a construction train hit me in my chest and ruptured my ribs, punctured my lung and almost killed me.</span> <span id="s725">But I survived.</span> <span id="s726">God, I believed in God, and it helped me.</span> <span id="s727">And there was one German worker who had a hat on, they called him Toten Kopf, which translation mean dead head.</span> <span id="s728">And he helped me with little food there was in the underground, while I was in the camp, in the working camp, when I was going a – I – I came out every day to walk back because they counted the people when they came and when they left, make it sure that there is everybody there.</span> <span id="s729">But every morning when we walked there, which was seven days a week and sometimes working 12 - 14 - 15 hours a day, that’s including in walking and everything else, and I was most of the time in the bunker, underground and in the dark, cause I couldn’t breathe.</span> <span id="s730">Finally, I got better.</span> <span id="s731">And – and also it was a problem in the camp because they threw me out from the barrack because I was moaning from pain all night long and I couldn’t – they couldn’t sleep and they f – they felt that they are so tired that they just cannot take my, what you call misery and – and sound, or pain, cause that would have made them more s – what you call vulnerable to their – to their work and because they were so tired.</span> <span id="s732">Even then we didn't have sleep.</span> <span id="s733">And many people died there too, in the working place, if not on the what you call, on the march.</span> <span id="s734">Cause it was, you know, every day marching to work and from work and lunch.</span> <span id="s735">Lunch hour was in a section and we knew what time.</span> <span id="s736">When the horn sounded, you’re supposed to go to the – what they call a – a lun – a lunch area.</span> <span id="s737">And people used to always slowly work their way in closer – closer to their lunch, because if you didn’t, there was just a si – one hour time you had to feed I don’t know how many hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s738">So natural, you were trying to get closer.</span> <span id="s739">When you were closer you ran to it if you were lucky, you know, and they used to put in a – a ladle in that soup, and come out with a potato and he puts it back and you get nothing but water.</span> <span id="s740">It has one or two potatoes in it and they showed it everybody else what it is, but never got it.</span> <span id="s741">But they showed what it was.</span> <span id="s742">But anything was cooked, what little was in it, and it – a-and a little bit, it did help.</span> <span id="s743">And to prove that it did help, I’m here today.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: So you essentially helped the Germans build this underground factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: I want to go back to your accident, when that train hit you.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: How did it exactly happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: There was a Russian prisoner who was driving that little train.</span> <span id="s750">And then he wanted to put it in reverse, because he was in a standing position, he wanted to put it in reverse, and we were around there.</span> <span id="s751">And it, instead of reverse, it jumped in drive and it jumped – I was so close to it, that the edge of the train hit my rib, and it –</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: So it was an accident?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Oh yeah, that was th – an accident, it was not on purpose [indecipherable] and I still have the thing sticking out over here, even though I had the operation, they removed part of it, not to – you know, punctured it.</span> <span id="s754">But there was a doctor who did help me, not an official doctor –</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: At the time?</span> <span id="s756">At th –</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: At the camp, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: At mi – at Misseldorf(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Ye-Yes, and he said, let me do something for you and he put his hand and pulled out the rib.</span> <span id="s760">I almost died in the pain from that alone.</span> <span id="s761">And he said now, the blood started – stopped running, as it did before.</span> <span id="s762">And like I said, everything, it was just working my way, bu –</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Was it a Jewish doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yeah – oh yes, he was a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Also a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s767">But like I said, we didn’t have no doctors, not officially.</span> <span id="s768">We didn’t even volunte –</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: [indecipherable] he was a Jewish doctor from –</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: He was a Jewish doctor from our area, yes.</span> <span id="s771">And he is the one who pulled it out.</span> <span id="s772">And people said, you know, they pronounced me already dead, and I got up in the broad sunlight and I saw the stars, but I announced that I’m not dead, I’m alive.</span> <span id="s773">But the blood was just spilling out of my mouth.</span> <span id="s774">And you know, what we saw in movies and all that, a-all the time, when the person was shot and the blood was coming out the mouth, that – the sign was, that’s it.</span> <span id="s775">And so did – I thought so too, and everybody else around that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: But you were taken care of by your friend – by your fellow prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yes, but this German, he w – he was a worker over there, he is the one who really helped me, he gave me some food every day.</span> <span id="s778">Not much, because he didn’t have too much either.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Was he a guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: No, he was a working guy.</span> <span id="s781">He was – looks like a penalized worker, because you didn’t see no civilians, Germans working in that camp.</span> <span id="s782">But whatever there was, an overseer, or – or what – he was not working like we did, but in the same area, so I – I couldn’t tell what he was, but I figure he was maybe penalized and put in there working with us, even though supervising.</span> <span id="s783">What position, I couldn’t tell because he wouldn’t tell me nothing, other than he said he is sorry what they doing to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Mm-hm, and – but he covered for you for the few days that you couldn’t work?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: He wa – yes, he took me down in the – in – in – in the bunker every day and he said, you stay here until I come after you.</span> <span id="s786">And he used to come down and got me out just before the work was over.</span> <span id="s787">So when there was a roll call, I had to lift my hand up and said aye, you know, he count so and so, everybody else by name.</span> <span id="s788">And sometimes they just counted how many people, and they – each – each group had 40 - 50 of them, and you better have 50.</span> <span id="s789">One was missing, we stayed there til they find the body or the person.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s791">And how long were you in Dachau or Misseldorf(ph), or –</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Mildorf(ph)?</span> <span id="s793">I was in Mildorf(ph) til the last day when the Americans were already close by and some of the guard were talking to each other, you know, that th-the Americans are already in – in – close by in Munich and all that.</span> <span id="s794">So we knew that it is coming, so they wanted to take us some death camp, and they told us, get ready, we going into the – on that train, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: The Germans told us, yeah.</span> <span id="s797">The SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: When di – what time of year was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: That was in – in April, in ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: No, no, ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: I mean ’45.</span> <span id="s802">I me –</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: April ’45, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Yeah, ’45.</span> <span id="s805">And then he said, everybody goes to the train.</span> <span id="s806">And we walk – a-and we – and we were close, and as we were driving, I don’t know how many miles, not too many miles, but the American planes attacked the train.</span> <span id="s807">And they thought maybe an army train, whatever it is, and the SS took off, the guards, and so did we.</span> <span id="s808">We opened the train – one of them was opened, somebody opened ours because every train was opened, and we were scattered in the forest, but it didn’t last too long because after the plane flew out, the SS guard came back and picked us up and walked us back.</span> <span id="s809">Now, we were afraid that they – what we heard about in – in – when we were in – still in – in our home country, that the SS took civilians in the forest and they killed them in the forest.</span> <span id="s810">And so we figured that’s it.</span> <span id="s811">But as we were walking, it was getting darker and we – my brother, myself and my brother-in-law, I told them we gonna jump into the gutter, which was filled up with water, and we swam down about maybe two or three kilometers and we got up and we walked into a farmhouse.</span> <span id="s812">And that’s – we stayed til the liberation – the Americans came in – with the farmer’s approval and knowledge, because he caught us a couple days earlier, that we ate the food what they were serving to the pigs.</span> <span id="s813">And they were making so much noise, they knew that something is wrong in their pig house, because they never made that much noise.</span> <span id="s814">So he caught us, but did not give us up.</span> <span id="s815">He s – he told us what to do and where to stay, til the SS were coming back and looking in all the farmhouses.</span> <span id="s816">And that’s when the American came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: And how many people were in your group?</span> <span id="s818">Just you and your brother and brother-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Uh-huh, so just the three of you –</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: No, only that – in that one, or – there was others, without our knowledge.</span> <span id="s822">You know, there was – well, there was quite a few all around it.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: But were –</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: But in that little house, that was just you and your brother –</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: And my brother, a-and my brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s828">How were you treated by the – the German guards in – in – when you were in camp in Mildorf(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Oh no, the SS – the SS were SS in every guard.</span> <span id="s830">They did not treat you right.</span> <span id="s831">You couldn’t ask question, and for instance, one time I walked to a SS, a what you call a guardhouse, and working on the – on – on the field, and he was eating pudding.</span> <span id="s832">And he looked at me and he just threw the pudding on the grass.</span> <span id="s833">And he didn’t say here take it.</span> <span id="s834">He could have – you know, he could have done that, but that would have been a – a – a goodwill gesture.</span> <span id="s835">And so I walked over there and I put it in my shirt, which was nothing but a cement sack and I walked back to my brother.</span> <span id="s836">And we ate the pudding from my sack.</span> <span id="s837">And – and that – that was something that he – he – it was out of this world for the simple reason, we never had anything in those – in that time that I was in a camp that was sweet, and that was sweet.</span> <span id="s838">And that was just a few days before we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s840">Tell us about when you were liberated, how did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: It’s – it’s ou – there’s no word to describe, nor to tell how does it feel to know that the American – the Americans, you know, were the soldiers, we didn’t know different because we couldn’t understand English.</span> <span id="s842">But luckily there was –</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Can you describe your first encounter with the liberators?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Oh yeah, we went – we wen – we ran to them, we hugged them, and – and – and they, you know, tried to, what you call, restrain us to the point they’re hold it, now hold it, everything is all right, you’re safe.</span> <span id="s845">But the first thing they ask about who is sick, what ch – you know, what – what’s the problem and so on.</span> <span id="s846">And we said food, food, and food.</span> <span id="s847">And that’s what we got – we got from the Americans, plenty food.</span> <span id="s848">We had – matter of fact, we ate to the time that we fell asleep.</span> <span id="s849">We were tired and hungry.</span> <span id="s850">When we were full we just fell asleep over there and – and – and stayed there til the next day, which they always ask us what we want to do.</span> <span id="s851">And I told them that I want to go back to Czechoslovakia to look for my family, because I knew I had a big family.</span> <span id="s852">I knew I couldn’t find my father, my mother, my sister, but I had younger people.</span> <span id="s853">And sure enough, I found my brother, who was a staff captain in the Czechoslovakian army.</span> <span id="s854">Then I heard from him that one of my brother who was a paratrooper in the Czech army was shot in the air after liberated my hometown.</span> <span id="s855">Then I found out that two of my sisters were alive also in my hometown.</span> <span id="s856">And then I have another brother in Budapest.</span> <span id="s857">So I traveled from one end to the other, and I told my younger brother to stay here and I’ll try to get the family together in one place that I know.</span> <span id="s858">And that’s how we did what you call got – get at a family.</span> <span id="s859">I had clothes which I had to give up for my sisters because the Russians arrested my sisters, for whatever reason I don’t know, but I went in there and they wanted to get my –</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Where was it that –</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: That was in my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: And – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: You see, the Russian occupied it.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: [indecipherable] you went back to – to Užhorod?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Oh yes, I had – yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: How long were you with the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Not too long, just a few days, because I wanted to go and find my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: And were you in a camp, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: No, no, no, I stayed a few days in the – with the farmers, and after that they took us into the city, which was mil –</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: The Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: The Americans – which was Mildorf(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: And there we stayed a few days, like I said a train – a – a truck is going –</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: And they gave you clothes, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: I still had the same – still had the same clothes on, they didn’t give us clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: So you were still with your –</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Yeah, that’s right –</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: – prisoner uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: – mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: And what was the farmer’s name [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: I could no – it – I don’t think I knew or I asked, but I wouldn’t remember, definitely I wouldn’t know it, but I was very grateful to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: And so you were with the farmer and the American gave you foods.</span> <span id="s885">And how did you get back to –</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: On top of the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Did the Americans give you money?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: How did you manage –</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: There was no – you couldn’t buy –</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: How did you manage the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: You don’t – y-yo – there was not tickets that time.</span> <span id="s895">That was only strictly army movement.</span> <span id="s896">If you’re going on the train, it was free.</span> <span id="s897">There was no – no – no money exchanged as far as the trains is concerned.</span> <span id="s898">But that was so many people and so many army inside there, the only place you could go on the top and even that was full.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: So from Mildorf(ph) you went back to –</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: We went to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: To Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: With your prison uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: With the prison uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: And from [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: From Munich – from muni – from Munich we took – there was American what you call trucks, were going toward Czechoslovakia, which is actually were going to Pilsen(ph), which is the border town – border town.</span> <span id="s907">Well we got there – we wanted to go to Prague.</span> <span id="s908">From there we got on top of the train and we got to Prague, and the first thing we did, we looked up the Jewish community section, because we knew that there has to be, because I’m not the only one who survived, so some are – they have to get together and find out, or get information how to get where.</span> <span id="s909">And sure enough, we found out that I had a brother in Bratislava, which is the capital city of Slovakia.</span> <span id="s910">And we again, on the train, on top of the train, we got to Czechoslovakia, and they told us where he is, also went to the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: In Bratislava?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: In – in Bratislava and they told us where.</span> <span id="s913">Meanwhile he told us that here is a place that you’re gonna stay while you stay here, and there was food, kitchen, everything else, Jewish people who were survivors or hidden, whatever, there’s – they were cooking food there for everybody.</span> <span id="s914">And we slipped – slept in the apartment there.</span> <span id="s915">But anyway, went to see my brother –</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: And fa – when did you change your prisoner’s clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: In Czechoslo – in – in Bratislava we got clothes, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: In Bratislava, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s919">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Did they give you money as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yes, they gave me money, not too much, but you see, we didn’t have to buy nothing, because everybody was very helpful, even non-Jewish people if you s – if you said you know, what you are and where you come from and all that.</span> <span id="s922">So people helped you if you wanted something.</span> <span id="s923">Some people gave me apple, some people gave me oranges, because they knew I didn’t have a chance to get that.</span> <span id="s924">But anyway, I went to see my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Which brother was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Was that the oldest brother who was a captain in the army, and people ask me who you looking for, and I told them, Herman Klein.</span> <span id="s927">They said oh, th-th – is – is – was a staff captain.</span> <span id="s928">And he said oh, Staff Captain Klein –</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: In which army –</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: – I didn’t know that – Czechoslovakian

id="s938">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Okay</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Anyway, when he came back – but I haven’t seen him for seven years, he didn’t recognize me.</span> <span id="s941">He said, who are you?</span> <span id="s942">And I said, you don’t know me?</span> <span id="s943">And he said no.</span> <span id="s944">I’m your brother.</span> <span id="s945">And he looked at me and he said, which one?</span> <span id="s946">Cause we had – there was eight of us.</span> <span id="s947">And I se – I told him, I said Baylor.</span> <span id="s948">And he started to cry and we all cried, and my younger brother with me over there.</span> <span id="s949">And we had – I mean, excitement i-i-in my body, I could feel like – like the blood just circulating with – with the speed in me, and then he was telling me about it that he heard that I – our two sisters in my hometown and he could not leave his position, even though he could have gone easily there.</span> <span id="s950">So he told me to go and then he said, I heard that there’s one brother in Budapest, and so I went around in my hometown and picked up my two sisters and my brother was in Budapest, I took him – took them over there and then we turn around and went back to Czechoslovakia, into what you call Bratislava because my brother was there.</span> <span id="s951">We stayed –</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Your brother the officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Yeah, and we sta – stayed there a very short time, then we went up to Prague and from Prague they told us that we could have a house if we wanted in the Sudeten, maybe you heard about the Sudeten.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s956">And I got a house what belonged to postmaster in that section, and we stayed in that house until we decided that we want to go back to Germany because we heard that from there they’re going to Israel and what – America.</span> <span id="s957">So we signed on for both ways and I wind up going to Australia.</span> <span id="s958">To the last minute they announced my paper arrived from am – America and it’s – I

to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s978">Which we didn’t care where Israel, just to go, you know, someplace.</span> <span id="s979">And we walked through the – in the border town and they told us they

because after th – after that, at the end of 1950 and then I went into what you call Bremerhaven because I stayed there for awhile and I come out here in 1951 in January.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: So you left from Bremerhaven to America –</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: – in 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: ’51.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: You had applied for a visa, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Oh, that was a big – big story, you see, my brother and my sister, they came in 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Somebody – somebody gave a – a story that, you know, one of the person that I would not let him play with me soccer.</span> <span id="s1050">He got mad and he went to the consul and told them that I was a communist.</span> <span id="s1051">And I asked the consul general, when was I a communist?</span> <span id="s1052">And he said I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1053">I said, before the war I was 14 years old, and after the war I couldn’t be, because I was always – almost like in a prison [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1054">So it took a little while and finally he acknowledged that there was nothing but a false rumor and they gave me the paper to apply again, you know, and – and – and I was within a few – a couple weeks, I was ready to go.</span> <span id="s1055">And then I went to Bremerhaven and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Took the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: – took about 11 – 11 days to come to your country, cause I messed – missed my brother’s wedding.</span> <span id="s1058">I had arrived here Monday and his wedding was Sunday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1060">Okay, so you arrived in America in 19 – when – what month was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: January.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: January 1951.</span> <span id="s1063">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1064">And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Chicago.</span> <span id="s1066">I had my mother’s brothers, two brothers, the one who sponsored us, and that’s where we stayed til everybody got married, and this is why I wa – I’m here, because my cousin is over here, or – or her grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: And how do you feel about all that experience today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: I feel that it is nothing we could have done, but the world as a whole, yes, it could have done.</span> <span id="s1069">And I felt, as I’m speaking in an engagement, that what happened to us, it could happen to other people, because people are fighting not a war, but always a religious war.</span> <span id="s1070">Whatever the reason it is, it happens – it just so happened now in Russia is the same way with the Orthodox Ukrainian, with the Muslims over there, or Yugoslavia, the Serb, and the Muslim.</span> <span id="s1071">So it could and it does happen.</span> <span id="s1072">But as far how I feel about it, I think the world could have stopped it and I feel that partly President Roosevelt was also like against the Jewish people, which I feel it wa – you know, that’s what everybody else feels the same way about it, because he sent the ship back and the Germans figured nobody wanted, so might as well kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: How did you feel during the war about being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: I always felt Jewish, I always was proud that I am Jewish, and I’ve been approach so many time by so many people to convert and I told them that I was born a Jew, I am living as a Jew and I will die as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1075">I’m a very proud Jew.</span> <span id="s1076">I would never change with anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Does the war still affect you now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Do the memories of your experiences still affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Ah, yes, it does affect me many ways.</span> <span id="s1081">First is I was beaten up very badly and so it have the pain, like my knees, which both has to be replaced.</span> <span id="s1082">My hand was broken and my wrist, and my back, like I said, is like a map.</span> <span id="s1083">So that’s was one thing.</span> <span id="s1084">The second, when I’m in a speaking engagement, I feel all if I sleep, I dream sometimes, but I try to get away from it because it – it brings bad memories.</span> <span id="s1085">So – but I have to talk about it for the simple reason I get it – I get it out of my system and I feel a hundred percent better.</span> <span id="s1086">That’s what I’m doing that, in the speaking engagement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: When did you – when were you beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Oh, when I was in the camp, working –</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: They did beat you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Oh yeah, sometimes with a si – a – a – a pick, sometime with a shovel.</span> <span id="s1091">And many times with a gun butt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Where did they beat you?</span> <span id="s1093">Over the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: The back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: On the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1097">And I never said that – that I had muscle spasm in my heart and muscle spasm in my legs.</span> <span id="s1098">I was married almost 17 years that when my wife caught me one time in the kitchen on the floor laying, and she turned on the light and I was actually pale gray.</span> <span id="s1099">So she thought that I have a heart attack, and I said no, I don’t have a heart attack, I have muscle spasm attack in my leg and in my heart.</span> <span id="s1100">And when – I couldn’t breathe, but the leg paralyzed.</span> <span id="s1101">I had to roll off the bed and roll into the kitchen and get the, what you call the circulation back in my legs.</span> <span id="s1102">And it’s even today, I have it for 50 years.</span> <span id="s1103">Almost 50 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: Why did – why did they beat you, for what reason did they beat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: There is no such a thing as a reason for them, for any reason or no reason.</span> <span id="s1106">They just came by and they hit you.</span> <span id="s1107">Maybe I was in his way, or he just wanted to let me know he is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Did you ever tell your children about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1110">When they were in – in – in – around 10 years old, I felt that it’s time for them to know what I went through, that – what they knew, I was in a concentration camp, but not the details and as we watched some films, they were talking in German, they always asked me to translate what they saying, and that’s when I was telling them ho – and what I did and what they did to me.</span> <span id="s1111">And my son, who was very much active and supportive of the museum, and my younger daughter, who is sometimes my spokesperson, she can tell you my story as good as I am because she heard it so many times from me, that if – one time I missed my appointment at home with the TV crew, she was the one who gave my interview, and they accepted.</span> <span id="s1112">That’s – that’s – that’s how well they know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: That’s very good.</span> <span id="s1114">Mr. Klein, did you ever apply or receive reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: A operation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Reparations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: No, I did not apply.</span> <span id="s1118">I – I oh – when I was in Germany one time, I went to the Jewish organization and they gave me a few hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s1119">But in this country when everybody else signed up, I don’t know why, but I just didn’t do it, and – but a couple years ago, I applied for a hardship fund and they gave me 3,000 – no, 5,000 German mark, and – which was about 3,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s1120">That’s the only thing.</span> <span id="s1121">But applied for it now, when they came out again, the German government said that they have 175 million dollars to give away and so I applied for it, but so far I didn’t hear nothing from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to – to tell us, that you have to share with us that we didn’t touch on [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: No, no, I think I just about told everything what had happened to me, wheth-whether major or minor, but that’s – that’s just about what it is.</span> <span id="s1124">I – I think I said everything there is to be said, as far as the story that – you know, that it happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Well thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s1127">And I hope people will hear it and read it, but like I said, I – you know, I have newspaper people come out to my house.</span> <span id="s1128">There was a Passover they came into my house [indecipherable] paper.</span> <span id="s1129">If you want me to send you those things, you know, I’ll be glad to send it to you.</span> <span id="s1130">Also, I have letters from – at least 500 letters from schools, from children, from teachers and all that, that they never knew that that’s happen.</span> <span id="s1131">You know, children don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: You go and you speak in schools, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: And this is – the people ask me, do you hate?</span> <span id="s1134">What – and I ask one time, what’s that?</span> <span id="s1135">They said, you know, you hate, you don’t like him.</span> <span id="s1136">Hate does not exist in our society as far as the Jewish people is, because we [indecipherable] from history, the only thing we teach is remember.</span> <span id="s1137">Because if I hate somebody, is only hurts me.</span> <span id="s1138">It doesn’t hurt the other party.</span> <span id="s1139">He doesn’t know and he doesn’t care.</span> <span id="s1140">So people were so surprised that I don’t hate.</span> <span id="s1141">No, I have a German girl, works in a – an office that I used to be on the board in there and we became very good friends.</span> <span id="s1142">And she knows that, that I don’t hate her.</span> <span id="s1143">A matter of fact, her boss is a German Jew, and – and he accepted her, cause she is a very nice person.</span> <span id="s1144">She was a young girl, she must have been about 12 – 13 years old.</span> <span id="s1145">She could have been responsible, something with her father or – or grandfather, or uncle, or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1146">So you can’t hate everybody.</span> <span id="s1147">And like I said, there was many good Germans too.</span> <span id="s1148">And – and – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Did you know any?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1151">And like even – like I said, after the liberation, and it’s not that they would [indecipherable] they were saying this way, that they were told if they ever help any Jewish person, or any prisoner, they will be killed with their whole family.</span> <span id="s1152">So it was threaten, and let’s face it, that goes the same way like was in Russia.</span> <span id="s1153">Your family was in jeopardy if you said something against the government, the same way in any other country.</span> <span id="s1154">So I would say there was many that, like I said, in our hometown, when we worked with the army, which was army, German army, they were not hateful, they were not bad.</span> <span id="s1155">They never touched us, never.</span> <span id="s1156">And they told us that they don’t want to join the SS because they are nothing but murderers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: When did you find out about your parents, your mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: The next day, when we ask the overseer, the kapos, that what they doing with our parents, and he said your parents are dead.</span> <span id="s1159">If they were old, they are dead the same day, some the next day and it got to us to the point that we were lifeless, like – like no feeling.</span> <span id="s1160">You just walking in the air and – and they said you have to get used to it and you have to go on living.</span> <span id="s1161">Either you gonna live or you gonna die here, you got the choice.</span> <span id="s1162">And we decided to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: In other words, your parents died shortly after arriving at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Arrived there, that’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: You’re wel – [tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: I’d like to thank you very much for giving us your time to do this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: It was an honor and a privilege and I – I – I think it was my job to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: This concludes the interview with William Klein.</span> <span id="s1170">The interviewer was Mira(ph) Hodos(ph) and the interview took place on October 18, 1993 at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span></p> <p><span
