was age 19.</span> <span id="s380">And when the bad news was spread, or announced that Hitler had begun a war with Poland, especially most of the Jewish community, panic began to exist, which we began to worry and think what our future and our next move would be, what to do about.</span> <span id="s381">Unfortunately, we couldn’t do anything about, because the borders were sealed and especially for a Jew to try to cross the German line would have been a suicide, killing.</span> <span id="s382">The Germans, within the next few days, as the war began with Poland, they arrived in our town, very disciplined and very well-educated how to occupy a town, very well-trained how to begin with the Jewish cause...</span></p> <p><span id="s383">JF: Can you give me some details of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">IH: Yes.</span> <span id="s385">Rules and regulations changed about Jews.</span> <span id="s386">Stores closed.</span> <span id="s387">Curfew started.</span> <span id="s388">We couldn’t walk later than a certain time in the evening and not to get out in the morning before a certain time.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">JF: When you said stores closed, do you mean Jewish places of business could no longer operate?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">IH: No.</span> <span id="s391">They start to operate it under a black market, which it couldn’t be open.</span> <span id="s392">A store couldn’t be open.</span> <span id="s393">A Jewish store was, start to become, to get discriminated, not enough by the Germans, but by the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">JF: So it wasn’t officially closed.</span> <span id="s395">It was that it was avoided and boycotted?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">IH: It was avoided to open, boyco-, no, no, it was closed for being scared to open a store, because not then after the Germans would take the advantage, but the Poles began to help themselves to take the advantage what they waited for.</span> <span id="s397">It wasn’t enough time for them to wait, to get the opportunity that they should start it, to take away from the Jews what they have been waiting for many years, and they promised themselves that the time will come whatever a Jew builds with his sweat, and whatever a Jew made for his life, and helped the business community in Poland, then the Polak came and he helped the Germans to destroy all the Jewish efforts that they had put in in so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">JF: What would the Poles have done if they came into a Jewish store?</span> <span id="s399">Would they have confiscated the goods?</span> <span id="s400">Or destroyed the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">IH: They robbed, they robbed, and if they could kill, they killed.</span> <span id="s402">And if they saw even a German did anything to a Jew, they stood by and they had joy.</span> <span id="s403">They were proud.</span> <span id="s404">They had a pride of it, that the Germans are killing Jews or hurting Jews.</span> <span id="s405">Time began very rough.</span> <span id="s406">We start to feel that we are in trouble.</span> <span id="s407">And it is, a lot, a lot to talk, and a lot to explain how the situation was, how things were carried out at the time of the occupation when the Germans occupied.</span> <span id="s408">Orders came out that Jews have to deliver all the radios.</span> <span id="s409">Orders came out that Jews have to start to bring up their gold or diamonds or anything they possess.</span> <span id="s410">Every day was another order posted through town what a Jew has to give up, and bring it in to the Germans.</span> <span id="s411">They formed a Polish militia and they start to catch Jewish young people and elderly people to forced labor in town, to dig trenches, to pick up bombs that they didn’t explode when they threw them on the city before they, when they invaded the city.</span> <span id="s412">All, every little things which was very scary for a Jew, a Jew had to do, under the supervision of the Germans and the Poles, helping them.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">JF: What effect did it have on you personally?</span> <span id="s414">What were you asked to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">IH: Well, I tell you the truth, I was 19.</span> <span id="s416">I didn’t have much sense or maybe understanding or enough leadership at the time to come up with something in how to resist or how to fight.</span> <span id="s417">I learned later that it was formed a resistance organization in our town.</span> <span id="s418">And maybe I wasn’t informed or maybe I couldn’t, but I thought of a way how to escape, and how to try to save lives if I can.</span> <span id="s419">And it came to a time that I looked forward how to do it.</span> <span id="s420">Each time they rounded up Jews in town, if they rounded them up in Bendin, I ran to the other city where my mother lived.</span> <span id="s421">If they start to round up over there, I start to escape from one town to the other, to avoid a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">JF: What do you mean you rounded up Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">IH: They rounded up Jews, for slave labor.</span></p>

that you were not, at that time, you were not aware of the resistance, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">IH: I wasn’t aware of their forming a resistance in this city or surrounding towns, but I learned later that the resistance was formed.</span> <span id="s437">Unfortunately I couldn’t do much, but it was formed with the intention to resist Germany.</span> <span id="s438">And they proved that later, that the Warsaw Ghetto did it, and other cities maybe.</span> <span id="s439">And we had a very strong resistance, especially in Bendin, because the city was predominantly Jewish, most, 95%.</span> <span id="s440">Well it came to a point that I was caught by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">JF: How long after the invasion was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">IH: I was caught by the Germans in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">JF: December of...</span></p> <p><span id="s444">IH: December.</span> <span id="s445">I was trying to finagle and escape as much as I

by shovel.</span> <span id="s456">I was 19, and had many other youngsters with me from the same town, from other towns.</span> <span id="s457">And I started to, I began to realize that it comes to a rough future.</span> <span id="s458">They didn’t have yet the concentration camps ready.</span> <span id="s459">Probably those years they start to build them.</span> <span id="s460">Germany had concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">JF: Did you know that, at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">IH: That Germany had, because we had a lot of German Jews coming into Poland.</span> <span id="s463">Before the invasion, German Jews of Polish descent, 1939, 1938, 1937, before the invasion yet of Poland, they only tried to tell the Jewish people in Germany, “But we don’t mean yet you [born in] Germany.</span> <span id="s464">Let’s try to start with the Jews that they weren’t born, they have Polish citizenship or French citizenship.”</span> <span id="s465">And

<span id="s471">But still, the German Jewish, the German Jew was naive those years.</span> <span id="s472">They didn’t, still they couldn’t get it through their heads what’s going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">JF: You think that the Polish Jews were more realistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">IH: Right.</span> <span id="s475">We were more politically in activities, during the years before Hitler, with the kibbutzim in Poland, with all the activities, with Palestine sending Jews on aliyah to Israel for make a kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s476">In Poland we were more aware than the German Jew believed, what it might happen, with Hitler, what it did happen.</span> <span id="s477">Because the German Jew thought that their skin as a German Jew will be saved.</span> <span id="s478">It will never happen to them.</span> <span id="s479">And, well, but the German Jews, would start to be, when I was already in, on a coal mine, I foreseen a little bit to

mattresses.</span> <span id="s487">We didn’t have the bunks.</span> <span id="s488">I don’t think that the formation of those things began before 1940.</span> <span id="s489">The building the concentration camps, because they did prepare already concentration camps.</span> <span id="s490">But I wasn’t aware much of it, what’s gonna happen, but I felt that, that it’s a beginning of a

of going.</span> <span id="s595">And they already escaped from town.</span> <span id="s596">It was bad.</span> <span id="s597">Then we went to Prsemy and the first welcome from the Russians was a prison.</span> <span id="s598">Wet [pause].</span></p> <p><span id="s599">JF: In the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">IH: In the town of Prsemy they took us into a prison, the Russians.</span>

having friends in there from town, sitting in there, behind the bars.</span> <span id="s611">And even you thought that you’re going to fall into the Russian hands, you’re going to try to tell them that, “Maybe I will be safe if I tell them that I was a Communist in Poland.</span> <span id="s612">So maybe he’ll save my life.”</span> <span id="s613">So already a friend of mine said, “Listen, don’t ever tell them that you were a Communist.”</span> <span id="s614">He hollered it out to me in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s615">“Don’t you ever tell them that you were a Communist.</span> <span

and how to interrogate.</span> <span id="s631">But I already, grabbed me and said, “I am a Communist.”</span> <span id="s632">This side, I’m not, this side.</span> <span id="s633">But the first thing in prison, when we met that Russian soldier, the dirt and the unpleasantness of their behavior was outrageous.</span> <span id="s634">A plague became upon us in prison.</span> <span id="s635">And I want it to be recorded that lice alive ate us.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">JF: Lice ate you alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">IH: Lice ate us alive in prison.</span> <span id="s638">This was Russia already.</span> <span id="s639">We were taught that we will be saved.</span> <span id="s640">Running away from one disaster, we came into another sort of a disaster.</span> <span id="s641">I didn’t say I was a Communist, because I never was and I never believed in it, in their cause and their laws.</span> <span id="s642">As I said before, I mentioned in my previous report that I was a Zionist and raised within the Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s643">But you have to start to feel the ways they live already.</span> <span id="s644">They were in Polish territory, and they let us

was questioned only but not too much.</span> <span id="s648">But I said I wasn’t a Communist.</span> <span id="s649">“And what did your father do?”</span> <span id="s650">I said, “My father was a tailor.”</span> <span id="s651">“Is your father living?”</span> <span id="s652">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s653">And they said, “O.K.”</span></p> <p><span id="s654">JF: So, in other words, they tended to believe the people who did not pretend to be a Communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">IH: Right.</span> <span id="s656">To be a Communist.</span> <span id="s657">That they hear, they knew,

Russian soldiers, a little business here.</span> <span id="s694">It’s all illegal, all not to be caught.</span> <span id="s695">If we were caught.</span> <span id="s696">Well, people start to register

and here I see myself in an elevator going down for miles, three miles beneath the surface.</span> <span id="s716">And give me a coal crusher with a little shovel, and here is your hole, which is was already digged out for us to shovel it.</span> <span id="s717">And it happened I dropped mine, one of my galoshes that were given to me.</span> <span id="s718">And I moved out.</span> <span id="s719">And I says, “I don’t want to go back.</span> <span id="s720">Kill me all right.”</span> <span id="s721">So they put me up to mark the wagons which they came out.”</span></p> <p><span id="s722">JF: So you never did go down the elevator?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">IH: I was down, but I never start to dig the coal the proper way, the way I, they told me, because I start to get a little bit more, how do they express themselves, guts, to start to resist, to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">IH: Not to make any emotional things, but

fight me to go, you know, but I resisted and I says, “No, not, just I will not.”</span> <span id="s734">I says, “Do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s735">Do you want to kill me?”</span> <span
