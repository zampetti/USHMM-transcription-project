id="s7">This is side A of tape number one.</span> <span id="s8">Okay, Mrs. Green, will you please tell me your name as it was at birth and your date of birth and the place where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Answer: My name is, was, Sylvia Farber.</span> <span id="s10">I was born in Karlsruhe am Rhine, April 14, 1924.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: And Karlsruhe am Rhine was in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: In Baden, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: And will you tell me something your parents and let’s start with your father, what was his family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: He was one of seven children and they were married in 1919, they were married in Poland and then they moved to Germany right away, and they lived in Stuttgart and my brother was born in 1920 in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s15">And I don’t know when they moved to Karlsruhe, I was born in Karlsruhe in ‘24, so between ‘20 and ‘24 they moved, I don’t know the exact date.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: And your father’s, your father’s family, were they middle-class, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Yeah, my dad’s, what I have been told, I didn’t know too many of them except the ones whom were living in Germany, some stayed in Poland.</span> <span id="s18">He was the baby and when my dad was born, his oldest brother already had children the age of my father and they were in the United States.</span> <span id="s19">And some of them moved to Karlsruhe, some of them, his sister lived in Nuremberg and she would come and visit.</span> <span id="s20">And they had a dairy store, dairy, eggs and butter and my dad, that was my dad’s job in Karlsruhe.</span> <span id="s21">It was lucky, my mother always said I was the lucky child because the day I was born my dad got that job.</span> <span id="s22">He was the manager of the dairy department in a wholesale grocery store, and he had this job until he was deported to Poland in 1938.</span> <span id="s23">And on the same day my brother came home with a horse shoe and that’s supposed to be luck also.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: So your father was born where?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: In Dukla, in Poland, and I’ve never been there, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And he moved to Germany in?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Well, in 1919 when they married.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Did they marry before they had come to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yeah, 1919, they married in Chrzanow where my mother was from and I think it was a match, probably, arranged.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: What was your mother’s family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: They were very poor, there were ten children and my grandfather had a tailor shop, tailoring shop, and there hardly was any food on the table and my mother was the second oldest girl, the first one was a boy.</span> <span id="s32">So my mother had to raise all the younger children so she never had a childhood.</span> <span id="s33">She said she never played with children.</span> <span id="s34">They had a cradle made out of wood and she would look out the window and children were on the sidewalk playing hopscotch and she participated then, she was in an apartment upstairs and many times the cradle was turned upside down because she got so excited, but she never had time to really play with children, raising the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s35">My grandfather, I only saw him once or twice in my life.</span> <span id="s36">To me, he was a big man with a long beard, Orthodox, and my mother said that he never held any of the children on his lap, but the grandchildren he did.</span> <span id="s37">That one time we went to visit, I was on his lap and I braided his beard and my mother just stood there, she didn’t believe that he let me do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Was your family very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Yeah, they were Orthodox, but modern Orthodox.</span> <span id="s40">My dad was clean-shaven and my mother did not wear a wig, they were modern Orthodox, but very observing, Sabbath and all the holidays.</span> <span id="s41">When my dad worked, well the name was Pfankuch, he never had a vacation all his life because he didn’t work on any Jewish holidays and we got a lot of holidays, so this was taken off as vacation.</span> <span id="s42">So my mother used to take us places or, also, we children, obvious, every summer you had to get out of the city, like otherwise you would die it seems like.</span> <span id="s43">The New Yorkers do that too, don’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Mmm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: And, well, it was camps we used to go to and also I was very athletic and on weekends we used to train and then I also belonged to the Mizrachi, which is a orthodox Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s46">And I think I was about five or six when I joined, and we had camps for about two weeks and then we had conclaves.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: And you had one sibling, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Two, my brother who is four years older and myself.</span> <span id="s49">My mother always said she only wanted two children, she raised such a large family before that that’s all she wanted and that’s all she had was two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: When was your brother born?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: June, wait a minute, June the 2nd because my son was born June the 4th, June 2, 1920, he was born in Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Were you close with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: As children we were close in a way, but boys were raised entirely different than girls.</span> <span id="s54">A girl just had to smile and look pretty, that’s all that mattered, and my brother had to be educated, so he didn’t have a childhood.</span> <span id="s55">My dad wanted him to be a rabbi, is that all right the way I’m holding that now?</span> <span id="s56">My dad wanted him to be a rabbi, my mother wanted him to be a college professor, so he was educated for both.</span> <span id="s57">So I was schooled, we had school, you went to school from eight till 12 and you went back in the afternoon from two till four, or from eight till one and three till five.</span> <span id="s58">Whenever he got out of school, he had to go to Hebrew school, every day.</span> <span id="s59">So he didn’t have much of a childhood either.</span> <span id="s60">And it was really interesting, after we met again after the war, he was married and I was married and so we talked about our parents and about our childhood, and the interesting part was the way I talked about our parents was not the same way he talked about his parents, which were our parents, you know.</span> <span id="s61">So he told me, he said, “I was so jealous of you.”</span> <span id="s62">And I said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s63">I said, “I was so jealous of you, you were so brilliant.”</span> <span id="s64">And he said, “I had to be.</span> <span id="s65">I had to study all the time, I had no childhood and you had friends.”</span> <span id="s66">He didn’t have any friends.</span> <span id="s67">“You always had friends, you always were playing or going places, doing things.”</span> <span id="s68">And it was really interesting, we were jealous of each other.</span> <span id="s69">But it worked out well, I mean we got it out of our system and we didn’t carry any grudges.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: So your parents didn’t, weren’t particularly interested in your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: I was not a dumbbell, I didn’t have to work very hard and I brought home A’s and B’s, without any sweat.</span> <span id="s72">And he had to bring home A’s, B’s were not good enough.</span> <span id="s73">And, well, that’s what I said, all you had to do was smile and you had to associate with the people they approved of.</span> <span id="s74">And you couldn’t go with children they didn’t approve—especially my mother.</span> <span id="s75">My dad was a hard-working man.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: You mentioned that you had a lot of friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes, I always had a lot of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Were they friends from school, or from?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Well, at the beginning I had Gentile friends, but then when Hitler came to power, they got sparse, less and less friends.</span> <span id="s80">And it’s really interesting you asking that, I still remember Fritz Öler, we were raised together and I loved Fritz as much as I liked my brother, loved my brother Bernard.</span> <span id="s81">And then when Hitler came to power, he disappeared.</span> <span id="s82">If we passed on the street, he wouldn’t see me.</span> <span id="s83">If I passed on the street when it was dark, at that time we used to go out in the evening, at the beginning, later on we didn’t go out too much in the evenings, he would look, stare at you like no recognition, but then he would take his hand and wave at you in the back, so he wouldn’t been seen.</span> <span id="s84">So but that really hurt, because in a way I knew that the reason for it because I was a Jew, but it’s very hard for children to accept.</span> <span id="s85">You, you take it personally.</span> <span id="s86">Because I would cry, I came home and I saw some of the girls I used to play with and they run away.</span> <span id="s87">“Why doesn’t she like me any more?</span> <span id="s88">I haven’t done anything to her.”</span> <span id="s89">That’s hard.</span> <span id="s90">And they probably went home and talked to their parents, also, how bad they felt, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Do you remember, were those the first incidents that made you realize that you were somehow different than these other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: When we were kicked out of school.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: I think it was the beginning of the fifth grade because I was supposed to have gone to the gymnasium also, like my brother did, but there were articles in the paper that they building a new school for handicapped children in Frankfurt am Main and this was a very dilapidated school, I mean nowadays it’d be condemned, and that’s the school they gave us.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: What year would that have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Let me just think, I was born in ‘24, I started school in ‘30, it might have been ‘35, oh, the dates are getting dimmer, they really are.</span> <span id="s97">I mean, what happened you remember, but to remember the exact date, because I started at such a young age and so many things happened until ‘45, and nothing was good really.</span> <span id="s98">So, but what they didn’t know, we got a much better education than we did in public school because they wouldn’t let Jewish college professors teach, so we got the college professors to teach us.</span> <span id="s99">So we benefited from it, we really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: How far did you have to travel to go to school every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: I didn’t have to travel, it was within walking distance, in the radius of so many miles, they had a school close by and we weren’t bussed at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Was your family afraid when Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Well, I saw Hitler many times, I was a nosy child and whenever he came, I would not go down to see him in my neighborhood because everybody knew I was a Jew, I would go blocks and blocks out of my way and, where they didn’t know me, and I was standing in the front row, I was just fascinated by him, it was just like he hypnotized people.</span> <span id="s104">You know, I usually talk with my hands!</span> <span id="s105">It’s hard.</span> <span id="s106">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s107">Well, I would always be in the front row, many blocks away from where I lived, and I was there in the front row with everybody everybody else, and everybody yelling, “Heil Hitler!”</span> <span id="s108">Here, he always came in a convertible and, naturally, he would hold his hand on the belt, I can close my eyes and see him, “Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler,” and people just went crazy screaming, you know.</span> <span id="s109">And they all were running and I was right there with them.</span> <span id="s110">And he wouldn’t let them get too close and then he just would take his hands, slowly, and everybody would go back.</span> <span id="s111">It’s just like you were hypnotized, you know?</span> <span id="s112">So this was ‘33, but really, ‘32, already it started.</span> <span id="s113">There were Communist parties, Nazi parties, Socialist parties, and they always scheduled marches about the same time and there always, somehow there was a shooting going on, and they yelling and they used to hit each other.</span> <span id="s114">And my mother always used to grab my hand and, “Let’s go upstairs, let’s go upstairs.”</span> <span id="s115">“No, I want to see what goes on!”</span> <span id="s116">In ‘32, you know, I was eight years old, I was nosy.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: What did you think when you were watching these, these speeches and Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: I don’t know, I really don’t, I just was fascinated by that whole thing, it was just like everybody was hypnotized.</span> <span id="s119">And his speeches weren’t, he didn’t say anything, he said three, four words, and then yell, everybody yelled, “Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler.”</span> <span id="s120">I don’t know, as a child, the one thing I remember, he’s… always when he came to Karlsruhe, it was a pretty good sized town at that time, the size of Louisville, he would stay in the Hotel Germania, and every time I passed that hotel, I was going to stay there someday.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: So you admired him a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: I don’t know, you kind of fascinated until, you know, then I didn’t admire him anymore.</span> <span id="s123">I mean, what came afterwards, my mother always said, “It can’t get any worse.</span> <span id="s124">It can’t get any worse.”</span> <span id="s125">Like when they deported my dad to Poland in ‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Would you tell me a little more about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: One night we were home, Mother wasn’t feeling well and she already was in bed, and the doorbell rang, they always were very noisy and always yelling and always rushing, and they always rushed, you know, and they were yelling, “Open that door!</span> <span id="s128">Open that door!”</span> <span id="s129">And they kicked the door.</span> <span id="s130">So my dad went to the door and they came in and they said, “Empty your pockets.”</span> <span id="s131">And my dad said, “Why?</span> <span id="s132">I haven’t done anything.”</span> <span id="s133">He was at work that day, he came home from work.</span> <span id="s134">“Well, just empty your pockets.</span> <span id="s135">And you do as we tell you and the sooner you do it, the sooner you’ll be home.”</span> <span id="s136">And they took my dad away, they pocket all his belongings and his favorite watch, I don’t remember who gave him that watch, it was a gold watch, it was a pocket watch, that was the style at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Where you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yes, I was there, I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: My mother was there and that night my father came home from Würzburg, it was a teacher’s college, and we had a whistle, and I don’t remember it now, that when we whistled downstairs we knew it was one or the other.</span> <span id="s141">I mean, my parents knew, my mother knew, middle in the night we heard that whistle, and it was my brother came home, that was in ‘38.</span> <span id="s142">So after they deported my dad to the Polish border, they had some kind of agreement that if any Jew in Germany was not in Poland for the last ten years, that they are going to make them staatenlos, that you didn’t belong anywheres, you had no country.</span> <span id="s143">And Germany did not want to get stuck… your back hurts?</span> <span id="s144">It’s okay.</span> <span id="s145">Germany did not want to get stuck with the people without a country, so that’s why they pushed them to the border and the Polacks were shooting and the Germans were shooting and somehow they came to an agreement.</span> <span id="s146">Now, I was not there, this was told to me afterwards by my dad that, then they finally let them there, let them in.</span> <span id="s147">So then after ‘38, this was October, in November they had Crystal Night.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Before we talk about Crystal Night, could you just tell me a little bit about how your mother and you and your brother dealt with the, the absence of your father immediately after he was deported.</span> <span id="s149">How did you find out where he had gone and…</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: You know, I don’t remember that…</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: …did you expect him to come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No, I didn’t expect him to come back, because they called a meeting to all the wives of Polish citizens and my mother was sick in bed, I think this was sometime in ‘39, that was already after Crystal Night, and we were told to be at the police station, that there is gonna be a meeting and we have to be there, if we not gonna be there, then they were gonna arrest us.</span> <span id="s153">So my mother was sick and she sent me.</span> <span id="s154">So I went there and when they called my mother’s name, I stood up and apologized that my mother couldn’t be here, but I’m here and I will give her the message, whatever the meeting is about.</span> <span id="s155">He yelled at me to come forward, he yelled so hard and I was a child, you know I was 15 years old and we were children at 15, not, not the children, 15 seemed like they’re very grown up, but we were not, we were children.</span> <span id="s156">I was shaking from head to toe, he gave me a pencil to sign my mother’s name, that we had to leave Germany by August ‘39, or we were gonna be arrested.</span> <span id="s157">Well, I couldn’t hold the pencil, my hand was just shaking, so he took his gun out and put it to my temple.</span> <span id="s158">And I really don’t remember whether I signed the name or I put the X mark—he was satisfied, so maybe I signed the name, I don’t remember what I did, he seemed to be satisfied.</span> <span id="s159">And we left, we left in August of ‘39, the beginning of August and they followed us, September, beginning of September, the Second World War started.</span> <span id="s160">That’s when they came, invaded Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: So after your father was deported…</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: …you, you weren’t really sure where he had gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yes, we knew that he, he, that they had deported him to Poland.</span> <span id="s165">And my mother had a sister in Krakow and we were pretty sure that’s where he was headed.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: And what happened in those months before that, before you left when you weren’t with your father?</span> <span id="s167">Did you have any word, or what did you and your mother. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: I don’t remember how my mother found out, I couldn’t tell you that, there was so much going on with me, also.</span> <span id="s169">Like, the Jewish Welfare Office was trying to get one child out of every Jewish family and I was designated to go to England, they found foster homes.</span> <span id="s170">And, but then, they were gonna round up the young men and my mother made me go to the Jewish Welfare Office and she told me to really make a scene and cry that I don’t want to go to England, I want to go with my mother and, evidently, they bought it and I really was scared, you know, I was crying, I was scared.</span> <span id="s171">Also, so, then they sent my brother instead.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Is that what your mother wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: That’s what my mother wanted.</span> <span id="s174">Because they were not, they were not doing anything to the girls but they were already taking the young men to Dachau, so she wanted him out the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: What do you remember about Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Crystal Night, it was wild.</span> <span id="s177">We didn’t go out and, excuse me, got the hair right on your eye, I’m looking at you, okay.</span> <span id="s178">They banged at the door and my mother yelled, “We don’t have any men here in the house.</span> <span id="s179">You deported my husband.”</span> <span id="s180">And my brother hid in the apartment, I don’t know, I think in a closet or something, bathroom.</span> <span id="s181">And we didn’t open the door.</span> <span id="s182">And we screamed and they screamed, and then they went away.</span> <span id="s183">Several times they came that night, then later on we found out they burned the synagogues, they burned the Torahs, they took the rabbi and set his beard on fire and this was afterwards.</span> <span id="s184">I didn’t, we did not go out, we were too scared to go out.</span> <span id="s185">This was November, ‘38.</span> <span id="s186">It was horrible, it really, it was horrible when they took my father away, but they just went crazy, they really did.</span> <span id="s187">We lived on Main Street and there was so much yelling going on.</span> <span id="s188">I stood behind a curtain just to see something and then they broke all the glass in the Jewish stores and there were quite a few Jewish stores on Main Street.</span> <span id="s189">They went berzerk.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Did your mother have any plans to leave Karlsruhe at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Well, you need an affidavit to come to the United States and my aunt Mina, the one I came to the United States with, had a brother-in-law in Lexington, Kentucky.</span> <span id="s192">And after we were in Poland, we lived in the same apartment house my aunt lived in and we talked, if somebody was going to survive that, to get in touch with Leon Urbach and there was a street, but I didn’t remember it when I wrote to them, and that’s how we were gonna be reunited.</span> <span id="s193">So, what was the question you asked?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: I asked if your mother had plans to leave Karlsruhe.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yeah, yeah, Urbach sent us an affidavit, but it was already too late, because Hitler went into Austria, that was in ‘38.</span> <span id="s196">And the Austrian quota, you see, there was a quota, German citizen, Polish citizen, Austrian citizen, you had to wait, you got a number, so they raised the Austrian quota for the Jews get out of Austria, so we couldn’t get out, if maybe another six months we could have made it, but I guess it wasn’t meant to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: And you didn’t have any contact with your father at all until. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Until we met again, we were reunited in Krakow, we had to leave in ‘39, August ‘39, and we were reunited with my dad and they rented a small apartment and. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Let’s go back to just after you had found out that you were, you and your mother, you had signed a form and you knew that you were to be leaving…</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: …Germany.</span> <span id="s202">What did you do, how long did it take for you to be deported, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: I worked in the Jewish Welfare Office, I was like a gopher, you know, taking papers, there were Jewish offices in different. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s204">[end of side one of tape 1 of 3] Beginning of side B, Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Can you understand it?</span> <span id="s206">I talk with a very heavy accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: You can understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Yes, it’s fine.</span> <span id="s210">This is tape one, side B of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green.</span> <span id="s211">And Mrs. Green, if you would just repeat from the beginning, the question about what you did after you had signed that affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: I worked in the Jewish Welfare Office and, like gopher, you know, taking papers, they had offices in different parts of town.</span> <span id="s213">And also, when the switchboard operator went to lunch, I would take over for a very short time, and that was one job I hated.</span> <span id="s214">I was a nervous wreck, always thought I was going to connect the wrong people.</span> <span id="s215">So, I don’t know, that’s just about all I remember what happened, I don’t know how else I passed the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: How long did it take until you actually had to leave Germany because of that paper that was signed?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: There was, well, we had to leave, I think they gave you a few months to get ready.</span> <span id="s218">And well, my brother, he, we had like an overseas trunk and, and he packed everything, and it was shipped to Poland and the bedroom was shipped to Poland.</span> <span id="s219">We didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s220">So, we left by August, beginning of August, you just had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Were you on a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s223">We stopped by, we stopped off in Berlin, my brother went to England the same night my mother and I caught a train to Poland, but we stopped off in Berlin.</span> <span id="s224">My mother wanted me to talk to the American Consulate and she thought I could do better, you know, to talk to ‘em, that maybe we could get out and come to America.</span> <span id="s225">I didn’t even get to see the Consulate in Berlin.</span> <span id="s226">I just talked to the secretary or somebody at the front desk, maybe some other people had the same idea, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: How long did the trip take?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: I know it was a overnight trip, but I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s229">It’s very hard to remember everything, it was such a long period of time.</span> <span id="s230">Like I told you when I talked over the telephone to you, I started right from the beginning with him, it was ‘33 until ‘45, that’s 12 years, that’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Did you know where you were headed?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Poland, yes, we were headed to Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: By choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Well, we had to leave Germany, yeah, but by choice, excuse me.</span> <span id="s235">After we crossed the border, it was our choice to go to Krakow because my aunt lived in Krakow.</span> <span id="s236">If we had somebody in Warsaw, maybe we would have gone to Warsaw, but we didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s237">My mother was born in a little town near Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: So she, you mentioned that she thought that was where your father would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s240">And I don’t remember whether she knew or she thought he would be there because my aunts, my aunt lived in Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Was that your father’s sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: No, my mother’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Do you remember what happened when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s245">We went on a vacation, my aunt Mina was on a vacation, vacation in Jordanow, it was a vacation place, and we went there for a whole week.</span> <span id="s246">I even got a picture of that.</span> <span id="s247">And my dad came or he was there, also.</span> <span id="s248">And it was great, I just thought “Well now, everything is going to go get back to normal,” and since they rented an apartment, that everything is going to be okay now, we were together and my brother was in England, so, but we were wrong, we really were wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Do you remember meeting with your father again, being reunited?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Well, not exactly.</span> <span id="s251">I don’t know whether, on the picture, he was in Jordanow with us, so I don’t know whether he was on vacation with my aunt or he came to Jordanow, it was not very far from Krakow, it was a vacation place.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Where did you live in Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: First we lived with my aunt, can’t remember the name of that street, but as soon as they start bombing Krakow, we were in the basement and the house across the street got bombed.</span> <span id="s254">In middle in the night, we just took sheets and dumped stuff in there, clothes and whatever, and we walked all the way to Sebastiana [ph], number nine, that was a place where we rent an apartment afterwards, I don’t remember the first address.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: So it was the… you and your mother and your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: My father, all three of us.</span> <span id="s257">And then we were not the only ones, because my aunt lived in that apartment, and then some other sisters came from the country.</span> <span id="s258">And at the beginning, we all stayed at my aunt’s place.</span> <span id="s259">And the children slept on the floor, and the adults used the beds.</span> <span id="s260">And my mother wouldn’t let me sleep on the floor, she thought I was too good to sleep on the floor, and I was just dying to sleep on the floor with the other kids.</span> <span id="s261">Seems like such a silly thing to remember, you know?</span> <span id="s262">But I guess it must have made an impression on me at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: What did you do with your days?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Well, this was ‘39, September, ‘39, in 1940, just a few months, then we had to sweep the streets, we had to wear armbands, that was in 1940.</span> <span id="s265">We had to, even if it rained, we had to sweep the streets.</span> <span id="s266">We had to clean barracks, we scrubbed the barracks on our knees, we carried railroad tracks, all in 1940, but we still lived in the apartment.</span> <span id="s267">We had to meet in the mornings.</span> <span id="s268">And my trouble was, I was very tall, I was five-eight, and they would line us up, the tallest in the middle and then the shorter ones and shorter ones, and I really got the heavy load.</span> <span id="s269">And they were not very kind to us when we cleaned the barracks, I mean they would yell and scream, or kick, or scare us they were gonna shoot us, but in the evening, after we went back, my mother always had a hot meal for us and I can hear my mama say, “It’s not gonna get any worse, it’s not gonna get any worse.”</span> <span id="s270">And all during the war, I can hear her say, “It’s not gonna get any worse,” but it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: So you were working with other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: With other children, yeah.</span> <span id="s273">There was 40, I was 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Did your mother or father work?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: No, no, they didn’t work.</span> <span id="s276">I don’t know whether they didn’t ask them to work, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s277">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: And did you have any sort of education, even informal, during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: How many hours a day did you have to work this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: I don’t know, from morning till it got dark?</span> <span id="s282">But that hot meal sure tasted good, it really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Did you have weekends free?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I don’t remember, I don’t think so, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s285">Do you know, came to a point you were like a zombie, you only did what you supposed to do, more later on even.</span> <span id="s286">And you didn’t question it, you just did it.</span> <span id="s287">Worst thing really happened to me was, my parents and my aunt always said, “Sylvia, if Germans are around, never speak German.</span> <span id="s288">You don’t want them to know that you German.”</span> <span id="s289">So I spoke Polish, naturally with an accent.</span> <span id="s290">And there was a German, we were carrying railroad tracks and loading them on trucks, so I did not know and I was talking German to another German Jew, he came up and he said, “You speak with a Badenzer,” Baden, it’s like the state of Baden, like Kentucky, you know?</span> <span id="s291">But then the accent, “You speak exactly like I do,” and he was the meanest thing, he would scream, he always sit on top of the truck and yell at us.</span> <span id="s292">And we never did anything right, and always had the gun, was going to shoot, and he said, “Where are you from?”</span> <span id="s293">And I had to tell him, I said, “Karlsruhe am Rhine.”</span> <span id="s294">“I’m from Karlsruhe am Rhine.</span> <span id="s295">You come on and you sit on the truck,” and he gave me his lunch, and he made everybody watch.</span> <span id="s296">I couldn’t swallow, I could, I mean my throat closed up, you know?</span> <span id="s297">And he was yelling at me, “You eat.</span> <span id="s298">You eat.”</span> <span id="s299">I don’t know whether he wanted me to have his lunch or he did it out of meanness or maybe he thought he was helping me, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s300">But I sure couldn’t swallow, it just got, got stuck in my throat.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Did you have to march a long way?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Oh, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s303">You marched there, you had a meeting point and you marched, and you marched home that night.</span> <span id="s304">And you had to wear your armband.</span> <span id="s305">And I don’t understand, some people say they, they wore a armband with a yellow star which said Juden there.</span> <span id="s306">We had the blue star, a white armband, in Krakow.</span> <span id="s307">That’s what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Do you remember, were you able to make any friends, or was there just no time?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Well, we really couldn’t talk too much because we were watched so closely.</span> <span id="s310">You made friends and you didn’t make friends.</span> <span id="s311">One day you had friends, the next day they were gone.</span> <span id="s312">I was fortunate that I was with my aunt constantly and we talked a lot.</span> <span id="s313">And especially at night, you know, after we got together, we talked a lot.</span> <span id="s314">But you couldn’t have friends because. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Did you find any ways to have fun?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Huh?</span> <span id="s317">Fun?</span> <span id="s318">Yeah, you know how I had fun?</span> <span id="s319">To aggravate the Germans.</span> <span id="s320">That was our fun.</span> <span id="s321">We would laugh so hard where we felt like crying.</span> <span id="s322">And they could not understand and then we, we would tell jokes, and we would laugh, really we didn’t feel like laughing, but we did laugh, and that just about killed them.</span> <span id="s323">“My God, you should be crying there, what are you laughing?”</span> <span id="s324">You know.</span> <span id="s325">But if they got closer to you, you really shut up and you didn’t look at ‘em, you turned your head.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Did you ever see them hit any, anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s328">Some hit people, I saw ‘em kill people, I saw ‘em kill babies and… for no reason.</span> <span id="s329">Really sometimes you wonder how they could live with themselves, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s330">I think a lot of them were drunk, I really do.</span> <span id="s331">I did not realize that until I saw “Schindler’s List,” then I saw there, I mean they were drinking, I knew Goeth, now I’m getting ahead of myself already.</span> <span id="s332">But they must have been drunk because they were yelling, yelling, yelling, my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: So you kept on working like this, until…</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Like that, day after day, whatever they asked me to do, I did.</span> <span id="s335">And then ‘41 was the ghetto.</span> <span id="s336">We were notified we had to leave.</span> <span id="s337">So like in “Schindler’s List,” we grabbed a bedsheet again, we dumped everything in there, and a suitcase, and you walked.</span> <span id="s338">And like I told you on the phone, when I saw that “Schindler’s List,” I was looking for myself in there because it was so real, it, to me it was a documentary, it was not just a movie.</span> <span id="s339">I was looking for my relatives, I was looking for my parents, I was looking for myself.</span> <span id="s340">And that was no picnic, five, six people in a little apartment where you barely had room even to sleep on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Was it just your family or. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: My family and my relatives, and then that got smaller all the time.</span> <span id="s343">I mean, one day, well, I’m getting ahead again, it’s… Well, we did the same thing there, we would march to work outside the ghetto and did the same thing, we shoveled snow, we washed the streets, and the same yelling.</span> <span id="s344">There were different faces of… watching us, but it seemed like they were all the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: So you were doing the same. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: The same thing until ‘42, we got the job, my aunt got the job in Kabelwerk work and we marched from the ghetto to Kabelwerk every morning, it’s—was a cable factory, and there were different departments there.</span> <span id="s347">I had to cover cables, I was in charge of ten machines and my aunt, they made, what did she do?</span> <span id="s348">Oh, I can’t think of that word, you plug it in, you know what I’m talking about, a cord you plug in, those what do you call them?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Extension cord?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Extension cord?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Yeah, something like that, but you plug it in in outlets like, what’s it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Plug?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Plug, okay, well she put those together, my aunt, it was a different department she worked in.</span> <span id="s355">And from morning we marched with a O.D. man [ph], it was a Jewish police and then we went back again.</span> <span id="s356">And then, I think it was towards end of ‘42, then we were concentrated in Plaszow, Patkusz [ph] Plaszow, the concentration camp, and we went to work to Kabelwerk from Plaszow.</span> <span id="s357">And I only saw my parents twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Before, would you tell me about Plaszow, will you describe your living quarters to me, I know you said you, you were in very cramped conditions, was, was it cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Well, it was always cold.</span> <span id="s360">And I don’t know what I looked like, there was no mirror, you know, but I looked at my aunt and I knew what I looked like: a skeleton.</span> <span id="s361">We were always cold, all we wore were prison garb and it was in the wintertime, naturally you were cold and Poland is cold.</span> <span id="s362">And then you had to stand appell, they would count you and count you, they wanted to make sure that a half a person wasn’t missing or something, sometimes it was for hours just of meanness, till they got bored with it.</span> <span id="s363">The quarters, they were barracks, and with wooden slats and you just, there were a bottom one, I think they were like a bunk, like a bunk, you couldn’t call it bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: This is in Plaszow?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: In Plaszow.</span> <span id="s366">Patkush Plaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: What about in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: In the ghetto was apartments, still apartments, but overcrowded.</span> <span id="s369">Because the ghetto, at one time, people lived there, before the ghetto, they were homes, you know.</span> <span id="s370">I mean, apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: And you, you, did you manage to get enough to eat during that time that you were in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Probably I did, I don’t know, we got a meal in Kabelwerk, the interesting thing was that the first time, I always ate kosher and when I started working in Kabelwerk, they served us meals and it was the same meal the Gentile workers got, so that wasn’t that bad because it had a lot of vegetables in there, I don’t remember about meat now, maybe it did.</span> <span id="s373">And I wouldn’t eat, I came home and I barely dragged and my dad said, “What’s the matter?”</span> <span id="s374">We were still in the ghetto at that time, “What’s the matter?”</span> <span id="s375">I said, “Dad, I can’t eat it, they serving trayf.”</span> <span id="s376">So it must have had meat in there also.</span> <span id="s377">And he said, “You have to eat.</span> <span id="s378">You have to have strength to survive this.</span> <span id="s379">You have to eat.”</span> <span id="s380">So the next day, I ate and I couldn’t keep it down, I was throwing it all up, I came home and I dragged again.</span> <span id="s381">I told my dad, I said, “I can’t keep it down.”</span> <span id="s382">He said, “You have to eat.</span> <span id="s383">You have to force yourself.”</span> <span id="s384">And the third day, I was glad to get it.</span> <span id="s385">So from that on I started eating trayf and was lucky enough to get it, you know, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Were your parents working at Kabelwerk?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s388">Just my aunt and I and I was promised that I, if I would work in Kabelwerk, that my aunt, my parents would be safe in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s389">But naturally, it was broken promises.</span> <span id="s390">So the liquidation of the ghetto was March the 13, 1943.</span> <span id="s391">And my father got killed in the hospital, Spital.</span> <span id="s392">What happened was, every so often in the ghetto, they were rounding up people to send them to concentration camps and he, they rounded him up on the street in the ghetto and he jumped out the window and he fell, he was going to run away and hide somewheres in the ghetto, and he fell, he broke his leg.</span> <span id="s393">So this was a makeshift hospital, and they had some Jewish doctors who practiced, I mean they were doctors before the war, and he was in traction and his leg was in traction, it was the last time I saw him.</span> <span id="s394">And he was shot in the hospital.</span> <span id="s395">Because my cousin saw him, he was in the clean-up crew, and he saw him laying there on the sidewalk and there were pictures of my mother and of me and my brother around him.</span> <span id="s396">But I didn’t know until I saw “Schindler’s List” that they gave them poison, the nurses gave them poison, I did not know that.</span> <span id="s397">And I was thankful.</span> <span id="s398">Did you see, they were grateful, the patients were grateful to get it.</span> <span id="s399">They were even smiling because you heard them downstairs already yelling and screaming, and by the time they came up, they start shooting and they didn’t even notice that they were already dead.</span> <span id="s400">And I don’t know what happened to my mother, I thought my mother might have ended up in one of the concentration camps, but she might have been shot in the ghetto because they were just shooting left and right.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Were you with her up until that day, up until the day of deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s403">I was in the Kabelwerk at that time, I mean I was working in Kabelwerk, And after the liquidation of the ghetto, then they built barracks in Kabelwerk and we were there, we were not walking to Plaszow any more.</span> <span id="s404">We were concentrated where the factory was.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: That was. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: That was till about September, this was, I think May, March, ‘43 until I think, September ‘43, we were concentrated in the factory where we worked.</span> <span id="s407">And that wasn’t that bad, the only upsetting thing I still remember is, they supposed to have somebody come from Switzerland, a Red Cross representative come from Switzerland and we had to clean the barracks and we all got a care package, which we had to open but not touch.</span> <span id="s408">So when the representative from Switzerland came, he looked around, the barracks were clean and we all talked to him on the side how bad it is, you know.</span> <span id="s409">And he was not very sympathetic, he said, “The barracks are clean.</span> <span id="s410">Look at the nice care package.</span> <span id="s411">What are you complaining?</span> <span id="s412">People are getting killed, there is a war going on, you got it good here.”</span> <span id="s413">So we told him, we said, “We will have to return those, we can’t even touch it.</span> <span id="s414">The order was to open it up, but not to touch it.”</span> <span id="s415">And they took those care packages away, but it was so upsetting to us that he didn’t believe us, the representative from the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Before the ghetto was liquidated and you left, do you remember the last time you saw your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: The last time, it might have been maybe a month before.</span> <span id="s418">My aunt knew the O.D. man [ph], the one used to march us from one place to another, and he had to be in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s419">And my aunt asked him, whether he would take me along.</span> <span id="s420">So I marched with him and he was yelling at me just because there were Germans around, you know, even going from one place to another, “Now you walk straight.”</span> <span id="s421">You know.</span> <span id="s422">And it might have been about a month before, I went to the hospital—I went first and saw my mother and my mother told me my dad was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s423">So I went to the hospital and I only had a very short time, I don’t remember exactly, maybe a whole hour or a half an hour, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s424">And my dad said he was so happy to see me, he was just smiling and he had his leg in traction.</span> <span id="s425">So he said, “I want you to meet my doctor, he is such a nice man.”</span> <span id="s426">I said, “Dad, I have to go, I have to go.”</span> <span id="s427">They just gave me so much time, and I says, “I got to go,” and we hugged and I kissed him and I was walking out and the doctor just walked in.</span> <span id="s428">And my dad said, “This is my daughter I have told you about.”</span> <span id="s429">[phone rings in background] I was dad’s little girl always.</span> <span id="s430">And… End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: This is tape two, side A of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green.</span> <span id="s433">And, Mrs. Green, I’m going to ask you to repeat the story that you were telling about your last visit with your father in the hospital in the Krakow Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Ghetto, yeah.</span> <span id="s435">Do you want me to hold it or you hold it?</span> <span id="s436">The last visit, I went into the ghetto, an O.D. man had to go to the ghetto and he was a good friend of my aunt’s and so my aunt asked him to take me along so I could see my parents.</span> <span id="s437">And so we marched and he was yelling at me, I knew he was just doing it, you know, for the other Germans around, the ones who would walk, and as we entered the ghetto, I went to my mother’s place first and then she told me that my father was in the hospital and I went to see my dad and he was so happy to see me because I always was daddy’s little girl and we talked for awhile and he had his leg in traction and he told me what happened, how he broke the leg, that he jumped out the window because they were rounding them up to send them to gas chambers.</span> <span id="s438">And, well, we talked for awhile and then I said, “Dad, I have to go.”</span> <span id="s439">Well, I called him Papa, we called the father Papa.</span> <span id="s440">I have to go because so and so, the O.D. man, I can’t remember his name now, I have to go back with him.</span> <span id="s441">And he said, “Oh, I wanted you to meet my doctor so badly.”</span> <span id="s442">And I started walking out and the doctor walked in and my dad smiled, “This is her, this is Sylvia, I have told you so much about it.”</span> <span id="s443">And the doctor said, “I’m so glad to meet you, he’s talking about you all the time.”</span> <span id="s444">And we exchanged pleasantries, I don’t know exactly what and my dad and I, we hugged and we kissed and I walked out and I met the O.D. man and this was the last time, might have been maybe a month or a few weeks before the liquidation of the ghetto and I’m really happy I had a chance to go there to see my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: And your mother, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: I don’t know what happened to my mother, I saw in the paper that the Red Cross has a new list, they found it somewhere, some in Russia which they kept under cover for years and years and I went to the Red Cross here in Winchester and she asked some background information and I gave it to her and she said, “Maybe you’ll be lucky that you can find out what happened to your mother.”</span> <span id="s447">And then my aunt’s husband and my aunt’s daughter, and they haven’t found out.</span> <span id="s448">I got a, she couldn’t find out anything and then I also got a letter from Baltimore they could not trace what happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s449">I always thought she ended up maybe in Auschwitz or Treblinka or somewheres, but after I saw “Schindler’s List” I saw they were shooting like crazy.</span> <span id="s450">I mean, it’s not what your looks was, they was just shouting and shouting and shooting, going crazy, so I don’t know whether she was shot in the ghetto or what happened to her, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Do you remember the last time you saw her or close to the last?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: That was the last time, when I saw my dad, that was the last time, about a month or two weeks before the liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s453">The ghetto was. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: She was there, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s456">Yeah, I went to her place first and she told me my dad was in the hospital, I was looking for him.</span> <span id="s457">You know, when I went there I thought I was going to see both of them.</span> <span id="s458">So that was the last time.</span> <span id="s459">And that was ‘43 and my mother was born in ‘87, that would make her 54 years old.</span> <span id="s460">And you know my dad never even had a cold, I don’t remember my dad, he only missed work one time I recall, he had an abscess on his chest and my brother cleaned it out and it got infected, my dad thought he was dying, he never was sick, he didn’t know how to handle it, you know.</span> <span id="s461">He went to bed.</span> <span id="s462">He never was sick and got killed and he only was 53 years old, a nice looking man.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: You had mentioned the O.D., the—those are the Jewish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: The Jewish policemen, kapo, O.D., Jewish policemen.</span> <span id="s465">Some of them were pretty mean, also, they thought they would get a better treatment when they mistreated us, some were pretty rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Did you ever get beaten yourself by Germans, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: No.</span> <span id="s468">I got beaten one time, 25, by—that was in Plaszow, Patkush-Plaszow, that concentration camp, it was in a barrack and it was the one who was in charge of the barrack, and I got 25 paddles.</span> <span id="s469">There was a bad odor in that neighborhood where I was on the double decker wooden thing where we were laying.</span> <span id="s470">And somebody had their period or something and they put some, it wasn’t pads, it was something, and pushed it over where I was sleeping and she said it was mine, it didn’t happen to be mine, I got 25 paddles.</span> <span id="s471">But that was, I think was the only time.</span> <span id="s472">My aunt always told me, “Don’t walk erect, make yourself shorter,” you know, that you wouldn’t stand out, and I always knew wherever I went, I just walked like that.</span> <span id="s473">So some, some, some girls got raped and I was pretty fortunate, but I wasn’t much to look at because all those years already took its toll at a very young age and I was still in the developing age, you know, when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Do you remember the deportations that happened before the ghetto was liquidated?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: No, I was not in the ghetto when it was liquidated, so I don’t know anything, it’s just what I heard, it all was hearsay.</span> <span id="s476">And my cousin was in the clean up crew and he saw my father there and he told me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: You mentioned that, as you were working at Kabelwerk. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Kabelwerk, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: You were in charge of ten machines?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Ten machines, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: And were you supervising other workers?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s483">I was in charge of all ten machines and there was another person, another ten machines and then in the back of you there were ten machines and they had to be in operation at all times.</span> <span id="s484">If not, the thing was, it was a very fine but strong thread, but if something went wrong and it skipped a stitch, you had to cut it open and, and do it again, I mean you really had to watch it so it would be evenly covered.</span> <span id="s485">And there for awhile, I just worked daytimes, but then, you worked one week, 12 hours daytime and the following week, 12 hours nighttime.</span> <span id="s486">And they did this on purpose because you never could sleep.</span> <span id="s487">I mean there was no way to get adjusted from one to another.</span> <span id="s488">So, well, we were sent back to Patkush Plaszow, September, ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: When you say sent back, you meant you had been there before?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s491">I was in Plaszow, I was in Plaszow, and we walked from Plaszow to Kabelwerk from Plaszow, and then they concentrated us in Kabelwerk for a short time.</span> <span id="s492">And then, but by the time we were sent back to Plaszow, we did not work in Kabelwerk any more.</span> <span id="s493">This was September, ‘43.</span> <span id="s494">And when I got there, well, we had to work in the concentration camp, we had to open graves, pull out gold teeth and the people who were in charge of this place were prisoners, German prisoners and they were completely out of control.</span> <span id="s495">I mean they were murderers, they were in prison because they were murderers from way before the war and they let them out to, to oversee us.</span> <span id="s496">And the guy’s name, Hermann [ph], oh wow, he was crazy, he really was crazy.</span> <span id="s497">I saw Goeth many times and as soon as we heard he was walking in the camp, I was running away because we knew he was target shooting, he didn’t care what you looked like, he was just target shooting, he wanted to see how close he could shoot or how far he could shoot.</span> <span id="s498">And Schindler was with him many times and they were drinking buddies.</span> <span id="s499">And I really don’t think Schindler, well, he saved a lot of Jews and like they say, who saves one life, saves the world, but I can guarantee you this man did not start out to save the Jews.</span> <span id="s500">He started out to, to fill his pockets and somehow I think towards the end, he found out that it’s a losing war they’re fighting so he changed his mind.</span> <span id="s501">But, thank God he did because he saved a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s502">But this was terrible, I mean in Plaszow, whether we had to go outside and load railroad tracks again or in, if we worked inside, then we had to dig, I mean open the graves and pull out the gold teeth or we carried barracks, they were always building barracks and we had to, to carry that stuff.</span> <span id="s503">And really my legs are my weakest, my, my health problem, are my legs.</span> <span id="s504">You can’t work like a dog, like a man, and not come out scarred.</span> <span id="s505">So we were there until, oh, I didn’t tell you about my cousin, Janek Haubenstock.</span> <span id="s506">When we came back in September ‘43, people were telling me about my cousin, Janek.</span> <span id="s507">He and a little boy were walking in the concentration camp and, evidently, Goeth was walking towards him and my little cousin Janek had a habit, he drove his mother crazy, when he was upset he would whistle.</span> <span id="s508">He didn’t even know he did this.</span> <span id="s509">And somebody told me that he was whistling, that, it was a Russian song or a French anthem, I don’t know, I wasn’t there, and they arrested him right there, in ‘43, and they built a gallow to hang him, all night long, and the next day they brought him out to hang him, they made his father sit in the front row, my uncle, Henek Haubenstock, and the rope broke.</span> <span id="s510">So he sent somebody for a new rope and my poor little cousin, must have been just scared to death, and he was crawling up to Goeth’s foot and kissing his boot.</span> <span id="s511">And they said that he was just hissing, Goeth took the gun out and shot him right there.</span> <span id="s512">My uncle saw it and he had a complete stroke, never came back from it because when I went up there, I went to see him in Plaszow, in that concentration camp where it all happened, he was just a vegetable.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: How old was your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: He was younger than I and I really don’t know exactly, maybe four or five years younger, this was in ‘43, I was 19, he might have been 15, 14 or 15, I don’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Had you known him?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: I did not know them very well because I was born and raised in Germany and I was not in Poland, I think maybe about a couple of times.</span> <span id="s517">My mother went to visit, but she didn’t take us children.</span> <span id="s518">Somehow you take children more now than you used to, it seems like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: What kept you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Well, this is interesting question.</span> <span id="s521">I don’t know, really, what kept me going, the only thing, my aunt and I we talked all the time, and other people, too.</span> <span id="s522">Somebody had, had to survive to tell the world, we did not know that the world knew about it.</span> <span id="s523">We thought everybody was just ignorant about it, you know, they did not know.</span> <span id="s524">And I don’t know, don’t ask me whether, people say you must have been very healthy.</span> <span id="s525">I wasn’t any healthier than the ones who died next to me because I had typhus, for two weeks I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s526">I was so sick and we had to stand appell and they would drag me out, which I did not know, and they stood me up, holding me up.</span> <span id="s527">The only thing I can think of is, my time was not up.</span> <span id="s528">Somebody still had some purpose and also, I don’t know, maybe it was a strong will to live, to tell the world.</span> <span id="s529">But my world crumbled pretty quick after I came to the United States, when I found out the world did know and didn’t do a thing about it.</span> <span id="s530">And maybe it was lucky I didn’t know because I am pretty sure I would have given up, my aunt would have given up.</span> <span id="s531">My aunt was just like my mother, we were just constantly together, really, by yourself you could not survive, you had to have somebody to care for—your back’s hurting now?</span> <span id="s532">You okay?</span> <span id="s533">You had to have somebody to care for, and she did.</span> <span id="s534">The ration of bread we got, she wanted to share with me, her portion.</span> <span id="s535">“I’m really not very hungry, Sylvia, why don’t you take this?</span> <span id="s536">I just couldn’t eat it.”</span> <span id="s537">I said, “Mina, I don’t want it.”</span> <span id="s538">I said, “You just want me to have it because you know I am so hungry.”</span> <span id="s539">“No, no, no, honest, I just can’t eat another bite.</span> <span id="s540">I’m just not hungry.”</span> <span id="s541">That was my aunt.</span> <span id="s542">God bless her.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Did you have faith at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: I didn’t have much religion all during the war and after the war, oh God, I was bitter.</span> <span id="s545">I blamed God, what happened and why.</span> <span id="s546">And I’ve still got a lot of why’s, thank God I got over the bitterness.</span> <span id="s547">The bitterness doesn’t work, it eats you up alive and it, it doesn’t harm the people you hate.</span> <span id="s548">It, I couldn’t even talk German after the war, a complete blank.</span> <span id="s549">I blocked it out.</span> <span id="s550">And my brother told me, “Sylvia,” he said, “the German language is beautiful.”</span> <span id="s551">I said, “The German language?</span> <span id="s552">I connect it with Hitler, it’s not beautiful, it’s terrible.”</span> <span id="s553">And then to meet people who had anything to do with Germany or German descent, I had to run away.</span> <span id="s554">And this kind man helped, he was so kind, because I just wanted to shut the door and that’s it, not think about it and when I got married, and even after, I was an atheist, I didn’t believe in anything, I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s555">And so after I got married, I still did not talk about it to anybody.</span> <span id="s556">It was like I was ashamed of it, like some of it was my fault, you know.</span> <span id="s557">And I knew it wasn’t, but somehow I just couldn’t talk about it and then it was a small town with not many Jewish people, I already had one monkey on my head to be a Jew in a small town, and, but the door would not stay shut when I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s558">And then it all came back, the nightmares and waking up screaming, not waking up, excuse me, screaming in my dreams.</span> <span id="s559">Sobbing wet, Jake would wake me up, and we would come in and we sit for hours and I had to start talking and this man sat next to me, I don’t know whether he listened what I said or what, but his ear was there and that’s what I needed.</span> <span id="s560">So I was pretty lucky to have a wonderful husband and the children are great, they really are.</span> <span id="s561">They’re loving, very loving.</span> <span id="s562">I said that in the documentary, I did not want to raise them full of hatred.</span> <span id="s563">In fact, they didn’t know much about the Holocaust till I made that documentary.</span> <span id="s564">I want them to, want to raise them healthy, happy and, physically and mentally, and they got problems, I mean everybody’s got problems, but the problems are not connected with my past.</span> <span id="s565">Because I did set myself a goal that if I fail, then Hitler had won out, and he didn’t because they’re loving children, they really are big hearts.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Let’s go…</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: But, well, September, January, ‘44, naturally, we had to line up, we had to be counted, and they were telling us we were going to a wonderful place, there’s gonna be clean beds and plenty food, you’re gonna to work hard, but you’re gonna have it good.</span> <span id="s568">And my aunt said, “Wow, it sounds like paradise,” you know.</span> <span id="s569">And then we were crammed into cattle wagon.</span> <span id="s570">And Krakow, Auschwitz is not that far from Krakow, but it took such a long time because the train stopped every few feet because the planes were bombing.</span> <span id="s571">And before we got into the cattle wagon, they gave us some bread and that was all.</span> <span id="s572">And there was a container with water, and one container for the bathroom.</span> <span id="s573">And they stopped and gosh, were we pray, praying.</span> <span id="s574">Yeah, they jumped out of the, the trains, and they were hiding in ditches, the German, and we were laughing, we really were laughing.</span> <span id="s575">There was a little window up in top, those cattle wagons, the old ones, and we would get on each others’ shoulders to lift them up to see so we could get a good laugh because they were so scared.</span> <span id="s576">And we yelled, “Bomb us, bomb us, come on.”</span> <span id="s577">You know, we didn’t care, we really didn’t care as long as they would have gotten killed.</span> <span id="s578">And then we went a little bit longer, to me it seemed like we went the whole week, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s579">But you see, time was, didn’t seem important at all.</span> <span id="s580">It was just running into a day or night till the cattle wagon stopped, they opened the doors and they were yelling, “Out, out, out, out, out!”</span> <span id="s581">Kicking and dogs, and we were running.</span> <span id="s582">And then we looked and we knew where we were, because we saw the chimneys burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: You had heard about Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s585">Everybody heard about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s586">And you could smell the smell of human flesh.</span> <span id="s587">So, you know how they kept the records so neat, you know, they had to have orders, they didn’t have any orders.</span> <span id="s588">We arrived without orders, they didn’t know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s589">So we were sitting there or standing there between the ovens, near the gate when they opened.</span> <span id="s590">And on the other side were the barracks and you sat there for 48 hours and they were running like crazy.</span> <span id="s591">They couldn’t get any orders, they didn’t know whether we end up in the, should end up in the gas chamber or at the camp.</span> <span id="s592">And we just sat.</span> <span id="s593">And it was cold, it was January.</span> <span id="s594">And finally there still were no orders, but then we took, I guess they were afraid to send us to the ovens, if the orders came that we should not been killed, they couldn’t bring us back after they once gassed us, you know.</span> <span id="s595">So then they told us to go in to showers and we took the shower, naturally there’s never enough water.</span> <span id="s596">And then we walked out in the nude, in January in Poland, shivering.</span> <span id="s597">And then we got prison garbs and they gave me wooden shoes and they make me wear those shoes, I couldn’t walk in the shoes.</span> <span id="s598">It seemed like those shoes had a mind of their own.</span> <span id="s599">And then they put us in barracks and about, well, you didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s600">You just laid there or you stood there and we were there about 12 or 14 days, too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">[end of side one of tape 2]</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: This is tape two, side B of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green.</span> <span id="s603">Did they, did they give you a tattoo when you arrived at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s605">In Auschwitz, and I found that out later on, that you had to work there before they tattooed your arm.</span> <span id="s606">And we didn’t work there.</span> <span id="s607">We just were there 12, 14 days.</span> <span id="s608">And we didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s609">One time we got black coffee or whatever it was, it was awful, in the morning, and we had to carry, they were heavy kettles and in the evening you got the water soup.</span> <span id="s610">So I remember that very well, it was my turn to go, and some other girls also went and coming back and we were almost to our barrack and those stupid wooden shoes wouldn’t stay on my feet and I dropped the kettle and our whole supper was there.</span> <span id="s611">And really I was scared that the people are going to kill me, the hungry people, you know, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s612">We just all lay down and we licked the floor, whatever fell there.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Did they shave your hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Already partially, every so often it was shaved, the hair.</span> <span id="s615">It was already very short before we went in Auschwitz and then in Auschwitz they shaved it again, and delouse ‘em, they sprayed you, and they deloused you with some kind of powder that they, they, they sprayed you with.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Were you still with your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s618">We were liberated together.</span> <span id="s619">Let’s see, after about 12 or 14 days in Auschwitz, we were shipped back in the cattle wagon to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s620">And when we got to, I think it was still January of ‘44, because we were pretty much one of the first ones there.</span> <span id="s621">When we came to Bergen-Belsen, they had nothing but tents and then there was a big storm one night and it was quiet, there was no shouting and it was very quiet in comparison to Auschwitz, there was so much commotion constantly.</span> <span id="s622">It was very quiet and my aunt said, “You know, Sylvia, in comparison to Auschwitz, this is a vacation.”</span> <span id="s623">But we didn’t know that was…it was no gas chambers, but it was a starvation camp.</span> <span id="s624">They just starved you to death.</span> <span id="s625">So there weren’t that many people, but then we had a big storm and it knocked all the tents down and they moved us to barracks.</span> <span id="s626">And they were looking for somebody who spoke a lot of languages, so I applied for it.</span> <span id="s627">I spoke German fluently, by that time already, I spoke Polish fluently, but couldn’t read or write it because when you’re young you pick up languages, they said I spoke it with a heavy accent.</span> <span id="s628">So I applied for it and I knew about three words of French, or maybe five words, and two words of Russian, so I got the job, not very long, though, but enough that I had a foot in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s629">And so I could steal food so my aunt wouldn’t be hungry.</span> <span id="s630">So there were Jewish people working in the kitchen and some Russian soldiers working in the kitchen, and there were three Frenchmen.</span> <span id="s631">They were college students and they worked with the underground, Gentiles, and they got caught.</span> <span id="s632">So they were funny, they were so funny.</span> <span id="s633">They all spoke German and wouldn’t let the German know that they spoke German.</span> <span id="s634">And they would sing, and they would sing the French anthem, and they would laugh and they made us laugh.</span> <span id="s635">But the Russian people, we had to stay away from ‘em.</span> <span id="s636">When when we stole food, we didn’t tell on each other, but the Russians told on us when they saw us stealing food.</span> <span id="s637">They kept to themselves pretty much, we were afraid of ‘em.</span> <span id="s638">So, well, I got typhus in the, back in Belsen, and Paul Lepitre, one of the Frenchmen, stole food and sent it to the camp, so by the time I got the food, there wasn’t that much food left because she shared it with other people, but evidently it must have helped some.</span> <span id="s639">And when I got better after two weeks, I noticed that I didn’t have any shoes, I don’t know what happened to ‘em, my shoes, and I told the girl, I said, “I can’t go back to work in the kitchen without shoes.”</span> <span id="s640">So Paul Lepitre stole some man’s boots and sent it to the camp with a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s641">And after I went back to the kitchen, those three Frenchmen hoisted me up on their shoulder and they were marching and they were singing La, what is it, La Marseillaise, the French anthem.</span> <span id="s642">Ach, the German, I’m telling you, they would get so red and yell and we’d say, “You’re going to have a stroke, he’s going to have a stroke.”</span> <span id="s643">But no, not such luck.</span> <span id="s644">And we were liberated April the 14th …</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Before...</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: …of ‘45.</span> <span id="s647">It was really strange, by that time I wasn’t working in the kitchen any more, nobody was working anywheres because there was no food and they already knew that they were in bad shape because the guards were disappearing there and they came back, there was no place for ‘em to go.</span> <span id="s648">We didn’t know that, they were surrounded by the Russians, by the British and by the Americans, and there was no place to run around, so they were digging ditches.</span> <span id="s649">And oh, they were angry, I’m telling you, you couldn’t even set a foot out, if not, you got shot.</span> <span id="s650">So we stayed pretty much indoors and everybody was sick, no energy, no water, no food and then I got dysentery problems again.</span> <span id="s651">I went out one night to relieve myself and I felt something cold I was sitting on and I looked, it was a body and I just moved over.</span> <span id="s652">I mean, you got, evidently, you got conditioned to that.</span> <span id="s653">I mean, just thinking about it, it blows my mind, you know.</span> <span id="s654">And I crawled back in.</span> <span id="s655">So one night, it was between 14th and 15th, the night, or was early in the morning, we heard a lot of tanks rolling and rolling and rolling, we didn’t know what was the matter.</span> <span id="s656">And it was morning and somebody came running in, “We are liberated!</span> <span id="s657">We are liberated!”</span> <span id="s658">And they said, “By the British Army, we are liberated!”</span> <span id="s659">Well, I crawled out there and my aunt went out there, too.</span> <span id="s660">I said, “What are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s661">The German commanders, they were standing in front of the tanks, they tied them down evidently, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s662">And they, with no medals, they stripped them of all the medals, but I didn’t see that.</span> <span id="s663">I still saw the Nazis, I said, “What you talking about?</span> <span id="s664">Here they are.”</span> <span id="s665">And then we found out we were liberated, and I stood up, then I start singing the British anthem, God Bless the King, I remembered that from school.</span> <span id="s666">And, ah, there was such, so much commotion going on.</span> <span id="s667">They were so wonderful.</span> <span id="s668">And they gave us care packages, we didn’t know how to handle those care packages, we ate everything!</span> <span id="s669">And that’s why so many died, on that starvation diet for so many years and then you drank cocoa, I mean the powder, and coffee, you smoked cigarettes, chocolate, all at one time and sardines.</span> <span id="s670">They meant well, I mean they didn’t mean any harm.</span> <span id="s671">But I think that the world learned from that, whenever prisoners come back, they kind of condition them slowly with food.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Let’s go back a little bit to before liberation and you had mentioned that, that you had typhus and I remember earlier you had said that you, you, you had to go out to roll call everyday and other people were holding you up.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yeah, I didn’t, I don’t remember, two weeks I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s674">I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s675">They told me, you see, the thing about it is, they had to have a certain amount, they had the number there and that number had to satisfy ‘em.</span> <span id="s676">Well, they dragged me out and somebody called, you said, “One, two, three,” you know, you called your own number, so somebody must have called a number for me.</span> <span id="s677">If not, they’d be still standing there today.</span> <span id="s678">I mean, it had to be like to say 550, it had to be 550.</span> <span id="s679">If not, they went back in the barracks and they counted the dead.</span> <span id="s680">So they told me that they dragged me out every day and then it came, I mean that’s a lot of people that’s, you know, lined up.</span> <span id="s681">They probably when it came to me, they just held me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Do you know if you were in a hospital at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: No, I was not in a hospital, there was no hospital there.</span> <span id="s684">After the war, they made a hospital where Himmler’s palace was, in Bergen-Belsen, he had a palace there and they made this into a hospital.</span> <span id="s685">The ones who were so sick, they took them there, but by that time, I was, I wasn’t that sick any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: How did you get better?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: I don’t know, I don’t know, the grace of God, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s688">I told you, my time wasn’t up, I guess.</span> <span id="s689">I had to have those beautiful babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: And your aunt, was she working?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: In the camp, no.</span> <span id="s692">I stole food while I was in the kitchen, but then there were times we just laid there.</span> <span id="s693">She had typhus before I had it even, my aunt.</span> <span id="s694">Everybody had typhus, it’s a dysentery, but to get well, it’s hard to explain with any antibiotics or anything, because now you hear about typhus, everybody dies.</span> <span id="s695">It was like cholera, you know, a long time ago people died, not many survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Did you have the sense around that time that, that the end of the war was coming close and that you were going to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: No.</span> <span id="s698">That would be too much thinking, I didn’t have the energy.</span> <span id="s699">I think I told you that earlier in that interview, you did what you were supposed to do and you did it and hour went into hour into day and night, it… there was no difference.</span> <span id="s700">No, I never.</span> <span id="s701">The only thing, like sometimes we would sit around and be miserable and then somebody would say, “You know, on Shabbat, Friday night?</span> <span id="s702">Boy, my mother set a table fit for a king.”</span> <span id="s703">“What did she cook?”</span> <span id="s704">“Well, there was fish and chicken soup and chicken and roast beef and vegetables and dessert.”</span> <span id="s705">And somebody would pop up, “That’s enough food, I can’t eat another bite.”</span> <span id="s706">You know, really, I’m not kidding, we could taste that food.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Did you have other fantasies?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: No.</span> <span id="s709">Just blank, just a zombie.</span> <span id="s710">And I don’t think I was the only one, I think everybody was that way.</span> <span id="s711">I was so conditioned from the time I was nine years old until the end of the war, that only thing many times you ask yourself, why, why, why?</span> <span id="s712">I still ask myself now, why?</span> <span id="s713">I said when my time comes, I’m going to have a list that long and I’m, when I get upstairs, I’m going to ask Him maybe, “Why this, why that,” you know.</span> <span id="s714">But you know what’s very upsetting to me?</span> <span id="s715">The world didn’t learn anything by it, if the world just would have learned something by it.</span> <span id="s716">Look that ethnic cleansing now, they’re killing babies.</span> <span id="s717">So I feel like that whole thing was a waste.</span> <span id="s718">At least if people would have learned by it.</span> <span id="s719">But they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Do you remember, at liberation, and you, you suddenly saw, realized that you were liberated…</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: …and you were inspired to sing.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s724">Oh, yeah, that national, the British, God Save the King.</span> <span id="s725">I met a British soldier and I still remembered, whoever lives going to get in touch with the Urbachs in Lexington, Kentucky.</span> <span id="s726">So I told him about, I had about two years of English and I didn’t do too well, but I still have the letter here, I … I was going to pull it out and show it to you.</span> <span id="s727">I wrote to Urbachs in Lexington, Kentucky, but we couldn’t mail, I mean there was no mail going between Germany and, and America at that time.</span> <span id="s728">And I gave it to that British soldier I met and he sent this letter to his mother in England and his mother, his parents, forwarded that letter to America, to Urbachs, Lexington, Kentucky.</span> <span id="s729">And at that time, Lexington, Kentucky was small, there were about 65,000 people, so everybody knew each other, so it got there just, Leon Urbach, Lexington, Kentucky, United…USA.</span> <span id="s730">So my brother was in the American Army, he, Urbach sent him an affidavit from England to come to the United States in 1940 and he was drafted in ‘41.</span> <span id="s731">So he was still serving in the American Army, he was with Intelligence, he spoke seven languages fluently.</span> <span id="s732">And the Urbachs got in touch with him.</span> <span id="s733">And he came to Bergen-Belsen, and I think I told you that previously, when they came running in, telling me that my brother was out there.</span> <span id="s734">And I run out and all in a sudden I just stopped.</span> <span id="s735">I thought my dad was there because they look so much alike.</span> <span id="s736">So then he took us to Munich, he was stationed in Munich, my brother was stationed in Munich.</span> <span id="s737">And he sent an ambulance after us, I think it was around October, ‘45.</span> <span id="s738">When he came to the camp, he brought oranges, food, and ah, we, we just had a party.</span> <span id="s739">And my brother said, “I just brought it for you and Aunt Mina.”</span> <span id="s740">I said, “I can’t eat that by myself, not sharing it, what you talking about?”</span> <span id="s741">He didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s742">You know, you’re hungry together, you party together!</span> <span id="s743">So it was good food, it really was.</span> <span id="s744">And he rented an apartment in Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: When you saw him and he arrived at Bergen-Belsen and you thought it was your father…</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: It was scary, that’s why I, I couldn’t talk, I just stood there like paralyzed, even had a mustache like my dad at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Did you have a feeling of, of, of sadness or of joy?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: I had no feeling, I just looked, I knew my dad was killed and I thought my dad was standing there.</span> <span id="s749">It wasn’t sadness, I just couldn’t understand it, you know.</span> <span id="s750">They look so much alike, almost like twins.</span> <span id="s751">And then I was very happy.</span> <span id="s752">Yeah, we just grabbed and we hugged and… He went through his own hell, because he went in my place to England and all during the war, that was on his mind.</span> <span id="s753">He told me, he said, “I’m so happy that you are alive, I don’t know how I would have managed to, to live, to know that you got killed and I’m alive.”</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Had you thought about him much through those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yeah, my mother would talk, “I wonder how Bernard is getting along,” you know, but that’s, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s756">“I hope he’s doing okay.”</span> <span id="s757">But we knew at that time he was in England, we didn’t know he came to America.</span> <span id="s758">But we felt like he was safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: So you went to Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: We went to Munich and he could have, he was discharged about, we came in June, he was discharged about two or three months before and he could have come to the United States, so he signed up as a civilian for another six months because he wanted us, he wanted for us to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s761">He was afraid that we weren’t pushy enough probably, you know.</span> <span id="s762">And so he stayed and he took care of all the papers and we got out about June.</span> <span id="s763">We arrived in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Would you say you were still feeling numb about everything that had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Well, you come to a strange country, you’re scared.</span> <span id="s766">People you didn’t know, all right, the Urbachs were related to my aunt, but they were no relations to me.</span> <span id="s767">No, I wasn’t feeling numb then.</span> <span id="s768">I was angry, I was full of hatred, I think I brought this up before.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: I’m sorry, how long had you been in Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: From October, ‘45, until June, ‘46.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: And what did you do while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Go crazy, go wild.</span> <span id="s773">Eat, drink, bleach your hair blond, peroxide my hair.</span> <span id="s774">We didn’t know whether to walk on our head, we didn’t know whether to walk on our feet.</span> <span id="s775">I mean all that freedom, all in a sudden, listen, that’s, that’s overpowering.</span> <span id="s776">And my brother brought a lot of food home from, oh, what do you call that, the mess hall or something, is that called mess hall?</span> <span id="s777">I think.</span> <span id="s778">Brought a lot of food and all his friends brought food.</span> <span id="s779">I guess they felt so sorry for us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: And you didn’t have to do any work?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s782">He took care of us.</span> <span id="s783">Well, the strangest thing, he got that apartment for us and he just told the Germans to get out.</span> <span id="s784">And they were crying and they were crying, “That’s our apartment, how we, we’ve been living here.”</span> <span id="s785">And he was not very sympathetic, he told them they had to get out and some of his friends, also.</span> <span id="s786">We got the apartment, so while we already lived in, in that apartment, they came ringing the doorbell, “We want to move back, this is our apartment.”</span> <span id="s787">So I was angry, I said, “What are you talking about?</span> <span id="s788">I’d like to see my parents, too, what did you do to them?”</span> <span id="s789">I wasn’t… we weren’t very sympathetic.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: And they just left?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Yeah, they left.</span> <span id="s792">And then they came back two or three days later on.</span> <span id="s793">Looking back now, I, I mean, it was theirs, you know, but look what they did to us.</span> <span id="s794">I mean, the one they killed, you couldn’t bring those back, could you?</span> <span id="s795">And this was only material things.</span> <span id="s796">But I told you I was angry, it was just all bundled up, you know, and all in a sudden it just had to explode.</span> <span id="s797">But Munich was great, it really was.</span> <span id="s798">We went to museums and we went to concerts, we went to the opera.</span> <span id="s799">He came in, because…</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: So when you were in Munich, you, you, you were angry, but you were also having fun?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Oh, I was having fun.</span> <span id="s802">And I’m not the only one, I mean everybody had fun.</span> <span id="s803">Somebody said, “Oh, you…” I used to be a blond as a child, kind of golden blond.</span> <span id="s804">“Oh, you got brown eyes.</span> <span id="s805">Blond hair and brown eyes is unusual, how about bleaching?”</span> <span id="s806">So they used peroxide.</span> <span id="s807">And I came to the United States as a blond.</span> <span id="s808">And then there was a museum, it was kind of a meeting place of the survivors, and once in awhile you can meet some which you knew.</span> <span id="s809">I mean, you met people all the time, so you couldn’t remember everybody, you know?</span> <span id="s810">But sometimes you run across somebody, and “Oh, you are here, you are here.”</span> <span id="s811">You know, “You survived it.”</span> <span id="s812">And we grabbed and we hugged and we were wild.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: You made new friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: In Munich, no, not really.</span> <span id="s815">I mean, people I was together, then I was with my brother a lot, my aunt was with us constantly, you see, my aunt was my best friend, there was nothing I couldn’t tell her.</span> <span id="s816">And she knew exactly how I felt about things.</span> <span id="s817">She was my best friend, she was my psychiatrist, and I helped her.</span> <span id="s818">But my brother was very good to us, he really took us places and his American soldiers, his friends, were very nice.</span> <span id="s819">You know, we did make some friends, Brechner, he came back to Munich after the war and he opened a store they had before the war.</span> <span id="s820">And he got us some material and we had some raincoats made.</span> <span id="s821">At that time a lot of things were custom-made, you just couldn’t go in a store, maybe house dresses they would sell in a store, but not like you go and you can buy suits and all that.</span> <span id="s822">Those things were custom made a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: This is tape three, side A of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green.</span> <span id="s826">Mrs. Green, you were just talking about your, your stay in Munich and you spent almost a year there, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Well, not quite a year.</span> <span id="s828">From October until June.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: From October until June, so a little over a half a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s832">And, and during this time, did you reflect much on what had happened to you before, in the…?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: No, not too much.</span> <span id="s834">I had a lot of living to do, because I didn’t live before.</span> <span id="s835">That’s, everybody felt that way.</span> <span id="s836">We ate too much, we drank too much, we just felt like a, a bird coming out the cage.</span> <span id="s837">It’s very overpowering, all, all that freedom.</span> <span id="s838">You were not told what to do, you could walk, you could go to bed when you wanted, you had nice beds and sheets.</span> <span id="s839">I mean, things you take for granted.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Did you think much about the future, about what you would do?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Well, I knew that we were coming to the United States, this we knew because my brother filled forms out all the time, you know, and then we had to go, for examinations and you had to get passports.</span> <span id="s842">And finally, the day came when we left Germany and I think we were, we came over on the ship, Marine Perch, and, from Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s843">And I think we were on water about 11 days because they had to stop, there were some mines, and they didn’t tell us they had mines in the water until they deactivated it.</span> <span id="s844">They didn’t tell us about it, we would have been scared to death.</span> <span id="s845">But I would say there were about 800 passengers, maybe with the crew also, it was a very small ship.</span> <span id="s846">And it was not equipped, it was not a luxury liner.</span> <span id="s847">We had one little room, but from the 800 people, there might have been about 40, 50 who didn’t get sick.</span> <span id="s848">Most of them got sick, seasick.</span> <span id="s849">And my aunt was seasick.</span> <span id="s850">They, the younger people they put in the bunk beds, and it was a great big room.</span> <span id="s851">And the, the food was served buffet and, but my aunt, she was over 40 and she had, I think it was a semi-private room.</span> <span id="s852">They just gave it to her, after, up to a certain age.</span> <span id="s853">And they ate at a table, they were served and my poor aunt was in bed all the trip.</span> <span id="s854">I went down every day to see her and I want to bring her some food and she said, “Get out of here.</span> <span id="s855">I can’t look at that food!”</span> <span id="s856">So, we had a good time, we entertained ourselves, the 45, 50, and it was just amazing to us, when we got to New York, all in a sudden those people start pouring out the ship, you know, you haven’t seen them, “How did you get on?</span> <span id="s857">I didn’t see you.”</span> <span id="s858">But so many were sick.</span> <span id="s859">Then we had to wait, that you had relatives or somebody had to pick you up at the pier.</span> <span id="s860">They wouldn’t just let you go loose.</span> <span id="s861">And my aunt and I, we waited and waited and my cousin in New York supposed to pick me up.</span> <span id="s862">I did not know those cousins except one cousin, he was in Karlsruhe and he was just like my brother.</span> <span id="s863">At that time, first cousins were like brothers and sisters, very close.</span> <span id="s864">And he’s supposed to pick me up and he just didn’t show up and my aunt and I, we were the last ones.</span> <span id="s865">And, oh God, were we scared, I start crying and all in a sudden a woman came up to me and she said, “You’re Sylvia Farber, aren’t you?</span> <span id="s866">From Karlsruhe?”</span> <span id="s867">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s868">And she said, “I don’t know, do you remember Berndt Weissman?”</span> <span id="s869">I said, “Yeah, I went to school with him, the, the Jewish school.”</span> <span id="s870">He had a speech defect and the children were not very kind to him and children can be cruel.</span> <span id="s871">So she said, “Well, I really didn’t have you on my list, but I looked at the list and I saw Sylvia Farber and I wanted to greet you, so I switched with somebody and I want to say, welcome to America and thank you for being so nice to my son, Berndt.”</span> <span id="s872">And that kind of felt good that people remembered you, you know.</span> <span id="s873">And he was such a nice boy but the kids just didn’t give him a chance, he was very intelligent, his father was a doctor, I don’t know what happened to him, lost contact.</span> <span id="s874">So while we were talking, my cousin came with other cousins.</span> <span id="s875">The other cousins, but I didn’t know the other cousins, they were waiting for that one cousin, he had to sign for us.</span> <span id="s876">And he came and he looked like a Farber, he looked like my dad, he looked like my brother and we just start hugging and kissing, you know.</span> <span id="s877">It seemed like the Farber, the looks go through the family, it’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Was your brother with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: No, my brother didn’t come until September.</span> <span id="s880">You see, he signed up six more months to make sure to get us out.</span> <span id="s881">And I really loved New York, I wanted to stay there, but my brother wouldn’t let us.</span> <span id="s882">My brother said, “Listen, we’re going to make a home in Lexington, Kentucky, it’s a beautiful little town.</span> <span id="s883">And that way we can be together, we don’t have parents.”</span> <span id="s884">And I listened to him and I stayed in Lexington.</span> <span id="s885">Do you know where he ended up?</span> <span id="s886">New Jersey.</span> <span id="s887">He got his undergraduate degree from University Kentucky, he got his Master’s degree from Chicago, University of Chicago, he was working on his Ph.D. in, at Columbia University.</span> <span id="s888">And he stayed there.</span> <span id="s889">Then when he got married, they moved to New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: This relative of yours in Lexington, will you describe how he was…</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: They really were not related to me.</span> <span id="s892">They were related, the one, Leon Urbach was my aunt Mina’s brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s893">My aunt Mina’s husband Alec and Leon Urbach were brothers.</span> <span id="s894">And I was related to my aunt Mina through my mother.</span> <span id="s895">You see, so they really were not related, but they were wonderful, they were, really were wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: And so your brother had been living with Leon Urbach?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: When he came in ‘40, he lived with Leon Urbach, then he went to Louisville and they grabbed him right away in ‘41 for the Army.</span> <span id="s900">So they really were wonderful people and they treated me better than the daughter, the daughter said.</span> <span id="s901">Because I was older than their daughter, five and a half years, and I could stay out longer on a date.</span> <span id="s902">And she resented that.</span> <span id="s903">She said, “They love you more than they love me.”</span> <span id="s904">They really were great people.</span> <span id="s905">But we didn’t stay very long.</span> <span id="s906">My brother came in September and we rented an apartment and we lived on my brother’s Army pay, ninety dollars a month, forty-five dollars rent.</span> <span id="s907">Water bill was cheap, two dollars, electric bill and we made it, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s908">And we only had hamburger on Sundays.</span> <span id="s909">But we wanted to be independent, Urbachs didn’t want us to leave, but we wanted to get started.</span> <span id="s910">So my brother start teaching languages, he, he was working on his undergraduate degree and he was tutoring in French and German and sometimes he didn’t go to bed until two, three o’clock in the morning because he had to do his own homework.</span> <span id="s911">And he caught the flu, he couldn’t get over it and the doctor said something has to give, you need sleep.</span> <span id="s912">So I went to work for eighteen dollars a week, but that was money.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Did you speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: By that time, a little bit, Urbachs, you see, we came in June and I went to work, I think it was Christmas or right after Christmas.</span> <span id="s915">And they were nice enough to give me a job, it was Wolf Wile’s, they were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s916">And I think they gave me a job, they felt sorry for me and then I was a novelty.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: This was in the paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s919">That’s me, a young Sylvia Farber.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: And you have blond hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: And there’s your aunt. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Do you know it stayed blond until practically. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: . . .on the left.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Yeah, that’s my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: The headline says, Polish. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Polish refugees, there were students, they kind of messed it up a little bit, they didn’t get it straight, some of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Will you read the entire headline?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s930">This was 9/27/46, and it was the Lexington Leader: “Polish Refugee, Ex-Prisoners Now at Henry Clay High School.”</span> <span id="s931">We just sat through English classes, American Government classes.</span> <span id="s932">And then some of the students gave up their study hour to help us learn how to read, I thought it was very nice of them.</span> <span id="s933">And then also, when I was working, I audited some classes at the University Kentucky from eight till nine in the morning.</span> <span id="s934">And Joe Wile’s niece who went to University Kentucky, picked me up and took me to work so I would be there by nine o’clock.</span> <span id="s935">And they were very nice because I should, supposed to have been there at ten minutes to nine, but I talked to him and then he said that’s alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Were you interested, very interested in getting an education?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: It was not the education as much, what I wanted, I wanted to learn how to speak English, it’s very hard to think in German and then have to translate everything, it’s not easy.</span> <span id="s938">I mean, were you ever in a foreign country where you walked around with a dictionary?</span> <span id="s939">And my problem was that I always would put the buggy before the horse somehow, the sentence construction was very difficult.</span> <span id="s940">And English is a very hard language, and the spelling, my God, there’s so many words they sound alike.</span> <span id="s941">Now, I wish I would have gone on to get an education, I really, but the education at that time wasn’t that important.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: What were you doing in your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: I started out as wrapping packages and, but that April, I just felt like, you’re stupid, you can do better than that, you know.</span> <span id="s944">So I start sneaking out and waiting on customers and the customers loved it because I was a survivor which they never met another one and that publicity, I mean everybody knew about me.</span> <span id="s945">So I remember Joe Wile said to me, “What are you doing on the floor?”</span> <span id="s946">I said, “I’m not stupid, I can do better than that, just wrap packages.”</span> <span id="s947">And, well, normally a clerk couldn’t have said that, but then, I didn’t have the clothes I was supposed to wear, supposed to wear dark clothes, navy blue or gray or black.</span> <span id="s948">I didn’t have it, he told me, “You wear what you got.”</span> <span id="s949">So he really made, made allowances for me.</span> <span id="s950">In fact, people must have talked about this—a Holocaust survivor—and another department store, Martin, the buyer, I don’t remember, I don’t think she came in to Wolf Wile’s, she must have waited outdoors or something, she came up to me and she said, “I really would like for you to work for Martin’s.</span> <span id="s951">How much money do you get at Wolf Wile’s?”</span> <span id="s952">And I said, “Eighteen dollars a week.”</span> <span id="s953">She said, “We can do better than that, we can pay you twenty-five dollars.”</span> <span id="s954">So, I said, “Let me think about it.”</span> <span id="s955">So I went to Joe Wile, I thought that was the right thing to do because he gave me the chance.</span> <span id="s956">The factories where I applied in Lexington wouldn’t hire me because I couldn’t speak English fluently.</span> <span id="s957">Now, you could sue ‘em because you discriminated, but at that time you didn’t know about suing people.</span> <span id="s958">So I told him, I said, “Listen, they approached me at Martin’s and they would pay me twenty-five dollars a week.”</span> <span id="s959">He said, “Well, if Martin’s can pay you twenty-five, I can give you twenty-five.”</span> <span id="s960">I did feel guilty because the people I worked with, some been working there ten, 20 years and didn’t make more than twenty-five or twenty-seven dollars, but I told him, I said, “You know, we need the money.”</span> <span id="s961">He said, “I know.”</span> <span id="s962">So people in Lexington were very nice, very decent.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: When did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Jake?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">(Unknown person): You know, I think you better wind this up, three hours is enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Open through his cousin.</span> <span id="s967">We met his cousin, we lived on McDowell Road, Chevy Chase area, I don’t know whether you know that area there, okay.</span> <span id="s968">And Martha Steinburg and she said, “I know a young man I would like for you to meet.”</span> <span id="s969">And I was going with that Hungarian fellow, I was telling you I met on the boat, from Budapest.</span> <span id="s970">And he proposed before we got off the boat, he wanted to get married, but my aunt said, “No way, he is scared, he doesn’t want to be alone to get into a country not knowing anybody.”</span> <span id="s971">So we corresponded, and we talked on the telephone sometimes.</span> <span id="s972">So I was telling Martha, I said, “Well, I’m dating a fellow in New York.”</span> <span id="s973">But we had an understanding that we could date other people also, since we were that far apart.</span> <span id="s974">And she said, “I really would like to.”</span> <span id="s975">My aunt said, “Well, you have nothing to lose.”</span> <span id="s976">So they fixed up a date, they fixed up a date, Martha and Jake, for eight o’clock a certain day.</span> <span id="s977">It was eight-twenty, eight-thirty, quarter to nine, no Jake Green.</span> <span id="s978">I got undressed, I put my slack suit back on, I was madder than a hornet.</span> <span id="s979">I wasn’t used to be stood up.</span> <span id="s980">Doorbell rings there, “I’m Jake Green.”</span> <span id="s981">And I said, he said, “If you don’t want to go out with me, I will understand.”</span> <span id="s982">I said, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s983">He said, “I got lost.”</span> <span id="s984">Well, where we lived, it was like McDowell Road and then there was a circle and the next road, Irvine, there was a circle and he drove around in circles in the dark and he went downtown to a gas station and they gave him directions and this really made sense, it’s really hard because many times we drive by now where I used to live to see the changes in the apartment house, and it’s very easy to get lost.</span> <span id="s985">It’s like a cul-de-sac, you know, it’s a circle.</span> <span id="s986">So that’s how I met my husband and we went out dancing and I don’t know, the evening passed by so fast and I ask him now, I said, “How could you understand me, I couldn’t even understand myself.”</span> <span id="s987">He said, “It was very easy.”</span> <span id="s988">I learned a little Jewish, Yiddish and he knew a little Yiddish and some German and some English, we had a marvelous time and we both like to dance.</span> <span id="s989">And we dated about a year and a half and we got married January the 16th, 1949, which is going to be 47 years, a long time.</span> <span id="s990">My brother said, “It won’t last.”</span> <span id="s991">I said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s992">He had nothing against Jake, he just said, “Nobody could live with you any longer ten days to three weeks.”</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Why did he say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Why did he say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: You know how brothers and sister… he meant well, but he was so strict with me.</span> <span id="s997">Now you wouldn’t even listen to a brother, but at that time you did.</span> <span id="s998">And I just listened to him.</span> <span id="s999">When I had a date, even before Jake, they had to come inside the house, they had to talk to him, he had to look them over whether they were good enough for his sister.</span> <span id="s1000">But I wasn’t a child, I already was 23, 22, 23 years old, but he just took it on himself like he was my father.</span> <span id="s1001">Like I told him, “You’re stricter on me like Dad would be.”</span> <span id="s1002">But then, after we got engaged and everything was all right, he said, “Oh well, it’s not so bad.</span> <span id="s1003">I’m not losing a sister, I gained a bathroom.”</span> <span id="s1004">You know, one bathroom in an apartment, two bedrooms.</span> <span id="s1005">And I had a problem after the war, I took an awful lot of baths, we didn’t have a shower, I just felt dirty, three, four times a day, but everything turned out all right.</span> <span id="s1006">They were kind of worried about me because all that time, you know, you had lice in the camps and you were itching and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1007">And you were dirty all the time.</span> <span id="s1008">And even if they gave you water, on purpose, they would give you soap but never let you wash off the soap, they just dumped the water off, they got their kicks that way, I guess.</span> <span id="s1009">So I did have a problem, so he probably was happy, he gained a bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Okay, we have a tape, a, a photograph here of yourself with your family before the war and will you just describe the people from left to right and say something about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Well, this was taken in a garden, that’s a botanic garden and I remember when that was taken, except my brother had this blown up and at that time you didn’t have color picture, he, he had it tinted, the pictures were just black and white.</span> <span id="s1012">And I kind of feel bad, this was a blue dress and he had it tinted green.</span> <span id="s1013">Because I got the picture and I thanked him so much for it, I said, “Bernard,” I said, “The dress was blue.”</span> <span id="s1014">He said, “No, it was green.”</span> <span id="s1015">I said, “No, it was blue.”</span> <span id="s1016">And he kind of felt bad about it, but I really shouldn’t have told him that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: So this on the left…</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: This is my mother, this is, well her name was Cerka, which is a Polish name, and then she, and they would call her Cilly, and then after she came to Germany, she couldn’t be called Cilly because it’s, she would spell it C-I-L-L-Y, it would be ‘Silly,’ you know.</span> <span id="s1019">And she was a big woman and, like I told you, I was Daddy’s little girl and I always said, “I look like a Farber, I am a Farber.”</span> <span id="s1020">Look, I’m the image of my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: You’re almost as tall as she is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1023">Mother told me she grew very late in life, about 17.</span> <span id="s1024">They used to call her shrimp because she didn’t grow, very slow, she got her period very late then she start growing.</span> <span id="s1025">And she ended up about five six or five six and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: And you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: And this is, I always was called ‘Klein Sylvia’ because from all my cousins, I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s1028">And I remember the dress, it was a very pretty dress and they called that holsom [ph], I don’t know, what do you call this in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: The bodice, I believe, the bodice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Yeah, and that was all made and this, this is work because you have to pull the threads out and then finish it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: How old were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: I think I was about, in 1933, I think I was maybe about nine.</span> <span id="s1033">And my mother said I was skinny.</span> <span id="s1034">Being heavy was stylish because many times when we walked down the street and we would see a chubby girl passing by, she would say, “Isn’t she beautiful.”</span> <span id="s1035">And then she’d look at me, “humph.”</span> <span id="s1036">I don’t, I am not skinny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: You look thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: You look thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Ahhh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Very healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Yeah, I was healthy, I was a healthy child.</span> <span id="s1043">Next to me is my brother in his bar mitzvah suit.</span> <span id="s1044">This was custom made and he had short pants and long pants, but the short pants weren’t real short, they come about, just up to the knees, a little above.</span> <span id="s1045">And he’s wearing his gymnasium cap and every year they would change the band, different colors.</span> <span id="s1046">And this is my handsome dad.</span> <span id="s1047">And I think this picture must have been taken about ‘33 because in ‘36 my mother went to Poland and she had some modern suits.</span> <span id="s1048">I just go by the style, this was in ‘36, she had some made in Poland and she brought ‘em back in ‘36, and they were double breasted suits, so this. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: This is a single breasted suit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: This is a single breasted suit, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: And he’s. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: He’s wearing a vest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: He’s wearing a vest and a tie, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: But not only that, I don’t see the spats, maybe he wore spats in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s1055">I remember his spats and at times he would carry a cane, just for the fun of it.</span> <span id="s1056">It was the style, I guess.</span> <span id="s1057">He has a very kind face.</span> <span id="s1058">Do you notice this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: A nice smile.</span> <span id="s1061">He had black eyes, and my brother inherited [doorbell rings] his black eyes and mine are dark, but not as dark as theirs.</span> <span id="s1062">Mine, my mother’s eyes got a little mingled in there in mine.</span> <span id="s1063">He smoked cigarettes also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Do you have any closing comments you’d like to make today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: I didn’t think about that.</span> <span id="s1066">My life certainly has been interesting.</span> <span id="s1067">It, I divided it up.</span> <span id="s1068">This was then and raising the children I really enjoyed.</span> <span id="s1069">I didn’t work outdoors, they were my whole life, my children, but I wanted to, I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1070">And, well, they’re wonderful, we love them dearly, they love us dearly, but they got their own life.</span> <span id="s1071">And… it was a good life.</span> <span id="s1072">And altogether, the only thing, I thought well, everybody has to go through some kind of hell and I always thought, well, I been through it early in life and the rest of the life, I got smooth sailing.</span> <span id="s1073">But I guess it wasn’t enough because then this came up, with my husband’s illness.</span> <span id="s1074">But we’re holding together.</span> <span id="s1075">The… certain things I would love to do, I would love to travel.</span> <span id="s1076">I used to travel by myself because Jake wanted to work and he really could have gone with, but, with me, but in that respect, he was a small-town boy and he really didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1077">But I went to New York, I went to visit my brother, I went to Israel in ‘85 by myself, and that was a highlight of my life because I always wanted to go to Israel when I was a member of the Mizrachi, I was… at that time, I was going to Palestine and at the time I was five or six, and I was going to build it up single handed, I really was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s1078">And I always said, someday, someday I was gonna go.</span> <span id="s1079">In ‘85, I said, “Well, you feel pretty good now and that someday has to be now because you don’t know what’s ahead of you.”</span> <span id="s1080">And I went for two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Interview with Sylvia Green</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">April 22, 1999 Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</span> <span id="s1084">This is an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green, conducted at her home in Winchester, Kentucky, on April the 22nd, 1999.</span> <span id="s1085">This… I’m Arwen Donahue, conducting the interview, and this is a follow up interview to an interview that was conducted with Mrs. Green in, in January of 1996.</span> <span id="s1086">This is tape number one, side A. Okay, we’re picking up a little bit, on where we left off, the last time that we, that we sat together and, and did an interview, and… and you told me about, about your war time experiences, and some about afterwards, as well.</span> <span id="s1087">And, and what I… where I thought we would start is at the time of liberation, when you were at Bergen-Belsen, and the, it’s April of 1945, and the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Answer: April the 15th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: April the 15th, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: I haven’t forgotten, yeah.</span> <span id="s1091">I can’t forget that date.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Of course you’ve never forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: After my birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Yeah, the day after your birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: And the British troops came in and you... and you talked about... about what it was like to see them, and how you... how you remembered the... the anthem, and you sang.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: And I, I wondered if you could just talk some more about that moment, and, and that… those first couple of days…</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: At that moment…</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: …right after the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Well, that moment, when the tanks, they were driving in, and the British were driving the tanks, and somebody said, “We liberated, we liberated.”</span> <span id="s1102">But they had the German officers standing up tied to the front.</span> <span id="s1103">I said, “What you talking about?”</span> <span id="s1104">I didn’t even see the British.</span> <span id="s1105">All I saw is that, “There are the Germans, don’t you see ‘em?”</span> <span id="s1106">Then somebody said, “No medals, look.”</span> <span id="s1107">And I stood up, and it is amazing that I had the energy to stand up, before… because we had no food.</span> <span id="s1108">We couldn’t even venture out the barracks, because if they saw somebody venturing out, you just took your life into your hand.</span> <span id="s1109">They were digging ditches, they were going to blow up the camp.</span> <span id="s1110">And, really all… we all were in a semi-conscious state.</span> <span id="s1111">And I remember I crawled out, I did not walk out.</span> <span id="s1112">I crawled on all four.</span> <span id="s1113">And somehow, I had the energy, I don’t know where it came from, I stood up, and I sang God… well, the British anthem, “God Save the King.”</span> <span id="s1114">I learned that in school.</span> <span id="s1115">So, they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s1116">I think the first thing they did, they took us to delousing.</span> <span id="s1117">This camp was just completely diseased.</span> <span id="s1118">It was typhus and lice and any kind of disease you want was found in there.</span> <span id="s1119">And so many piled up that’s all… the, the, the ones that died.</span> <span id="s1120">And so they took us to delousing, and they gave us clean clothes.</span> <span id="s1121">And delousing usually was, with the German, too, you left your… you went in through one door, you, you, you walked in the nude in the shower, and then, after you came out, and they sprayed you.</span> <span id="s1122">So then they gave us a box of food.</span> <span id="s1123">And it was like a ration.</span> <span id="s1124">And I remember I ate everything in sight.</span> <span id="s1125">I did not know what instant coffee was, and powdered milk, and sardines and cigarettes, and chocolate.</span> <span id="s1126">That whole thing was consumed in the, in the few minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Did you get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: I already was sick, I already had dysentery.</span> <span id="s1129">I had diarrhea, everybody did.</span> <span id="s1130">It is amazing that it somehow blew over, because so many died, with all that rich food, and your stomach conditioned to nothing, emptiness, you know.</span> <span id="s1131">So, I don’t know, I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: What did the British do with the perpetrators?</span> <span id="s1133">You mentioned they were tied up, were…</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: They were tied up.</span> <span id="s1135">I don’t know what they did with them afterwards.</span> <span id="s1136">They burned this camp we were in, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: The British did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: The British.</span> <span id="s1139">That’s that diseased camp, and they gave us the German barracks.</span> <span id="s1140">We were moved right away, this was the first thing.</span> <span id="s1141">But they felt so bad.</span> <span id="s1142">I mean, they meant well when they brought us boxes and food, and our eyes popped, you know.</span> <span id="s1143">But they did not realize what it was going to happen to people.</span> <span id="s1144">But they learned from this mistake, because whenever they have prisoners now, United State prisoners, they don’t give them all that food, they just gave it to them gradually, and reconditioned them gradually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1146">How was your Aunt Mina at that time?</span> <span id="s1147">Was she still sick?</span> <span id="s1148">You mentioned she had typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Well, she was, yeah, she had… she had typhus before I had typhus and I got it afterwards.</span> <span id="s1150">When she had typhus, I still worked in the kitchen and I stole food, and I sent it in with a friend, through the barbed wires, because when I worked, I was not in the same camp, it was divided.</span> <span id="s1151">So she was probably in a semi-conscious state too, because we had nothing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: How long did you stay in Bergen-Belsen altogether?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: I was in Bergen-Belsen… I was transported to Bergen-Belsen from Auschwitz in January 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: ‘44 or ‘45?</span> <span id="s1155">‘44?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: ‘44.</span> <span id="s1157">I was one of the first ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Okay, right.</span> <span id="s1159">Okay, and then after the war ended, how long did you stay in Bergen… I mean, after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: In Bergen-Belsen, after the liberation, my brother came.</span> <span id="s1161">My brother was in the American Army, and I wrote the English letter, and I gave it to a British soldier which I got acquainted with.</span> <span id="s1162">And he sent the letter to England, with his own letter.</span> <span id="s1163">And his mother sent it to Urbachs in Lexington, Kentucky.</span> <span id="s1164">I didn’t remember the street, but I remembered the name, because my mother drilled it into us.</span> <span id="s1165">Whenever, whoever survives, get in touch with Leon Urbach, and there was a, a street also, which I didn’t remember, Lexington, Kentucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: How long…</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: So my brother was in France.</span> <span id="s1168">They, they called him.</span> <span id="s1169">He was in the American Army.</span> <span id="s1170">They called my brother in France, and, and he came to Bergen-Belsen, let’s see, April?</span> <span id="s1171">Don’t remember exactly the month.</span> <span id="s1172">But we left Bergen-Belsen in October ‘45.</span> <span id="s1173">He sent, oh gosh, an ambulance, an American ambulance after us, and a registered nurse, because he didn’t know how we were gonna travel, and he was worried about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: So, April 15th through October, you’re in…</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: I’m in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: …you’re in Bergen-Belsen, and what was…</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: But my brother already was visiting us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Did he spend a long time there with you?</span> <span id="s1179">Or there was…</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: A few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: He spent a few days and he brought food, my God.</span> <span id="s1183">We had a feast.</span> <span id="s1184">And then he had to go back and he couldn’t come back with the ambulance, so he sent that ambulance, and registered nurse, and he took us to Munich, and he rented an apartment for us.</span> <span id="s1185">He didn’t rent it, he evacuated some Germans, told them to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Well, before we go to that, would you tell me a little bit more about what those months in Bergen-Belsen were like for you?</span> <span id="s1187">Were you mainly just recovering your health, and… and resting, or what… what were you doing during those months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Do you know, that’s a good question, what I did those months.</span> <span id="s1189">We just went wild.</span> <span id="s1190">And that’s why they really didn’t just open the… the concentration camp gates and say, “Go.”</span> <span id="s1191">Because, probably we wouldn’t have been responsible what… what we would have done.</span> <span id="s1192">That friend of mine, we got acquainted with some British soldiers, who were standing guard on the gate, and he let us ride the bike around the camp on the outside and I returned it.</span> <span id="s1193">And then one morning, Halina and I, we walked to see how far we can walk.</span> <span id="s1194">Not to get away, just… and we passed some vegetable gardens and we destroyed some of it, some we stole, and then we came to a cherry orchard.</span> <span id="s1195">I don’t know whether I told you about that in the other one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: No, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: And there was a step ladder leaning against the trunk, and I climbed up, and all in a sudden the German came out, and oh, was he cussing me out, that Hitler should have killed all of us.</span> <span id="s1198">That was a cherry orchard, I don’t know how many trees, full of trees.</span> <span id="s1199">I had no bag, all I could do was throw down what I could hold in my hand.</span> <span id="s1200">Halina was down and picking them up.</span> <span id="s1201">So how much can you carry?</span> <span id="s1202">He took the stepladder away, and I got stuck up on top.</span> <span id="s1203">So, luckily, a Jeep, with British soldiers were driving by, and I yelled at them and told them … I spoke a little English, I had about two years in school, and I told them what happened.</span> <span id="s1204">Oh, he got so angry.</span> <span id="s1205">He was cussing the German out, but the German didn’t understand English, so I translated everything for them, and he told him to get that ladder, and no buts about it.</span> <span id="s1206">And they waited till I had the ladder and I came down and they said, “My God, how much could you carry in two hands?”</span> <span id="s1207">you know.</span> <span id="s1208">And they drove away.</span> <span id="s1209">And that German really got me.</span> <span id="s1210">He might have been about maybe 60 - 65, and he said, “Hitler knew what he was doing.</span> <span id="s1211">He should have killed you all.</span> <span id="s1212">Look what you doing to us,” you know.</span> <span id="s1213">I got so mad, I took both hands and put it around his neck, and Halina said, “Do it, do it, do it.”</span> <span id="s1214">And I pressed and I pressed and he was getting kind of pale, and my hand, I had to let go, I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1215">So I didn’t kill him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Was that before the British… that was after…</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: No, after, that was after the British, because I was…</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Oh, you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: …up on the tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: …stuck in the tree.</span> <span id="s1221">Where was…</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: I couldn’t have jumped, I would have broken my neck, it was way up high.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: What did the… where was the British soldier, what did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: They left, they left.</span> <span id="s1225">Because he’s, he knew I was safe and we had the few cherries, and they left, and after they left, that’s when the German start cussing us out, and we should have been dead and Hitler knew what he was doing.</span> <span id="s1226">So that’s all we needed.</span> <span id="s1227">But I’m very thankful I didn’t do it, because I wouldn’t want to carry that with me the rest of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: But you were… were you feeling angry before that?</span> <span id="s1229">I mean you, you described kind of being numb.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Very angry.</span> <span id="s1231">Numb, angry, just everything combined.</span> <span id="s1232">Listen, I was with that monster 12 years, how can you not be angry?</span> <span id="s1233">Just thinking about it now, I get angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Did you… were you feeling happy at all?</span> <span id="s1235">Did you have a sense of… of feeling free?</span> <span id="s1236">That, that you were really liberated, or was that kind of …</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Yeah, yeah, it was a little too much.</span> <span id="s1238">We just wanted to live, that’s what we wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1239">And the best thing was getting out of Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1240">And then I was in Munich and my brother in American Army, had some lovely friends.</span> <span id="s1241">And everybody brought us food and they bought us clothes, and we really had a wonderful time in Munich.</span> <span id="s1242">I went to the opera, my aunt and I, we went to the opera, and concerts, and shows.</span> <span id="s1243">And… it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Do… can you tell me a little bit more about your relationship with your Aunt Mina, who you were so close with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: My Aunt Mina was my mother, really.</span> <span id="s1246">I, I lost my mother while I was still a child, and I was with my Aunt Mina, I worshipped the ground she walked on, to a point that I modeled myself after her.</span> <span id="s1247">My mother was a lovely lady, but I never knew… I thought she was stuck up.</span> <span id="s1248">And then, after my brother married, and I was married, and we had children, I told my brother, we sat down and we talked about the parents and I don’t think we had the same parents even.</span> <span id="s1249">He remembered things I… which were not important to me.</span> <span id="s1250">And I said, “You know Mom was stuck up.</span> <span id="s1251">She had one friend.</span> <span id="s1252">She knew other people, but just one friend.”</span> <span id="s1253">He said, “What you talking about?</span> <span id="s1254">She was so shy.</span> <span id="s1255">She’s,” he said, “What she used to do is that…” and he was my mother’s boy and I was my dad’s little girl.</span> <span id="s1256">So we were divided family.</span> <span id="s1257">She said, “She would snub people first, because she was afraid that they were going to snub her.”</span> <span id="s1258">I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1259">But Mina was so outgoing and so loving, and... and Mina just could give, give, give.</span> <span id="s1260">When we were in the camp, she gave me her bread portion.</span> <span id="s1261">She tells me she was too full, she couldn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s1262">And I didn’t want to take it and then finally she pushed it on me.</span> <span id="s1263">But that’s very giving person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Was she your mother’s younger sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Yeah, but not the youngest.</span> <span id="s1266">In my mother’s family, there were about ten children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: How much younger than your… how, how, how much older than Mina… than you was Mina?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Mina was born in, Mina was born in 1900.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: And I was born in ‘24.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: So she… yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: She was just…</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: 24 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: for… yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: She could have been my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: But I had a third mother, too.</span> <span id="s1279">I’m a lucky person.</span> <span id="s1280">My foster parents.</span> <span id="s1281">They were my parents, and they were wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Back in… in the immediate… the time immediately following the war, how did you learn about what had happened, or… to your father and did you ever…</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: I knew that, right away, what happened to my dad.</span> <span id="s1284">My dad was in a ghetto when they liquidated the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1285">I only saw my parents from 1942 to ‘43, liquidation of the ghetto, only twice.</span> <span id="s1286">And the last time I saw my dad was in that makeshift hospital, with a broken leg.</span> <span id="s1287">And how he broke his leg, they were rounding up some people in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1288">Every so often they just picked up people and they… they’d send them, probably, to Auschwitz, or Treblinka, somewheres.</span> <span id="s1289">Well, they locked them in a room till they had the whole truck full, and my dad jumped out the window.</span> <span id="s1290">And that’s how he broke his leg, and he was in a makeshift hospital.</span> <span id="s1291">And when they liquidated the ghetto, March the 13th, 1943, my first cousin, he was still alive at that time, was in the clean up crew, where they cleaned up the bodies, loaded it on trucks, and he told me that my dad was laying on the sidewalk, in the nude.</span> <span id="s1292">Not just my dad, all the ones they killed.</span> <span id="s1293">And looking back at that, I… I screamed, I cried.</span> <span id="s1294">I didn’t cry that they killed him, they took his pajamas off.</span> <span id="s1295">This was the ultimate, the worst thing could happen, I mean, didn’t even leave the pajamas on.</span> <span id="s1296">It’s so… seems so degrading to me.</span> <span id="s1297">So that’s how… I don’t know what happened to my mother, I don’t.</span> <span id="s1298">I always thought she probably was sent to Auschwitz or somewhere’s gas chamber, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1299">But then, when I saw “Schindler’s List,” that’s… they killed a lot of people in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Did your… how did you find out from your cousin?</span> <span id="s1301">Did… was you cousin in, in, with… when you, with you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Plaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: …in Plaszow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: No, I … when I went up to Plaszow, he was in Plaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Then they sent him somewheres.</span> <span id="s1307">I mean, it’s… it’s mind boggling, you know?</span> <span id="s1308">Just shipped from one place to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: So you knew really, right after your father…</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: I … I knew that, as soon as we went to Plaszow, which was in September.</span> <span id="s1311">That’s when I found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1313">After… so, after the war, when you were in Munich, did you try to find out what had happened to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: Well, the Red Cross, we found out that they had some papers on them… some dates, so I went to the Red Cross in Winchester, and they never could find out what happened.</span> <span id="s1315">They were talking about that the Russian released some papers, way after the war, maybe four or five years ago.</span> <span id="s1316">And I gave them all the dates, and everything I knew about them, you know, where they were, and they couldn’t find out.</span> <span id="s1317">And I still got the letter from the Red Cross here.</span> <span id="s1318">And a letter from the Red Cross in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1319">They also said they never could find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: When you think… if we focus just on that time, immediately after the war, when you were in… in Munich, and… and what your… what your concerns were, and what your hopes were, at that time you weren’t searching for your, for what happened to your mother, or were you, you hadn’t gotten to that point yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Where could I search?</span> <span id="s1322">Where could I search?</span> <span id="s1323">Where would you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Did you think about going back to your hometown, to talk to anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: Hometown, Karlsruhe?</span> <span id="s1326">What was my hometown, Karlsruhe?</span> <span id="s1327">I left Karlsruhe… we had to leave Karlsruhe in ‘39, this was ‘45.</span> <span id="s1328">And how many different camps, and ghetto, and… and factories I was in.</span> <span id="s1329">There was nothing to go back to Karlsruhe for, he killed them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Had you had any, any other relatives in Karlsruhe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Not… not any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: Did you… did you feel at all like Karlsruhe was your home, or was that… all of that erased by… by what happened during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1334">They had a Holocaust reunion in Karlsruhe, 50 years after Crystal Day.</span> <span id="s1335">I did not know anything about, because I was the only survivor in this part of the country.</span> <span id="s1336">And some people I knew in New York, they went, and I met one of them at one of the weddings I went to.</span> <span id="s1337">And she said, “Would you have gone?</span> <span id="s1338">I feel bad.</span> <span id="s1339">I should have notified you, but I didn’t think.”</span> <span id="s1340">I said, “No, I would not have gone.</span> <span id="s1341">I don’t want to go there.”</span> <span id="s1342">My brother went back.</span> <span id="s1343">My brother was with Borden’s export and import, and he was in Europe a lot, so he was close by, and we had a friend, Fritz Öler.</span> <span id="s1344">Before Hitler, he was our friend, then he didn’t know us, you know.</span> <span id="s1345">So he wrote Fritzle a letter, and Fritz wrote him back and he said, “I want you to come home with me, and we going to have dinner together, you meet my wife, you meet my children.”</span> <span id="s1346">And Bernard said wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1347">He wrote him, “I don’t want to go to your home.</span> <span id="s1348">Let’s just meet at the neutral place, in the park, or the depot, just somewheres.”</span> <span id="s1349">Because, too many hard feelings there.</span> <span id="s1350">And they met, and Fritzle was happy, Bernard, he… Bernard wanted to make his peace with Karlsruhe.</span> <span id="s1351">So Fritzle was talking and Bernard was talking, and Fritzle said that his parents were still alive.</span> <span id="s1352">Bernard jumped up, and walked away, didn’t say good-bye or anything.</span> <span id="s1353">He came back to the United States, Sarah my sister-in-law told me, he walked into his home, went to the telephone, calling me, “There is no justice, there is no justice.”</span> <span id="s1354">Fritz Öler… Fritz was like a brother, really.</span> <span id="s1355">We were raised together, and my mother and Frau Öler were close friends.</span> <span id="s1356">And then, when Hitler came to power, her husband became a big wheel in the SS.</span> <span id="s1357">And I was scared of the man.</span> <span id="s1358">I don’t know, I… how can you be that close, and then all in a sudden looking at you like, “I’m going to come at you and kill you?”</span> <span id="s1359">And I got the picture of… well, that’s, the picture wouldn’t help you, and I got… here.</span> <span id="s1360">It’s right in the front.</span> <span id="s1361">Oh-oh.</span> <span id="s1362">That’s Fritzle.</span> <span id="s1363">That’s me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1365">Was he as close with… with your brother as he was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: We were a family.</span> <span id="s1369">I had… really, that’s what I said.</span> <span id="s1370">I was about two or three here, and I was always tall for my age, I might have been three.</span> <span id="s1371">And I… I probably didn’t even know the difference between Fritzle and Bernard, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Did your brother… how did you, how did these pictures survive?</span> <span id="s1373">Did your brother have…</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: No, no, some of it were my brother’s, but you see, we, we left Poland a month before the war.</span> <span id="s1375">My dad was deported to Poland in… see the dates.</span> <span id="s1376">October, ‘38, and we had to leave Karlsruhe by August, ‘39.</span> <span id="s1377">So we had the pictures.</span> <span id="s1378">So, in Poland, my Aunt Mina had a very good friend, we thought.</span> <span id="s1379">She gave her silver to her, fur coat, her china, her linen.</span> <span id="s1380">And the linen, everything was hand monogrammed, even sheets were hand-monogrammed, everything.</span> <span id="s1381">And my aunt gave her everything and her pictures and my pictures.</span> <span id="s1382">So my Aunt Mina had the maid before the war, so after the war was over with, Mina wrote to Yulche [ph], the maid, to go to the people and tell them that she was alive and then that Mina was going to call her or talk to her, how to ship that… her stuff here to the United States.</span> <span id="s1383">So when Yulche went there, the woman opened the door and she… and Yulche said that Mina was alive, and she said, “Oh, that poor woman is still alive?”</span> <span id="s1384">She said, “Well, you write her that right after she left all that stuff with me, the German came and took everything away.</span> <span id="s1385">I do have the pictures.”</span> <span id="s1386">So, we were so thankful for those pictures, because the other stuff was material things, you can live without it, but the pictures, Mina… we really were happy.</span> <span id="s1387">And a lot of those pictures are my Aunt Mina’s.</span> <span id="s1388">Have you ever seen a picture of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Here.</span> <span id="s1391">Look, I play.</span> <span id="s1392">That’s me, here.</span> <span id="s1393">Oh, let’s see, where is my Aunt Mina?</span> <span id="s1394">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1395">That’s my Uncle Alec, Mina’s husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: It’s Leon Urbach, the people who sponsored us.</span> <span id="s1398">That’s Leon’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: What happened to him?</span> <span id="s1400">What happened…</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: …to Alec.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Alec, Uncle Alec, and Silvusha, Sylvia Frederica, they were taken away in ‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: We… we came home… There’s Mina.</span> <span id="s1406">Oh, she was sharp.</span> <span id="s1407">And that was the little girl, here’s Mina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: There’s the family, Uncle Alec, Mina, and Silvusha.</span> <span id="s1410">Her name is Sylvia Frederica.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Sylvia Frederica is Mina’s daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: And she… she and Alec…</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Alec were taken from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: …were taken from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: In ‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s1418">Yeah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: That’s her.</span> <span id="s1420">Those are my mother’s three sister.</span> <span id="s1421">That’s Mina, that’s Lola, and that’s Gustie.</span> <span id="s1422">And those are my cousins.</span> <span id="s1423">That’s Sharon, she got killed.</span> <span id="s1424">That’s Silvusha, Sylvia.</span> <span id="s1425">And that’s my cousin Janek, the one Goeth shot in Plaszow, think I told you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Oh yes, you did tell…</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Do you have all of these photographs labeled on the back for your… for your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1430">Sandy pretty much knows who they are, pretty much.</span> <span id="s1431">Maybe I… that’s what I should do.</span> <span id="s1432">I don’t know, some of them I think are, some of them are not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Yeah, I see, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1434">Well, was this… how did this album… was this album in your brother’s hands, or how did it come to you?</span> <span id="s1435">Have you had… kept it all of these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: I kept the pictures, I just did this… I think I did it not too long ago, before… oh, maybe a year ago, I put it all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Well, let’s go back… you can put the album down, but let’s, let’s go back to Munich, and tell me how you, how you felt about being in Germany, at all, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Munich, I didn’t even think where I was, I was free, I was wild, and just go, go, go, go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Were you… did you have hopes or dreams of what would come next…</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: …what things that you want to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: No, no, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1443">People say, hadn’t you thought about going back to school?</span> <span id="s1444">I said, “No, I wanted to live.”</span> <span id="s1445">That, that, that’s the only thing, I mean 12 years out of your life, I didn’t have a teenage life.</span> <span id="s1446">I been…</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Did you date people in Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Yeah, but not single dates.</span> <span id="s1449">I mean, all my... brother’s friends, American soldiers, they took us just all the time.</span> <span id="s1450">And then I got a lot of company from Bergen-Belsen, people came to visit me, people I was in the camp with, they came to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: What was the atmosphere in Munich like?</span> <span id="s1452">Were there a lot of refugees, a lot of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: Oh, there were a lot of refugees, and there was a museum where the refugees met.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: You all met at... at a museum, the refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Yeah, that’s... yeah, yeah, that’s all some...</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: And... And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: And, but the atmosphere, the Germans... I got my period again, which I didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1459">I always thought they put something in our food, but Stuart told me, and Bernard also said no.</span> <span id="s1460">I needed everything to survive, that’s why we didn’t have our period.</span> <span id="s1461">And I was flooding, and then finally Mina got scared and Bernard got the German doctor, and he did not know I was a survivor.</span> <span id="s1462">And he start talking about the Jews and how horrible, what they doing in Munich.</span> <span id="s1463">We were loud.</span> <span id="s1464">We really were loud.</span> <span id="s1465">I mean, you locked up... look, even an animal, you let an animal out, they gonna go wild, you know, you cooped up.</span> <span id="s1466">We were loud.</span> <span id="s1467">We didn’t bother anybody, but we were laughing loud, whatever we did, talking loud.</span> <span id="s1468">And I spoke German to him, with a Badenzer [ph] accent and he thought I was Bernard’s girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1469">And, so finally he gave some medicine and I told him to get out, and I told him who I was.</span> <span id="s1470">He didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1471">So that was after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Did you get the, the impression in general that, that the Germans just didn’t know what happened, or that they knew what happened and they didn’t care?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: No, they knew, they didn’t care, and it’s convenient not to know.</span> <span id="s1474">Don’t tell me the little towns near Bergen-Belsen, the people didn’t know what happened?</span> <span id="s1475">What about Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1476">We had to walk a mile, they never let you out on the… in the main depot and it was always at night, wherever we went.</span> <span id="s1477">They never let you out in the main depot during the day, it was always at night.</span> <span id="s1478">As soon as we got out, that… the, the cattle wagon, we knew we were where, because far away, we saw the chimneys burning.</span> <span id="s1479">Now you telling me that… that the… they didn’t know?</span> <span id="s1480">They knew, they just didn’t want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: You knew you were going to be leaving for America at some point, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Scared.</span> <span id="s1485">It was scary.</span> <span id="s1486">I mean, people I didn’t know, and you don’t know how you’re going to be treated, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s1487">But I just was a very lucky girl.</span> <span id="s1488">Because they took me in right away, they took to me.</span> <span id="s1489">And Dolly, their daughter, said, “It’s unfair, I have a curfew on a date.</span> <span id="s1490">Sylvia can go and she can stay out.”</span> <span id="s1491">She was jealous of me, you know.</span> <span id="s1492">But then, she didn’t realize I was older.</span> <span id="s1493">But they were, they were wonderful to the day they died.</span> <span id="s1494">I loved them dearly.</span> <span id="s1495">And I still miss them, like Mother’s Day, I always called them.</span> <span id="s1496">At that time, towards the end, they lived in Florida.</span> <span id="s1497">From Lexington, moved to Louisville, from Louisville, in a condominium in Florida.</span> <span id="s1498">And then, they had two condominiums, next to each other, so there was somebody always could watch over them, when they were older.</span> <span id="s1499">And then they went into a small apartment, and they both said, “You know, we now where we started from.”</span> <span id="s1500">In a small apartment when they first were married.</span> <span id="s1501">But Mother’s Day, birthdays, I always called them.</span> <span id="s1502">And Leon was so hard of hearing and I just miss it.</span> <span id="s1503">Rose always answered the telephone, and she would yell, “Leon, Leon,” you know.</span> <span id="s1504">Took awhile for him to hear, but I miss that.</span> <span id="s1505">And I always told them, I said, “My God, you took such a chance, taking a stranger in.”</span> <span id="s1506">And they brought my brother from England, too, in 1940, and Bernard was drafted in ‘41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: Did your aunt, your Aunt Mina come with you to…</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Lexington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Lexington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: We lived… well, it was my Aunt Mina’s brother and sister-in-law, but I was not related to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Going back a little to your, to your journey, or to right before your journey to the U.S., what, what were your ideas about the United States?</span> <span id="s1514">What did you expect to experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: I didn’t even think of the experience.</span> <span id="s1516">I met a lot of young people.</span> <span id="s1517">My Aunt Mina was seasick from the second day.</span> <span id="s1518">They, I don’t know, they were… after you were after 40, they got a cabin, and we had bunkbeds, we were a whole lot in one room.</span> <span id="s1519">And I met a lot of people, and we had a good time on the boat, so we had to entertain ourselves, because this was not a luxury line, Marine Perch was just a ship.</span> <span id="s1520">And there was one little room.</span> <span id="s1521">But we had fun.</span> <span id="s1522">Like, I met a fellow on the boat, he drank a whole bottle of ketchup.</span> <span id="s1523">Just showing off, and laughing, you know, it’s… I didn’t think that far, till we got to New York and somebody had to pick you up.</span> <span id="s1524">It took us 11 days to come over, because they had some mines, and all in a sudden we just stopped, but they didn’t tell us why.</span> <span id="s1525">And then they finally deactivated it, and then they told us what happen.</span> <span id="s1526">We could have been blown up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: You mentioned that you met… in the first interview, you told something about the journey and you mentioned that you met a Hungarian, a young Hungarian man who had proposed…</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Yeah, that’s the one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: …marriage to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: He’s the one who drank the ketchup?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: He drank the ketchup.</span> <span id="s1533">I thought that was great.</span> <span id="s1534">Stupid now, you know.</span> <span id="s1535">He, he was kind of wild, too.</span> <span id="s1536">We all were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Did you want to marry him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: No.</span> <span id="s1539">I wasn’t ready for marriage.</span> <span id="s1540">It would have been the biggest mistake in the world.</span> <span id="s1541">My aunt, right away, I was telling her.</span> <span id="s1542">She said, “You know why?</span> <span id="s1543">He’s afraid to go to a strange country, to be alone.”</span> <span id="s1544">That probably was the reason.</span> <span id="s1545">But we did spend a lot of time together on the, on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Did you see… do you remember approaching the harbor in New York?</span> <span id="s1547">Did you see the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Yes, I remember the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1549">I had the camera, and it was a good camera, my, my brother got it for me.</span> <span id="s1550">Akvakarat [ph].</span> <span id="s1551">I don’t think they make them any more now, it was a German camera.</span> <span id="s1552">And I looked and oh, I saw the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1553">When I had it developed, it was nothing but water, I was too far away.</span> <span id="s1554">You couldn’t see the statue, it just water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: Do you remember how you felt seeing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: Yes, I got goose bumps.</span> <span id="s1557">So… excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s1559">Okay, you were saying about the, the… seeing the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1560">Did you feel the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Yeah, I… I got chills, I really did.</span> <span id="s1562">It’s… then, as you dock, somebody had to pick you up.</span> <span id="s1563">If the sponsors couldn’t do it, then they had to send somebody.</span> <span id="s1564">You had to be claimed.</span> <span id="s1565">And Mina and I, and we waited and we waited and we waited, and nobody came.</span> <span id="s1566">And I start crying.</span> <span id="s1567">But the nicest thing happened also.</span> <span id="s1568">A woman came up and she said, “You Sylvia Farber?”</span> <span id="s1569">And I said yes, I looked at her, she said, “I’m Berndt Weissman’s mother, you went to school,” we went to Jewish school together.</span> <span id="s1570">And she said, “I didn’t have you on my list, but I looked at the list and I saw Sylvia Farber.”</span> <span id="s1571">And she said, “I just want to thank you so much, you were so nice to my Bernd.”</span> <span id="s1572">He had a speech defect.</span> <span id="s1573">And people, children can be so cruel, they didn’t want to have anything to do with a… with people who are a little bit different.</span> <span id="s1574">He was brilliant, and I remember I liked Bernd.</span> <span id="s1575">And when he spoke to me, his speech wasn’t as bad, because he got used to me, you know, and, and he knew I liked him.</span> <span id="s1576">So, she thanked me.</span> <span id="s1577">She said, “I saw your name, and I wanted to thank you personally, and then also wish you well.”</span> <span id="s1578">She said, “We been in New York,” her husband was a doctor… doctor while in Karlsruhe.</span> <span id="s1579">So that was kind of nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: It must have been…</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: It… it’s a good feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: …a nice way to be greeted…</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: …to, to a new country, to have something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: So, we were the last ones getting off the boat.</span> <span id="s1586">We were claimed.</span> <span id="s1587">It’s almost like having a claim check, you know?</span> <span id="s1588">It was my cousin, who looks exactly like my dad and my, my brother.</span> <span id="s1589">The Farber is very predominant, know most of them are gone now.</span> <span id="s1590">But he came, I knew him from Karlsruhe, so they did claim me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: So he, he… did he escape before the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: Benjamin used to live in Karlsruhe and then they moved to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Sorry, what was his full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: Benjamin Farber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: And they moved to Holland.</span> <span id="s1597">I don’t think he was in a camp.</span> <span id="s1598">I really… he’s still alive in New York, once in awhile I talk to him.</span> <span id="s1599">I don’t know, he might have come to the United States before, I think.</span> <span id="s1600">I am not sure.</span> <span id="s1601">There’s so much in there, you know.</span> <span id="s1602">It goes round and round.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: So he picked you up, and did you… where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: And some cousins, I met some cousins, first cousins.</span> <span id="s1605">And I, I went home with them, we stayed the whole week.</span> <span id="s1606">And they treated us like royalty.</span> <span id="s1607">We saw Broadway show, it was just too bad we couldn’t understand it too much.</span> <span id="s1608">But then, on my honeymoon, I went back to see it, like Mr. Roberts, Annie Get Your Gun.</span> <span id="s1609">Then, I already understood a lot better.</span> <span id="s1610">And they took us to fabulous restaurants, and the food, my God, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1611">So, my… I really would have loved to stay in New York.</span> <span id="s1612">I loved the hustle and the bustle, at that time, not any more now.</span> <span id="s1613">And my brother wouldn’t let me.</span> <span id="s1614">He said, “We going to Lexington, Kentucky, what’s left of our family, and we going to stay there, and we going to be close together.”</span> <span id="s1615">So I stayed in Lexington then Winchester, he lived in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1616">He deserted me then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: So you stayed in New York for just a week before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: A week, a week, my aunt and I, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1620">And did you, how did you get to Lexington from, from New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: George Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Do you remember the journey?</span> <span id="s1625">Do you remember traveling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Yes, yes, I remember it very well, because it was after the war, there were no seats on the train, people stood up.</span> <span id="s1627">And the ladies’ rest room, they had a couch there.</span> <span id="s1628">And we had the nerve, Mina and I, we lay down on the couch.</span> <span id="s1629">It was for somebody who got sick.</span> <span id="s1630">But we were so exhausted, we fell asleep on the couch, and nobody woke us up, till we… till the night was over with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: And you didn’t speak English at that point, or just a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Very little, very.</span> <span id="s1633">I had two years of English in school.</span> <span id="s1634">But the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Did Mina speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: No, Mina didn’t speak any English.</span> <span id="s1637">Mina spoke German fluently, and Polish, but not English.</span> <span id="s1638">But she learned, and Leon was so proud of her.</span> <span id="s1639">After they moved, and we wrote letters to him, every so often when we talked, “She wrote a masterpiece.”</span> <span id="s1640">Do you know he corrected every letter I wrote him?</span> <span id="s1641">And not to be mean or anything, just to learn.</span> <span id="s1642">And the last letter he corrected, there was no correction, he wrote, “It was perfect.”</span> <span id="s1643">And oh wow, I was in seventh heaven.</span> <span id="s1644">My friends said, “This is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1645">I wouldn’t write to him.</span> <span id="s1646">This is not very nice.”</span> <span id="s1647">I said, “You don’t understand him, he’s trying to teach me.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Do you remember seeing… you’re on the train, you’re traveling between New York and Lexington, do you remember looking at the landscape out of the window, or see… approaching…</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: There were… There was a mob on the train.</span> <span id="s1650">People sat on their suitcases.</span> <span id="s1651">It was just right after the war.</span> <span id="s1652">Soldiers coming back.</span> <span id="s1653">I don’t even think we were near a window, couldn’t even get near a window, had… would have to climb over people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: What about arriving in, in Lexington?</span> <span id="s1655">Can you talk about your first impressions of the… well, where did the train arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: You know, that’s getting kind… Lexington Depot.</span> <span id="s1657">They had the depot in Main Street.</span> <span id="s1658">It’s very dim, I don’t remember that much.</span> <span id="s1659">I was so scared.</span> <span id="s1660">We both were scared, Mina and I, we talked about that.</span> <span id="s1661">But Urbach picked, picked us up at the, the train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: How did you feel about meeting them, did you… was it…</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1665">So it didn’t click right away, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Well, they were wonderful right away.</span> <span id="s1667">We had our own room, and she was very thoughtful.</span> <span id="s1668">She… right away, she start teaching, after a few days, you know.</span> <span id="s1669">They send… they paid for picture show, we saw every new picture show, just to sit through, to get used to the English language.</span> <span id="s1670">Then she went to Henry Clay High School in Lexington, and, so we could attend…</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: She… Mina, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: You…</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Rose Urbach, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: Rose, oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: And we went there for a few hours every day, we’d sit through English classes, American government classes.</span> <span id="s1677">She arranged all that.</span> <span id="s1678">They did not have night classes at the University Kentucky at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: Were you going for a high school diploma at Henry Clay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: No, no, just to get the feel of the language, it’s… the sound is so different, you know, it… do you speak languages?</span> <span id="s1681">Any foreign languages?</span> <span id="s1682">But the, the sound is different, and the sentence construction in German and English, is just the opposite.</span> <span id="s1683">When I first came, and I thought in German and had to translate it into English, it seemed like I always put the cart before the horse, it seems like it.</span> <span id="s1684">It just always lost something in the translation, or it was wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: What language did you speak to the Urbachs with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: Well, she start teaching right away, like she said, “Sylvia, we going to set the table.</span> <span id="s1687">This is a plate, this is a napkin.</span> <span id="s1688">Fork, spoon and knife.”</span> <span id="s1689">And then she would add something to it all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: She would always speak to you in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1693">Did she…</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Leon spoke a little bit of German.</span> <span id="s1695">He’d always, “Yah, yah, yah.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Tell me about what you thought of Lexington.</span> <span id="s1697">What did you… what did it see… what kind of town was it?</span> <span id="s1698">What…</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: I loved Lexington.</span> <span id="s1700">It was a small town.</span> <span id="s1701">In ‘46, it had 65,000 people, and now it’s bulging out in the seams, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s1702">People were very friendly.</span> <span id="s1703">And then, Mina and I, we were a novelty.</span> <span id="s1704">I went... had to go to work in December, and I applied in factories, but they wouldn’t take me, because I didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s1705">Times have changed.</span> <span id="s1706">If it be now, your language has nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s1707">But Dolly Urbach, that’s Rose’s daughter, she had a friend, Phyllis Strauss, and her uncle and her mother were owners of Wolf Wile’s, downtown Lexington.</span> <span id="s1708">I got a job there, in, wrapping packages, it was December ‘46.</span> <span id="s1709">And I wasn’t very happy, because I felt like it was demeaning.</span> <span id="s1710">I said, “You’re not that stupid.”</span> <span id="s1711">Talked to myself.</span> <span id="s1712">“You can do better than that.”</span> <span id="s1713">So I always sneaked out, and tried to wait on customers, and Joe said, “Come on, Sylvia.”</span> <span id="s1714">He was very kind, he knew my past.</span> <span id="s1715">And that’s why he gave me the job, also.</span> <span id="s1716">And so, by April I was on the floor, waiting on customers.</span> <span id="s1717">And the first year, I had the most sale for the year, and the second year the most sale.</span> <span id="s1718">People were curious, so they waited for me.</span> <span id="s1719">They…</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: They knew something about your, your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Well, it was in the paper.</span> <span id="s1722">Refugees, survivors, you know.</span> <span id="s1723">I was the on… we were the only ones in Lexington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Did people come in and, and ask you about what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s1726">They just wanted to see me, like I was a novelty, and no, they didn’t ask.</span> <span id="s1727">And I would not, not have been ready to talk what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1728">It took years and years before I was able to talk.</span> <span id="s1729">I didn’t talk about it until ‘83.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: Were the customers… what, what kind of things were you selling there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: It was a ladies’ department store.</span> <span id="s1732">It was more exclusive, and children’s clothing and china.</span> <span id="s1733">It was like a department store.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: Did you feel any… a sense of antisemitism from anyone in, in town, in Lexington, when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: No.</span> <span id="s1736">This is really strange.</span> <span id="s1737">I found it more in Winchester than I did in Lexington.</span> <span id="s1738">When I first married Jake, and they didn’t even know about my past, because I had problems enough.</span> <span id="s1739">My children were different.</span> <span id="s1740">So I, I didn’t think… I didn’t want to load that on them, being a survivor, also.</span> <span id="s1741">And this wasn’t made public until ‘83, till I make a documentary, with Dr. Otis Singletary, he was the moderator, and three survivors and two liberators.</span> <span id="s1742">So that was on television, then they found out.</span> <span id="s1743">I don’t know, Winchester… I changed my mind.</span> <span id="s1744">I really don’t know whether it was that much antisemitism, as it was ignorance, and also, they didn’t like strangers.</span> <span id="s1745">They wanted Winchester to stay a little town.</span> <span id="s1746">They didn’t like strangers, because I have talked to people who came, and they were not Jews, and they had the same feeling, that they were not treated right.</span> <span id="s1747">And I said, “I always thought they were anti-Semitic.”</span> <span id="s1748">But there were a lot of rich farmers here, who did not want industry, they tried to keep it out… keep them out, till they couldn’t keep them out any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: So, you didn’t hear anything, any comment, comments about the Jews when you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: In Lexington, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: In Lexington, or in the… and did you, do you, did you have the sense that people knew what had happened during the war in Europe, what had happened to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: We just never talked about it.</span> <span id="s1753">I don’t know, maybe I thought it would go away.</span> <span id="s1754">I just wasn’t ready.</span> <span id="s1755">I wasn’t even ready in ‘83, if not Marilyn Moosnick.</span> <span id="s1756">She said, “You owe it, to do that.”</span> <span id="s1757">And I told her, I said, about the documentary, I said, “I don’t know, I might cry.”</span> <span id="s1758">She said, “Well, it’s not going to be on live, anyway.”</span> <span id="s1759">And the reason for it was, that in ‘81, there was a history teacher at Tate’s Creek High School, who said the Holocaust never happened, it was a war.</span> <span id="s1760">So this, well, they were trying to do it in ‘81, and I wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1761">And then, Dr. David Widstein approached me, and I said, “David, I can’t do it, I might cry.”</span> <span id="s1762">He said, “No, you couldn’t cry with Dr. Singletary there,” you know.</span> <span id="s1763">And so he dropped it.</span> <span id="s1764">But then Marilyn took it in hand, and she used a lot of psychology on me, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: I’d like to talk more about that in a little while, but I… stick with the chronology more and, and talk about right when you arrived in Lexington and, and some of those experiences.</span> <span id="s1766">Where did you, where did the Urbachs live, what neighborhood was that, or what was their address?</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: They lived Fontaine Road, Chevy Chase area.</span> <span id="s1768">They lived on Irvine Road, and my brother was discharged from the Army in ‘86, September ’86 [fn: 46].</span> <span id="s1769">He could have been discharged six months before, but he signed up as a civilian with the American Army, so he wanted to make sure that Mina and I would be out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1770">He was afraid that we didn’t have enough pull or push or what.</span> <span id="s1771">So then he was discharged in September of ‘46, and we got an apartment.</span> <span id="s1772">So we weren’t that long with the Urbachs.</span> <span id="s1773">We came in June.</span> <span id="s1774">July, August, September, about three months.</span> <span id="s1775">They didn’t want us to leave.</span> <span id="s1776">They didn’t think we were ready, but we wanted to be on our own.</span> <span id="s1777">And we managed, believe it or not, on 90 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s1778">That was my brother’s Army pay.</span> <span id="s1779">And then, he would give private lesson, he spoke seven languages fluently, so he would give private lessons.</span> <span id="s1780">And then he caught the flu and he couldn’t get over it, and sometimes he didn’t get two or three hours of sleep at night.</span> <span id="s1781">And he was very sick with that flu, and the doctor said, “Something has to give.</span> <span id="s1782">You have to take better care of you.”</span> <span id="s1783">And that’s when Mina and I, we went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: Did Mina work at the same place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1786">My Aunt Mina got acquainted with people who had a photo shop, sold cameras and tripods and bulbs and everything.</span> <span id="s1787">And she developed pictures.</span> <span id="s1788">And she was very good at it, and she was a wonderful worker and they liked her so much, that my Aunt Mina was sick with cancer for four years off and on, she would go back to work.</span> <span id="s1789">And even if she didn’t work, he paid her to the end, till she died.</span> <span id="s1790">But she was a… a very dedicated worker.</span> <span id="s1791">They went to England for a vacation and Mina ran the store.</span> <span id="s1792">Very loyal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: Did you… did you develop ties with the Jewish community in Lexington in those early days in the… did the Urbachs take you to synagogue with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: Yeah, the temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: The temple.</span> <span id="s1797">I wasn’t too happy, but the… I was an atheist anyway.</span> <span id="s1798">I come from a Orthodox home, but after the war I was an… an atheist.</span> <span id="s1799">I blamed God for everything.</span> <span id="s1800">And I did go to the temple with them, but somehow I didn’t feel that comfortable, because I was used to seeing the men wearing yarmulkes, skullcaps, and at the temple, at that time, the Rabbi Lewis, he was ultra, ultra, ultra Reformed, that if you wore a hat, you took it off before you went inside.</span> <span id="s1801">So, but I went, it was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Was this Adath Israel, or... what was the temple?</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Rabbi Adland.</span> <span id="s1806">But he... he seems like he is more religious.</span> <span id="s1807">And I really do think the Reform is leaning towards... more to the Conservative, because they’re having Bar Mitzvahs now, which they used to not to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1809">You mentioned in the first interview, I’m just going back a little bit to something that you mentioned, that, that in the early years of the war, when you were in Plaszow...</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: You, you had been keeping kosher up until then, and then you couldn’t keep kosher any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: No, it was at Kabelwerk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Right, okay, Kabelwerk…</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: It was at Kabelwerk, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: Right, okay.</span> <span id="s1816">And then did you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Well, what happened was, I worked, and at that time we... we got the pretty good soup, usually it was just one...</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: ...but it wasn’t just cooked for us, because there were a lot Gentile working there too, in that factory.</span> <span id="s1820">So, we got the same soup, but I wouldn’t go and get it, because it was not kosher.</span> <span id="s1821">So I went home and I dragged.</span> <span id="s1822">And my dad said, “Didn’t they give you anything to eat?”</span> <span id="s1823">I said... we used to call him Papa, my dad.</span> <span id="s1824">“Papa, it’s not kosher, I couldn’t eat it.”</span> <span id="s1825">He said, “You have to eat it.</span> <span id="s1826">It’s a sin, it’s almost like committing suicide.</span> <span id="s1827">You have to eat to keep yourself alive.”</span> <span id="s1828">So, the second day, I ate, but it wouldn’t stay down, it came up quicker than I ate it.</span> <span id="s1829">And so I came home and I dragged even worse.</span> <span id="s1830">He said, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s1831">I told him.</span> <span id="s1832">He said, “You going to be all right.</span> <span id="s1833">Tomorrow it’s going to stay down and you’ll be fine.”</span> <span id="s1834">And it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: After the war ended, you... you mentioned that you were angry at God…</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Did you... did you get to a point where you thought...</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q:... of changing your diet again, back towards being kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: We were not kosher in Lexington.</span> <span id="s1843">We were lucky to buy a pound of hamburger a week.</span> <span id="s1844">Ate a lot of potatoes.</span> <span id="s1845">So, no, even... the only reason I start keeping kosher is because Jake’s father wouldn’t eat at my place.</span> <span id="s1846">And Jake even asked me, I mean, he knew about how I felt.</span> <span id="s1847">And he said, “You want to keep kosher or not, that’s up to you.”</span> <span id="s1848">I said, “Well,” I said, “almost have to keep kosher, if not, your dad couldn’t eat in our house, and that’d be awful, you know.”</span> <span id="s1849">So I start keeping kosher, and I knew all about it, because I was raised that way.</span> <span id="s1850">And then when you first start out, you just divide your dishes.</span> <span id="s1851">It, it was simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: Did you form – you, you mentioned that you were... that you were dating a little bit, before you met Jake?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: Yeah, but way before, when I first came, it wasn’t single dates that much.</span> <span id="s1854">People didn’t single date that much, it was group.</span> <span id="s1855">And, like a group, I was running around with a group from the university, they have an organization, Hillel there.</span> <span id="s1856">It’s connected... I don’t think it’s just a temple, I think it’s just the Jewish children on the campus.</span> <span id="s1857">And I went to parties, but it was mostly groups.</span> <span id="s1858">But I met a lot and some were nicer than others, and I don’t know whether I told you in the other one, I wore hand-me-downs, and it is not very pleasant...</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Sylvia Green.</span> <span id="s1861">You were just talking about being at a Hillel dance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: And you were going to tell something about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Well, I think I told you about the hand-me-downs, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: You just mentioned it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Yeah, so I wore a hand-me-down, and the girl who gave it to me, her name was Shirley, I will not mention the last name.</span> <span id="s1867">She doesn’t live here, she lives somewheres else now.</span> <span id="s1868">And out the blue sky, all happy, talking, dancing, and then the whole group, we were to... having a Coke, or whatever it was, and she said, “Oh, you see Sylvia’s dress?”</span> <span id="s1869">And they all looked, “Yes, what?”</span> <span id="s1870">“Don’t you remember I bought it last year, and I really didn’t like it, and I gave it to Sylvia.”</span> <span id="s1871">Now, how do you think a young girl feels?</span> <span id="s1872">I wanted the... the ground to open up and swallow me up, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: Mm, like you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: So one of the guys, I..</span> <span id="s1875">.</span> <span id="s1876">I know his name was Abie Guller [ph], because I met him in Munich, he was in American Army, and my brother knew him from Lexington.</span> <span id="s1877">He said, “Shirley, I remember that dress when you wore it last year.</span> <span id="s1878">It sure looked like hell on you, but Sylvia looks beautiful.”</span> <span id="s1879">I want to hug and kiss him, which I didn’t, you know.</span> <span id="s1880">So, that was not very pleasant.</span> <span id="s1881">Now, some other... there’s another girl, that Strauss, I told you Phyllis.</span> <span id="s1882">I audited some classes at the University Kentucky, I think it was two or three times in the morning, from eight till nine.</span> <span id="s1883">I supposed to be at work at ten minutes to nine, because I had to take the mail around to different departments.</span> <span id="s1884">But I talked to Joe Wile, my boss, he said, “That’s all right.”</span> <span id="s1885">Well, Phyllis would pick me up before eight o’clock, take me to class, was waiting... she was going university at that time, too... was waiting for me, and took me to work.</span> <span id="s1886">And I told her that not long ago, about three years ago, she lives in Boca Raton, Florida now.</span> <span id="s1887">But Jake passed away, she donated to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1888">My brother passed away, she donated to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1889">I said, “You know, you were something.”</span> <span id="s1890">I said, “You picked me up,” she said, “Sylvia, I don’t remember.”</span> <span id="s1891">So she said, “So it was not that big a deal.”</span> <span id="s1892">She said, “If I would have had classes, it’d be a different story.</span> <span id="s1893">Evidently, I didn’t have classes, so I was glad to do it.”</span> <span id="s1894">So, not everybody is bad, not everybody is good, you know.</span> <span id="s1895">All kinds of people in this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1897">Did you interact at all with non-Jews in the community?</span> <span id="s1898">With Gentiles in Lexington?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: Girls, yes.</span> <span id="s1900">I went out to lunch when I worked at Wolf Wile’s, and they ate out every day, but I couldn’t afford it.</span> <span id="s1901">I only could eat out once a week, because the money I made and my... my aunt and my brother, we all pooled together.</span> <span id="s1902">And they figured out I could eat out once a week.</span> <span id="s1903">So I went with them, ate out.</span> <span id="s1904">But I went, and I had the sandwich with me, and I went to restaurants with them, and they let me eat my sandwich and had a glass of water.</span> <span id="s1905">I don’t know whether I drank coffee at that time, or not, or milk, and paid for that.</span> <span id="s1906">But they didn’t object, the restaurants.</span> <span id="s1907">They knew.</span> <span id="s1908">Yeah, I met some nice people.</span> <span id="s1909">Dating, no, not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: How long had you been in Lexington before you met Jake?</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: I met Jake in ‘47.</span> <span id="s1912">I think it was September ‘47.</span> <span id="s1913">His cousin lived a half a block from us, Martha Steinberg.</span> <span id="s1914">And Mina, my aunt Mina and Martha got very close.</span> <span id="s1915">And naturally then, I was close.</span> <span id="s1916">And she always said, “I have a cousin, a first cousin.”</span> <span id="s1917">Jake and Martha were more like brothers and sisters, because when Jake’s mother died, Jake went to live with Martha and her parents, so he could say special prayers in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1918">It’s called kaddish and you need ten men, at that time.</span> <span id="s1919">Now women count, too.</span> <span id="s1920">And so, they felt more like brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s1921">And I told her, I said, “Well, I’m going with that fellow in New York.”</span> <span id="s1922">And she was just after me and after me, so George and I had an understanding that we were going to date other people, since we were that far apart, to learn about the American way.</span> <span id="s1923">And, so the first night we went out, he took me dancing, we had a marvelous time.</span> <span id="s1924">I always said, “How could you understand me?”</span> <span id="s1925">We spoke... spoke some German, some little Yiddish, sounds like German, he understood Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1926">And then English.</span> <span id="s1927">He said he understood me very well.</span> <span id="s1928">So, it was September ‘47, and we married January the 16th, ‘49.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: Did he... did he ask you about your experiences during the war, or did you talk to him about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: I don’t think that... I don’t remember, but I don’t think I talked... we talked about it when we dated.</span> <span id="s1931">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1932">But after we were married, we wanted children pretty soon, because he was 34, I was 24, and when I got pregnant with Jerry, that was when the nightmares started.</span> <span id="s1933">And he would come with dry, clean pajamas and a towel, and he sponged me off with a washcloth.</span> <span id="s1934">He changed the sheets, it just went through.</span> <span id="s1935">The nightmare was the German came to take my baby away and kill it, because I saw many babies killed and they did not use bullets, they just threw them against the wall, because they couldn’t waste bullets.</span> <span id="s1936">So, that’s when we talked, usually after I got... he got me all dried off and everything, we would sit on the couch in the living room, and many nights we never went back to sleep, and he didn’t either.</span> <span id="s1937">And all the time I lived with that man, he never complained.</span> <span id="s1938">He didn’t let me sleep, because it was even later on at times, I needed to talk.</span> <span id="s1939">His ear was always there.</span> <span id="s1940">One time I told him, I said, “I don’t know whether you’re listening, but your ear is there.”</span> <span id="s1941">I just needed the ear, you know.</span> <span id="s1942">No, he was... he was a good soul, he really was.</span> <span id="s1943">I was fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: Tell me something about your wedding.</span> <span id="s1945">What was that... Where did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: I’m already... We got married in Laurel, we were without a rabbi, and my brother Bernard paid for the wedding.</span> <span id="s1947">We had a sit-down dinner, just immediate family.</span> <span id="s1948">And he paid 300 dollars, and was kosher.</span> <span id="s1949">And the rabbi performed, it was my brother’s friend, and he hired a cantor.</span> <span id="s1950">And I got married in a suit.</span> <span id="s1951">I could have bought... I only could get a wedding dress or a suit, and I was very practical and I got the suit, which I wore years afterwards.</span> <span id="s1952">I’ve got pictures, I got wedding pictures, I show you later on.</span> <span id="s1953">You see, Jake was a large family.</span> <span id="s1954">There were... there were four children, and their wives, and his nieces and nephews.</span> <span id="s1955">And Urbachs, Rose and Leon, and Grandma, Rose’s mother, and my Aunt Mina, so it was... was a crowd.</span> <span id="s1956">But he paid for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: Had Jake been in this area for a long time, his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: Jake was born here in Winchester.</span> <span id="s1959">They had the business downtown.</span> <span id="s1960">When he was born, Pop, his father, already was in business.</span> <span id="s1961">It was a small Mom and Pop store, with everything in there.</span> <span id="s1962">And he was raised on top of tobacco cotton.</span> <span id="s1963">They had those like bales, you know, rolled up.</span> <span id="s1964">That’s where... where... where they raised him, right on top of the... the tobacco cotton.</span> <span id="s1965">It’s a miracle he didn’t fall off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: And did Jake carry on in that business then?</span> <span id="s1967">Was he working in the family business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1969">His sister was also.</span> <span id="s1970">What happened was, he graduated from University Kentucky, in ‘36, and he couldn’t get a job.</span> <span id="s1971">So he just fell in there, and then he was too lazy to get out.</span> <span id="s1972">So, he just stayed in there.</span> <span id="s1973">He always said, “We never going to be rich.</span> <span id="s1974">You’re going to have a roof over your head, you’re going to have food on the table.”</span> <span id="s1975">And that’s what we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: What was the name of the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: The Hub Store.</span> <span id="s1978">Hub.</span> <span id="s1979">H-u-b.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: The Hub Store.</span> <span id="s1982">Joe Green.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: Here in…</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: On Main…</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Here in Winchester.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: Yeah, on Main Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: You mentioned in the first interview, that when you arrived in the United States, it was a hard time in the beginning, because you realized that people knew what had happened in Europe, and that they didn’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s1988">Can you... can you explain...</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: Yes, what I probably was trying to say is, we in the camps talked about somebody had to stay alive, to tell the world what was going on in Europe.</span> <span id="s1990">We thought the world didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1991">But when I came to the United States, and I found out that they knew, Roosevelt knew.</span> <span id="s1992">That that ship came with the Jewish people and they wouldn’t let it in, and they sent it back, they got all killed.</span> <span id="s1993">This was very upsetting.</span> <span id="s1994">But then, in another way, I’m not a psychiatrist, but maybe I understand a little more now.</span> <span id="s1995">I’m older, maybe.</span> <span id="s1996">That maybe it was good we did not know that the world knew, because if we would have known, I think we would have given up.</span> <span id="s1997">This is my opinion now.</span> <span id="s1998">What do you think, that’s a possibility, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2000">Do you remember how you found out that... that Roosevelt knew that... that...</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: Well, I found all that out in the United States, after I came in ‘46.</span> <span id="s2002">I don’t know exactly where I found out.</span> <span id="s2003">Might have found out from Urbachs, or people, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: Were you... did you feel anger at the American people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2006">I was angry.</span> <span id="s2007">Not at the American people as much as Roosevelt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: So it was more on the political level...</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q:... not on the just common.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: And there was a very important rabbi who went to Washington to tell Roosevelt about what was going on.</span> <span id="s2012">And at that time, Bernard Baruch was advisor to Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s2013">I don’t know what they talked about, I, I just wonder sometimes.</span> <span id="s2014">But one person cannot do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: Did you feel… so you didn’t feel that the American people bore any kind of responsibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: No, it’s... most of the time, the way I see things now, the people have nothing to do with it, it’s the head of the government.</span> <span id="s2017">The average person wants exactly the same thing.</span> <span id="s2018">You want the family, you want your children, you want a roof over your head.</span> <span id="s2019">You want to be able to have enough money to send them to college, so they make something out of themself.</span> <span id="s2020">That’s what the average citizen wants.</span> <span id="s2021">And all along in history, it was always the heads of the government who started the problems.</span> <span id="s2022">Maybe if they would start fighting each other, maybe this would stop.</span> <span id="s2023">That’s wishful thinking, right?</span> <span id="s2024">Silly?</span> <span id="s2025">Is that silly?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: No, it’s funny to imagine a fistfight between Clinton and Milosevic or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: It’s not... huh?</span> <span id="s2028">It wouldn’t be fistfights, believe me.</span> <span id="s2029">It’d be more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: So, did you feel angry, back then, when... after you arrived in the States?</span> <span id="s2031">You said you felt angry while you were in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: I was angry, I was angry, I was angry for 12 years.</span> <span id="s2033">I was angry.</span> <span id="s2034">We had a large family and it was so wonderful, cousins were like brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s2035">You know, you didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s2036">Like, when my son was Bar Mitzvah, Jake had a large family that came from all over.</span> <span id="s2037">I had nobody.</span> <span id="s2038">My aunt already had cancer, she was in a wheelchair, and she didn’t want to come to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2039">We were going to hire somebody and she said if she can’t walk on her own two feet, she didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s2040">So I called Urbachs, I said, “You have to come.”</span> <span id="s2041">And they came.</span> <span id="s2042">I said, “I have to have somebody on my side.”</span> <span id="s2043">Because it makes you feel pretty much alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q: I’m sorry, would you say again what event that was?</span> <span id="s2045">I missed it…</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: My son’s Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s2047">My brother was out the country.</span> <span id="s2048">My sister-in-law had two little kids, so she couldn’t come, because Bernard was out the country.</span> <span id="s2049">So, but they came, Urbachs came.</span> <span id="s2050">They were there for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q: Can you talk more about the time that you were pregnant and you started to have these nightmares and it was like the floodgates were opening.</span> <span id="s2052">What were your feelings about... did other feel-feelings, memories come back to you?</span> <span id="s2053">Was it... Did it change the way that you...</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: No, it was always when I was pregnant, it was all the time the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: They were trying to catch me, they were going to take my baby away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: Did having... having the baby change that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: Yeah, it got better.</span> <span id="s2059">I mean, they weren’t constant, the nightmare, they only were once in awhile and then later on, with Sandy, it got less and less.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: When was your son born?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: My son was born June, 1950, and Sandy was born December ‘54.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: And your son’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: Jerry.</span> <span id="s2064">Jerry Walden Green.</span> <span id="s2065">And my daughter’s name was Sandra Ann Green Zuckerman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Zuckerman now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: Zuckerman now, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: Can you tell me something about... about each of them?</span> <span id="s2069">Tell me something about your son, first.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: Never gave us any trouble.</span> <span id="s2071">We didn’t agree on everything, you know, but I don’t know, if I look at the children now, I don’t think I could raise them now.</span> <span id="s2072">I mean they... they’re such different children.</span> <span id="s2073">He was one of the good guys, he didn’t experiment with drugs, he didn’t smoke.</span> <span id="s2074">He…studies were very important, he wanted to make good grades to get out of Winchester.</span> <span id="s2075">And that was, I think, our doing.</span> <span id="s2076">We wanted him out of here.</span> <span id="s2077">There wasn’t much for him to do.</span> <span id="s2078">He took, he got a degree in Political Science, and History.</span> <span id="s2079">Undergraduate degree.</span> <span id="s2080">And then he was turned against it.</span> <span id="s2081">There was somebody working in Frankfort, who made appointments with him to come, he could help him and he would go there two, three times and the man wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s2082">So he got very upset over that.</span> <span id="s2083">And then he met a girl at IU, and they were dating for awhile, and then they decided he was going into social work.</span> <span id="s2084">And he went to Indianapolis.</span> <span id="s2085">He got an undergraduate degree from IU, he went to Indianapolis and got the Masters in social work.</span> <span id="s2086">And first he worked for the Catholic service in Indianapolis, but now he’s been with the Methodist Hospital now, for about 18 or 19 years, or maybe getting closer to 20.</span> <span id="s2087">But he said he had to get out of Kentucky because social workers were underpaid, that he makes a lot more money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: And he’s married?</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: He is married.</span> <span id="s2090">They married in ‘75.</span> <span id="s2091">She’s a occupational therapist, and they adopted three Korean children at different times.</span> <span id="s2092">Jenna is 13, and Cara, she’s beautiful, the middle one, and Cara is 11.</span> <span id="s2093">And Lindsey is going to be seven.</span> <span id="s2094">And that’s the one who has cerebral palsy.</span> <span id="s2095">But she doesn’t know she’s handicapped.</span> <span id="s2096">She’s very bright, she gets speech lessons.</span> <span id="s2097">And it’s so much easier to understand her now, over the telephone.</span> <span id="s2098">The trouble was... Jerry explained it to me, because she kept her mouth too wide open, and she was drooling all the time, and they teach her now to close her mouth, not that wide open.</span> <span id="s2099">And she drools less, that way you can understand her.</span> <span id="s2100">About three years ago, she was in a body cast for six weeks.</span> <span id="s2101">And all the bedrooms in this house are upstairs, so they brought the, her mattress down and she was in the rec room for six weeks.</span> <span id="s2102">They had to carry her around.</span> <span id="s2103">She got spoiled, but she never complained.</span> <span id="s2104">But if she called you, she wanted you there.</span> <span id="s2105">And the teachers say she is very bright.</span> <span id="s2106">She just going to finish the first grade.</span> <span id="s2107">And she makes pretty good grades.</span> <span id="s2108">Eventually she will need some more surgery.</span> <span id="s2109">They had to operate on her, if not, the hip would have gone out.</span> <span id="s2110">You see, the knee hit the other knee.</span> <span id="s2111">So now, the other knee is doing the same thing, but the pediatrician or... or the... the... the surgeon keep... keep a track on it.</span> <span id="s2112">It has to be a certain degree before they want to operate.</span> <span id="s2113">If not, the other hip would go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: So tell me something about your daughter now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: My daughter?</span> <span id="s2116">Oh gosh.</span> <span id="s2117">I don’t think I could have made it without her.</span> <span id="s2118">She’s such a warm person and she worries about me a lot.</span> <span id="s2119">Like when I was sick, I told you I had the flu, she called three times a day.</span> <span id="s2120">And we almost talk almost every day.</span> <span id="s2121">And if I get out of here, I’ll move to Chattanooga.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: It sounds as if she’s helped you just by being sympathetic and understanding what your experiences have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: Yeah, that... the camps, no I mean, even now, I mean, I lost Jake.</span> <span id="s2124">I never could have done it without her.</span> <span id="s2125">Both children were wonderful.</span> <span id="s2126">They came and they stayed.</span> <span id="s2127">Jerry stayed eight days, he had to go back to work.</span> <span id="s2128">And Sandy stayed ten days, and she had to go... she just works, teaches, at the community college, part time, because with Jay, I told you, her husband is so busy.</span> <span id="s2129">And many times he has to get up middle in the night, and has to go in if the people can’t work out the problems, then they call the boss, and he has to go in.</span> <span id="s2130">And the irony is, he didn’t want to go into medicine, because his father is a pediatrician and years ago, when his children were sick, everybody else’s children were sick, and Larry’s mother used to call him, come on home, Larry is sick, or Janet was sick, the daughter.</span> <span id="s2131">And he said, “Give them an aspirin, I’ll be there in, in ten, 15 minutes,” and sometimes it was hours and hours.</span> <span id="s2132">So he just didn’t want to become a doctor, but now with the doctors it’s different, they cover for each other.</span> <span id="s2133">I mean, I see it in the hospital here, they... is your back bothering you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Let me sit there for awhile, and you won’t feel... that be softer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: No, no, it’s fine, really I’m fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: So, now with the computer, he’s called out at night.</span> <span id="s2138">The doctors only go when they on call that night.</span> <span id="s2139">Isn’t life funny?</span> <span id="s2140">It’s ironic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2142">She’s got how many...</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: One son.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: One son.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: 15, who thinks he’s 25.</span> <span id="s2146">Last time she came, I said, “Sandy, you didn’t bring my grandson.”</span> <span id="s2147">He always was so agreeable, “Yes, Bubby, yes, Bubby.”</span> <span id="s2148">Now I say black, he says white.</span> <span id="s2149">So I said, “You didn’t bring my grandson.”</span> <span id="s2150">She said, “Well, that’s the way it’s going to be till 21, get used to it.”</span> <span id="s2151">If I live that long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: When… did you talk to your kids about your experiences during the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: Did they ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: No.</span> <span id="s2156">Sandy says it came out a little bit.</span> <span id="s2157">She said, “We knew more than you think.”</span> <span id="s2158">I never talked to them about.</span> <span id="s2159">They were Jews in the little... little town.</span> <span id="s2160">And, like I told you about Jerry, Sandy was the same.</span> <span id="s2161">Grades was important get out of here, and they both did.</span> <span id="s2162">Now, when I complain, Sandy will say, “Mommy, you pushed us out.”</span> <span id="s2163">I said, “Well, there was nothing for you to do here,” you know.</span> <span id="s2164">Sandy was the only Jewish child in the school system, the only Jewish child in high school, and she had a stupid teacher, homeroom teacher, who... it was before Christmas, said one morning, “I was driving up and down Boone Avenue, all the houses were decorated for Christmas beautifully, except Sandy’s house.</span> <span id="s2165">Let’s take up a collection.”</span> <span id="s2166">How do you think she felt?</span> <span id="s2167">She came home and she cried, you know.</span> <span id="s2168">Stupid teacher, he knew why.</span> <span id="s2169">He thought he was funny.</span> <span id="s2170">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2171">He was crazy, anyway.</span> <span id="s2172">And then she was… well, if they would have had valedictorian, she was the valedictorian, she got the junior cup.</span> <span id="s2173">All A’s, from the first grade on.</span> <span id="s2174">And the minister’s son came up to her, “I would love to date you, but my father would kill me.”</span> <span id="s2175">So she came home and she cried, and I laughed, and I said to her, “Well, I wouldn’t be so happy about it either,” you know.</span> <span id="s2176">What you going to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: How did you... what did... how did you convey Jewish culture to them, or a sense of... of heritage and history?</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: They are not as Orthodox... well, I’m not Orthodox, but not observant like I am.</span> <span id="s2179">We took them to the synagogue, we took them to Sunday school, we took them to Hebrew school, and that was about the best we could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: When did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: And I observed, I kept kosher.</span> <span id="s2182">Friday night the candles were lit.</span> <span id="s2183">Every holiday was a holiday.</span> <span id="s2184">Passover, we always had college students.</span> <span id="s2185">We never were less than 14, sometimes 20 people, sometimes 11 people.</span> <span id="s2186">So what else could I have done?</span> <span id="s2187">I mean, you come to a point that they have to do it themselves.</span> <span id="s2188">And I thought they had enough background.</span> <span id="s2189">Sandy later belonged to a Conservative synagogue, but they only go on High Holidays and I think a lot... the rabbi has a lot to do with it.</span> <span id="s2190">They had the rabbi, that’s why they joined it, he was wonderful.</span> <span id="s2191">He was great with young people.</span> <span id="s2192">They... they went all the time, but this one, he’s such a bore.</span> <span id="s2193">The first time I went down there, and they were walking around... I don’t know, have you ever... were you ever at services, Jewish services, when they walk around with the Torah, and you kiss the Torah?</span> <span id="s2194">He was walking around, he didn’t carry a Torah, and he was shaking hands, and I had my hand out.</span> <span id="s2195">And I said, “Rabbi, I’m Sandy’s daughter,”... I mean, mother, “Sandy is my daughter.”</span> <span id="s2196">And he said, “Oh.”</span> <span id="s2197">And then I went... Oh, I went a lot last year.</span> <span id="s2198">And I even would go more, but I won’t drive, and I have to fly, and Sandy’s been paying for the flight for me to get there, and so I want to kind of slow down on that.</span> <span id="s2199">She’s going to have a son going to college soon.</span> <span id="s2200">So, whenever... everywhere I am, I go to Saturday morning services, because I always say I’m a reborn Jew, I was Bat Mitzvah 11 years ago, because women couldn’t participate when I was a child.</span> <span id="s2201">So we went to the synagogue, he should know me, nothing.</span> <span id="s2202">Not, “Oh, it’s good you’re visiting again,” or something.</span> <span id="s2203">How about stopping a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">End of Tape Five, Side A Beginning Tape Five, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: How is it going, all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2207">This is tape two, side B, of an interview with Sylvia Green.</span> <span id="s2208">You were just talking about your synagogue and... and I wondered when you started to be religious again, and when you joined a synagogue, and what synagogue you joined?</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2210">We joined the synagogue as soon as we were married, Ohavay Zion.</span> <span id="s2211">Jake’s father was one of the founders of that synagogue.</span> <span id="s2212">So, as soon as we got married, there was no question about it.</span> <span id="s2213">We have been members for 50 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: Uh-huh, that’s the Conservative synagogue in Lexington?</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: That’s the Conservative synagogue on Alumni Drive, but that used to be on Maxwell Street, where Joe Bologna is in, the pizza place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2217">How did it feel, did you start to recover a sense of faith, or feeling…</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">A: It’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: …or were you still an atheist, just going to synagogue, or how did that… what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: Do you know Jake... I don’t know how it happened, when it happened, it was so gradual, but it happened a lot more since I can participate.</span> <span id="s2221">And when I was Bat Mitzvah, there were two other young girls.</span> <span id="s2222">I’m the only old woman who was Bat Mitzvah, and I don’t know whether I did it as much out of religion, as I was… I think I was jealous of my brother, as a child.</span> <span id="s2223">All that attention and all the gifts.</span> <span id="s2224">And here, I knew every speech, I knew his Torah reading, I knew his Haftorah reading, I knew his speech by heart, as well as he did.</span> <span id="s2225">And they made such a big deal over him.</span> <span id="s2226">So, I don’t know, in my speech 11 years ago, I said, “You probably are asking why I’m doing this now.</span> <span id="s2227">I raised my children in a kosher home, in the Jewish religion, to the best I could.</span> <span id="s2228">I don’t know whether that has anything to do with the religion, I am Bat Mitzvah, or it was jealousy.</span> <span id="s2229">I had to prove to myself I could do it.”</span> <span id="s2230">That was my speech.</span> <span id="s2231">And I said, “I doed it.”</span> <span id="s2232">But, it was a lucky thing, because it helped me a lot in... after Jake died.</span> <span id="s2233">The people are wonderful, they... I’m almost the oldest one there, and they’re all young couples, so I’m a grandmother.</span> <span id="s2234">And then, after Jake died, they came for a whole week here, just saying prayers.</span> <span id="s2235">And you only need ten people to say prayers.</span> <span id="s2236">Now women count, too, men and women.</span> <span id="s2237">Sometimes we had up to 30 here, because they wanted to come.</span> <span id="s2238">And if I don’t go on a Saturday, I miss it.</span> <span id="s2239">I go every Saturday, even we had the little bit of snow, and they got mad at me after I walked in.</span> <span id="s2240">“I thought you wouldn’t be here, maybe you shouldn’t be out.”</span> <span id="s2241">I said, “Well, it’s supposed to have melted by the time I drove home.”</span> <span id="s2242">But I miss it, and I feel like this is my family.</span> <span id="s2243">And in fact, I think I told you, last Saturday, they called me up to say a special prayer, before you read the Torah, or was it between you read the Torah, and I cried, I couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s2244">And, so the one who read the Torah raf, he said, “What’s the matter, Sylvia?”</span> <span id="s2245">And I said, “I feel so alone.”</span> <span id="s2246">Yeah, they were wishing me a happy birthday and clapping, and in Hebrew, congratulations, you know.</span> <span id="s2247">And so, I don’t know, I just looked around, there was no... I mean, there were people there, but I was alone.</span> <span id="s2248">And I told the Torahfa, he said, “What are you talking about?</span> <span id="s2249">We are your family.”</span> <span id="s2250">That was sweet.</span> <span id="s2251">And it helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: Mm-hm, that’s good.</span> <span id="s2253">That’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">A: But then I was still teary eyed, because that Monday I spoke in Louisville.</span> <span id="s2255">I told you, it takes me forever to get back to normal.</span> <span id="s2256">So, I’m just the happiest when people leave me alone and I go about my volunteering, or… or just not think about it, I do the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: Did your… I’m jumping around a little bit, but I remembered another question about your kids.</span> <span id="s2258">Did they ever ask you about their grandparents, what… I mean did they try to find out what had happened to their…</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: Well, my grandmother died.</span> <span id="s2260">There were ten living children, my grandmother died on my mother’s side when she was 47 years old.</span> <span id="s2261">Every year there was a child, stillborn.</span> <span id="s2262">I had a very active grandfather.</span> <span id="s2263">Or… stillborn, miscarriage, and only the strong survived and ten survived and she died.</span> <span id="s2264">I’m named after her.</span> <span id="s2265">Sarah was her name.</span> <span id="s2266">My Bible name is Sarah.</span> <span id="s2267">So they knew about that, and my mother’s… my dad’s mother, she died… let’s see, there was, the war broke out in ‘39, she died around that time.</span> <span id="s2268">The war already broke out, but it was at the beginning and thank God, the way she died, it was Passover, and she choked on a piece of matzo, and the whole thing was not even a split second.</span> <span id="s2269">She must have been a hundred.</span> <span id="s2270">And can you imagine how frightened she would have been in the cattle wagon?</span> <span id="s2271">So this was really a blessing.</span> <span id="s2272">So my children did not have a grandmother, because Jake’s mother died when he was nine, and my parents got killed.</span> <span id="s2273">So that’s why I am a Bubby.</span> <span id="s2274">‘Bubby’ is ‘Grandmother’ in eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s2275">So, when Sandy was pregnant with Jay, she asked me whether it be all right, she never had a Bubby, whether Jay can call me Bubby.</span> <span id="s2276">The other grandmother did not want to be called Bubby, she wanted to be called Grandmama.</span> <span id="s2277">I said, “That’s fine, if he doesn’t call me… if your baby, my grandchild doesn’t call me anything worse, Bubby is fine.”</span> <span id="s2278">So I’m still Bubby.</span> <span id="s2279">But he tells me if he talks about his Bubby to his friends, I’m his grandmother, not Bubby.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">Q: So your, your own children really didn’t try to find out…</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">A: No, it isn’t that… no, no, it…</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: So the information…</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: They were busy.</span> <span id="s2284">They were busy, they, they, they always had the working time, the schoolwork, and then, and Sandy was a girl scout, they took piano lessons.</span> <span id="s2285">And Jerry was a boy scout, he took piano lessons, he was on the Little League and they were busy.</span> <span id="s2286">And it was good for them, and then both went to work.</span> <span id="s2287">Jerry went to work at Kroger’s when he was 16, sacking groceries.</span> <span id="s2288">One time I walk in, Jerry was washing the floor.</span> <span id="s2289">I said, “Jerry,” somebody dropped a watermelon.</span> <span id="s2290">I said, “How come you don’t do this at home?”</span> <span id="s2291">He said, “I don’t get paid.</span> <span id="s2292">Here I get paid.”</span> <span id="s2293">He worked for Kroger’s when he went away to college.</span> <span id="s2294">Now, he never worked during a week, in high school, just on weekends, because the manager ask him, “I need somebody during the week,” and he said, “Mr. Hazelwick, I want to work, but this would defeat the purpose.</span> <span id="s2295">I want to save money so I can go to college.</span> <span id="s2296">If I don’t make the grades, then I wouldn’t be accepted.”</span> <span id="s2297">And he liked his honesty, and he hired him.</span> <span id="s2298">So when Jerry came home Christmas, and during the summer he worked at Kroger’s till he graduated from college, and he saved enough money up to buy his own car.</span> <span id="s2299">And Sandy worked at IGA as a checker, and she worked from the time she was 16.</span> <span id="s2300">And she worked the graveyard shift, till 12 o’clock, Jake was waiting for her.</span> <span id="s2301">If that be now, I wouldn’t let her work the graveyard shift.</span> <span id="s2302">Be too dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: Did you move to Winchester right after you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: In 1949?</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: 1949.</span> <span id="s2307">Papa let us live in the house.</span> <span id="s2308">There were two little houses, so he let us live in the house, so it already was painted, and we just moved in.</span> <span id="s2309">And then he gave us the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: This house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2312">This house we bought.</span> <span id="s2313">It was a very small house and we… it was a one-bedroom house, and then, when I was pregnant with Sandy, we added on another bedroom, and another bathroom, but then we outgrew it again, because I had to separate the kids, so we bought this house.</span> <span id="s2314">We been living here since… we bought the house in ‘65.</span> <span id="s2315">I think we moved in ‘66, because we had it all fixed up before we moved in.</span> <span id="s2316">Painted and repairs and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: Has… well, let me go back to something else.</span> <span id="s2318">When you, after you got… before you got married, you were working.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">Q: Did you stay… did you continue working after you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: He didn’t want me to marry... Joe Wile wanted me to marry.</span> <span id="s2324">I was going to quit before Christmas, because I wanted to get ready for the wedding and all that, and he ask me to stay till after Christmas.</span> <span id="s2325">So I stayed till after Christmas, and then they had the sale, and he ask me to stay one more day and then every time I went in there, he wanted me to come back and work.</span> <span id="s2326">And I said, “No,” I said, “We had an agreement, Jake and I, that I wouldn’t work.”</span> <span id="s2327">I was the good Hausfrau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: Did… was that fine with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: It was all right with me.</span> <span id="s2330">I needed peace and quiet anyway.</span> <span id="s2331">And then Jake was from the old school.</span> <span id="s2332">Listen, we go way back.</span> <span id="s2333">It was before your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Q: When did you become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: ‘52... 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: Was that an important event for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: That was a very important event, because I never was a citizen of any country.</span> <span id="s2338">I was born and raised in Germany, but my father was a Polish citizen, and they would… your nationality was what your father’s nationality was.</span> <span id="s2339">So, in Germany, I was a Polack.</span> <span id="s2340">Then, after we lived in Poland, I was a German.</span> <span id="s2341">So I never had a country to call my own, and this was a very happy moment.</span> <span id="s2342">I could have done it earlier, I could have done it in three years, but Jake thought it was better, because Jerry already was a little older.</span> <span id="s2343">And I did good, I… I passed, I had no problems.</span> <span id="s2344">At that time, I still had a good memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">Q: Did you feel like an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">A: I felt like an American, but I was very upset with the judge.</span> <span id="s2347">There were a lot of Germans who married American soldiers, they became citizens.</span> <span id="s2348">There was a girl from Poland, the American fellow she married, he said he owned a newspaper in the United States, and then when she came here, she found out he was a newspaper boy, delivered papers.</span> <span id="s2349">And, well, they called you up there, and you sat in front, facing the... oh, I’m sorry... facing the people, you know, I told you I talk with my hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">A: Facing the people, and all in a sudden, he said, “I notice here, you were incarcerated.</span> <span id="s2352">What were you incarcerated for?”</span> <span id="s2353">And that’s all it took.</span> <span id="s2354">I start crying and screaming.</span> <span id="s2355">Jake said you could hear me in the back row.</span> <span id="s2356">The only crime I ever committed was I was born to Jewish parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: Did you tell him that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: That’s what I told him.</span> <span id="s2359">The amazing part was he just... you know, was mind-boggling to me.</span> <span id="s2360">And there were German fräuleins there... I mean frau marrying Americans, and he talked so nice to them, you know.</span> <span id="s2361">That really... Judge Ford, he’s dead, may he rest in peace!</span> <span id="s2362">No, this was very upsetting to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: What did he say in response to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: “I’m sorry.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">A: Nobody heard him.</span> <span id="s2367">I did.</span> <span id="s2368">I don’t know, we have a friend here, a lawyer, and he was one of my witnesses, and another friend, a neighbor, Margaret Walden, she was one of my witnesses, too.</span> <span id="s2369">Mike said he just wanted to kind of show off, you know.</span> <span id="s2370">But I screamed, I really did.</span> <span id="s2371">And that was the only crime I committed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">Q: Did you feel safe in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2374">I felt very safe, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: And did you feel at home in Kentucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: Well, that was the only state I knew, I mean, I would go to New York, where my brother was, or New Jersey, to visit, but I only lived in Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2377">I lived in Lexington till I married, and then I came here, and I always lived in Winchester.</span> <span id="s2378">I been to Israel just one time.</span> <span id="s2379">In ‘85, that was the only time I left the country.</span> <span id="s2380">And I’m glad I did, because now I don’t think I could take the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Q: What did… did you, when you would visit New York, for example, did you, did you meet people who had stereotypes about Kentucky, and what... and ask you, “Why do you live there, are there any Jews there,” or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">A: No, no, the funny part was, I had a silk blouse, that was the style, and written Sylvia all over, handwritten on it.</span> <span id="s2383">I think I’ll show you a picture later on, I think I got enlargement there.</span> <span id="s2384">And I was visiting my cousin for two weeks every summer, till I got married.</span> <span id="s2385">And well, one week they could take off, the other week they couldn’t take off, so I waited for them when they came home from work.</span> <span id="s2386">And I wore that blouse, and a guy passed by and he looked, “Hi Sylvia, how are you?”</span> <span id="s2387">I says, “Do I know you?</span> <span id="s2388">I never met you.”</span> <span id="s2389">“Oh, yes, you know me.”</span> <span id="s2390">You know.</span> <span id="s2391">Then he start kind of laughing, then I look down, and I saw it.</span> <span id="s2392">And so I laughed, I said, “Oh, you tricked me, I forgot I wore the blouse with my name on there.”</span> <span id="s2393">He said, “You’re not a New Yorker.”</span> <span id="s2394">I said, “No, I’m from Kentucky.”</span> <span id="s2395">And he said, “I noticed the different accent.”</span> <span id="s2396">Oh, that is funny, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s2397">Oh gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: That’s the only time that you came up against a stereotype of, of… about Kentucky, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: Well, no, no, I… why, do people have?</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q: Yeah, like…</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A: They don’t respect people from Kentucky, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: Well, they might think…</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: We’re hicks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">Q: …it’s just a place where there are hillbillies, and what, you know…</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">A: Oh, about that, listen.</span> <span id="s2406">I had a cousin, he’s gone now, cousin Harry, and that’s the ones I stayed with when I first came to the United State, and spent one week in New York.</span> <span id="s2407">About a couple months after we were settled, I think we still lived with Urbachs, so it was about a couple months, he came to visit.</span> <span id="s2408">He came because he was worried.</span> <span id="s2409">He heard that in Kentucky people don’t wear shoes, and they don’t have many Jews, and he wanted to see it with his own eyes, and… and to take me back to New York.</span> <span id="s2410">I thought it was very thoughtful, and very sweet, just the cousin who I met, you know.</span> <span id="s2411">So, he fell in love with Kentucky, but he wouldn’t move to Kentucky, but he thought it was such a quiet life.</span> <span id="s2412">When 65,000 people were in Lexington.</span> <span id="s2413">And, he wouldn’t give up New York, so…</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: You’ve seen Lexington change a lot over the years, I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: Oh my God, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: Can you kind of describe how, how that’s… how you’ve seen it change?</span> <span id="s2417">A: Well, I’ve seen the change… I think I told you, I don’t know, I just got my license, driver’s license when I was 68.</span> <span id="s2418">This is… in May it’s going to be seven years.</span> <span id="s2419">And if not my friends here.</span> <span id="s2420">He took me out for three months, every day.</span> <span id="s2421">So, I remember when I came to Lexington, people drove cars, but there were not many cars.</span> <span id="s2422">And if you were driving, they would stop, “Go on, go on.”</span> <span id="s2423">Now, since I drive myself, they… they try to beat you to the stop light.</span> <span id="s2424">It’s a lot of change in... it’s kind of overgrown, I think.</span> <span id="s2425">Look what’s going on in Anita Madden’s… that shopping center she has, the mall.</span> <span id="s2426">I don’t know, I mean, it’s just overgrown.</span> <span id="s2427">Whenever they have a new shopping mall, people move out from a different place, and move there.</span> <span id="s2428">I, I just wonder, how many shopping malls do you need?</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: It never… it seems like…</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: How many restaurants?</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: …never enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: Never enough is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">Q: Do you remember when you first voted?</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2435">As soon as I became a citizen.</span> <span id="s2436">And I was very nervous.</span> <span id="s2437">I think in that old tape, I think, as I recall, I spoke about that Monday, a week ago.</span> <span id="s2438">When we had to report to the police station, that we had to leave the country, and my mother was sick and she sent me instead, and as he called my mother’s name and I told him my mother was sick, the policeman, he yelled at me to come forward, but he yelled so loud that I was shaking from head to toe.</span> <span id="s2439">And then he took the… and I couldn’t hold the pencil or pen, whatever it was, in my hand, and I dropped it.</span> <span id="s2440">And I don’t know, he seemed to be satisfied, maybe I put the ‘X’ down there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2441">Ever since then, any kind of legal, took a long time to overcome.</span> <span id="s2442">Because I remember when I needed a Social Security number, it took me three hours to get enough nerve to go in there.</span> <span id="s2443">And Rose said, “No, you have to do it yourself.”</span> <span id="s2444">She wanted me to do things for myself, it’s so much easier to let somebody else do the things, but she wanted me to learn to be independent.</span> <span id="s2445">Took three hours.</span> <span id="s2446">So the first time I voted, just… you have to sign your name and it was going pretty shaky.</span> <span id="s2447">It took years.</span> <span id="s2448">Doesn’t bother me any more now, but I don’t know, I don’t think I ever missed an occasion, not to vote.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q: Did you learn about Kentucky history, or… was it in, of interest to you to…</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">A: [Indecipherable] a lot, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: …to feel part of that, that history, or that you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: I am not part of that history, I am part of the history way up there.</span> <span id="s2453">You know what I’m talking about, Germany, Poland, ghetto, concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2454">But I like Kentucky, and I was happy in Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2455">And I will have to leave Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2456">There’ll be a time I won’t be able take care of myself, then I have to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">Q: And you’ll, you’re thinking you would go to Chattanooga…</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">A: Chattanooga, yes definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">Q: …where your daughter is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">A: It’s not… the children are nice, Jerry and Marcia, they’re nice kids, but it’s different.</span> <span id="s2461">A daughter is a daughter all, all your life, a son is a son till he takes a wife.</span> <span id="s2462">She’s a nice girl, she’s good for him.</span> <span id="s2463">But she has more ties with her family.</span> <span id="s2464">But her mother died just two weeks before Jake died.</span> <span id="s2465">And the father has had cancer now for six, seven years, and it’s lung cancer.</span> <span id="s2466">And he’s doing okay.</span> <span id="s2467">He went back to Czechoslovakia for two weeks.</span> <span id="s2468">He takes chemotherapy for three weeks and radiation for three weeks, and he’s still here, it’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: Will you tell me about when… you, you mentioned a little earlier about how there was something that happened in 1981, where a teacher had said that, that there was no Holocaust…</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">Q: …and that that caused a reaction here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">A: A history, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">Q: And, and caused that documentary…</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A: Among the Jewish... not in Winchester, in Lexington, among the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">Q: Tell me about that, what happened and, and your involvement, and, and the documentary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">A: Well, my involvement, it was no involvement, they just got in touch with me and David, I don’t know whether he already talked to Dr. Otis Singletary to moderate something, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2477">He called…</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: This is David who?</span> <span id="s2479">David…</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">A: David, Dr. Wedstein.</span> <span id="s2481">He teaches at medical school.</span> <span id="s2482">And I said I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s2483">He called me long distance, he wanted me to speak, like on television, to have a television program.</span> <span id="s2484">And I said, “I just can’t do it,” never talked before, you know, and then television, my God.</span> <span id="s2485">I never been on television before.</span> <span id="s2486">So I told him, I said, “I don’t know, even now I don’t know when I talk about, I cry.”</span> <span id="s2487">I, I never know, there’s… not that I can say I’m not going to cry, it just comes automatically.</span> <span id="s2488">So, he said at that time, he said, “No, you can’t cry, after all, Dr. Otis Singletary, you know.”</span> <span id="s2489">Like you can’t cry.</span> <span id="s2490">Then they came back to me in ‘83, and it was Marilyn Moosnick.</span> <span id="s2491">And she said right away, “It’s not going to be on live, it’s going to be taped.”</span> <span id="s2492">So we all taped the half an hour and the program’s name was, “And I Was There.”</span> <span id="s2493">And it was shown all over Kentucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: All over Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2495">On public television?</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">A: I think it was Channel 18.</span> <span id="s2497">And then, what is it, KET broadcasted it maybe a couple years later on, or a year later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">Q: Did… did you get the sense up until then, that people in general around you in Kentucky, among the non-Jewish population, didn’t know about the Holocaust, what had happened, in this, in this state?</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">A: I don’t know, I didn’t… we never talked about that, they all just felt bad for me.</span> <span id="s2500">At that time I walked two miles every day and people stopped me, and there was a man one time, “Oh, I feel so sorry for you…for you.”</span> <span id="s2501">And I said, “Please don’t feel sorry for me.</span> <span id="s2502">I’m proud what I’ve done with my life, and that’s the past.”</span> <span id="s2503">I said, “I feel good what I have done with my life.</span> <span id="s2504">So don’t, I don’t want anybody to feel sorry for me.”</span> <span id="s2505">He apologized, he said, “That’s not what I meant, what I meant, what you had to go through as a child.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: Was that the first time?</span> <span id="s2507">I… you mentioned that before that, you had talked to Jake about your experiences.</span> <span id="s2508">Had you talked to anybody else before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: No, just Mina and I, we talked.</span> <span id="s2510">Mina died in ‘64, but Mina and I, we talked, still.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Q: So, did that change things for you, starting to relate to people in a… in a different way?</span> <span id="s2512">Or did people relate to you differently afterwards, apart from…</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">A: Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s2514">Especially after the documentary.</span> <span id="s2515">And then Betty Radliff had the news magazine, and that was my whole life story, with pictures in there.</span> <span id="s2516">And I think she, she done a good job.</span> <span id="s2517">I just didn’t go out for two days, I didn’t want to face anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: What was this magazine?</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: It was a insert to the Winchester Sun.</span> <span id="s2520">I can show it to you later.</span> <span id="s2521">I just didn’t want to go out, I didn’t want to face anybody, I didn’t want to talk about it, and then you had to go out.</span> <span id="s2522">So I went out, after about a couple days.</span> <span id="s2523">It’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Q: And did people start asking you questions, or say…</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">A: Yeah, then, then, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2526">I think somehow, I don’t know, they accepted me more somehow.</span> <span id="s2527">I really think maybe they felt sorry for me.</span> <span id="s2528">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2529">Right now, where I am here in Winchester, I’m part of Winchester, all in a sudden.</span> <span id="s2530">The first 25 years, I did not feel like I was part of it.</span> <span id="s2531">And really, after Jake retired in ‘83, I wanted to get out of here.</span> <span id="s2532">And he didn’t, he loved it here, he was born here, he was raised here.</span> <span id="s2533">And I don’t know whether I told you about the Klu Klux Klan [sic]?</span> <span id="s2534">Year ago, that was before my time… End of Tape Five, Side B Beginning Tape Six, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with silver… Sylvia Green.</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: They were marching, and Jake was right on Main Street, and one of the Klu Klux Klan run out, came into the store, “Joe, sell me a handkerchief.”</span> <span id="s2537">At that time they had those neck… neckerchiefs, red and… like the cowboys wore.</span> <span id="s2538">That’s what they sold for handkerchiefs.</span> <span id="s2539">“I’m sweating like a horse.”</span> <span id="s2540">It was ten cents.</span> <span id="s2541">He came to a Jewish store to buy.</span> <span id="s2542">He was sweating like a horse.</span> <span id="s2543">That poor guy didn’t even know what he was marching for, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">Q: Did he know that it was a Jewish store?</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">A: Sure, everybody knew that it was a Jewish store.</span> <span id="s2546">Papa was there for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">Q: The Klu Klux... Ku Klux Klan didn’t give you or Jake or his family any trouble?</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">A: No, that’s what I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s2549">He came to a Jewish store to... to... to buy a handkerchief.</span> <span id="s2550">I don’t think he knew why he was marching.</span> <span id="s2551">He just belonged as a member, probably didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s2552">So, Jake told me that, I thought that was pretty funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: It makes you wonder, doesn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: It makes you wonder.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2557">Well, that’s the way Hitler started.</span> <span id="s2558">He started with the poor.</span> <span id="s2559">Start giving them black leather pants and jackets and motorcycles.</span> <span id="s2560">He started with the poor, and that made them feel important, he gave them jobs.</span> <span id="s2561">That’s the way he started that whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">Q: You mentioned that you took a trip to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2564">In ‘85, May ‘85.</span> <span id="s2565">I always… as a child, I was a member of the Mizrachi, which is a Zionist organization, and I always wanted to go to Palestine as a child, and build up Palestine single-handed.</span> <span id="s2566">I was very enthusiastic.</span> <span id="s2567">I also was going... I was a member of the Hakoah.</span> <span id="s2568">Hakoah in Hebrew, it’s The Strong Ones.</span> <span id="s2569">It was a sports club, and I was going to the Olympics.</span> <span id="s2570">I mean, I had planned, my future was planned out, except Hitler cut it short.</span> <span id="s2571">So I always wanted to go, and I always told Jake, “I need to go, I need to go.”</span> <span id="s2572">But then, I couldn’t go, children in college, so after they got married, I told Jake, I said, “I want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s2573">You go with me?”</span> <span id="s2574">Well, he wouldn’t even fly.</span> <span id="s2575">And I said, “Jake, I have to go by myself.”</span> <span id="s2576">I said, “I feel pretty good.</span> <span id="s2577">If I wait longer, I won’t be able to go.”</span> <span id="s2578">And I went on the tour, with a group from Florida, and oh, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s2579">I came out not the same person.</span> <span id="s2580">It’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">Q: Tell me more about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">A: Well, just everything.</span> <span id="s2583">I mean, how brilliant!</span> <span id="s2584">You take the desert, where nothing grows and that irrigation, I was just fascinated with everything.</span> <span id="s2585">And then, one Shabbat, one Saturday, I spent with a cousin, my first cousin.</span> <span id="s2586">She left Germany from Breslau in ‘36, and she stopped by in Karlsruhe, and we took her to the train station, and she went to Israel, and she became a Hadassah nurse.</span> <span id="s2587">And I spent a whole Saturday with her, and had dinner with, and met her children, and her grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2588">And then her sisters came, which I haven’t seen in years and years.</span> <span id="s2589">So that was memorable.</span> <span id="s2590">We had a lot of talking to do.</span> <span id="s2591">And then I have a cousin who survived the Holocaust, who came to Munich, and he lived with us in Munich.</span> <span id="s2592">I met his wife and his children, they came to the hotel and spent the day with me.</span> <span id="s2593">But we flew in on a Friday, and then, well the airport is in Tel Aviv, and we took a bus to Jerusalem, that’s where our tour started.</span> <span id="s2594">So when we came to the hotel… boy, my neck is bothering me now…</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">Q: Oh…</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">A: We went, we went…</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: Oh, do you want to stop…</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">A: No, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s2599">We went to the hotel and they weren’t ready for us.</span> <span id="s2600">So, then we start driving around Jerusalem, and I just didn’t believe it, that I actually was there, you know.</span> <span id="s2601">But then some things were upsetting.</span> <span id="s2602">After Jerusalem, then we went to Tel Aviv, and to Haifa, different places.</span> <span id="s2603">And when we went into the department store, you had to open your purse.</span> <span id="s2604">This was upsetting.</span> <span id="s2605">They had to check whether you had any guns, you know.</span> <span id="s2606">It was upsetting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: How long did you stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">A: Two weeks.</span> <span id="s2609">And I came back and my brother picked me up.</span> <span id="s2610">My sister-in-law gave him a 65… 65th birthday party, a surprise party.</span> <span id="s2611">So we worked that out, his birthday was in June, and I came back, probably around beginning of June, maybe.</span> <span id="s2612">And she was cooking, she invited 30, 35 people, and she was cooking, and cooking, and cooking, and corned beef, she wanted to cook it herself, do everything herself.</span> <span id="s2613">She could have ordered that.</span> <span id="s2614">And Sarah said, “You should have been here, you would have died laughing.”</span> <span id="s2615">He said, “My gosh, what are you cooking that much?”</span> <span id="s2616">And she said, “Your sister Sylvia’s coming back from Israel.”</span> <span id="s2617">She cooked for over 35 people, he had no idea what… what cooking is, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q: What an appetite.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">Q: What an appetite…</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">A: Appetite for what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">Q: …she must have.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">A: Oh, he knew I was a big eater, but he had no, I mean that he had no idea, you know.</span> <span id="s2624">So, well I got there, and I slept around the clock.</span> <span id="s2625">This was Friday.</span> <span id="s2626">He came, oh, about six o’clock.</span> <span id="s2627">It didn’t take very long for me to go through custom, I must look honest, because as I got my suitcases and before I had to open it up, he looked at me, and he said, “Do you have anything to declare?”</span> <span id="s2628">So I told him what I had to declare, he said, “Go on.”</span> <span id="s2629">I mean, I didn’t buy anything for business, I bought little gifts for everybody.</span> <span id="s2630">And I was honest about it.</span> <span id="s2631">And so when I came out, my brother was running in.</span> <span id="s2632">He said, “You’re already through?</span> <span id="s2633">I can’t believe it,” you know.</span> <span id="s2634">I said, “Well, I look honest.”</span> <span id="s2635">So when I got there, oh, about an hour later on, I went to sleep and I slept around the clock.</span> <span id="s2636">Woke up Saturday morning, I said, “Sarah,” my sister-in-law, I said, “Boy, I feel so rested, I feel wonderful.”</span> <span id="s2637">She said, “Good, you can go shopping with me, I want to buy…” her daughter had a birthday and she got her own apartment.</span> <span id="s2638">“I want to buy her some lamps.”</span> <span id="s2639">I said, “Good.”</span> <span id="s2640">We looked at the lamps, and I fell asleep again.</span> <span id="s2641">I said, “I can’t keep my eyes open.”</span> <span id="s2642">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s2643">She’s gone, too.</span> <span id="s2644">She died in ‘89.</span> <span id="s2645">That’s my brother’s wife.</span> <span id="s2646">We were very close.</span> <span id="s2647">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2648">They all gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: You… were you very close with your brother after the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: Was that… will you say something about your relationship after the war?</span> <span id="s2652">I mean, you, you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">A: My relationship after the war was maybe closer than the average.</span> <span id="s2654">The only trouble I had with him after the war, when I was single, he was so strict, every boy had to come into the apartment, he had to meet them, he had to interrogate them, whether they good enough for his sister.</span> <span id="s2655">And Jake took me to Cincinnati, to a ball game, and he was going to take me out.</span> <span id="s2656">There used to be, up on a hill, it was in Kentucky, I can’t remember the name of the restaurant, it burned down, it was more of a nightclub.</span> <span id="s2657">And I told my Aunt Mina we going to be late, but we were even later, because he wanted me to meet his brother and his sister-in-law, and we all went out to dinner, they went with us.</span> <span id="s2658">So, he threw a fit.</span> <span id="s2659">And in ‘48, I was 24.</span> <span id="s2660">He threw a fit, “And you let her go, and you let her go.”</span> <span id="s2661">And my Aunt Mina said, “She’s not a child.</span> <span id="s2662">She knows how to behave.</span> <span id="s2663">She knows what to do, what not to do.”</span> <span id="s2664">“You just don’t know what goes on,” he told Mina.</span> <span id="s2665">He had a date, which he took to Atlantic City for a weekend, that was all right, wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s2666">But not his sister.</span> <span id="s2667">So this was the only object… objection I had to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">Q: Do you think he was so protective of you because of what had happened during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s2670">The thing about it was, after we met again, he said, “I am so happy, you have no idea.</span> <span id="s2671">I couldn’t have gone on living if you would have gotten killed.”</span> <span id="s2672">Because he took my place, by going to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">Q: Did you ever feel angry about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">A: No.</span> <span id="s2675">No I never did.</span> <span id="s2676">He… even my aunt and I were talk… he never could have survived it, he was a scholar.</span> <span id="s2677">He wasn’t strong.</span> <span id="s2678">All Bernard knew, Bernard never had a childhood.</span> <span id="s2679">He was studying, and they tore him apart, because my dad wanted him to be a rabbi, my mother wanted him to be a college professor.</span> <span id="s2680">He had to bring home all A’s.</span> <span id="s2681">So poor Bernard just studied all the time.</span> <span id="s2682">He never could have made it.</span> <span id="s2683">He couldn’t have made it in any of the camps.</span> <span id="s2684">So, no, I wasn’t angry about that, I… in fact, after we survived, Mina and I talked a lot about that, how lucky, because he would have been one of the first ones.</span> <span id="s2685">And we were lucky that they sent him instead, the Jewish Welfare Office.</span> <span id="s2686">He did not go with the kindertransport, but they send him somewheres else.</span> <span id="s2687">Probably with the older children, he was four years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">Q: What did he do, as a profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">A: As a profession, he did not become a rabbi, he did not become a college professor.</span> <span id="s2690">He worked for Borden’s in export and imports, and he traveled for them.</span> <span id="s2691">And, but he did moonlight… he has a beautiful voice, cantorial voice.</span> <span id="s2692">When I came back, when I buried him in Paramus, New Jersey, and I told you I locked myself in the house for two days and two nights and cried, I played the tape over and over, I must have over ten times, and I said, “You going crazy, you better quit.</span> <span id="s2693">If not, you’re going to wear out the tape and you’re not going to have any tape.”</span> <span id="s2694">So, he had a strong, beautiful voice, and he did moonlight sometimes.</span> <span id="s2695">Like on Passover, he would go in New York, oh what was that place?</span> <span id="s2696">It was a hotel and they served food and ceremony… Grossinger.</span> <span id="s2697">You heard of Grossinger, did you?</span> <span id="s2698">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: It’s not there any more, but it was there at one… usually well-to-do people went down there, and they spent the whole week and you didn’t have to make Passover.</span> <span id="s2701">You know, our Passover is a week.</span> <span id="s2702">So my sister-in-law loved it, because it was a lot less work for her.</span> <span id="s2703">And he used to conduct services, and then the seder he conducted.</span> <span id="s2704">He loved to do that, but not as a profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">Q: When did he die?</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">A: Oh, he just died four days before Thanksgiving.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">Q: Oh, this last year, in 1998.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">A: ‘98, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">A: And I’m so happy I was there to see him two months before.</span> <span id="s2711">And his mind was gone.</span> <span id="s2712">So when his daughter, Sharon, picked me up at the airport, I said, “Could we stop by?”</span> <span id="s2713">It was about eight o’clock.</span> <span id="s2714">She said, “Sure.”</span> <span id="s2715">So we stopped by, and the kids bought him a Lazy Boy, and he was asleep, and I walked in, and he was hard of hearing, too, and he couldn’t… the hearing aids, he lost them and lost them and then they didn’t help any, anyway.</span> <span id="s2716">So I whispered in his ear, “Bernard, Bernard, you lazy boy, wake up.</span> <span id="s2717">Your sister Sylvia is here.”</span> <span id="s2718">About three or four time, I repeated that, and all in a sudden, you should have seen his face.</span> <span id="s2719">Before, he was pale, flushed, his eyes, there was recognition, and a smile from ear to ear.</span> <span id="s2720">And Sharon said, “You know something?</span> <span id="s2721">I haven’t seen Daddy smile like that since Mama died.”</span> <span id="s2722">But that was the only recognition, then I was “Hey you,” or “I want to do this, I want to do that.”</span> <span id="s2723">And when Sharon… before we went to the airport, I… this time I stayed two days, because it just wore me out, just fly in and fly out Sunday.</span> <span id="s2724">So I, I flew in Thursday, and I was just… because before, I stayed with him all day, and she picked me up just to go to bed at her house.</span> <span id="s2725">She said, “It’s getting too hard for you, and you just stay a half a day,” but I stayed all day Friday, I stayed all day Saturday, and before we went to the airport, I said, “Do you think you could, we could stop by?”</span> <span id="s2726">She said, “Sure.</span> <span id="s2727">We can leave about an hour earlier, and you can stay with him.”</span> <span id="s2728">So, when I walked in, he said… the day before, we thought he was going to die.</span> <span id="s2729">Walked in there, “I want to get dressed.”</span> <span id="s2730">I said, “Okay, you going to get dressed.”</span> <span id="s2731">I took some clothes and I matched up things.</span> <span id="s2732">He looked sharp, he really did.</span> <span id="s2733">And I was going to shave him, but his electric shaver didn’t work, and I wouldn’t use a straight razor, he was a severe diabetic.</span> <span id="s2734">But I combed his hair, I washed his face.</span> <span id="s2735">He said, “I want to eat in the dining room.”</span> <span id="s2736">He hasn’t eaten in the dining room, I don’t remember when.</span> <span id="s2737">I took him to the dining room in a wheelchair, and sat down next to him.</span> <span id="s2738">And they wouldn’t give him any bread any more, because he would wad it up, put it in his mouth, and he’d choke.</span> <span id="s2739">So he saw the bread and he pointed, and his face lit up.</span> <span id="s2740">So I broke it up in a million little pieces.</span> <span id="s2741">And then he ate, and I kissed him good-bye.</span> <span id="s2742">It didn’t bother him that I left, he didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2743">But I’m just happy I saw him two months before, and this… to recognize him, that he recognized me, this is something I cherish.</span> <span id="s2744">But he left three beautiful girls.</span> <span id="s2745">Nice son-in-laws.</span> <span id="s2746">Good girls.</span> <span id="s2747">One is going to make Aliyah, she’s moving to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: Were you ever frustrated with him that he left Kentucky after bringing you here, after…</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A: Yeah, I laughed about it.</span> <span id="s2750">No, that’s become home, you know.</span> <span id="s2751">He left here, graduated, undergraduate degree from University Kentucky, so he was with us.</span> <span id="s2752">And then he went to Chicago, and he worked on his Master’s in Chicago.</span> <span id="s2753">And I went to visit him in ‘48.</span> <span id="s2754">My parents had some friends who survived, who lived in Chicago, and I stayed with them for two weeks.</span> <span id="s2755">And then he went to Columbia University.</span> <span id="s2756">And he had enough credit for everything, but he didn’t finish his thesis, he got involved with a girl and got engaged, and it was a mess.</span> <span id="s2757">But thank God he saw it ahead of time, that he called the engagement off.</span> <span id="s2758">It wouldn’t have worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q: I’m… okay, I wanted to ask you about Germany and Germans.</span> <span id="s2760">After the war you... you were, of course, very angry at the…</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">Q: …at the Germans.</span> <span id="s2763">Has that changed over time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: Yeah, it’s… I finally let go of it.</span> <span id="s2765">Took a long time, it was a gradual thing.</span> <span id="s2766">And anybody had any connection with Germany or even probably 20 generation way back in Germany, I wouldn’t have anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s2767">And even the language, I don’t speak German.</span> <span id="s2768">Maybe I could, I don’t know, I just don’t do it.</span> <span id="s2769">I think I build a mental block, and even my brother Bernard used to say, Germany was there before Hitler, but when Hitler came to power, I only was nine years old, so to me, the German language was Hitler.</span> <span id="s2770">So, but that’s gone now, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">Q: Did you ever have the desire to visit Germany again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">A: No, I don’t have any desire.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">Q: Or Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">A: The other… no, mm-mm.</span> <span id="s2775">I don’t have that happy memories about Poland, either.</span> <span id="s2776">And then the Polish Gentiles were very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s2777">They collaborated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2778">They were very happy to collaborate with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2779">So, no, there are other places I would like to go.</span> <span id="s2780">I would like to go back to Israel, but I don’t know if… I’ve got some problems with my legs.</span> <span id="s2781">Maybe if I win the lottery and I could fly first-class, then I would go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">Q: You were saying a little bit earlier about… off tape, about a woman who you met at the Kroger…</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">A: Oh, at the… yeah, the Kroger’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">Q: Will you tell, will you tell about that on, on tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">A: Well, I have known her.</span> <span id="s2786">She’s been here as long as I have, over 50 years.</span> <span id="s2787">She was from Germany, and maybe a hundred miles away from my hometown, she was… she’s, was from Mannheim.</span> <span id="s2788">And some relatives of Jake wanted me to meet her, they thought that she was such a lovely lady, and she probably was, but I didn’t want to meet her, because with the German connection.</span> <span id="s2789">And for years I didn’t meet her.</span> <span id="s2790">If I saw her, I would run across the street, just not to have to see her.</span> <span id="s2791">So then, finally, we did meet and we talked some, and I always said, “She seems nice enough, she couldn’t be my best friend.”</span> <span id="s2792">And I don’t know whether I would want her as my best friend, because then it’s German again, you know.</span> <span id="s2793">But I was at Kroger’s, oh it was, I don’t know, November, December, and we were talking about something and it came up, the past, and she starts sobbing and she start crying, and automatically, I cradled her in my arms.</span> <span id="s2794">I couldn’t believe it, I mean, that was such a automatic gesture, you know.</span> <span id="s2795">I just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2796">So when I came home, I called Sandy.</span> <span id="s2797">I said, “You won’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2798">I was comforting Lilo Thomps… Thompson.”</span> <span id="s2799">She said, “Mom, you’ve come a long ways.”</span> <span id="s2800">I said, “Yes, I have.”</span> <span id="s2801">But I did tell her also, I said, “Listen, we were born at the wrong time, at the wrong place.”</span> <span id="s2802">Now, I couldn’t have felt that way a few years back, and it’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">Q: So your bitter, your bitterness has…</span></p> <p><span id="s2804">A: It’s, it’s gone…</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">Q: Has the…</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">A: …well, it’s kind-of subsided, thank God.</span> <span id="s2807">Like I said, that I’ve, I feel like there’s a load off my shoulders, you know, like you carry the world on your shoulders.</span> <span id="s2808">Thank God it’s not there any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">Q: What… can you identify things that happened in your life that made that change, that made the bitterness go away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">A: I don’t know, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s2811">It’s… the few years I have left, I like to live them out, not with hatred, and it’s even hard enough just to be alone now.</span> <span id="s2812">Living isn’t easy.</span> <span id="s2813">So, I don’t know when it left me, I just hope it stays away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">Q: I don’t think we mentioned on the tape… that when Jake passed away, that was… will you say when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">A: It was January the ninth, ‘97, and we both have a living will, but I… I wanted him back, so I called 911, and they start working on him.</span> <span id="s2816">And I called the children, they told me to call the children.</span> <span id="s2817">They found a very slight pulse.</span> <span id="s2818">So I called Jerry, then I called Sandy, Sandy said, “Hang up, I call right back and leave the line open.”</span> <span id="s2819">So I did, so she heard everything what went on.</span> <span id="s2820">So, I was so fortunate that night, because my doctor, Dr. Pika was on call that night, and she was called in, and she stayed with me.</span> <span id="s2821">And Sandy called a friend to stay in the hospital with me.</span> <span id="s2822">And so Dr. Pika told that friend, Ava Tyler, “Miss Tyler,” she didn’t know Ava, “I like to ask a favor of you, would you please spend the night with Mrs. Green?</span> <span id="s2823">I don’t want her alone.”</span> <span id="s2824">So, I’m very fortunate to have a caring doctor like she is.</span> <span id="s2825">And she’s only about 32-33 years old, with two children.</span> <span id="s2826">She had those while she already was, was in practice.</span> <span id="s2827">So, she prepared me so, because they were working at, with Jake at the hospital, in emergency room.</span> <span id="s2828">And she would come back and forth, to see how I was.</span> <span id="s2829">And after about a half an hour, she said, “Miss Green, you don’t want him back.</span> <span id="s2830">If he would come back now, he’d be brain-dead and you wouldn’t want him, he wouldn’t want it.”</span> <span id="s2831">I think he already was gone when she came in telling me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">Q: And I, I’m… I know that you went, recently… we were talking about this a little bit off tape, too, that you went recently to Louisville, to talk, to do a public talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">A: For the first time…</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">Q: For the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">A: Yeah, and it was in the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s2836">And the only reason I did it was because my foster brother asked me.</span> <span id="s2837">Otherwise, I wouldn’t have done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">Q: This is Stuart…</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">A: Stuart…</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">Q: …Urbach.</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">A: Dr. Stuart Urbach, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">Q: Can you tell me about what that experience was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">A: Well, nerve-racking, that’s all I can say.</span> <span id="s2844">I didn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s2845">I might have slept about five hours in three nights.</span> <span id="s2846">And I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2847">When I got up there, I mentioned, first I mentioned my name and then I told them that I never spoke in public, that I have given interviews in the comfort of my own home, but I told them I was very nervous.</span> <span id="s2848">And well, I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">Q: And how many people were in the audience?</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">A: Well, that was strange, because when I walked in, we were a little late, and Leah was kinda on edge.</span> <span id="s2851">I said, “You thought I’d be a no-show, huh?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: You’re talking about Leah… Leah Dickstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: Like I talked to you on the telephone, Dr., Dr. Dickstein, yeah.</span> <span id="s2854">So she said, “No, I just want to show you where you stand and which side you get on the stage, and I’m going to get on the other one, I will introduce you.”</span> <span id="s2855">And I looked around, I said, “Leah,” I said, “there are over a thousand people here.”</span> <span id="s2856">She said, “That can’t be, because it only holds 250.”</span> <span id="s2857">I swear it looked like over a thousand.</span> <span id="s2858">But then I got the letter from the Federation and they said there were 450 people, that there were chairs all around, then the lobby, a lot of people were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">Q: This was held in the Jewish Federation of Louisville, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">Q: Jewish…</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">A: No, the Community Center.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: Community Center.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">A: It’s the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s2865">But the, the Jewish Federation is in charge of it.</span> <span id="s2866">And Leah, she… Dr. Dickstein organized the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: Was this the first event of its kind in, in Louisville?</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: No.</span> <span id="s2869">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2870">She said it was a wonderful attendance, and she said there were a lot of Gentiles and a lot of children.</span> <span id="s2871">And the children are important, because they never heard of it, they didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s2872">So that’s the ones we have to teach.</span> <span id="s2873">We have a Yom Shoah day in Lexington.</span> <span id="s2874">Sometimes you have more people than other times.</span> <span id="s2875">So I don’t know, they had one here, I think Tuesday, and I don’t know, I didn’t ask… find out how many people there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">Q: Has it gotten any easier for you to speak about your experiences, over time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">A: It still, it still upsets me.</span> <span id="s2878">You can see it does.</span> <span id="s2879">Sometimes I wish it’d just go away.</span> <span id="s2880">But the only way it’s going to go away, when I go away.</span> <span id="s2881">That’s the only way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">Q: Do you have any sense of relief, or maybe even that it’s necessary to talk?</span> <span id="s2883">Do you have a feeling that it’s, that there’s anything good that comes out of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">A: Well, people should know, but… End of Tape Six, Side A Beginning Tape Six, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">Q: Tape three, side B, of an interview with Sylvia Green.</span> <span id="s2886">I’m sorry, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">A: I, I just said, maybe I’m selfish, it just still gets me upset, and I don’t like to be upset.</span> <span id="s2888">I would like to live my life out in peace.</span> <span id="s2889">And see it… the past, I feel like I’ve lived more than two lives.</span> <span id="s2890">And really, the life right now is not easy, either.</span> <span id="s2891">Looking back, if Jake would have lived, we would have been married 50 years in January.</span> <span id="s2892">And I always thought that… well, everybody goes through some kind of hell in life.</span> <span id="s2893">You’re not promised a rose garden, and I always felt like, well, you’ve gone through your hell at a very young age, and everything was smooth, everything was fine.</span> <span id="s2894">We had no problems here, the marriage was good, the children were wonderful, and then, then it hit again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">Q: What hit again?</span> <span id="s2896">I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">A: Well, Jake passed away, it hit me again.</span> <span id="s2898">I just thought maybe I will have smooth sailing the rest of my life, but there’s no guarantee.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">Q: Do you have ideas of, of what you want now, for the rest of your life?</span> <span id="s2900">Goals?</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">A: Goals.</span> <span id="s2902">I hope and pray, and I pray all the time, I hope when my time comes, it be quick.</span> <span id="s2903">I hope I’ll be able to take care of myself and don’t have to be a burden to my children.</span> <span id="s2904">This bothers me.</span> <span id="s2905">And that’s my goal.</span> <span id="s2906">Otherwise, what kind of goal?</span> <span id="s2907">I mean, I enjoy working in the hospital, I got good relationship with the people I work in, and know everybody there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">Q: You mentioned that you volunteer one, one day a week there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">A: Yeah, eight and a half hours.</span> <span id="s2910">I get there by… well, I used to at eight o’clock, but then, there’s so much traffic on Boone Avenue when school is in session, if I try to get out here ten to eight, to be in the hospital at eight, I can sit 20 minutes and can’t even get out my driveway.</span> <span id="s2911">So it’s worthwhile for me to get up a half an hour earlier and leave here about 7:30.</span> <span id="s2912">But then, we have other things.</span> <span id="s2913">We have bake sales, we have book sales.</span> <span id="s2914">And in the morning, I… what I do is like a gopher.</span> <span id="s2915">Anything they ask, we, we do.</span> <span id="s2916">And then, the afternoon, I go to the gift shop, because in the morning it’s a lot of running around.</span> <span id="s2917">And my legs don’t take it as well, so when I get in the gift shop, then it’s more relaxing, except when we have Beanie Babies, then it’s not very relaxing.</span> <span id="s2918">There’s… people still go wild over the Beanie Babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">Q: What’s the name of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">A: Clark Regional Medical Center.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q: Here in Winchester?</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">A: Here in Winchester, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">Q: And what do you do the other days of the week?</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">A: Well, take somebody else’s place.</span> <span id="s2925">Like somebody goes out of town, like I was out of town Monday, so somebody fills in what I do.</span> <span id="s2926">So, if they go out of town, then I fill in what they do.</span> <span id="s2927">And then, the only bad thing is that I don’t drive at night, because we really got a lot going on in the synagogue, but it’s always at night.</span> <span id="s2928">And I have that horror getting stuck on Interstate 64, with a flat tire, or the car stops.</span> <span id="s2929">So, I do have a car phone, I… I don’t know, it just… it’d be scary.</span> <span id="s2930">So I don’t go after dark.</span> <span id="s2931">I do in town, I drive.</span> <span id="s2932">I’m a member of AARP, and we meet in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">Q: Do you have anything else that you’d like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2935">I’m glad it’s over with.</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">Q: Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2937">A: I enjoyed seeing you again, but that…</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">Q: I certainly enjoyed seeing you.</span> <span id="s2939">I thank you so much for doing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">A: And I wish you well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">End of Tape Six, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">Conclusion of Interview Josef Färber, born Feb. 14,
