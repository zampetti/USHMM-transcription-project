This is Muriel Nathanson, interviewing Johanna Mantel, a righteous Gentile.</span> <span id="s5">The interview is taking place on November 12, 1987, in Mrs. Mantel’s home.</span> <span id="s6">First of all, Johanna, I want to thank you so much for being a part of this project.</span> <span id="s7">And, you do understand that we are planning to make tapes that can be used as curriculum in the high schools.</span> <span id="s8">And, we appreciate your contribution to this program.</span> <span id="s9">Uh…tell me a little about yourself.</span> <span id="s10">Johanna.</span> <span id="s11">About your family background, and how you came to be involved in harboring a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s12">First of all, tell us where you lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Well, I lived in Amsterdam, Holland.</span> <span id="s14">Our family consisted of four brothers, a sister and myself, of course.</span> <span id="s15">There were six children, and my brothers were a lot older than I was.</span> <span id="s16">So, I started working, I had my education and I started working when I was eighteen years old in a plant in Amsterdam and the name of the plant was Hollandia Fabriken Cotton Verk .</span> <span id="s17">It was a raincoat factory, where worked about 1,200 people.</span> <span id="s18">Most people in the plant were Jewish.</span> <span id="s19">I worked in the office and the management was all Jewish people.</span> <span id="s20">So, I had a lot of contact with quite a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s21">Uh…I had a lot of friends with Jewish people--because in Holland and Amsterdam, there were so many, so you don’t think anything about it.</span> <span id="s22">We had a nice time with them.</span> <span id="s23">You could have fun with them, when they had money, and when they were short of money, you still had fun with them, too.</span> <span id="s24">So, uh.</span> <span id="s25">.</span> <span id="s26">I worked there for quite some years.</span> <span id="s27">At first, I worked in bookkeeping and later on, in purchasing.</span> <span id="s28">And, then, of course, do you want to start me with the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s31">We heard a lot in Holland about the Jewish people picked up and destroyed in Germany, but, still, we couldn’t believe that.</span> <span id="s32">It was so close by.</span> <span id="s33">Germany is really so close by to Holland, but still you didn’t believe it--what was going on.</span> <span id="s34">That they were destroying the homes and shops and everything like that.</span> <span id="s35">But, then, of course, one day it happened in Holland.</span> <span id="s36">Because they came in in May 1940.</span> <span id="s37">I still remember that so good, because it was 6 o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s38">A beautiful day.</span> <span id="s39">It was outside and all of a sudden, I was still in bed, and I heard noise in the street.</span> <span id="s40">Quite strange, because it was always so quiet.</span> <span id="s41">So, I went out of my bed and looked outside and people were talking, and everything like that.</span> <span id="s42">And, all of a sudden, we heard airplanes coming over, but not high, really, pretty low, and then we found out that the Germans invaded Holland.</span> <span id="s43">And, because, after three days, really, the war was over and really happened because they destroyed first Rotterdam, the harbor, the houses and everything like that, and then, they say, “when you don’t stop and don’t--then we will destroy Amsterdam and the rest of Holland”.</span> <span id="s44">So, that’s the reason.</span> <span id="s45">That was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s46">And, that was the day, too, that all these Germans came in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: How did you and your family become involved, then, in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, it happened--my brother, he was married to a Jewish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: And, so, in 1940 or soon after that, I think, they started to give the Jewish people a star.</span> <span id="s51">But, she never was wearing a star.</span> <span id="s52">So, like a kind of hiding.</span> <span id="s53">But, she just lived with my brother.</span> <span id="s54">And, because we knew so many Jewish people, you were involved really so much in it, because in the plant there were so many people working over there.</span> <span id="s55">So, then, soon already because they can start picking…first it went slow, of course, because…first no stars, then stars, and then they started picking up the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s56">So, we got more involved in it.</span> <span id="s57">So, at a certain moment then, it was, I think in 1942 or something like that…well, they started collecting all kinds of material and everything, and they started picking up the Jewish people already.</span> <span id="s58">So, then, the people were afraid, and they were asking a few things to say for them.</span> <span id="s59">Or, they were asking me, especially in the plant, because I knew a lot of people in the plant, too.</span> <span id="s60">I worked in the office, but I was always very much interested in the plant itself, what they were making, and sometimes we had to go in the plant, and I met a lot of people--Jewish people--in the plant, too.</span> <span id="s61">And, then, they were asking…a few people were asking me if I…when something would happen, if I could go to their houses and tell them what happened or anything like that.</span> <span id="s62">So, I promised and did never think it will happen, really.</span> <span id="s63">Then it was in…they were in hiding places…it is a little bit difficult to go back all of a sudden…and, yah, I think that started before the invasion…in the plant…so, the Jewish people, I had a contact with them.</span> <span id="s64">I came to their houses, more, really than before the war, because now we wanted to help them.</span> <span id="s65">Don’t ask me why…you are just doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes, because I was not married, of course.</span> <span id="s68">I had…at that time I had a fiance, but I was not married.</span> <span id="s69">Didn’t want to get married, either because it was too dangerous in the wartime.</span> <span id="s70">Because, when you do something for the people and they find out, they’ll take you and shoot you, or send you away.</span> <span id="s71">So, that was the reason…one of the reasons…we didn’t get married at that time.</span> <span id="s72">So, then I started going…people went in hiding places because they were afraid to be picked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: What kinds of hiding places?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Well, first I had…it was an older man, I very good remember.</span> <span id="s75">He was the buyer of the plant, and he went in a…staying with some older ladies.</span> <span id="s76">And, so he went out on the street many times, but for the rest, hardly really, but once in a while, when it was dark, then he would go out in the street.</span> <span id="s77">But, still, we were taking care of it, bringing coupons or bringing some things what he needed.</span> <span id="s78">So, that’s…then, my brother, he was very much involved in it.</span> <span id="s79">Really, he did underground work, so much.</span> <span id="s80">And, he couldn’t come to our house too much anymore, because they found out he was doing it, so he didn’t want to bring us in trouble.</span> <span id="s81">And he came to our house very seldom, with his car, just coming in the house, saying “Hi”, and everything.</span> <span id="s82">And, if we needed something, and right away, out again.</span> <span id="s83">So, then I had another older man…Max Bullock was his name.</span> <span id="s84">I can mention it because he is not here anynore, with an older sister.</span> <span id="s85">And, they started hiding out in apartments, in a poor neighborhood, without the stars, so they could go on the street, and like that.</span> <span id="s86">Then I had a few more people.</span> <span id="s87">We would just go, bring coupons—you know, coupons for the food and everything like that…</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s89">So, you really had several people that you were bringing food and coupons…</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Not food, really.</span> <span id="s91">It was more…….</span> <span id="s92">.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Coupons?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: …coupons, yes.</span> <span id="s95">And when they needed something, we would bring that over.</span> <span id="s96">My brother many times was asking me or the people in the plant, the management in the plant who was involved with a lot of other people, asked me to do that.</span> <span id="s97">So, it happened in, I think, in 1942, that, one day, I wanted to leave the plant, and my boss told me not to do it, because the plant was surrounded by the polizei.</span> <span id="s98">I never forgot that day, really, because….</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Sometimes it’s hard to bring these things back.</span> <span id="s100">Do you want to stop for a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Now, you were saying that, in 1942, you wanted to leave and the S.S. had surrounded the plant…</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yah, and they came in and we…they came in and were shouting.</span> <span id="s103">“One side and the other side.”</span> <span id="s104">So, first, we all had to come out, because I worked in the office.</span> <span id="s105">We all had to come out and stand in the hall and they were shouting, “One side and the other side.”</span> <span id="s106">In the beginning we were thinking, the women on one side and the men on one side, and then they started shouting, “No, the Jewish people on one side and the other ones on this side.”</span> <span id="s107">So, that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s108">Meanwhile some of my friends who could say, “Can you go to my home when something happens?”</span> <span id="s109">so, I say, “Yah, it’s O.K.” So I (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s110">I think, about an hour we were standing there, then we had to leave the plant.</span> <span id="s111">We could go out.</span> <span id="s112">Of course we didn’t know what happened to the other people, but I went to almost a few houses of my friends, and that’s terrible.</span> <span id="s113">Tell them what happened, and they started shouting and crying and everything like that, because they were for sure that they wouldn’t come back.</span> <span id="s114">Anyhow, we heard the next day, that they put trucks in front of the plant, and loaded all the Jewish people in them--with their families.</span> <span id="s115">They picked up their families and everything like that, and, altogether, it was 1,500 people.</span> <span id="s116">It is in the book, too.</span> <span id="s117">You can read it.</span> <span id="s118">They picked up…</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: From the one plant?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: From the one plant, yah.</span> <span id="s121">The company’s--yah, the plant…only the management…a few of the management…got away because they went in the basement and were hiding between the material.</span> <span id="s122">And, then, a few people…I know for one boy.</span> <span id="s123">He got off the train because they were transported by train.</span> <span id="s124">He got off in a curve because the train was slowing down…that’s what I still remember a few things, really.</span> <span id="s125">And, he got off the train, and he came, because my younger brother was working in the plant, too, and he came out and came to our house, if we could hide him.</span> <span id="s126">We couldn’t do it, because we already…because we were planning to have other people in the house when something went very bad.</span> <span id="s127">So, he went somewhere else.</span> <span id="s128">My brother took care of that.</span> <span id="s129">Now, I forget to tell, really, that my older brother, who was the president of the sister plant, he wait…</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Weeso?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Weeso, yah…it was a small town, and close to Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: And, then the management didn’t want to stay more as a president, because they were for sure they would take the whole plant, the Germans, when the management stayed Jewish.</span> <span id="s134">So, they made my older brother…my brother…his name is Joseph…he is not living anymore, either.</span> <span id="s135">They made him president of that plant at the moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: So, that’s perhaps, one of the reasons, too, that he helped so many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: So, they took all the people away.</span> <span id="s140">I think only a few came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: How did you…were your parents involved in this, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: No, my…only my mother lived.</span> <span id="s143">My mother lived then, because it was really one of the reasons, too.</span> <span id="s144">We lived in an apartment house, first.</span> <span id="s145">And, then, my brother started asking me, “Could you…’ because most times it was I who had to do it, my mother was a lot older…”When we moved you to a larger house,…woud you do this?”</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Oh, would you keep people in hiding, if they moved you to a larger…?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Yes, because we found a nice place and, that is, what I told you, in Patricia’s house, upstairs…</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: “Would you do that?”</span> <span id="s150">I say, “Yah.</span> <span id="s151">It’s O.K.” I don’t know why but I promised everything.</span> <span id="s152">I would take them.</span> <span id="s153">You are younger so you don’t think about it, that they will shoot you.</span> <span id="s154">When something happen, you die.</span> <span id="s155">(good for a tape or for text--voice and content.)</span> <span id="s156">So, then we moved, and I think it was in ’41.</span> <span id="s157">I don’t know the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: We moved to a larger house.</span> <span id="s160">It’s not very important.</span> <span id="s161">And, so, this, yah…and later on…I say, “it’s O.K..’</span> <span id="s162">in that house was a nice hiding place.</span> <span id="s163">Where we lived before, there was no hiding place at all.</span> <span id="s164">So, then, we started living in Amsterdam…on Standhardes Strade.</span> <span id="s165">I forgot the number.</span> <span id="s166">I think it is something with 50, but it is not so important, I guess.</span> <span id="s167">And, we lived in there, and I don’t know exactly the date when two people, Jewish people, friends of my brother too…in the business…came to our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: I see, so there was a contact between your brother and these two people?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: …and these…yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: A man and a woman or two…</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: No…Yes…older ones…yah…and they…it was more a business connection with the two…yes.</span> <span id="s172">Good friends, too.</span> <span id="s173">Before the time…before they came to that house, I got to know them, too, because it was on my way from the plant to our home.</span> <span id="s174">And then I stopped, always, too.</span> <span id="s175">And, they wanted to prepare…they gave me some presents…They gave me some material to make a dress, and, that’s the way I got to know them.</span> <span id="s176">They asked me many times to stop for a moment so they got to know me.</span> <span id="s177">I forgot in what year they came to the house.</span> <span id="s178">I can’t remember that.</span> <span id="s179">I think when it got really bad, it was in 1943, so just after what happened in the plant.</span> <span id="s180">So, it must be 1943 or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: And they lived in our house for about…for two years, until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s183">They never came outside.</span> <span id="s184">They lived on the third floor of the house and (words missing in original transcript) in night.</span> <span id="s185">They lived.</span> <span id="s186">They were hiding during the night in the attic on a mattress.</span> <span id="s187">It was all very nice.</span> <span id="s188">I mean…of course, it was awful, because you had to crawl in this space and sleep there, when you are used to lying down in a bed.</span> <span id="s189">But during the daytime, they had a nice room.</span> <span id="s190">But, now, what happened, the polizei came to the house and, it was a house where you have to lock…you could lock it from the inside.</span> <span id="s191">I don’t know if you know this, high up.</span> <span id="s192">And, it was scary when they came, so we decided because Rudy was not living at our house…</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Oh, Rudy was your fiance at the time, and now your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s195">My mother was living downstairs.</span> <span id="s196">I was living on the first floor where you have to open the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: And then, you have my brother was more higher, and then, they had their room.</span> <span id="s199">So we decided, because that room looked as if it was lived in, and that was not good.</span> <span id="s200">So, we decided that Rudy would live in that room, and sleep there during the night, while they were gone upstairs.</span> <span id="s201">They could live there during the daytime.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: And then, so they lived in that room, and once in a while they came downstairs.</span> <span id="s204">While during the week, they were eating downstairs with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Um, hum.</span> <span id="s206">That was a risk, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s208">But…of course it is a risk, but you don’t think about it because, what it is, you could lock the door…you had to lock the door…of course, it was not necessary…with a key inside.</span> <span id="s209">So, when they ring the bell, then I would open a little, because everybody was scared helping in the war, was careful.</span> <span id="s210">You opened a little window in the door and you asked who is there, or something like that.</span> <span id="s211">And, you say, “Oh, I have to get the key from the inside.”</span> <span id="s212">While you were going inside to get the key, we had an alarm really so they knew when there was something going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Sounds perhaps a little bit complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: But, yes.</span> <span id="s217">So, they were down there.</span> <span id="s218">But the funny part, because you didn’t…that is another story, really.</span> <span id="s219">Perhaps you are interested?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Because…O.K….</span> <span id="s222">we lived in a we had a block of houses.</span> <span id="s223">Uh…then in that time you didn’t have electricity any more.</span> <span id="s224">So everything was dark.</span> <span id="s225">So, you have to do it with a candle or anything like that.</span> <span id="s226">But, many times, you didn’t have candles.</span> <span id="s227">But, what happened now, the Germans locked every box because they were living in that block of houses…the Germans, too.</span> <span id="s228">They wanted to have light, so they connected everything again, but then, they came into every house separate to lock…to make a lock on that box--electricity box.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: The electric box.</span> <span id="s230">The fuse box?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: The fuse box, yes.</span> <span id="s232">But, then, what they did in ours, they didn’t…or they couldn’t…they didn’t lock it really, and so, Rudy could open the box up, and made electricity.</span> <span id="s233">But, the Germans were making electricity certain hours of the day, like, for example, we had light from 8-10, and they turned it off, and then, in the morning, it started again from 8-10.</span> <span id="s234">So, we had some light.</span> <span id="s235">Now, what we were doing, of course, when we had that light.</span> <span id="s236">Everything was uh…I don’t know how you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Covered?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Outside you could close it…</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Shuttered?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Shutters, yah.</span> <span id="s241">From the inside.</span> <span id="s242">And we were eating, and we had a little bit of light.</span> <span id="s243">But, then, some…so funny…we had a candle there standing, too.</span> <span id="s244">Now, a friend of my brother came over and knocked on the window that he was there, and we had to turn off the light, because nobody knew that we had Jewish people in the house, and all this.</span> <span id="s245">So, then he turned on the light in the candle again.</span> <span id="s246">Later on, after the war, he was asking us, “I always was wondering, you always had the same candle.”</span> <span id="s247">You see.</span> <span id="s248">How this little thing really… Q; Yes, you were lucky the Germans didn’t notice that.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: But then when they had a special day of Friday evening, they couldn’t turn on the light.</span> <span id="s250">I think it was, so we had to turn on the light for them.</span> <span id="s251">And, then they wanted to eat upstairs because they were eating…I think the head of a fish, which they like…a horrible smell…yah, they stayed there for two years and their daughter stayed with my sister, but she didn’t wear a star.</span> <span id="s252">She went outside…</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: So, it was possible in Amsterdam for some Jews to remain through the war.</span> <span id="s254">They just didn’t put the stars on, and no one betrayed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Nobody betrayed them, but, you know Jewish people can have very Jewish expression, but you have Jewish people who don’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: So, these friends of mine, like Max Bullock and his sister, they were very Jewish-looking, so people betrayed them, and that’s the reason the police came in, and, yes…did I tell you about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Yes, that they had the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: I don’t think I told it here on the tape, or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Why don’t you repeat it again?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yah, I think I didn’t because this was the day…oh, yah…one of the management, Sven is his name, he asked me if he could bring some coupons and some other things to Max Bullock and his sister, who were hiding…in a hiding place.</span> <span id="s262">So, then, I told him, “I am sorry, I can’t go tonight because I have to do the cooking.</span> <span id="s263">My mother is not home.”</span> <span id="s264">I said, “But, I will go tomorrow night.”</span> <span id="s265">He said, “It’s O.K.’ But the next day, he told me, “No, Johanna, you can’t go because the polozei came and they took them away because sometimes they were making noise when they were not supposed to do, you know.</span> <span id="s266">Because you have to be so careful with all this kind of things.</span> <span id="s267">But, the other ones I brought coupons to.</span> <span id="s268">You had to buy coupons from the black market of course, because you…</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Where did you get the money for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Well, that’s my brother…yah, he tried to hide it…because it cost money, of course.</span> <span id="s271">Especially, because we had two people more in the house.</span> <span id="s272">Especially the last year of the war, it was so bad, because in September we got freed, but not Amsterdam and it’s surroundings.</span> <span id="s273">So, we didn’t have any food, or anything like that, but that February before that, I went to my in-laws to get some food and they lived in the East part of Holland.</span> <span id="s274">That’s about 100 or 110 miles from Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s275">And, it was in the winter time.</span> <span id="s276">Do you want to hear that?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: And I went on my way because the boys couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s279">My fiance couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s280">My brother couldn’t go because they were picking up the boys from the street and sending them to Germany.</span> <span id="s281">So, I had to go and it was in February.</span> <span id="s282">It was still cold.</span> <span id="s283">On a bicycle.</span> <span id="s284">Lucky I had the bicycle with rubber tires.</span> <span id="s285">Many times there were no rubber tires, any more.</span> <span id="s286">We had wooden tires.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Uh, hum.</span> <span id="s288">Wooden tires?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Oh, yah, yah.</span> <span id="s290">Because there was no rubber, no air in that…a lot of people…I was lucky.</span> <span id="s291">Still I had that.</span> <span id="s292">So, I went to Hengelo.That’s the name where my in-laws lived.</span> <span id="s293">That is close to Germany.</span> <span id="s294">On my bicycle.</span> <span id="s295">But, they said, “dress yourself warm, because it will be cold on the bicycle.”</span> <span id="s296">And, because there was no food, nothing else, I got some…still some sandwiches, what we tried to buy on the black market.</span> <span id="s297">When you see the prices of the black market, it is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s298">But, anyway, we had some, and then, I went on my bicycle.</span> <span id="s299">But, it was pretty far when you drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: And, so, half way I wanted to stop.</span> <span id="s302">It was in Deventer, I still remember that place that was just over the Rhine.</span> <span id="s303">And, what happened, really, it started to rain before that time, and I had a short fur coat on…so I was like a cat…</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Wet.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Oh, and then I got an address in Deventer from a friend of mine in Amsterdam, and he said, “why don’t you go to that address, and they will, you can sleep overnight and go back on the next morning?’</span> <span id="s306">so when I was in Deventer, I went to these people.</span> <span id="s307">They were bombed out too, and they didn’t have a place for me to stay there.</span> <span id="s308">They say, “Well, I bring you to a hotel.’</span> <span id="s309">Everything is dark.</span> <span id="s310">Of course there was no light or nothing.</span> <span id="s311">So they brought me to a hotel, where all the windows were out, and it was cold.</span> <span id="s312">I was wet and everything like that.</span> <span id="s313">They brought me to my room with a candle.</span> <span id="s314">But, they had to take the candle back again because</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: …he didn’t have too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: So, I was there, soaking wet and was in bed and then, all of a sudden, I heard a noise…a noise just terrible that was going on here.</span> <span id="s317">I really thought they were bombing the town.</span> <span id="s318">And, every time again, a lot of noise and then was gone again.</span> <span id="s319">And, then the next morning, I found it was the V-2s.</span> <span id="s320">You know they were shooting over Holland--from Germany, over Holland, to England.</span> <span id="s321">But, I had never heard them in Amsterdam, so I was…but the next day, I had the wind with me and I was drying off.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: It dried you off.</span> <span id="s323">So you bicycled 120 miles…110 miles…</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: …so I stayed with my in-laws for a few week.</span> <span id="s325">So, my father-in-law, because he could exchange things.</span> <span id="s326">You will ask why…how come he had so many things.</span> <span id="s327">While he was exchanging his goods, he had all kinds of things, because he had a store with sheets in it and towels, and everything like that…could exchange it with other farmers.</span> <span id="s328">He went to the farm, so I brought back beans and rice and things like that, what you really could do something with and butter, but then, it was…I think it was March 1, they told us they would close the bridge over the Rhine, and you can’t go over it any more.</span> <span id="s329">So, I had to go back before that time…to go home.</span> <span id="s330">Well, I was…they put 150 lbs.</span> <span id="s331">on my bicycle, and they…150 lbs.</span> <span id="s332">--- I still think it is more here—Dutch pounds are more here than here the pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yah, on my bicycle.</span> <span id="s335">In the beginning, I was going from left to right and couldn’t keep my balance, but my brother-in-law--he took me away about…</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: It would have been 150 kilos.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No. 150 lbs.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: So, I went over there, and I came…just before I came to the wasser and the bridge, and it took, I don’t know exactly how many hours.</span> <span id="s340">They told us, the Germans are standing on top of the bridge, and “…they will take all the food away from you.’</span> <span id="s341">I had bags on the side of my bicycle, where we had put it in.</span> <span id="s342">But, for me, I had…there were people who were walking from Amsterdam up to the northern part of Holland to exchange things, with a hand cart, you know.</span> <span id="s343">Yah, walking all the way with everything on it.</span> <span id="s344">They came back with the food and they took all the food away from them.</span> <span id="s345">So, that was going on already, and the story was going on before I reached the bridge.</span> <span id="s346">And then, one man, he stopped me and he say, ‘You know what you can do?</span> <span id="s347">I have a store here.’</span> <span id="s348">I still remember a batcha store.</span> <span id="s349">“And, we can go to the store, unpack everything, and just put a little bit in the bags.</span> <span id="s350">He will not hold you, and go over the bridge.</span> <span id="s351">I have family living there on the other side of the bridge.</span> <span id="s352">And, you put your things over there.</span> <span id="s353">Then you come back again, and do that…’ Well, it took me until the evening to do this.</span> <span id="s354">Dog-tired, of course, and when it is evening, and so I could stay with the other people until the next morning.</span> <span id="s355">So, that was wonderful.</span> <span id="s356">Now, it always bothered me after that time, because I forgot the address.</span> <span id="s357">I forgot the name of the people--I never could remember it anymore….</span> <span id="s358">To thank them afterwards, you know.</span> <span id="s359">After the war.</span> <span id="s360">I never could remember that name or address.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: It seems as if people in…the Dutch helped one another, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s363">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s364">And, that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s365">The next morning I went on, you see so many people walking, and flat tires and I got more and more tired.</span> <span id="s366">I had to be in before 8 o’clock, because there was curfew time.</span> <span id="s367">And, I got so tired, and then I was praying by myself, and I thought, “Oh God, please when I get a flat tire, let it be before my home.’</span> <span id="s368">And, then I was in Bussum.</span> <span id="s369">Bussum is about 20 miles to the farmhouse from Amsterdam, another brother over there lived over there.</span> <span id="s370">And, when I was there, I got a little bit sick.</span> <span id="s371">You know, my period started, and I forgot his address.</span> <span id="s372">I didn’t know his address and I was standing next to my bicycle and then a man was asking me, “Can I help you with something?’</span> <span id="s373">And I say, ‘Yes.’</span> <span id="s374">I say, “I don’t know the address of my brother anymore and I want to go to him.”</span> <span id="s375">He say, ‘ Well, do you know his name?’</span> <span id="s376">I say, “Yes.’</span> <span id="s377">Because he has the same name as I have.</span> <span id="s378">He say, ‘why don’t you come in the house and we will call him.”</span> <span id="s379">So, I called him and I went over to my brother and his wife and he started…and I could clean myself and everything, and they wanted me to stay for the evening, but I didn’t want to stay, because they didn’t have any food, and because I needed food myself.</span> <span id="s380">Otherwise, you are obligated to give something of the food too.</span> <span id="s381">But I couldn’t do that because we had for so many people.</span> <span id="s382">So, I say, ‘No, I am going home.”</span> <span id="s383">And then, every bridge I met, I walked.</span> <span id="s384">I got…the funny part is that when the man tried to pick up my bicycle, or hold my bicycle, he fell down on the floor with it.</span> <span id="s385">It was so heavy.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: He didn’t expect it.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Later on I could bicycle with one hand, really.</span> <span id="s388">So, then I then you don’t believe it, but you can ask Rudy and you can ask my younger brother.</span> <span id="s389">They were waiting for me, because they knew I had to come back at that time, because the bridge was closed and everything like that.</span> <span id="s390">And so, they were waiting for me.</span> <span id="s391">It was just before…a little before eight and go on the sidewalk, and then I had a flat tire.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Right in front of the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A; Right in front of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Somebody was watching.</span> <span id="s395">How long did you and your mother hide these two people.</span> <span id="s396">Man and wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s398">Husband and wife.</span> <span id="s399">Well, that’s what I don’t know.</span> <span id="s400">I think it started in ’43.</span> <span id="s401">I know it started after that accident in the plant.</span> <span id="s402">So, it must be ’43--till ‘45 .</span> <span id="s403">I think it was about two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And, they never went outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: No.</span> <span id="s406">After the war, well, we got married and we were tired of everything that has happened.</span> <span id="s407">So then we started again, because my brother…because we did a lot for him and he did a lot, really.</span> <span id="s408">He really worked in the underground.</span> <span id="s409">Went…he had a large boat and he went over the lake to the other side of Holland, and during the night, too many times, taking in food, bags of food and everything like that, yah, and distribute that when he came back home.</span> <span id="s410">Yes.</span> <span id="s411">And, so he did a lot for people.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: You mentioned a young woman to whom you gave your papers.</span> <span id="s413">Tell us about that please.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I don’t care too much to talk about that really, because it was a little bit ugly part of it, don’t you think?</span> <span id="s415">So…use I think that.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: But still, that’s part of what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s418">Well, Max Bullock, who was in the hiding place, he asked me before they picked him up, if I could save some papers for him and they were shares…I never know really what was in it, but still it was a big yellow envelope.</span> <span id="s419">I say, “Yah, it’s O.K.” so, I took home and I saved it for him .</span> <span id="s420">now, his younger sister asked me if I wanted to…could give my…how do you really call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: The identity card.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: The identity card, what everybody had in Holland, because you needed it for the Germans.</span> <span id="s423">When they stop you on the street, they ask for it.</span> <span id="s424">So, you have to show it and you tell exactly how old you are, if you are Christian or anything like that.</span> <span id="s425">So, she asked me because she wanted to go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s426">And, her name is Bullock, too, but I don’t remember her first name.</span> <span id="s427">and, she asked me.</span> <span id="s428">I said, “Yah, it is O.K.” and, so she left for Switzerland.</span> <span id="s429">I, myself, because I didn’t want to give it up right away that I lost my…</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: You told them…</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Yah, I went to my in-laws in the East part of Holland, and when I came back, then I told the authorities that I lost my card in Hengelo--that is on the other side.</span> <span id="s432">And, they believed me, and so, they gave me another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: But, if she had been picked up with your original card, what would have happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: They shoot you…or they put you in a camp.</span> <span id="s435">Like, for example, too from the Jewish people…too…when they find out that you have Jewish people in the house, then they take the whole…everybody out of the house, and then they shoot you in front of the house.</span> <span id="s436">Now, we were lucky at that time really, because we had…I mix it up…</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: That’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Because when the polizei came in, they came in during the night once, and I had to open the door, because I was sleeping on the first floor, and they came in…five of the seizurheit polizei…greuni polizei is all the same thing.</span> <span id="s439">And, they came in, and they went through the whole house.</span> <span id="s440">They never found the Jewish people because…yah…because they were upstairs in the attic.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q; And, you said that there was a panel that didn’t…</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s443">It was in the attic…was a panel with all this…</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: With the boards…</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yah, with the boards.</span> <span id="s446">It really…it was a piece of wood…a strip of wood…you know, like this…</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yah, and it was a strip of wood, so you couldn’t see it, and you could open this up, and they were sleeping in that.</span> <span id="s449">They had the mattresses in it and they were sleeping during the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: In other words, you were able to open that panel, and there was a mattress behind it, and that’s where they slept during the night.</span> <span id="s451">So, that…</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Because they were not supposed to sleep in a bed or anything like that, because it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s453">Because they came…the Germans came in once during the night--at 12 0’clock, during the night…So you were never sure what time hey were coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: But, then I want to go back to the girl again, O.K.?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: So, she went to Switzerland, and I had these papers.</span> <span id="s458">I never heard from her, but, after the war, because Max Bullock--they took Max Bullock and his older sister away--and we never heard from them, so they passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: They had taken the apartment in the poorer section?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes, uh, huh…so they passed--they died, really, and so she came back after the war.</span> <span id="s461">We never heard anything from her, but only from her lawyer.</span> <span id="s462">And, her lawyer asked us to set the papers up.</span> <span id="s463">So, that’s what I did, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: After the war, did you, or your mother, or your brother hear from the couple whom you had hidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Oh, yes, because my mother…we were tired…we…Rudy and I married after the war, and we left, and we saw them occasionally, because my mother was still in that house, too.</span> <span id="s466">And, they were in the house, and so, they were very nice for my mother.</span> <span id="s467">Yah.</span> <span id="s468">And, for the rest, we moved out of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s469">We went to another town, so we didn’t have too much contact with them.</span> <span id="s470">We heard, of course, through my mother and my sister, too, because my sister was more in contact with them, because she took care of the…that girl for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Tell us about that.</span> <span id="s472">About their little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: I don’t know too much.</span> <span id="s474">My sister lived about ten miles from Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: More in the suburb.</span> <span id="s477">Now it is close together, because everything is built in, but, at that time it was the suburb, and the little girl--she was not little anymore, I think--I think she must be about 12 already.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: And she lived with my sister for a few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: While her parents were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s482">And, once in a while she came to our house to visit her parents, but it was very emotional, so they didn’t do it too much.</span> <span id="s483">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: It was also very dangerous, I would think.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: All this kind of dangerous.</span> <span id="s486">That’s the funny part…it’s not so funny, but you don’t think about it, really.</span> <span id="s487">You don’t think about all this kind of things when you are doing it.</span> <span id="s488">Because, that’s the reason, too, that we didn’t want to get married.</span> <span id="s489">Because, when they…when we had the people in the house, when something would happen--they would bring you outside and shoot you.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: And we didn’t want to…at that time, when you marry, you are supposed to have children.</span> <span id="s492">Now, it’s different, when you don’t marry.</span> <span id="s493">So, we didn’t want to have children, or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: So, we waited until after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: And, then you left Amsterdam for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Oh, yah.</span> <span id="s498">After that, we started living in that houseboat.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Your brother’s houseboat?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s501">Because there were so many house destroyed.</span> <span id="s502">And, during the war, too, they took all these woods out of the streets, too, because you didn’t have heating.</span> <span id="s503">You didn’t have fooid.</span> <span id="s504">And, so, near the street cars, and you had wooden blocks in the street car, between the rails.</span> <span id="s505">They took that out.</span> <span id="s506">When you rent an apartment, when somebody lives upstairs, third floor, they took all the steps out.</span> <span id="s507">Wood--to have some fire going on.</span> <span id="s508">So, Amsterdam looked terible, really, at that time, and you couldn’t rent a house, buy or anything.</span> <span id="s509">Nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: We could do ot once, in ’44, that was before the end of the war, and we could go and rent an apartment.</span> <span id="s512">It was a nice apartment, but, my brother, he say, “I ask you not to do it, because, otherwise, we couldn’t take care of the family.”</span> <span id="s513">Because my mother couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s514">My mother was sick too.</span> <span id="s515">Diabetes.</span> <span id="s516">So, she couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s517">So, I helped her out.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: That was quite an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: It was, yes, and I…uh…there are so many things more that happened, but had nothing to do, really with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s520">But, many times, you had to go to the Black Market for coupons, for ourselves, and to have more coupons for them, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Because, that’s what they always paid for--when you had to go to the Black Market and buy the coupons and everything for food, they always--these people always paid for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: They had brought money into hiding with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s525">Yah.</span> <span id="s526">Weinberg…their name is Weinberg.</span> <span id="s527">And, they have always, when they…we didn’t have to support them.</span> <span id="s528">No.</span> <span id="s529">Never.</span> <span id="s530">They have, when they wanted food or coupons, or anything…everything like that…we can’t really, because when you buy one quart of milk, you had to pay ten dollars.</span> <span id="s531">I don’t figure out really guilders or dollars, because equivalent of money really, what you can buy.</span> <span id="s532">Because, for a bag of potatoes, you pay one hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s533">The price is crazy…really silly.</span> <span id="s534">So, we never could have done this.</span> <span id="s535">Because I didn’t have a father.</span> <span id="s536">My mother…yah…so, no…they paid for every food what we had to take extra.</span> <span id="s537">They paid for all of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: But then was the trouble, of course, difficulty to get this, the coupons and everything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: And then to get the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s542">That’s the reason, I say I went to my in-laws.</span> <span id="s543">So, we were sharing it.</span> <span id="s544">When you have potatoes, you have to count your pieces…yah…it</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: It was a very difficult time.</span> <span id="s546">And, it was fortunate that you made it through without being caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s548">We don’t realize it…at the moment, you don’t realize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: And Rudy helped, too, out.</span> <span id="s551">Yes, and my youngest brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: So your whole family was really involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s554">Yah, because, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s555">I think we would do it again when something like that happens.</span> <span id="s556">But many times, people think, “Oh, nothing can happen, really, like this anymore.’</span> <span id="s557">But, you see it happening all over the weorld.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: It can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: I had asked you this before.</span> <span id="s561">But, apparently you and your family have not been acknowledged in the memorial in Jerusalem at Yad Vashem?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: I never heard about it, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: But we really were not…after the war we really were not interested in it…nothing anymore…we were so tired of five years of war, and then we moved out of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s565">Later on, we lived in Utrecht and we lived on the houseboat and then everything like that…and, one thing really, you want to forget about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Yes, I would think so.</span> <span id="s567">And, then you have these souvenirs--the story of the plant and the story of the war years in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: I think it is a coincidence, really.</span> <span id="s569">About November 11, 1942, when it happened.</span> <span id="s570">Then I got a new letter from Amsterdam about a month ago, telling them that they were having an anniversary this year, and it was yesterday.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: The anniversary was yesterday?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yes, Yah.</span> <span id="s573">And they will put my letter on the desk over there, and then, the people who know me--I think they will read it, and, perhaps I hear some more from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: And, you have heard…you said that, in the book, there were some names of people you didn’t know had come through the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Yah, yah.</span> <span id="s576">That was nice to hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Johanna, I want to thank you very much for this.</span> <span id="s578">This is a very important part of our learning about what went on, and I hope it hasn’t been too hard for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: O h, no.</span> <span id="s580">It’s hard.</span> <span id="s581">Later on, perhaps you think, “Oh, I know more.’</span> <span id="s582">When I find some more interesting, I write it down and tell you about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: I would appreciate that.</span> <span id="s584">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s586">PAGE 17</span></p> <p><span id="s587">PAGE</span></p> <p><span
