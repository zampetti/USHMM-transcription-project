Snyderman (When were you born?</span> <span id="s11">Tell me about your grandparents.)</span> <span id="s12">I was born in Kiev on July 11, 1957.</span> <span id="s13">I remember my grandmother and grandfather.</span> <span id="s14">They lived in Kiev, too.</span> <span id="s15">They were born in a little Jewish town near Kiev.</span> <span id="s16">They cam to Kiev after 1917, after the revolution.</span> <span id="s17">My grandfather worked in a factory and my grandmother didn't work.</span> <span id="s18">We lived together.</span> <span id="s19">I was living my whole youth with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s20">I was sixteen when my grandfather died and seventeen when my grandmother died.</span> <span id="s21">They spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s22">My parents knew Yiddish.</span> <span id="s23">They can't speak very well, but they can understand.</span> <span id="s24">I know just simple words.</span> <span id="s25">I was with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s26">She took care of me.</span> <span id="s27">My grandmother was a very good cook.</span> <span id="s28">She baked delicious cakes.</span> <span id="s29">She cooked Jewish things-- strudel.</span> <span id="s30">My mother learned from her and I learned then, too.</span> <span id="s31">We only celebrated Passover.</span> <span id="s32">I remember when my grandfather went to synagogue on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s33">He went to synagogue on other Jewish holidays, too.</span> <span id="s34">He was traditional.</span> <span id="s35">I have been with my husband in Moscow's synagogue when I was much older.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">My father was a mechanical engineer; my mother too.</span> <span id="s37">Now my mother's retired.</span> <span id="s38">She's still in Kiev.</span> <span id="s39">My father also.</span> <span id="s40">We celebrated all birthdays of the family.</span> <span id="s41">It was a party with our relatives and friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">(grandparents) My grandfather told me about their life before the revolution.</span> <span id="s43">He was born in a big family.</span> <span id="s44">About-- I don't remember exactly-- he had five sisters and two brothers.</span> <span id="s45">He was the oldest.</span> <span id="s46">When his father died, he took care of the family.</span> <span id="s47">He was very big and he looked older than he was.</span> <span id="s48">They wrote in his document that he was not sixteen, but twenty-one, and he wrote this in this document so he could get work.</span> <span id="s49">There were laws against children working.</span> <span id="s50">His younger sister was really young.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">The town was called Dimev, near Zhitomir.</span> <span id="s52">It was a Jewish settlement.</span> <span id="s53">My relatives all came to Kiev.</span> <span id="s54">I have many cousins.</span> <span id="s55">Some have come to America.</span> <span id="s56">I think it's maybe a second cousin living in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s57">But we weren't so close in Kiev.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">(about your neighborhood growing up) We lived in a Jewish area.</span> <span id="s59">Many Jewish families lived in this area.</span> <span id="s60">We had many Jewish neighbors.</span> <span id="s61">I don't have problem with anti-semitism when I was really young.</span> <span id="s62">Mostly I played with Jewish children because we had a courtyard behind the buildings and there were many children of Jewish families.</span> <span id="s63">We played "lapta" in Russian.</span> <span id="s64">We moved when I was seven years old.</span> <span id="s65">We received a better apartment.</span> <span id="s66">That wasn't a Jewish neighborhood, but a new development.</span> <span id="s67">I changed schools.</span> <span id="s68">At the beginning, I didn't have a problem with the mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s69">I took math, Russian, Ukrainian, history, geography, biology.</span> <span id="s70">I liked school.</span> <span id="s71">I was a good student.</span> <span id="s72">I graduated well.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">After school I had sport club.</span> <span id="s74">I played with my new friends.</span> <span id="s75">(Was the history they taught really the way things were?)</span> <span id="s76">When I was really young I didn't understand, but in high school I understood that what they said wasn't true.</span> <span id="s77">In the higher grades.</span> <span id="s78">I had many friends.</span> <span id="s79">I was a good student.</span> <span id="s80">Sometimes I had problems, I still have many Jewish students in my class, about ten Jews.</span> <span id="s81">The whole class had thirty students.</span> <span id="s82">Usually we were treated the same.</span> <span id="s83">But I had a problem with one teacher.</span> <span id="s84">Chemistry.</span> <span id="s85">She didn't like me.</span> <span id="s86">I think it's because I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s87">I had lower grades than I deserved.</span> <span id="s88">This happened to all the other Jewish students.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">(What were your dreams?)</span> <span id="s90">I wanted to be a teacher.</span> <span id="s91">But it was impossible.</span> <span id="s92">I can't study at the teachers' college.</span> <span id="s93">Almost no Jews could become teachers.</span> <span id="s94">So I forgot about it and went to Moscow and took a course in college in Communications.</span> <span id="s95">They teach engineering for communication: for the mail, automation for the mail service, sorters, etc.</span> <span id="s96">I was there five years.</span> <span id="s97">But I lived in Kiev and took correspondence courses and twice a year I have exams in Moscow.</span> <span id="s98">After school I was working.</span> <span id="s99">I got a job as an electrical drafter, designer, then engineer in the same company.</span> <span id="s100">I became an electrical engineer after the five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">(How did you meet Alexander?)</span> <span id="s102">I was nineteen.</span> <span id="s103">We worked in the same organization.</span> <span id="s104">We knew each other three years before we decided to get married.</span> <span id="s105">Our families didn't know each other.</span> <span id="s106">They met when we decided to get married.</span> <span id="s107">We had a party in a restaurant with family and friends, about 100 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">My mother's parents were dead.</span> <span id="s109">But my grandmother on my father's side is alive.</span> <span id="s110">She didn't live with me, but we were very close.</span> <span id="s111">I was very close with her when I was older.</span> <span id="s112">She's a beautiful person, a very smart and strong woman.</span> <span id="s113">She is eighty-three, she's my best friend.</span> <span id="s114">She lived with her younger son and his family.</span> <span id="s115">I remember that she had a big family.</span> <span id="s116">She had three sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s117">The brother was killed in the second World War.</span> <span id="s118">My grandfather was killed in the war, too.</span> <span id="s119">My grandmother was with two small children.</span> <span id="s120">She never remarried.</span> <span id="s121">She lived in Sverdlovsk and L'vov until just before the second World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">(at work) It was a very big engineering company.</span> <span id="s123">Many Jewish people worked there.</span> <span id="s124">My boss was Jewish and my friends-- I had many, many friends.</span> <span id="s125">I liked working there.</span> <span id="s126">I worked fifteen years in the same place.</span> <span id="s127">I had a break when I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s128">I had two years off then.</span> <span id="s129">When we got married we lived in our own place.</span> <span id="s130">It was bad, a small room, but our own.</span> <span id="s131">(Alex: our own 10 square meters).</span></p> <p><span id="s132">When we had the baby we still lived there.</span> <span id="s133">We shared the kitchen.</span> <span id="s134">Two other families cooked with me.</span> <span id="s135">We had many, many problems.</span> <span id="s136">We have two other families, so three women.</span> <span id="s137">I was in good relations with them but they didn't like each other.</span> <span id="s138">It was difficult.</span> <span id="s139">They weren't Jewish.</span> <span id="s140">They were Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s141">We heard when they spoke with other people about the Jews.</span> <span id="s142">We stayed there four years.</span> <span id="s143">Then we got a new apartment [laughter].</span> <span id="s144">We waited seven years.</span> <span id="s145">we applied just after we got married.</span> <span id="s146">We were very lucky.</span> <span id="s147">Some people wait twenty years.</span> <span id="s148">We moved in 1986 to the new apartment in the new area.</span> <span id="s149">It was a good apartment.</span> <span id="s150">It was far from our old place.</span> <span id="s151">It was very mixed.</span> <span id="s152">I didn't know Jewish people there.</span> <span id="s153">We still worked.</span> <span id="s154">You know, I had a very comfortable feeling in my job and when I came home, I was with my family.</span> <span id="s155">I heard what people say about Jews, but it wasn't to me.</span> <span id="s156">We lived far from relatives but we met each other once a week.</span> <span id="s157">My friends come to my apartment, usually, and we went to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">(being Jewish) I only felt bad about it one time when I couldn't go to college.</span> <span id="s159">I tried three times in two years.</span> <span id="s160">It was not a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">(leaving Russia) We decided to leave Russian when we got married.</span> <span id="s162">In 1979.</span> <span id="s163">We married in 1978.</span> <span id="s164">So we applied.</span> <span id="s165">Then it was 1979 and emigration was closed.</span> <span id="s166">We didn't lose our jobs or anything.</span> <span id="s167">I wasn't a boss, I was just a drafter.</span> <span id="s168">I had some uncomfortable disputes with my boss, but that was it.</span> <span id="s169">He asked me why I want to leave the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">(Alexander and the KGB) I had a terrible feeling.</span> <span id="s171">We didn't tell our parents or friends about this.</span> <span id="s172">We spoke about it only with each other.</span> <span id="s173">It was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s174">It was in 1984.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">(being in Vienna and Rome with the children) We didn't have a big problem with our children.</span> <span id="s176">Igor was nine months, but he was a good baby.</span> <span id="s177">Vladimir was about eight years old.</span> <span id="s178">We didn't have much of a problem, but it was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">(Chernobyl) I was scared about my son and scared about all my family.</span> <span id="s180">My sister was in her ninth month of pregnancy.</span> <span id="s181">I worried a lot.</span> <span id="s182">She also left Kiev.</span> <span id="s183">They gave us vacations for one month-- the usual length.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">(Why Chicago?)</span> <span id="s185">My cousin lives here.</span> <span id="s186">She came to America eleven years ago.</span> <span id="s187">So we decided... They sponsored us.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">(What do you like here, and miss from there?)</span> <span id="s189">In Russia I miss my parents, my sister, my friends.</span> <span id="s190">It's different here, but it's interesting.</span> <span id="s191">I have a problem only with my English.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">(about the future) I hope that my parents and sister come to me.</span> <span id="s193">I so miss them.</span> <span id="s194">It's better here for the children.</span> <span id="s195">I think my sons will have a real life.</span> <span id="s196">I don't know what they should be.</span> <span id="s197">Whatever they want.</span></p></body></html>
