And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: In Cologne, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: And l-let’s talk a little bit about your -- your family and your brother.</span> <span id="s28">So tell me what did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: My father had a business in Cologne, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: You know what kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s32">At that time -- we’re talking in the 30’s, it was very fashionable that lady used to wear lacy jabot and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: What is a lace jabot?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: It’s those --</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Jacket?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: -- those things there that, you know, puffy lace, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Ah, ah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: And then also lace for decoration of various dresses, gowns, whatever.</span> <span id="s39">And also buttons in mother of pearl, and basically that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s40">He had an office acro -- pretty much across the street in Cologne [indecipherable] where the eau de Cologne, which is called corniche eswassa, have their offices.</span> <span id="s41">4711 is the name of the cologne, which will be on every bottle, so his office was across the street, you know?</span> <span id="s42">And a fairly large office with, of course, what you would call the storage area for the product and whatnot.</span> <span id="s43">And few employees and a partner.</span> <span id="s44">So he was on the road half of the time, selling, and then he switched with his partner and he stayed in the office and did the paperwork as it would be, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s45">And then of course when Hitler came, and it was before Hitler was sworn in, he couldn’t make -- he wasn’t allowed to make a living any more.</span> <span id="s46">You see, history has a way of being a little bit mistaken at times.</span> <span id="s47">He had to stop his business in ’32, before Hitler was actually sworn in as the head man there, as it would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Why did he have to stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Because Jews weren’t allowed to have a business any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: And so my grandfather, who lived a few -- you know, few miles out in a very lovely town called Siegburg.</span> <span id="s52">And he had the very large house there.</span> <span id="s53">And so my father, mother and my brother and I, we went to live there.</span> <span id="s54">And I lived there until 1933, August 17th, when I left for France and I got some French tutoring lessons before I went there, but I had taken French in what you commonly call in Germany, gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Which would be sort of like high school - college mixture because you can start with -- like you don’t even have to go to a public school, you can start and finish pretty much, you know and graduate there.</span> <span id="s57">So I was in one of these and their main language was French.</span> <span id="s58">And obviously I had the heads up for French, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s60">Tell me something about what your father was like when you were growing up, before -- before you left and before you have to move from Cologne to your grandfather’s and grandmother’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Well, he wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Were you close with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s64">He was -- he was really strict, but he was perfect, you know?</span> <span id="s65">No nonsense, but he loved us very much.</span> <span id="s66">And he was on the road the whole week and he came home Friday night, you know, for religious purposes, I guess, you know.</span> <span id="s67">And Saturday and Sunday and that allowed him to catch up on his accounting for what he did during the week, also.</span> <span id="s68">So I saw him Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Monday he was gone again.</span> <span id="s69">And actually, I would say -- how old was I?</span> <span id="s70">Maybe seven, eight -- six, seven, eight years old, I don’t know for sure, he got sick and tired of traveling with those big sample cases, so he hired -- he bought a car and he hired a chauffeur, because he was not very adept at driving.</span> <span id="s71">That wasn’t his forte.</span> <span id="s72">At that time obvi -- obviously he had to shift, so he had the chauffeur and in the morning it was very nice, the chauffeur took us around the block to the school.</span> <span id="s73">You know, I was in what you call grade school, you know, it was very nice.</span> <span id="s74">And oh, of course, that ceased after a little while, as -- it’s quite obvious.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: What was your father’s name, his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Leo.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Leo.</span> <span id="s78">And what about your mother?</span> <span id="s79">Your mother’s name is what?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Martha.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s82">And what was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: She was perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Angel.</span> <span id="s86">Wonderful.</span> <span id="s87">And she -- well, like I said, she was born in my grandfather’s town, which was like oh, let’s say 10 miles away.</span> <span id="s88">It was a small town called Siegburg, which was very, very picturesque.</span> <span id="s89">I mean, without seeing a picture, you can’t believe it, but -- and so my grandfather had plenty of room there.</span> <span id="s90">She had three sisters who were, when I was born, maiden aunts, and I guess this is why I loved women, because I was always pampered, I was -- first of all, I was the first male grandchild around, so you know, it’s -- left an impression on me, I had three lovely aunts, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: And did your father have siblings, did your fa --</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s93">My father had one sister and two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: He happened to be a twin.</span> <span id="s96">My grandmother on my father’s side had 12 children, of which eight died.</span> <span id="s97">You know, it wasn't like nowadays, you know.</span> <span id="s98">Didn’t have the medications to keep you alive and what not.</span> <span id="s99">And so four -- four of them lived.</span> <span id="s100">His twin died, he survived.</span> <span id="s101">He had two brothers, and one sister.</span> <span id="s102">And they lived little bit further away in a beautiful town in the mountains, in the Eyffel.</span> <span id="s103">It was called Münster Eyffel.</span> <span id="s104">Münster is sort of like an abbey, and then Eyffel is the mountain, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: And it was up in the mountains and it was a resort town for pulmonary problem people.</span> <span id="s107">And it was, I don’t know, a thousand years old, and things [indecipherable] have pictures about all this, which words don’t describe everything properly, a picture is worth a thousand words --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: -- we -- we all know that, you know.</span> <span id="s110">So -- and so we went a few times here.</span> <span id="s111">We were much closer to my mother’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Mm-hm, family.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: -- family, obviously, it’s always the way, you know.</span> <span id="s114">Children are closer to their mother than they are to the father, it’s -- it’s normal, the father is on the road, he’s working, and then of course, his family, his father was sort of like I don’t know what, religious in the synagogue, something or something.</span> <span id="s115">And my sister married a Christian man, wonderful fellow who had a furniture factory up in that particular place, refinishing antiques and all that, it was marvelous.</span> <span id="s116">He had two children, a daughter and a son.</span> <span id="s117">The reason I say daughter first is because she was the oldest, the son was second.</span> <span id="s118">And well, when we went -- went visiting once in awhile, he took us out early in the morning in the woods so we could see the deers.</span> <span id="s119">You know, and it was bu -- beautiful scenery, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: And who is this, one of your mother’s sister, who married this guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Beg pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Who -- who are you talking about now?</span> <span id="s123">The --</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: My -- my fa -- my father’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Your father’s sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s128">And what was your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Martha Koppel, K-o-p-p-e-l.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: So did she -- did you have maids in the house, did she take care of you?</span> <span id="s131">You did have maids.</span> <span id="s132">So you -- was --</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Well -- well -- ha -- ha -- haf -- th-things were going quite well, we had a sleep-in maid, so when my parents wanted to go out, the maid stayed with us --</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: -- you know, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Was your mother a cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Y-Yes, yes, as a matter of fact, when they left Germany and went to France, and after than when they came to the United States, she was a -- I wouldn’t call it co -- you know, there’s cooks -- cooks, and then there is chefs.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: No, she was a gourmet chef.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Oh, the same way -- we are not talking about oh -- I wouldn’t insult my wife by calling her a cook, she was a chef, because what she could do without fat, cooking and baking, was mind boggling.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Or let’s say minimum of fat.</span> <span id="s144">My mother loved -- she made the most marvelous cakes and whatnot, but if a quarter pound of butter is good, half a pound of butter is better.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: And six eggs -- six eggs would just barely cut it.</span> <span id="s147">So obviously it had to be perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Taste-wise.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Do you -- do you remember her food as a -- as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: So she cooked a lot when you were a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes, yes, no, she -- she cooked.</span> <span id="s154">I mean, even when we had maids, I -- I di -- I was small when we had maids, you know, and I don’t remember at that time what she was doing.</span> <span id="s155">But later on, I mean, in -- in Germany, I remember later on when she was cooking, when we didn't have a maid any more.</span> <span id="s156">And then in France, of course, and then of course when they came to the United States, mind boggl -- it’s li -- France was very bad because starting in 1940 when the Germans overran France, until the end of the war, they plundered France with efficiency unparalleled in the history.</span> <span id="s157">There wasn’t a thing to be had for the French [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s158">And then the French -- I came here in ’48, in ’48 I still haven’t seen white bread in France.</span> <span id="s159">And it was still rationed, there was nothing to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: And I -- I wasn’t exactly a heavyweight when I came over --</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: -- you know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Tell me about your youngest brother, Harry.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Harry?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: What was it like for you when he was born?</span> <span id="s167">Was this a great thing for you, or wou -- did you feel invaded?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: I -- I loved my brother because he was my brother.</span> <span id="s169">On the other hand, he was not as affectionate as I was.</span> <span id="s170">I’m a loving, touchy, feely type guy.</span> <span id="s171">He’s not, you know?</span> <span id="s172">So everybody is different, you know?</span> <span id="s173">And he is more of a scientif -- scientist, you know?</span> <span id="s174">When he came over here, he went to college.</span> <span id="s175">He’s a little younger, a year and a half, and he became a physicist, and with a lot of degrees and things like that.</span> <span id="s176">And he thinks like a physicist.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: What was he like when he was a kid, when -- when -- when you were growing up together?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Before -- before France now, before --</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Oh yeah, yeah, I remember that.</span> <span id="s181">He used to be, shall we say, a shade abrasive, and he wasn’t all that tall, so I used to have to fight his fights for him.</span> <span id="s182">I didn't want anybody beating up my little brother, hm?</span> <span id="s183">Not that he remembers that, but I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Was he more like your mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: -- or your father?</span> <span id="s187">Was he more like your father, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Not even.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Not even that.</span> <span id="s190">So he --</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Not even.</span> <span id="s192">He was -- he was his own person.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: You know.</span> <span id="s195">My mother was very loving, my father, in his own way was very loving, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: And warm.</span> <span id="s198">Of course I can’t say anything that my brother isn’t that way, but he doesn’t sh -- show it --</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: -- you know, physically.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: So everybody’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s206">Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s208">I went to school because I had to.</span> <span id="s209">I mean, it’s as simple as all that.</span> <span id="s210">In Germany you do what you’re told.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: End of discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: But -- but di -- did you happen to like it?</span> <span id="s214">Or you don’t even remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Oh, I went to school because that’s something you had to do.</span> <span id="s216">I have no likes for it.</span> <span id="s217">As a matter of fact, when I was nine years old, my father send me to the local gymnasium, and you know, they have uniforms there, the caps, the whole mcgilly, you know, everything.</span> <span id="s218">And what was our language?</span> <span id="s219">I’m nine years old, remember that.</span> <span id="s220">Latin.</span> <span id="s221">Well no, try as I might, there was no way wa -- that I was going to go cut -- cut it in Latin.</span> <span id="s222">So after six months my father took me out, put me in another one where the language was French like I mentioned before, so that was piece of cake.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s224">You were supposed to speak Latin?</span> <span id="s225">Or just read it?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: No, the whole thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: You -- you’re supposed to speak --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: -- the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Not just reading, understanding, spelling and talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: And did Harry go to that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: He didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Harry was a year and a half younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: So henceforth, by that time -- you see, Hitler came into power and we went -- we had to leave -- you see, in Germany when I went to -- what do you call that, grammar school I would say?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Well, they didn’t make a-any differentiation.</span> <span id="s239">There wasn’t that much antici -- anti-Semitism in Germany in spite of what people will say.</span> <span id="s240">We went to school, school had catechism, so I sat in with the Christian children and I got catechism.</span> <span id="s241">No big deal.</span> <span id="s242">I got my Jewish education after school, you know?</span> <span id="s243">Several days a week we went and we had Jewish education in a different place.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Were your parents religious in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Well yes, I mean, for the holidays yes, but when I went to my grandfather, very religious, Friday night synagogue, Saturday morning synagogue, Saturday afternoon or evening synagogue, right?</span> <span id="s246">Of course holidays obviously.</span> <span id="s247">And I got so good in Hebrew that at the ripe old age of -- by 11 I left Germany, so I had to be 10, and I was living with them because I couldn’t -- we weren’t allowed in a Christian school any more, so we went to the Jewish school that the rabbi was running in my grandfather’s town.</span> <span id="s248">I could conduct the service at 10 years old.</span> <span id="s249">There was some kids my age that were actually better than me yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: They rattled it off like machine gun.</span> <span id="s252">But the world has a way of changing, and we change with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: So you went to a Jewish school when you were 10, in 1932, not 1933?</span> <span id="s254">And that was because you had to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Jew -- Jewish children were not allowed to go to a regular school with Christian children.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: In 1932?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: ’32.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: I mean, I don’t know whatever the date is, April of ’33 Hitler came to power, whatnot.</span> <span id="s260">Yeah, but that was just on paper.</span> <span id="s261">He owned the place from 1930 or ’31 on.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: His goons were running everything.</span> <span id="s264">And believe me, the terror that they initiated in the population -- we’re talking Jews, you -- you have to live through it to understand the total feeling of terror, with the brownshirts, which was called the SA, sturm abteilung.</span> <span id="s265">Forget the SS, the SS is something totally different.</span> <span id="s266">And they were marching, had parades every Sunday, flags.</span> <span id="s267">Of course, you locked up your place and what not, and hoped that nothing bad would happen.</span> <span id="s268">But it was frightening, I’m telling you.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So you were very frightened as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Well, as a child you take everything in stride.</span> <span id="s271">The one thing that the Germans were fabulous on, they created those what you would call Hitler type songs with the very marshall type music, and that appeals to the masses.</span> <span id="s272">You -- you have [indecipherable] every country has their own type of marshall music.</span> <span id="s273">The Germans are the best.</span> <span id="s274">The French are not bad.</span> <span id="s275">The United States is so-so, because we’re not really all that marshall.</span> <span id="s276">You know, we have a few songs.</span> <span id="s277">The Marines, you know.</span> <span id="s278">A-And -- and -- and [indecipherable] the Navy, Air Force, but it’s not really -- but the Germans, I mean, they have th -- a song for every occasion, or a march.</span> <span id="s279">And I’m telling you, there was one song I remember, and it’s [speaks German here].</span> <span id="s280">Translation - when blood -- when the Jewish blood spurts from the knife, then things will be twice as good.</span> <span id="s281">So that’s was a -- wa -- one of the lyrics in the songs.</span> <span id="s282">I don’t know where people know these things.</span> <span id="s283">These are minor details.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Do you remember hearing that song as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s286">How -- why -- why would I remember it to this day?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: And who -- who sang it -- when -- do you remember when you heard it?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: The -- the SA troops marching in the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: And they sang?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: And on the radio, and wherever you went that -- and they had more, you know, that’s just one, that’s the most bloody of them.</span> <span id="s291">Hate the Juden [speaks German].</span> <span id="s292">I mean, hang the Jews, kill the bosses, or something like that, I mean like that’s the most marvelous songs.</span> <span id="s293">I mean horrible, horrifying.</span> <span id="s294">If you were a Jew, and you understood this, the terror was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s295">And it didn’t matter, because he appealed -- first of all, the mistake was made in the tret -- Treaty of Versailles, where they made Germany pay unbelievable reparations that they couldn’t handle, and Germany was really in a bad way.</span> <span id="s296">So, lot of people out of work and things like that, people wound up in prison, Hitler saw his chance.</span> <span id="s297">He took the worst elements out of prison, the people out of work, hung a beautiful uniform on them, nice jack boots, nice cap.</span> <span id="s298">[indecipherable] and everything, had them marching.</span> <span id="s299">Tried to get them job, oh, whatever you take away from the Jews, you know, all right?</span> <span id="s300">So, th-th-these weren’t the nicest people in the world that were enrolled in those troops, I can’t call them strup -- storm troops, even though it says sturm abteilung, right?</span> <span id="s301">Sturm means storm, you know, but that’s not the -- the SS is like I said, something totally apart.</span> <span id="s302">But they weren’t nice people.</span> <span id="s303">The head man was Mr. Worm, and he was also a very disreputable character, you know, out of prison, and all kinds of quirks shall we say.</span> <span id="s304">So, it was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Did it surprise you that there was so much anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s306">You say you didn’t grow up with a lot of anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: No.</span> <span id="s308">Was --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: It didn’t sur -- it didn’t surprise you?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: You see my father, the last free election, he volunteered for the election board.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: You know, because there was other people running than Hitler.</span> <span id="s313">And already at that time it was a losing proposition because Hitler promised all kinds of things to the masses, which he actually implemented eventually, which the other people didn’t have the nerve to come up with things like that.</span> <span id="s314">So, you know, that’s why I say, hit -- Hitler ran the show way before he was elected.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: But let me ask you something, Kurt, you’re a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: You’re 10 years old in 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: So there’s a lot you don’t know, or necessarily understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: What’s -- what’s happening between you and your friends?</span> <span id="s322">Do your Christian friends stop being friends with you?</span> <span id="s323">Do you live in a neighborhood where it’s mixed?</span> <span id="s324">What’s -- what goes on with you as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Well, when I went to my -- wh-when I couldn’t go to Christian school any more, regular school, and my next door neighbor, I used to be friends with the boy, he was a little bit older than me.</span> <span id="s326">I don’t know whether he stopped being friends with me, I’m -- I really don’t know for sure.</span> <span id="s327">But then I associated with all the children that went to the Jewish school that were in my grade, boys and girls, and things like that.</span> <span id="s328">So I did not associate with Christian children any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: So no one said something to you?</span> <span id="s330">No -- no -- somebody was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: No remarks were made, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s335">Now, when was the decision made, and were you involved in a discussion about -- you were leaving to go to France?</span> <span id="s336">You were just told you were going to go?</span> <span id="s337">Did you not want to do it, or did you think that this was exciting?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Remember, in Germany you do what you’re told, okay?</span> <span id="s339">As much as you’re being loved, you feel that that is the right thing, if your parents -- if your parents, your father, your mother tell you, look, you’re going to France to Uncle Pierre and Aunt Emma, you know, because things here -- well, I realized how f -- how bad things were.</span> <span id="s340">So my father was smart enough, the oldest son, he got se -- out of Germany first.</span> <span id="s341">It was on my 11th birthday, basically.</span> <span id="s342">And I got on the railroad, on -- my aunt must have picked me up in Paris and we lived in Rennes at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: So this is August of 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Yeah, August 17th, 1933, I left Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: So that --</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Was a week after my 11th birthday.</span> <span id="s347">And then I went to live with my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s348">My -- my uncle was a French career officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: He was a doctor, right?</span> <span id="s351">And he met my Aunt Emma during the occupation of first -- of the first World War.</span> <span id="s352">After the first World War, he was sent -- French troops were occupying the Rhineland with the British.</span> <span id="s353">And he met my aunt in Germany, in her hometown, and they hit it off somehow.</span> <span id="s354">And then of course, an officer is called to duty wherever it’s called, so then he went to the Middle East, and he went to the bak -- Balkans, and things like that.</span> <span id="s355">So they got married in 1930 in our -- in our apartment in Cologne, they have a very large house.</span> <span id="s356">I mean house, a very large apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Actually, we had -- which was totally unheard of at the time, we had a bathroom like in the United States where the bath and the toilet and the sinks, everything is in one, and then we had a separate toilet.</span> <span id="s359">And we had two entrances, one for the servers and one for the regular people.</span> <span id="s360">So it was quite large, and I remember the wedding quite well.</span> <span id="s361">And they got married by us, you know, was [indecipherable] his family couldn’t be there, was in Germany, his fra -- fa -- parents, his brother lived in France.</span> <span id="s362">So anyway, so they got married there, this I remember, henceforth -- and then she left with him to live wherever he was stationed, which was Rennes.</span> <span id="s363">And that’s where I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Okay, we have to stop the tape and change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Kurt, so you knew your aunt and uncle when you -- before you went to see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Were they older than your mother and father, much older, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: My aunt was two to four years older than my mother.</span> <span id="s371">I think two years, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: But na -- so there wasn’t a big difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s374">She -- there -- she -- she looked pretty much -- they looked pretty much alike, my aunt -- the one that I went to, and my mother.</span> <span id="s375">And -- and my uncle was born in ’89, so by that time it -- no -- yeah, ’89 -- ’89, it was ’33, so what was he?</span> <span id="s376">11 and 33 is 44 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Right, so he was a bit older.</span> <span id="s378">They didn’t have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: No, obviously that --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: -- helped a lot.</span> <span id="s382">And he was like a second father to me, he was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: He just -- they took me to their heart.</span> <span id="s385">Now, my aunt of course, that’s family.</span> <span id="s386">But he a stranger.</span> <span id="s387">That’s very -- the most wonderful man I ever met.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: So he touched you a lot.</span> <span id="s389">He [indecipherable] you.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Oh [indecipherable] fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Fantastic, I mean, you know.</span> <span id="s393">And I lived with them for five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s395">That’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Passed by very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s398">But it was good for you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Oh, fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: And you went to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yeah, there I went through what they call in France this -- are we taping?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: In France they call it lycée, in Germany it’s gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s406">So they put me in this sixth degree.</span> <span id="s407">You come s -- like I say again, you start like in grammar school, and you wind up, you know, with your baccalaureate.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: So they put me back one year due to the language, but within three months I rattled off French, with the proper accent and things like that.</span> <span id="s410">Well, I was only 11, so you catch on real quick.</span> <span id="s411">And as a matter of fact, even if I didn’t understand everything, I remember one day -- the education is a little different in France than it is here.</span> <span id="s412">It’s mainly the arts and history and such, not how to make a dollar.</span> <span id="s413">Over here it’s much more sensible.</span> <span id="s414">They teach you economics and things like that.</span> <span id="s415">In France, no.</span> <span id="s416">Ancient history and things like that.</span> <span id="s417">Some poetry.</span> <span id="s418">So I remember Aesop’s Fables, they were all translated into French in a big book by Mr. LaFountaine and they were pretty strict in school, so we have to learn a fable per session, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s419">So I rehearse with my uncle.</span> <span id="s420">So I rattled off that whole fable, perfect intonation, stop, go, whatever.</span> <span id="s421">My en -- my uncle looked at me and he said, do you know what you say?</span> <span id="s422">I says no.</span> <span id="s423">It was so perfect, but I didn't know what I -- what I really was saying, you know?</span> <span id="s424">The thi -- that’s when you’re a child, you mimic anything, and I did fantastic.</span> <span id="s425">Of course, later on I have to [indecipherable] same thing with mathematics.</span> <span id="s426">They used to throw numbers at you, multipliclati -- multiplication, addition, substraction, a teacher went like this, like that, picked you and you better be on the ball.</span> <span id="s427">There was no missing.</span> <span id="s428">That’s how come you didn’t need a calculator at the time.</span> <span id="s429">You know what I’m saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: You really knew how to calculate in your head.</span> <span id="s432">That -- these are the things that were important there.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Now your parents and brother came to Paris in 1934, a year after you?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: After me.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: But it took that long for my father to get all the permits, and to -- he was still able at the time to take all the furniture and everything that they had out of Germany, plus his money.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Still he could take his money?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s439">I don’t know how he did that, that was a serious piece of change.</span> <span id="s440">And then he went to Paris, but of course, the French had accepted a lot of German Jewish refugees, also Polish for that matter.</span> <span id="s441">And -- but the only thing, there were restrictions.</span> <span id="s442">You could not start a job in a factory or anything like that.</span> <span id="s443">You had to start a business as it would be.</span> <span id="s444">So my father opened up a meat cutting -- meat packing business, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: That’s very different from what he was doing in Germany, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s447">The thing was, some of my mother’s relative’s children, they were butchers.</span> <span id="s448">So he had two or three of them that did the work.</span> <span id="s449">My father was a businessman, he knew how to run a business, and he’s the one with the money, so he bought or rented the building, he bought the trucks, he bought the machinery and he did the advertising.</span> <span id="s450">So it was hard -- you got to understand, France is a very culinary country.</span> <span id="s451">So to break in to the -- like what they call [indecipherable] which is the wurst, sausage business and ja -- ham and things like that, it’s not the easiest, so you have to really make a good product.</span> <span id="s452">But the Germans are fabulous when it comes to sausages and such.</span> <span id="s453">So the boys were good, they made inroads, slowly.</span> <span id="s454">The only thing wrong about the whole situation was there were young boys.</span> <span id="s455">In the early 30’s in France, ’34 - ’35 - ’36, everybody flocked to Paris.</span> <span id="s456">Americans, everybody, British, they loved it.</span> <span id="s457">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s458">So the boys discovered the races, they discovered the women, and they discovered gambling.</span> <span id="s459">Now, they were drawing a fairly decent salary, but that wasn’t enough for the lifestyle.</span> <span id="s460">So what they did, unbeknownst to my father, obviously, they looked at the delivery schedule for the -- today.</span> <span id="s461">So they filled the truck with all the stuff, and before the regular delivery boys could start, they went to the customers and sold the stuff at a little discount.</span> <span id="s462">So when the regular discount -- ah, the regular driver came along, sorry, you delivered this morning.</span> <span id="s463">So before my father found out, it was a little late.</span> <span id="s464">The business was shut there.</span> <span id="s465">So who was stuck with everything?</span> <span id="s466">My father had to pay off the machinery, had to pay off the trucks, have to pay off everything.</span> <span id="s467">So whatever money you have goes down the sewer.</span> <span id="s468">And the guys, couple of them, disappeared to the hospitality of countries such as Argentina.</span> <span id="s469">You know, a lot of these countries have been populated by people that weren't totally clean in their native country, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: But this -- these were relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Not these boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Only one of them was sort of like a relative.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: And he had nerve, what they call in Jewish chutzpah, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s476">He had his -- he had the nerve to come and had his clothes in my parent’s apartment and he used to come and visit occasionally, and my father wanted to kill him.</span> <span id="s477">And he would have been able to do it, physically.</span> <span id="s478">So my mother says, no [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s479">So that’s how come he survived.</span> <span id="s480">Now I jump a little bit forward.</span> <span id="s481">The war is over, the guy is alive, he went back to Paris -- he was hiding in the south of France, he was -- went back to Paris, opened up the same business, and he had the nerve to use my father’s trade name for his own business.</span> <span id="s482">But being that nobody was cheating him, he went to be very, very successful.</span> <span id="s483">I met him after the war, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s485">Did you -- when your -- your s -- you’re still living with your aunt and uncle for --</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: -- for five years.</span> <span id="s488">You don’t go back to your parents until 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Ah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: But you s -- but you see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: -- we visited, she -- my mother came, and -- or I visited Paris, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: As a matter of fact, I remember I was a young kid, I was 11 - 12 years old, and my father -- I tell you, Paris was unbelievable, he used to take me to nightclubs where the White Russians, who fled the revolutions were dancing, the Cossacks and things like that, and the -- in France, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s494">Children 11 - 12 years old, it’s not a problem.</span> <span id="s495">So I went to all these places, you know?</span> <span id="s496">That’s when my father still was in business, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: And then after the thing went, shall we say south, I have to use euphemisms, he had a magnificent apartment in Paris.</span> <span id="s499">I think it was -- I -- I don’t remember the exact name, it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s500">Fantastic, maybe seven rooms and things.</span> <span id="s501">Concierge, elevators, the whole bit.</span> <span id="s502">Couldn’t carry that one any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: So we had to entrench somewhat.</span> <span id="s505">Not that it was bad, we still had a concierge, and instead of seven rooms, we had now five rooms of -- you know, and things like that.</span> <span id="s506">So it wasn’t really all that bad, but then my father had to back to it -- to this -- his original business in Paris, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: But he still made enough money so that you didn’t have to live in a terrible circumstance, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Oh, no [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s509">Things were pretty decent.</span> <span id="s510">My father worked very hard, and my mother took a little job.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: You know, as a nanny to chi -- to -- to a child, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Very nice people.</span> <span id="s515">Jewish, of course.</span> <span id="s516">And so they made ends meet.</span> <span id="s517">And ma -- my mother, food-wise, was easy to get along with.</span> <span id="s518">If you give her a pound of chocolate today, that’s all she needed.</span> <span id="s519">Skinny like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s521">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: It’s genes.</span> <span id="s523">But sh-she knew si -- how to cook.</span> <span id="s524">I used to know how to cook, too.</span> <span id="s525">I remember when I went to Paris after, in 1937 to live with them, and my mother was working, my father was home, or came home.</span> <span id="s526">My brother was there.</span> <span id="s527">I used to make French fries.</span> <span id="s528">In French they have these special things, you know, like a container with a screen and the oil --</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: -- and it bub -- and you know exactly when to throw the French fries -- the potatoes in, when they pop up to the surface, I remember, I -- I wasn’t -- I wasn’t exactly a -- you know [indecipherable] as it would be, so I --</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: -- you know.</span> <span id="s533">So I -- and later on, as a matter of fact, I was but -- I went to school in Paris, and I used to iron.</span> <span id="s534">I was the -- I must have been a big 15 at the time, I used to iron my -- when my father came home, you know, we had this -- these two big suitcases where all the samples were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: And I used to refresh the -- like I say, the jabot, the lace creations, and I used to iron them.</span> <span id="s537">15 years old.</span> <span id="s538">Think about that.</span> <span id="s539">Amaze.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: That’s pretty complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: So that’s -- I’m telling you, I -- I was quite talented.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s543">When you moved back -- when -- when you moved back to your parent’s place --</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: -- rather than visiting, did your brother stay there, or did he go now to the aunt and uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: N-No, he -- he switched over, he went --</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: He switched over.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: -- he went with my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s549">Well, it’s good for them to have a child, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Child, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Of course you --</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Was it easier for your parents also not to have two of you at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Yeah, yeah, well listen, he wasn’t making the money he was used to.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: You know, and my mother had to, you know, have a little job, so it was easier for them.</span> <span id="s556">Of course I think they -- they sent some money, minimal amounts, even while I was there, to my aunt and uncle --</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: -- you know, so that it wasn’t total charity case, you know what I’m saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Do you have any idea how much your parents missed having the two of you in the house?</span> <span id="s560">Cause it’s very different to have one child, rather than the two together.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: No, no, no, it’s totally different, it’s totally different.</span> <span id="s562">I mean, my parents went through so much that they were very staunch and strong people of character.</span> <span id="s563">What is needed, has to be done.</span> <span id="s564">It’s no beating your breast and -- and -- and -- and -- and running to the shrink or anything like that, uh-uh.</span> <span id="s565">They were far stronger than that, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: What -- you’re now a-at an age, by 1935, you’re not a child any more.</span> <span id="s567">You’re now --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: -- 13 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Do you get Bar Mitzvahed, by the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: In France?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Oh that -- that -- that’s the most amazing thing.</span> <span id="s575">I got Bar Mitvahs -- Bar Mitzvahed in Germany, my father’s hometown, with the rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: How [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: We went back -- we went back to Germany, 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Honest.</span> <span id="s580">We managed.</span> <span id="s581">Just things are -- you -- you were still abe -- my aunt, my youngest aunt was still living in Germany.</span> <span id="s582">So was my oldest aunt, okay?</span> <span id="s583">And my grandfather still had his house.</span> <span id="s584">My aunt sort of like hat -- she had haberdashery, beautiful, you know my -- see, when -- it was customary when your daughters get married, to give them a dowry.</span> <span id="s585">Now, three of them were married.</span> <span id="s586">My youngest one -- aunt, was not.</span> <span id="s587">So instead of a dowry, he bought her a haberdashery.</span> <span id="s588">Really fine stuff.</span> <span id="s589">Really.</span> <span id="s590">And it was in the house, the bottom.</span> <span id="s591">Two show windows, central entrance, you know, the whole bit.</span> <span id="s592">She had decorators come and do the windows and whatnot.</span> <span id="s593">And I remember playing in there when I was a kid, I used to love it, you know, I -- on the holidays, you know, Christian holidays, people used to shop for shirts, hats, [indecipherable], ties.</span> <span id="s594">I used to lo -- pla -- love to play with the ties.</span> <span id="s595">I used to know how to present a tie, you know, with the knot and things like that.</span> <span id="s596">I was a kid, and the people loved to see me around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: So that part was okay.</span> <span id="s599">And so I went back, and of course I had to learn my Bar Mitzvah reading.</span> <span id="s600">I had at least a whole month to learn everything, not a year or two.</span> <span id="s601">And I went to the rabbi every day in the afternoon, when he had time.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: So you were in Germany for a month in 1935, or did you do this in --</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s604">No, no, no, that was in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: We went to Germany a month before so that I could get the teaching to read the Torah.</span> <span id="s607">Which I had only one month, I mean, I tell you, I don’t know, I’m not stupid now, but I was pretty bright as a young man, or child, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Now your mother stayed in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: She came too?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: My mother went with me, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s613">So what was that like to be in Germany three years after hit -- or two years after Hitler takes over.</span> <span id="s614">Is it -- was it terrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: I don’t remember, I didn’t -- I didn’t hang out too much.</span> <span id="s616">I went from my grandfather’s place to the rabbi’s place and back.</span> <span id="s617">And the synagogue was still standing and there was the Jewish school where we eventually went because there was a Jewish center, a magnificent gothic cathedral, I mean like -- a -- a synagogue, excuse me.</span> <span id="s618">I mean, whoa, fantastic.</span> <span id="s619">Of course it was Conservative with the mab -- women upstairs and the men downstairs, a separation, you know, with the pulpit, this, that, what, the Torah, it was magnificent.</span> <span id="s620">Oak -- oak things there for everybody who -- who bought a -- a seat there, you know, like put your stuff in, your tallis, your -- your -- your tefillis, you know, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s621">And the [indecipherable] it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s622">And then there was the Jewish center next door, and the bottom floor was the Jewish school where the rabbi taught the various grades of Jewish children, from the community, you know?</span> <span id="s623">I mean, it wasn’t a hundred children, you know what I’m saying, but they were -- ranged in age, let’s say, from -- from I -- argument-wise, from let’s say seven to 14 -15 maybe?</span> <span id="s624">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s626">You said earlier that your father had to give up his business in Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: -- because Jews had to not have businesses.</span> <span id="s629">But you go back in 1935 and your aunt has a haberdashery and she’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s630">So how is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: I -- this I can’t figure.</span> <span id="s632">I don’t know whether she’s -- I think she was still in business.</span> <span id="s633">It was different.</span> <span id="s634">My father had a different kind of business, I think.</span> <span id="s635">And they had signs -- I don’t even think that they had signs on the stores that said Juden, meaning Jews.</span> <span id="s636">You know, you were s -- not supposed to buy there.</span> <span id="s637">Of course, the business must have fallen off drastically.</span> <span id="s638">But there were some people that weren't so diehard, you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s639">In a small town everybody knows each other.</span> <span id="s640">It’s different than in the big city.</span> <span id="s641">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: So henceforth -- the house was still -- my grandfather was still in the house.</span> <span id="s644">My grandmother had died in 19 -- no, I don’t know when she died.</span> <span id="s645">I want to say in -- I wa -- I think I was in Paris when my grandmother died.</span> <span id="s646">And then my grandfather died later, around ’39, and my aunt stayed with him, the single one, because she couldn’t abandon him, it -- she felt obligated.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: And then she managed, at the last minute, to get shipped to England.</span> <span id="s649">Of course, whatever she had, went.</span> <span id="s650">I mean, she couldn't take a nickel along.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: But she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: The store, the house, they took everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s654">But she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: But sh-she managed to go -- to get to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: From there, eventually she -- during the war actually, she transferred from England to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Now, are you hearing about things that are going on in Germany?</span> <span id="s659">I mean, you’re there for a month, and you say pretty much you don’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s660">When you go back to France, are -- are you reading the papers as a 13 - 14 year old kid, or you’re not?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yeah, sort of.</span> <span id="s662">You -- a-and then you hear on the radio, when we -- the one thing I remember was [indecipherable] Olympics, you know, with Jesse Owens.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: In ’36?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: ’36.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: And Hitler occupying the Rhineland.</span> <span id="s667">And we thought for sure they gonna cut him off at the pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Who was going to cut him off?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: The French, they had the --</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: -- they had the biggest army in the world.</span> <span id="s672">Two million people [indecipherable] arms.</span> <span id="s673">All they had to do is move.</span> <span id="s674">They moved out of the Rhineland, they weren't supposed to occupy the Rhineland, Hitler moved into the Rhine -- this I remember, and my uncle, who was a military man, couldn’t understand that the politicians screw everything up, you know.</span> <span id="s675">Why they didn’t move?</span> <span id="s676">Go figure.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: So what did -- what did you all -- what were people talking about?</span> <span id="s678">Were you talking with adults or were you talking with kids about what -- what’s Germany going to do?</span> <span id="s679">Once they go into the Rhineland, do you now think they’re going to go someplace else, you think they’re going to stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: No.</span> <span id="s681">No, no, no, no, that -- it was a shock, as it would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: -- already.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: So you know, you get shocked often enough, it doesn’t shock you any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s687">So does going into Austria shock you?</span> <span id="s688">The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: No, no, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: -- that was anschluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: They’re German speaking people and they did [indecipherable] Austria and then a little bit tricky was Czechoslovak -- I think, was Czechoslovakia in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: It’s before.</span> <span id="s695">It’s before the anschluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: And that was a bad one.</span> <span id="s699">And so by that time, he was getting stronger and stronger and stronger.</span> <span id="s700">He had Austria on his side, he owned all of Germany, now he had Czechoslovakia, hey, hey, hey, hey, we’re becoming a big power.</span> <span id="s701">And everybody loves it, nobody does anything to him.</span> <span id="s702">So Hitler gotta be the right man, right?</span> <span id="s703">If you’re German.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Were you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: You weren’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Because you didn’t think he was going to come west?</span> <span id="s709">You didn’t think --</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Not with a two million dollar army.</span> <span id="s711">The -- the -- there was a big fallacy.</span> <span id="s712">Again, the Maginot Line was the most beautiful military construction ever conceived.</span> <span id="s713">Everything was underground, whole towns and whatnot, with elevators, [indecipherable] blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s714">What was wrong with the Maginot Line?</span> <span id="s715">It was supposed to go from the Swiss border to the ocean.</span> <span id="s716">So when they hit Belgium, the Belgian got bent out of shape.</span> <span id="s717">How can you do this to us?</span> <span id="s718">I mean, I don’t invent this, this is fact.</span> <span id="s719">How can you do this to us?</span> <span id="s720">We fought for you in World War І, and we will fight for you if World War ІІ should happen.</span> <span id="s721">Belgium is gonna be -- is gonna be a big problem for the Panzer divisions?</span> <span id="s722">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s723">So the Germans left the -- the Maginot Line where it was, and came right through Germany like an open gate.</span> <span id="s724">You see?</span> <span id="s725">So what do you do?</span> <span id="s726">And th -- from that moment on things got real bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Where y -- Harry stays with your aunt and uncle until when?</span> <span id="s728">He -- you come in 1938 to your parents -- or ’37?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: No, no, to my parents [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: You come to ’37.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: 1937, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Right, and he goes to your aunt and uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s735">Now, does he return in ’38 - ’39, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: He does.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Before the Germans take over France?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Yeah, yeah, ’39 the Germans -- you see, from the declaration of war o -- by France and England was on September -- the ultimatum was acember -- December the third.</span> <span id="s741">That’s ’39, that’s when the war was supposed to start in earnest, but nobody was shooting at anybody.</span> <span id="s742">The French mal -- French mobilized, the Germans obviously were mobilized, and they called it the funny war because nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s743">The Germans were behind the Siegfried Line, the French behind the Maginot Line.</span> <span id="s744">They figure ah, you know.</span> <span id="s745">Figure that goes on forever now.</span> <span id="s746">The British sent over Hindu troops to France.</span> <span id="s747">I remember, I was there.</span> <span id="s748">You know the ones with the turban?</span> <span id="s749">The Sikhs, you know and all that?</span> <span id="s750">And the French had the colonial troops and whatnot, and -- but didn’t cut the mustard.</span> <span id="s751">Once the Germans started rolling, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: What did you think in 1939 when they attacked Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: I didn't think</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: You didn’t think.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: I mean, I remember exactly when they walked into Poland.</span> <span id="s756">Across the street from where we were living, which was very large central area where all the avenues converged towards this area, and there was a beautiful park up there, and my boss and I, we were, you know, we went through the park, you know, we sat around and you know, and a guy comes by after lunch, and he’s all bent out of shape, and I said to him -- so he said, the Germans just invaded Poland.</span> <span id="s757">Then we ran home, we knew that -- that wasn’t good, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: And that’s when we hung up -- hu-hung on to the radio to hear the ultimatum, you know, in later afternoon that either you get out of Poland, or we going to start fighting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s761">We have to s -- change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s765">All right, so now you hear that the Germans have attacked Poland.</span> <span id="s766">Is this the start of World War ІІ in your brain?</span> <span id="s767">This is it.</span> <span id="s768">Do you begin to hear about ghettos being formed in ger -- in Poland?</span> <span id="s769">Nothing?</span> <span id="s770">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: The following morning at five o’clock, my father put my brother and me on the train to Brittany, out of Paris because everybody thought the Germans were going to bomb Paris, which they never did, obviously.</span> <span id="s772">And what was in Brittany, my aunt, while my uncle, being a soldier, was on the front.</span> <span id="s773">She was alone, so she took a vacation in Brittany on the coast, and rented a -- the bottom floor of a house.</span> <span id="s774">So my father called her, she was, send them over, so we went there, and stayed in Brittany for a f-few months, you know?</span> <span id="s775">It was still -- the weather was still nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: And your mother and father remain in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: And when do you meet up again?</span> <span id="s779">After the Germans come in and occupy France?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s781">I -- the first time I saw my parents was on April 12th, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: 1941?</span> <span id="s783">That means after you have been in at least one camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Oh yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Or two --</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: -- ha -- ha -- at least three camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: -- si -- at -- at least three camps.</span> <span id="s788">So from Brittany, after that, and your brother doesn’t see parents either?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: My brother went back to live with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: But he was younger than me, see, it’s a matter of age, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: All right, so in ’39, you’re sent -- both of you were sent to Brittany.</span> <span id="s793">Within a few months he goes back to Paris and you stay in Brittany?</span> <span id="s794">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: I went to Le Mans.</span> <span id="s798">My aunt --</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Another aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: No, the same aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: That had rented the house in Brittany.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Rented now a house in Le Mans.</span> <span id="s805">You know Le Mans?</span> <span id="s806">Car races 24 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Also beautiful town.</span> <span id="s809">There’s so many nice towns in France, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s810">Anyway, and -- so for a little while, I used to hang around as the word goes, I didn’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: So eventually they had to put me back into school, around -- before Christmas, ’39.</span> <span id="s813">My uncle, of course, was on the front and I was keeping my aunt company.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Now this is the original aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Yeah, from -- from -- from France.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: From -- from [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Yeah, so that we --</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: You [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: -- don’t change aunts --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Okay, this is the same person?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: -- this -- this -- always the same aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s823">And you’re now 15 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: You’re 16 --</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: -- I’m 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: -- 17.</span> <span id="s828">Okay, so you’re an old guy already.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Yeah, okay, so you’re 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: So you’re with Emma?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Now, being that I went to school in Le Mans previous, before I went to Paris, right?</span> <span id="s836">From ’35 when we left Rennes, we went to Le Mans until ’37 --</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: -- when my uncle got transferred from Le Mans to Veldun.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Okay, so now you’re back.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Then -- now I’m back and I had two real good friends who we went to school together, we were inseparable, right?</span> <span id="s841">So I used to meet them every evening, you know.</span> <span id="s842">One of them worked for a newspaper.</span> <span id="s843">The other one decided to become a salesman in a very high fashion female or ladies’ shoe store.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: He was handsome, bi -- was tall, very handsome guy.</span> <span id="s846">He just was in the right business, if you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s847">And so we met every evening after they were finished working.</span> <span id="s848">We had a gay old time, I mean, the th -- the three of us together like nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: In spite of the fact that your country is occupied?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: No, it’s not occupied yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: No, this i -- this is ’39, this is not occupied yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Thirt -- no, no, si -- the Germans started running through the [indecipherable] countries in May 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: And they hit France big time in -- you know, I’m not dead on the dates, but I would say around June 20th or so, the French signed the armistice.</span> <span id="s855">By that time the Germans had rolled up whatever was left of the French army, horse and buggy types.</span> <span id="s856">You know what I’m saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: But before that, so you’re with your three friends having a -- a good old time?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: They -- they -- they nailed me when the Germans started invading [indecipherable] countries in 1940, in May -- May 20-something or other.</span> <span id="s859">Towards the end of May, I think.</span> <span id="s860">And they rounded up everybody of German origin.</span> <span id="s861">Now, I was a German origin.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Jewish didn’t come into consideration.</span> <span id="s864">They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s865">You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s867">They didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: The French don’t make you wear a star.</span> <span id="s869">That’s Germans, you know.</span> <span id="s870">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Did anybody ask you if you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: It’s not on the record anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: No.</span> <span id="s876">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: You were ec -- you’re in France, you speak French like a Frenchman, you act like a Frenchman, you expected to be Catholic in a 99 percent Catholic country.</span> <span id="s878">Very simple.</span> <span id="s879">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s880">So, they rounded us up, together with what I would call the real Germans, Aryans that were caught.</span> <span id="s881">It’s called the fifth column.</span> <span id="s882">You heard about the fifth column in the Spanish civil war, where they put civilians to infiltrate a place, and then they take over the place.</span> <span id="s883">You know, so they had the same thing in France and the French actually did make German prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: And they happened to be -- we happened to be concentrated, or quartered in a military base in Le Mans.</span> <span id="s886">So we -- there we are, the Germans in the German uniform.</span> <span id="s887">The German Nazi type civilians, plus a whole bunch of Jews, too.</span> <span id="s888">So we’re all together.</span> <span id="s889">I mean, the masses --</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: This is --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: -- soon found out we were Jewish, but the soldiers weren’t up -- you see, there’s a big difference between the Nazis and the German army.</span> <span id="s892">The German army isn’t as bad as the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: But how did they find out you’re Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Listen, nothing stays secret for long, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Yeah, but who is te -- do you know how they find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Who knows?</span> <span id="s897">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s898">I don’t even know.</span> <span id="s899">I -- I assume they found out we were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: So at first you’re taken because you’re from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: So -- so the German refugees into France --</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: -- get taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: My assumption is that most of these German refugees are Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: -- because why are they leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: So maybe that’s the assumption.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Who knows?</span> <span id="s914">It’s hard to tell.</span> <span id="s915">The German soldiers in German uniform, there were a lot of flyboys there, in German uniform, they were hanging out by themselves, with possibly the fifth column types, and the Jews were hanging out with themselves.</span> <span id="s916">They were all going to associate with shall we call it the enemy, right?</span> <span id="s917">So obviously there must have been a shift, or a sh-schism, whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s918">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: And where do they put you in Le Mans?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Well, I told you, we were s-stationed in a military base.</span> <span id="s921">The place was okay, we have beds and things like that, or cots.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: So it wasn’t like a prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: No, no, it’s -- it’s a military camp.</span> <span id="s924">And then what happened, across the street there was the British military camp, and you know, [indecipherable] had a lot of British soldiers in France, you know.</span> <span id="s925">And of course, we didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s926">So one night, they told us to get up, pack our things and marched us out.</span> <span id="s927">That’s how come we found out a little bit up the road was the British camp.</span> <span id="s928">But the British were -- might have been gone by that time.</span> <span id="s929">And they marched us, and we were basically running away from the oncoming German army, surrounded by French soldiers.</span> <span id="s930">You know, and there was a lot of people [indecipherable] like the Germans, and the German Jews, and everybody.</span> <span id="s931">It was a column of people walking.</span> <span id="s932">How many?</span> <span id="s933">Don’t ask me.</span> <span id="s934">Hundreds, maybe more, 200, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: But you’re surrounded by French?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Surrounded by French soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Cause it’s the French [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s938">Okay.</span> <span id="s939">Kurt, I’m sorry, there was a bit of a technical difficulty.</span> <span id="s940">So where we stopped was, you began to speak about, you were marched out of the camp and you were surrounded by French soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: French soldiers, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: And so, repeat what happens then.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Well, then we’re walking down one of the main roads, and we’re not alone, the French were running away, too, and the French army was running the same way with horse, carriages, and things like that, dragging maybe some cannons or something, I don’t know for sure.</span> <span id="s944">And all of a sudden, aft -- I -- I’m talking this been going on, it’s very hard walking, but few hours, you know, later, it’s now daytime, we started at night.</span> <span id="s945">All of a sudden we get a visit from German fighter planes that come over and they start strafing us, you know, with bullets and things like that.</span> <span id="s946">And well, we scattered sideways and whatnot, and then when they’re gone, we start all over again.</span> <span id="s947">Keep on marching, and then every once in a blue moon, we have a rest, you know, by the side of the road, you collapse on the grass over there for, you know.</span> <span id="s948">And didn’t have really much food, or anything.</span> <span id="s949">I had the -- I had two suitcases, my aunt took good care of me.</span> <span id="s950">Two large suitcases, one with food, one with clothing.</span> <span id="s951">Well, that lasted about a mile or two, because 30 - 40 pounds on each side, I -- I couldn’t walk like that for long.</span> <span id="s952">So I took a few things out of there, a couple of cans of food, took a pajama, turned it, tied a knot, inside out, put it over my shoulder.</span> <span id="s953">And I put that in front of a house we were passing by around midnight or two in the morning, I don’t know, that was -- that was the end of my possessions.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: There are a lot of people leaving the north, right?</span> <span id="s955">Lot of people from --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Ev-Every -- everybody was running away because they knew the Germans were coming and they were getting away from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Now, the most amazing thing of it all, it was like the stranger than fiction.</span> <span id="s959">All of a sudden I hear my name being called, and I turned around.</span> <span id="s960">And who the heck is on the main drag, we were on the side?</span> <span id="s961">My aunt, my brother, my friend and his parents, they were all leaving at the same time.</span> <span id="s962">I meet them in the middle of nowhere, 12 hours after we left the camp.</span> <span id="s963">Do you believe that?</span> <span id="s964">Of course, I didn’t have much of a chance to say hello and hug them --</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: -- whatnot because the Germans, the French soldier says, that-a-way fellow, none of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: You know, they were afraid I was going to get lost in the masses.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: So, but that’s the most amazing thing that -- think about it, the odds.</span> <span id="s971">There’s hundreds of thousands of people and all of a sudden I’m at the same heights as my -- my aunt, my brother and my friends from the --</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: -- they were -- they were leaving together, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: So they were also going?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Yeah, they were going south, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Were they -- were they walking, or they had a car?</span> <span id="s977">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s978">A: Tell you the truth, I really don’t know what.</span> <span id="s979">I don’t think they have a car.</span> <span id="s980">Well, they -- they must have had something, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Because they mo-moving faster than we were, so they must have had something, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: You took out a couple of cans of food, you must have been still very hungry, cause you were marching for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Oh, but -- we marched for -- for several days.</span> <span id="s985">We marched approximately, I would say, a good -- I -- I mean 20 miles a day, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: 20 miles a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Yeah, at least.</span> <span id="s988">So we walked for three days, must have been about 60 miles.</span> <span id="s989">Of course, at night we stayed someplace, you know, whatever horror place they could drum up.</span> <span id="s990">They couldn’t throw us in a prison, no prison was big enough, you know.</span> <span id="s991">So they put us in a schoolyard, or a restaurant, or you know, whatever was handy, could accommodate us cramped together.</span> <span id="s992">I remember the worst part was one day -- one night, found some what yo -- I would call a beds -- bedstand.</span> <span id="s993">The frame, and wires strung across, you know, like a -- this.</span> <span id="s994">And I laid on that.</span> <span id="s995">I mean, like wasn’t very comfortable, you know?</span> <span id="s996">Can you imagine how hard it is to lay?</span> <span id="s997">But you’re young.</span> <span id="s998">Well the next thing I know, I wake up.</span> <span id="s999">Somebody is urinating on my feet.</span> <span id="s1000">Wonderful, I’m telling you, the l-life was great.</span> <span id="s1001">There wasn’t -- he coul -- he couldn’t even get out because we were so jammed together, so he stood up and he urinate on my feet, hey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: And you thanked him, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Oh, I -- I gave a -- I -- I gave him a piece of my mind, but too late, I was wet.</span> <span id="s1004">Of course, urine isn’t the worst thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: What were your shoes like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: But did your feet hurt?</span> <span id="s1008">Do you remember that?</span> <span id="s1009">Walking that much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: My feet hurt, are you kidding?</span> <span id="s1011">The whole sole of my foot was a callus.</span> <span id="s1012">Then fortunately, after three days of walking, they found a truck and they put us on a truck.</span> <span id="s1013">A --</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Oh, that was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Oh, I tell you, and the countryside was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1016">That doesn’t change.</span> <span id="s1017">I remember once we were resting, and I was against the wall, like about at least that high there, you know, sitting, resting against the wall.</span> <span id="s1018">You know, I had a little lunch or something, a bite to eat, whatever.</span> <span id="s1019">And the Germans were shelling us.</span> <span id="s1020">And all of a sudden I hear this big explosion.</span> <span id="s1021">And man, I don’t know how I did it.</span> <span id="s1022">In one flash I was over the wall, on the other side of the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Well, this must have been a nine foot wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Must have been a eight or nine feet wall --</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: -- right?</span> <span id="s1028">And you went -- and you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: -- yeah, that’s what I’m saying.</span> <span id="s1030">I -- I jumped over that like it was -- it wasn’t even there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Scares s -- does a wonderful thing for you.</span> <span id="s1033">And of course I was young, and I had -- I hadn’t suffered yet, you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: And so -- it gave me a good scare though, but th-that told me that things weren’t exactly going well.</span> <span id="s1036">So anyway, then, eventually we got the truck and the truck brought us to a railroad station, and then we got put into cattle cars, you know?</span> <span id="s1037">Eight horses, 40 men, that’s what’s marked on the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s1038">[speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s1039">That’s what they did in World War І.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Forty men or eight horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Or eight horses, right.</span> <span id="s1042">And that’s where they put us in these cattle cars, and of course we had a French -- two -- two French soldiers per car to guard us, you know.</span> <span id="s1043">And being that things weren’t going exactly a hundred percent, it was stop and go and stop and go.</span> <span id="s1044">So we went from -- well, what would I call it?</span> <span id="s1045">Brittany, sort of like France, Normandy, all the way down to southern France in -- in the train, and then they turned around and shunted the car, and the next thing we knew, we’re in central France in the plateau region.</span> <span id="s1046">You know, there’s the mountainous region like 3,000 feet up.</span> <span id="s1047">And that’s -- we have to walk some more from the main town which was called Marvejols, to a little place in the mountains, which was a sh-sheep ranch.</span> <span id="s1048">It was called Malavillers.</span> <span id="s1049">And that’s where we stopped, and that’s where we were going to stay.</span> <span id="s1050">And we had the greatest accommodation in the world.</span> <span id="s1051">We were staying in a sheep barn, and we were sleeping on a small layer of straw over the sheep dung.</span> <span id="s1052">It was just wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Over dung?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Over the sheep dung.</span> <span id="s1055">They didn’t take the sh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Oh, sheep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: -- the sh -- the dung out, they left it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: They just put some straw over it, so that’s where we stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Wonderful accommodations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Did it stink?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Ah, who knows?</span> <span id="s1064">Who knows?</span> <span id="s1065">I can’t remember that any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Now this is -- this is the French, this is not the Germans still?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: No, that’s the fr --</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: That’s still the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: -- that’s still the French, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1070">And we got f-fed very well.</span> <span id="s1071">We had quite a bit of freedom.</span> <span id="s1072">We were in the mountains, how far can you run?</span> <span id="s1073">You see, even if you were -- if you were of a mind to run away, it was -- it wasn’t going to work.</span> <span id="s1074">Here’s why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Still, it’s interesting, isn’t it, that you have the kind of freedom that i-it -- you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Yeah, w-w-way up in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1077">And once in a blue moon on a Sunday, we went down to the nearest village, see what you could get, little something or something.</span> <span id="s1078">Human contact, you know, French people.</span> <span id="s1079">Strangest village I ever saw.</span> <span id="s1080">All the houses were built without windows.</span> <span id="s1081">You never saw a soul.</span> <span id="s1082">A dog occasionally, and a nice little brook run -- river, small brook, whatever, run alongside, really picturesque.</span> <span id="s1083">And the houses -- w-we went inside a few times because made friends with the locals.</span> <span id="s1084">And they were heated like -- there’s places like that I think in England, too, there’s hot springs that run underneath the houses.</span> <span id="s1085">It’s the most amazing thing what you can learn.</span> <span id="s1086">I mean, not because you’re looking for it, because the circumstances bring it out.</span> <span id="s1087">And the people were quite ugly.</span> <span id="s1088">Must have been a lot of intermingling, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Is that why be -- because of the hot springs, is that why they didn’t have windows?</span> <span id="s1090">You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: I didn’t delve into this too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: You know, but the -- did -- nobody did nothing to us, so then we saw so -- went to some farms, the people were quite nice.</span> <span id="s1094">Well, you see, we all spoke perfect French, no accent, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1095">So obviously, some stranger comes, speaks in French, ah -- ah, the people up there in the mountain, you know.</span> <span id="s1096">You know, we didn't look like dangerous criminals, so wha -- what?</span> <span id="s1097">They treated us pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: So then you went back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Of course we went back.</span> <span id="s1100">See, we’re -- ex -- e -- allow me, where were you going to go without papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1103">As a young man, you were supposed to be in the French army of sorts, or y -- if you were German, you were supposed to be in the German army.</span> <span id="s1104">You had no business ha-hanging around at a young age gallivanting in the country, you see?</span> <span id="s1105">That’s -- that’s why.</span> <span id="s1106">And the French would nail everybody because you need papers.</span> <span id="s1107">I have the papers yet.</span> <span id="s1108">I mean, it’s like an accordion, those papers, it’s not like a nice little card like this, you know?</span> <span id="s1109">I mean, even in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: So how --</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: So they had everything nailed down to a science, there was no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: How long were you in Malavive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: Malavillers --</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Malavillers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: -- I would say, okay, the war was over, it was June, right?</span> <span id="s1116">July, August, yeah, maybe two months.</span> <span id="s1117">Oh, by the way, at very -- at the very beginning, being that the German Germans, you know, soldiers and whatnot were with us --</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: -- the German armistice commission, meaning colonels, majors, generals, SS, government people, came to check out who was in the camp.</span> <span id="s1120">So immediately the Germans, like have a dogtag, whatever it is, they were put aside and sent back to the Fatherlands to fight another day or whatever, you know?</span> <span id="s1121">And then all of a sudden we weren’t German any more, now we were Jews.</span> <span id="s1122">Now we were officially Jews.</span> <span id="s1123">You gotta understand that.</span> <span id="s1124">We were not with Germans any more, German nationals that fought for the Germans, we were Germans of German origin.</span> <span id="s1125">So now that they took the Christian people away, all of a sudden I wasn’t German any more, now I was a Jew, officially.</span> <span id="s1126">So that the Germans made the French nail the Jews.</span> <span id="s1127">That’s how come we never got out from under.</span> <span id="s1128">See, the French nailed us because we were of German origin.</span> <span id="s1129">And they were eventually gonna screen us, and then they was -- was gonna let us go.</span> <span id="s1130">Never got to this, the Germans got there first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: But there is an anti-Jewish law in Vichy, and you’re in Vichy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: No, that came later.</span> <span id="s1133">That was all the way at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1134">They’re talking 1940, they -- -- they -- they barely have time to get themselves organized.</span> <span id="s1135">You know, the Germans took over the e -- the end of June, a-and this was right then and there, so what, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: So are you now under German rule?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: No --yeah -- well, we are now under French rule, doing what the Germans tell them to do, keep the Jews, you know, locked up.</span> <span id="s1138">So, after a little while, for some reason, they send us to a different camp.</span> <span id="s1139">You know, again train, but this time we -- we picked up people from all over.</span> <span id="s1140">We were hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s1141">And they’re winding up in the south of France, the eastern coast by the Mediterranean and we’re walking from the railroad station through the town -- I don’t know how far it was.</span> <span id="s1142">And then we wind up on a camp that is built on the boards on the sand of the beach.</span> <span id="s1143">Was a very large, long beach.</span> <span id="s1144">And there were dozen upon dozens of barracks.</span> <span id="s1145">And things were pretty primitive at the time.</span> <span id="s1146">There was no running water, no drinking water.</span> <span id="s1147">They hadn’t set up the food situation yet, and that wasn’t very nice.</span> <span id="s1148">That’s the only time that I really fell apart, I collapsed.</span> <span id="s1149">I went -- couldn’t move any more, so I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1150">And when I woke up, I was alright again, you know, and I dealt with the situation, because I couldn’t -- I couldn’t handle it any more.</span> <span id="s1151">That was too much.</span> <span id="s1152">I went catatonic.</span> <span id="s1153">S --</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Did anyone do anything to you when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Oh, the other people have their own tsoris, you know.</span> <span id="s1156">Enough problems of their own.</span> <span id="s1157">So, then later on we get assigned to barracks.</span> <span id="s1158">Now that was the final insult.</span> <span id="s1159">The barracks are just built on the beach sand.</span> <span id="s1160">Which, that in itself, sleeping on the beach is not the worst thing in the world.</span> <span id="s1161">What made it so bad is that just before us, they had stationed a regiment of Senegalese soldiers, which is the black African contingent of the French army, in those barracks.</span> <span id="s1162">Now they were not too keen on what you would call hygiene.</span> <span id="s1163">They used --</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: No, it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: -- they used every area where you would sleep as a toilet.</span> <span id="s1166">And you found bowel movements.</span> <span id="s1167">And that’s where they made you sleep.</span> <span id="s1168">That really cuts it.</span> <span id="s1169">Of course, on top of that, being to -- due to that situation, there were -- I -- of course, I have to say millions of fleas there, because I myself got bitten up so badly, it’s frightening.</span> <span id="s1170">From the upper thighs to the groin, my stomach, up to the hips, thousands of bites.</span> <span id="s1171">I mean you can’t just believe this, it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1172">The most beautiful setting in the world, which was hell.</span> <span id="s1173">Dante’s Inferno doesn’t even come close.</span> <span id="s1174">And then, to make matters worse -- eventually we got food there, the French brought you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: I’m going to -- I’m going to ha -- I’m going to have to stop you, I’m sorry, we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1180">Where are you?</span> <span id="s1181">What camp is this, on the beach?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: This is called San Cyprian, which is right next to the town of Erne, on the Mediterranean, close to the Spanish border.</span> <span id="s1183">And the reason that the camp was there was that the French had to accommodate all the Spaniards that ran away from Franco when the war was over, the Spanish Civil war was over in 1939, so the French, they came over by the hundreds of thousands, so they have to put them up someplace, so that they had to build barracks in a hurry.</span> <span id="s1184">Now when I say barracks, which goes for any time that I mention a barrack, this is something like a wa -- one inch thick, you know, which is like three-quarters thick woods, and one layer, and covered with black tar paper, which is wonderful in the summertime, because the black reverberates the sun, and takes it in.</span> <span id="s1185">So if it’s 80 degrees inside, it’s a hundred deg -- o-outside, it’s a hundred degrees inside, it’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s1186">In the winter it doesn’t do anything for you, it doesn’t protect you from anything.</span> <span id="s1187">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: So the situation there was pretty awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Y-Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1190">We still, even there, we still had quite a bit of freedom.</span> <span id="s1191">If you asked for a pass, they gave you a pass to go to the near town, you know, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1192">But the unfortunate thing is that being we were in such unsanitary condition, there was a epidemic of typhoid, diphtheria, and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: And we fortunately -- this was at the beginning, the French still had stuff, we got vaccinated for these miseries.</span> <span id="s1195">They da -- it took care of three shots, you know, we -- a week apart.</span> <span id="s1196">The trouble was that they were administered by German trained doctors and I don’t know what possessed the Germans, they put the vaccination in your pectoral, whether you’re male or female, okay?</span> <span id="s1197">Not nice.</span> <span id="s1198">Hurts a lot.</span> <span id="s1199">So the first one, I took it.</span> <span id="s1200">At that time I might also say that the needles were approximately a good five to 10 times larger than what they are now.</span> <span id="s1201">And of course, there was no such thing as AIDS, so everybody got stuck with the same needle.</span> <span id="s1202">So anyway, the first shot in, fine.</span> <span id="s1203">A week later, second shot in.</span> <span id="s1204">It hurts.</span> <span id="s1205">And the third time, they -- the doctor was like this and I go like that, I jerk back.</span> <span id="s1206">So the needle being half in, it zigzagged a lot.</span> <span id="s1207">The doctor didn’t bat an eyelash, pulls the needle out.</span> <span id="s1208">Straightens it out with his hand and then he sticks me again.</span> <span id="s1209">End of discussion.</span> <span id="s1210">Of course, I didn’t get any of the sicknesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Is -- i-is -- does it surprise you now that you would vaccinate you?</span> <span id="s1212">I mean, why are they doing that if they’re what -- if they’re supposedly not caring about who you are, or what you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Well, the French are very nice people.</span> <span id="s1214">They are ha -- they are not at all like the Germans, they’re not out to kill you.</span> <span id="s1215">They’re forced into a situation that was abhorrent to them.</span> <span id="s1216">You see that -- that’s what people don’t understand.</span> <span id="s1217">They didn’t like to do that.</span> <span id="s1218">There was anti-Semitism in France, too, mind you, 99 percent Catholic country, you know, that you gotta understand that the -- the Jews did all ba -- kinds of bad thing to Christ, which wasn’t true, but that’s the preaching as it went, you know?</span> <span id="s1219">One of the popes in ’96 says, hey, forget about that, but at that time it was still running.</span> <span id="s1220">But the French really are not vicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: But what did you know la -- in this camp, if you didn’t know?</span> <span id="s1222">Anything about the Vichy government versus the occupied [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1223">You didn’t know anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: We were -- we were -- we were -- we were so worried about ourselves that, you know, and trying to -- to make a life for ourselves -- I mean some guys even went swimming in the ocean.</span> <span id="s1225">I mean, you could swim in the ocean over there, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Did you have to work at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: No, nothing, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: As a matter of fact, come to think of that, I was friends with two -- I -- what I would call -- what I called at that time, elderly gentleman, around 50.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Now when you’re 17, 50 is like getting there, right?</span> <span id="s1232">So they decided, let’s see if we can’t get a little bit better treatment, let’s volunteer to work in the office --</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: -- French office, you know, do clerical work.</span> <span id="s1235">There -- that was their profession.</span> <span id="s1236">So he says, why don’t you come with us, oh lo -- they liked me.</span> <span id="s1237">Don’t want to go into the reason why.</span> <span id="s1238">But anyway -- so I tried it for a little bit, but I felt so lousy and it’s so hot, and the offices weren’t air conditioned any better than anything else.</span> <span id="s1239">I says, so what am I doing here?</span> <span id="s1240">I’m getting treated the same, I eat the same stuff.</span> <span id="s1241">Why?</span> <span id="s1242">So I stopped doing that, too, you know?</span> <span id="s1243">But da -- that’s the only kind that -- that was voluntary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Now, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: I seen people die there, I remember one young, strapping fellow about 17, six foot, 180 pounds, got dysentery over there, right?</span> <span id="s1246">He was dead in a week.</span> <span id="s1247">That goes to show you what kind of fantastic genes I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Did you think about escaping, since there was so much freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Like I said to you, nobody escapes from anyplace.</span> <span id="s1250">What do you do without papers?</span> <span id="s1251">And there’s police, civil servants, all over the place.</span> <span id="s1252">You see, the French, if they didn’t want to go and being drafted into Germany, they had to go into some sort of French service.</span> <span id="s1253">Army, police, or some like that.</span> <span id="s1254">So they had them all over the place.</span> <span id="s1255">There was nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s1256">It never even occurred to me because I had enough brains to realize a-and where you going?</span> <span id="s1257">I tried the escape business once with my brother in 1942, February 40 -- oh no, wait, you’re not there yet, okay, so I won’t -- we’ll keep that for later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: How long are you in San Cyprian, how are you -- long are you at the beach?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: About two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Two months again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: About two months in s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Give or take, towards winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: -- right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Then they decided, oh this is not good for you, the winter.</span> <span id="s1266">We got to bring you to a better place, more suited for the winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Okay, so back in the train and we wind up on the other side of France.</span> <span id="s1269">Now we’re on the Atlantic side, but still by the Pyrenees.</span> <span id="s1270">The [indecipherable] was called Gurs.</span> <span id="s1271">So we wind up there and they got the same kind of barracks, with barbed wire around it.</span> <span id="s1272">Sections, they called them, elou.</span> <span id="s1273">Each section was called an elou, which was an island, all right?</span> <span id="s1274">So, had maybe 20 barracks per, and they had letters, A, B, C, D, you know, and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s1275">So I -- I believe my memory serves, I went in number H. Of course, the only trouble was that the barracks were of the same construction, even though we’re facing winter now.</span> <span id="s1276">Same thing, black tar, once inch ply -- one inch wood.</span> <span id="s1277">Now the only thing is, no Senegalese left their deposits there.</span> <span id="s1278">This was okay because who was there before us were the Spanish refugees.</span> <span id="s1279">And a few Spanish refugees were still left there to do maintenance work, the nicest young men you ever met in your life.</span> <span id="s1280">Friendly, gregarious, helpful, God knows what.</span> <span id="s1281">Now this time we were together with women.</span> <span id="s1282">Not together, but the camp held half women, half men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: That was not true in San Cyprian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: In San -- San Cyprian, I don’t -- I don’t remember seeing women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1287">So, we’re in this camp, and by that time it’s the winter of 1940 and the Germans were very busy already, plundering France for the homeland, you know, the Fatherland, you know, whatever you had there.</span> <span id="s1288">So by that time the food situation wasn’t that good.</span> <span id="s1289">Very, very minimal.</span> <span id="s1290">It consisted of cabbage at lunchtime, boiled cabbage at lunchtime and boiled cabbage for dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: This is in Gurs, in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: In Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Once in a -- in the morning you got a slice of bread.</span> <span id="s1295">Now, if you excuse the expression bread, flour as we know it was in the minority in the mixture.</span> <span id="s1296">Everything else was in there.</span> <span id="s1297">Ground acorns, whatever you could find.</span> <span id="s1298">And we got a slice a day.</span> <span id="s1299">Coffee, nonexistent.</span> <span id="s1300">Some sort of brew in the morning and that was it.</span> <span id="s1301">Boiled cabbage at lunch, not the most nourishing food, and at dinner the same time.</span> <span id="s1302">I think once a week we got about -- let me exaggerate, two ounces of meat.</span> <span id="s1303">I’m exaggerating now, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Did you have attacks of diarrhea from the cabbage?</span> <span id="s1305">No, you were okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: No.</span> <span id="s1307">No, no, I was okay.</span> <span id="s1308">I’m basically constipated, so you know.</span> <span id="s1309">All right?</span> <span id="s1310">Even as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: So that served you well then, in Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Whatever.</span> <span id="s1313">So, the problem is that the latrines -- we’re not talking bathrooms, we’re talking latrines, you know what latrines are, right?</span> <span id="s1314">Okay?</span> <span id="s1315">In bil --</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Why don’t you explain, what do they look like in -- in Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1318">They take those big oil drums, right, and over each oil drum they put -- they build a wood frame, all right, they throw a roof over it so that you’re not exposed to the rain from the top.</span> <span id="s1319">From the s -- the back is covered, the front is open, and there’s a walkway, and then you -- whatever one of the latrines, there might be 10 spots per, maybe more, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1320">I doubt -- I didn't make a business of committing that to memory, it wasn't that pleasant.</span> <span id="s1321">They weren't close by.</span> <span id="s1322">Why was that bad?</span> <span id="s1323">In San Cyprian they were God knows how far away on the -- on the border of the ocean.</span> <span id="s1324">Over here, it started to rain and the soil, which was clay, turned to mud.</span> <span id="s1325">Now we had to be very careful because you sank in up to here, because the mud has a tendency to suck your shoes right off your feet.</span> <span id="s1326">I got pictures to prove all that, too.</span> <span id="s1327">This is not something that I make up.</span> <span id="s1328">So it was quite unpleasant.</span> <span id="s1329">So sometimes -- they had made a little walkway, you know, threw some pieces of wood over there on some runners, you know?</span> <span id="s1330">So that was already pretty good, but that wasn’t all over, you know?</span> <span id="s1331">So anyway, the food was horrible, and they didn’t mistreat us.</span> <span id="s1332">We never had to wor -- look, we were so damn weak, my stomach growling all the time, I was hungry all the time.</span> <span id="s1333">Whenever I say hungry, I mean not hey, I would like to eat some, I mean hungry that you were starving, okay?</span> <span id="s1334">And the stomach is growling, there’s nothing in there.</span> <span id="s1335">So once in a blue moon we scrounged through garbage cans to see whether we could find a piece of beet, or something like that, you know?</span> <span id="s1336">Oh, it was very nice, very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Were there a lot of kids -- boys your age, or were they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Nah, nah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: -- were they mainly older?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: -- nah, I was one of the few.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: You were one of the few?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1343">Most of them -- most of them were grown -- grown men.</span> <span id="s1344">As a matter of fact, at one time, we got the survivor of the Saint Louis, I don’t know whether you know the Saint Louis was that ship that left Germany, where al -- everybody had cub -- Cuban visas and when they hit Cuba, Batista said, sorry fellows, I got your money, but I don’t want you.</span> <span id="s1345">So they shipped them over to the United States, and the United States said the same thing, so what was left over, they send them right back to Germany, and the Germans said, you see, I told you nobody wants the Jews.</span> <span id="s1346">So we happened to wind up with survivors from the Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s1347">Now these were all top of the line people.</span> <span id="s1348">I mean, we’re talking the intelligentsia, you know?</span> <span id="s1349">Lawyers, writers, movie producers, and whatnot.</span> <span id="s1350">And they showed the stress of the trip there.</span> <span id="s1351">I remember one movie producer, must have been in his heydays maybe 250 pounds.</span> <span id="s1352">Well, the reason I can say that is because first of all, those barracks didn’t have any yo -- windows.</span> <span id="s1353">A door at one each -- a door at each end.</span> <span id="s1354">And we had one bulb hanging from the ceiling in the middle, which went on for one hour at night, if it’s a lot, okay?</span> <span id="s1355">And so we -- at night we stripped to look for lice -- you know, lice?</span> <span id="s1356">And tried to kill whatever you could find in your clothing.</span> <span id="s1357">So I saw him stripped one day, and whatever his stomach was, was now a big flap hanging there.</span> <span id="s1358">So I know the situation well -- too good.</span> <span id="s1359">And then it gets to be winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Wait -- let -- let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1361">How many people from the Saint Louis do you think were in Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: All 900 of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: No, they went to different countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: So you’re not sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: They sent them back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: No, some of them went to England and some went to Holland and some went -- they went to different places, they didn’t all go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1368">They stopped off at different places.</span> <span id="s1369">So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Yeah, well, good for them because I only know about the ones that wound up in my barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: But do you know how many that you met, 10, 20, do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: In my barrack maybe -- I’m not just talking my barrack, my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: -- there were 20 barracks, I didn't know what was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: -- in the next barrack.</span> <span id="s1377">I would say about 20 of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: But you were assuming that all of the people from the Saint Louis were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: I assumed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: If -- if nobody wanted to accept them, well, they have to go -- the ship was a German ship, have to go back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: You know.</span> <span id="s1384">So anyway, they were very nice people, I -- I got friends later on with one of the younger lawyers, and that’s a different story, you have to wait for later.</span> <span id="s1385">But there were ---</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: What was it -- what were your relationships like with the other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Very nice, very good --</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: -- very friendly.</span> <span id="s1390">Cause they were old, young, didn’t matter, they were nice people.</span> <span id="s1391">Peop --</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Were people afraid of what was going to happen if the Germans took over this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: I don’t think so, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: You don’t think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: I’ll tell you why, here’s the story.</span> <span id="s1396">Gets to be winter, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Now, I discussed the construction of the barracks.</span> <span id="s1399">Every morning when you woke up -- there were stalactite hanging from the ceiling, I -- I mean a lot.</span> <span id="s1400">The condensation of the breath.</span> <span id="s1401">The breath goes up, form stalactites.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Right?</span> <span id="s1404">And then, after awhile, from southern Germany, the Germans had a shipment of people from part of German -- it’s about maybe 6,000 of them, they shipped them over to Gurs.</span> <span id="s1405">Women, children, babies, old people.</span> <span id="s1406">And I remember that because I was involved with them later on.</span> <span id="s1407">And you know, the wintertime, the icicles from the ceiling, every morning the door opened up and one of the French workers came and he yelled, any stiffs?</span> <span id="s1408">Meaning, anybody’s dead, frozen to death?</span> <span id="s1409">Well, fortunately my barracks, we weren’t that old.</span> <span id="s1410">But the people from Germany, you had the old people, and you saw -- well, maybe -- no, not necessarily, there were some people, older people, because I remember looking at the truck and all you saw sticking out f-from the truck were the feet with the socks -- with the socks on.</span> <span id="s1411">You didn't see the body, they were covered.</span> <span id="s1412">And we have the cemetery at the end of the camp, was -- the camp was maybe a mile long.</span> <span id="s1413">At the em -- end of the camp was a cemetery and they used to bury them there.</span> <span id="s1414">And it’s a situation -- I’m telling you, if -- if we have no -- no light at all in the barracks, nothing, one bulb hanging in the middle, maybe one hour at night, I’m telling you that’s all, and that’s where we quickly stripped, whether winter or summer, didn’t matter, and looked for the lice, and [sound effect]</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1416">Where did you eat?</span> <span id="s1417">In the barrack, or outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Well, they -- at lunchtime they rang the -- you know, the bell or something, and you went there with a whatever it was, and you got the ladle of soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Where -- where -- where would you go?</span> <span id="s1420">Was there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: To the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: There was a kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Yeah, with the big cauldrons, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: I once volunteered to work there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: [indecipherable] my reward was to get up at four in the morning, start the fire, and I could eat as much cabbage as I wanted.</span> <span id="s1428">And that didn’t cut it either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: So, everybody in the camp went to one kitchen, or was there a kitchen --</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: No, no, no, every --</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: -- every section has --</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: -- every section, every --</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Island?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: -- island had its own kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1437">So that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Did you work there?</span> <span id="s1439">Was there work indoors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Later on, later on.</span> <span id="s1441">I dis --</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: But not this first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: N-Not at -- not at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1444">It ca -- really start to get to me, freezing and whatnot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: So the same guys that I mentioned before, volunteered to work in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Is this Charles, one of the people?</span> <span id="s1448">Is that his name?</span> <span id="s1449">Or is that not his real name?</span> <span id="s1450">A: No, one of them was George.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: I can look it up to get the real name, and Abrams, I think his name was Mr. Abrams, they were bookkeepers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: I said ah [indecipherable] let’s go the office, at least it was heated.</span> <span id="s1455">They had the same barracks mind you, but they were much better with doors and things like that, and it was heated.</span> <span id="s1456">So that was great.</span> <span id="s1457">The food was the same.</span> <span id="s1458">We still had to go back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: -- and we had to go back to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: But during the day at least you got to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: So that’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: And you made friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: You know, the police inspectors that were there, they were very nice.</span> <span id="s1467">They were very nice.</span> <span id="s1468">Nobody mistreated you, I tell you.</span> <span id="s1469">So after a little while, there was one plum job to be had.</span> <span id="s1470">That was working for the director of the camp in the head barrack.</span> <span id="s1471">So the guy was one of the Spanish Civil War refugees, and he had the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1472">Very nice fellow, but he got a little greedy.</span> <span id="s1473">He got into problems, so they dumped him.</span> <span id="s1474">And I heard about that, I says, that’s my job.</span> <span id="s1475">So I went and [indecipherable] he didn’t speak French as perfectly as I did.</span> <span id="s1476">I went there, I impressed them no a -- no end, you know.</span> <span id="s1477">Was him and the -- his assistant.</span> <span id="s1478">I was hired on the spot.</span> <span id="s1479">So now I’m living in splendor.</span> <span id="s1480">There is -- you -- look at the barrack, the -- they have the same barrack.</span> <span id="s1481">The only difference is, picture a railroad car, and offices to either side with doors.</span> <span id="s1482">And he has the whole back end of the barrack, the director, right?</span> <span id="s1483">He lived on camp, as it would be, or on campus, what -- however you want to put it.</span> <span id="s1484">He had a beautiful house a little away from everything else, big villa, you know, with his wife, two kids.</span> <span id="s1485">And so we had also what you would call a reception room.</span> <span id="s1486">The reception room had a little window, people ask questions, then the door, and then part of the reception room was partitioned off about -- I’d say about three feet.</span> <span id="s1487">A wall, with a curtain.</span> <span id="s1488">There was a bed in there.</span> <span id="s1489">Luxury unlimited as far as I’m concerned.</span> <span id="s1490">I didn’t have a bed before.</span> <span id="s1491">Like a regular cot, you know?</span> <span id="s1492">And I -- whatever I had, th-th-the three pieces of clothing I could hang up, whatever.</span> <span id="s1493">Was three feet by maybe eight feet.</span> <span id="s1494">Luxury unlimited, and it was separated from the reception area.</span> <span id="s1495">And I dealt with the inspectors, I dealt with the radio operator, I dealt with the boss, I del -- I dealt with his assistant.</span> <span id="s1496">So they made me do jobs, you know, like little jobs and things like that.</span> <span id="s1497">But it paid off in the end, I tell you, big time.</span> <span id="s1498">So the most amazing thing is that -- of course there was no gasoline to be had in France, so the French invented cars that -- the regular cars were converted to run on charcoal gas.</span> <span id="s1499">They had those big cylinders mounted in the back of their car, and you threw charcoal in there and you lit it and that created gas and that went through a tubing to some sort of fuel indi -- gas injector.</span> <span id="s1500">And you weren't ri -- winning any races with it, but you could at least do 25 miles an hour with that, flat of course, you know.</span> <span id="s1501">So th-the -- th-the Germans were even smarter than that, they invent -- they were so -- so brilliant, they invented something, they had two cylinders on the trucks, one on this side, one on that side.</span> <span id="s1502">And then they had bags of chopped green wood, mind you.</span> <span id="s1503">You took a bag of green wood, threw it in that cylinder, that transform it into charcoal, send it over to that cylinder, and that’s how the trucks worked.</span> <span id="s1504">I mean, you -- you gotta give them credit.</span> <span id="s1505">You don’t have to like them, but you gotta give them credit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Did it go faster than 25 miles an hour?</span> <span id="s1507">The same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Like I said, you were -- y-you won’t win races, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: How long were you in Gurs at this time, the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1511">Tell you, I got out of there on April 12th, 1941.</span> <span id="s1512">I got there maybe October ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: So the first time was what, seven months?</span> <span id="s1515">No, six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Now does your father have something to do with your leaving somehow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1518">Now, my parents were in Paris, so when situation went bad, the Fr-French rounded them up too, in the [indecipherable], which was a big stadium in Paris.</span> <span id="s1519">The women were sent to one camp.</span> <span id="s1520">My mother happened to be, coincidently be sent to Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: But you didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: But you were there the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: And my father was sent to another camp, and I don’t remember exactly the name.</span> <span id="s1527">So, after they get screened, with references and things like that, they saw they were totally harmless, they let them go.</span> <span id="s1528">But, they were assigned residents, forced residents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: And the forced residents was in some minor, small village in southern France, you know?</span> <span id="s1531">So that’s where my mother and my f-father wound up.</span> <span id="s1532">And my mother heard on the rumor mill that I was coming from San Cyprian, so for weeks she didn’t eat her bread and was keeping it for me, so that I should have enough food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: She heard that you were coming to Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1535">The rumor mill is fabulous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: And she was saving the bread for me, you know, the rest, I mean the -- the cabbage she can’t save, you know?</span> <span id="s1538">My mother didn’t look too heavy, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: So, did you get this bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: So you didn’t -- you had no idea that she was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: I found out --</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Much later, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: -- once -- once I joined them in Castelno --</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Kurt, can you explain what forced residence is?</span> <span id="s1551">You said that your parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1553">Well, the same applied for me and my brother.</span> <span id="s1554">When you are released from the camp with all the proper papers and whatnot, you’re assigned to live in a certain area.</span> <span id="s1555">Now, first thing you do, you present yourself at the police station, and the police station ho -- tells you at the police, whoever it is, tells you how often they want to see you a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: You have to check in with them to make sure that you’re still there.</span> <span id="s1558">You see they usually -- villages don’t have a -- you know, even -- even in towns doesn’t matter, they cannot be with you 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s1559">They want to make sure that you don’t escape or run away, or do something that you’re not allowed to.</span> <span id="s1560">So anytime you want to go, or you have to go to let’s say the nearby town, you have to go up to police department and ask them for a pass.</span> <span id="s1561">So that’s what forced residence is, that you check in with them all the time.</span> <span id="s1562">Can’t move from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Now, was your father in Vernette?</span> <span id="s1564">Is that where he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Le Vernai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Vernai?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: I think that’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: So both he and your mother, who had been taken to two different places --</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: -- were -- were released?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: And they went to the small, little village called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: Castelnot Rivierbas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1575">Now, they were both sent there on purpose cause they knew they were husband and wife, or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Oh yeah, no, no.</span> <span id="s1577">Somehow my father, who is a very bright man, might have gotten in touch, through some organization or whatnot, to find out where my mother was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: And that’s how they got together and wound up in Castelnot at the same time.</span> <span id="s1580">I never questioned it because we had other worries at the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: -- you know, how.</span> <span id="s1583">I know where and when, but not exactly, you know, how they got together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Got together, right.</span> <span id="s1585">Now, how do you end up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Where?</span> <span id="s1587">In Castelnot?</span> <span id="s1588">Oh, when it came time for me to be released -- this was the strangest thing, my father, who is an alien resident -- alien resident, actually, whatever you call it, is now pretty much an unwanted person, right?</span> <span id="s1589">Went to see the mayor, the governor, whatnot.</span> <span id="s1590">Got an audience and pleaded my release with them.</span> <span id="s1591">And then they gave him a pass to come and see the commandant of the camp where I was, showed him the goods, and that’s how come I got released.</span> <span id="s1592">Can you imagine my father, who -- who -- who had -- who had no standing whatsoever, managed to do all that?</span> <span id="s1593">Of course, when they released me, we are to Castelnot Rivierbas.</span> <span id="s1594">Why?</span> <span id="s1595">My father, mother lived there, simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Now where is Harry at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Harry was already in ca -- in Castelnot Rivierbas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Had he been put into a camp also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: He was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: So it was only people over 17, or Germans over se -- was -- cause you -- you were the sort of the line --</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: I -- I just lucked out, what can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1605">So when you go back, when you go there, you’re with your father and your mother and your brother, and your aunt is where?</span> <span id="s1606">Where’s Emma?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: My aunt came to live, after a little while, came to live with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Because she couldn’t stay where she was, was the occupied zone, remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1611">So she couldn’t stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: When the Germans decided that they’re going -- I -- I mean, before they decided to take all over France, at -- at beginning she -- she got along pretty good with the Germans, because the Germans respect each others Army officers, things like that.</span> <span id="s1613">So being she was the wife was -- of an Army officer, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: And where was her husband, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Or -- your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: When the war was over, he was prisoner of war in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: So that’s where he was the whole time, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: No, not the whole time.</span> <span id="s1620">After -- after about a year or so they released him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: And he came to where you -- you were?</span> <span id="s1622">Do you -- or you don’t know, because by then you were gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: You know, this is a little hazy in my mind.</span> <span id="s1624">I remember my aunt living with us.</span> <span id="s1625">You gotta realize, my parents had rented a small, little house.</span> <span id="s1626">It had a kitchen, and two rooms.</span> <span id="s1627">A living room and a bedroom, so the living room was transformed into a three people bedroom, my -- my aunt, my brother and me -- when she came.</span> <span id="s1628">That was -- they were small rooms anyway.</span> <span id="s1629">And so eventually my uncle was released and then -- by that time they made him a general because the job asked for it.</span> <span id="s1630">The -- he was in charge of the medical military, I guess, otherwise too, I don’t know, of the hospital, or hospital with an s in Vichy, Vichy, France, you know, where the government was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: And he managed to -- to do in his position, to do a lot of good to save some French soldiers from, you know, unpleasantnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: So ho -- what do you do when you go to this little village?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: What do you do when you go to this little village?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Well, originally I couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s1639">So the only job open was as a farm hand.</span> <span id="s1640">So, I got a job as a farm hand.</span> <span id="s1641">But the funniest thing is, for the first -- it sounds strange -- 40 days, I couldn’t go to work.</span> <span id="s1642">Why?</span> <span id="s1643">The Bible repeated itself, we had 40 days of rain.</span> <span id="s1644">I’m not kidding you.</span> <span id="s1645">The only difference was, sometimes it rains heavy, and sometimes it rains slower.</span> <span id="s1646">Now, how come not everything was flooded?</span> <span id="s1647">Because -- I happen to appreciate the French, very brilliant, they had ditches alongside the road on either side.</span> <span id="s1648">That’s where the water went, and then the water went into the big river.</span> <span id="s1649">Of course, they also have a person with a scythe, you know what a scythe is, right, to move this.</span> <span id="s1650">This was a county job.</span> <span id="s1651">He was in charge of moving the grass from the -- from the ditches.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: So he took out the grass that -- that flowed in, so it wouldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: N-No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: It can’t overgrow.</span> <span id="s1656">They wanted to keep the ditches as drainage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: I see, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: In perfect condition, not to impede the water, with grasses growing all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: So for the first 40 days you can’t work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: Yeah, it’s so funny, 40 days of rain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Did you sleep a lot?</span> <span id="s1662">Were you exhausted from being in Gurs, or you were okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: I was mainly s -- mainly [indecipherable] what I did, I did a lot.</span> <span id="s1664">I don’t know where I got it from.</span> <span id="s1665">I mended my father’s jeans, he would be very fashionable now, had patches all over.</span> <span id="s1666">I made my mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Your father was wearing jeans then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: Oh, the jeans are invented in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: The Nimes.</span> <span id="s1671">Da Nimes.</span> <span id="s1672">Nimes being southern France.</span> <span id="s1673">That’s where the name comes from.</span> <span id="s1674">And these were working pants for -- for when you work.</span> <span id="s1675">You couldn’t wear a suit.</span> <span id="s1676">And all the way at the beginning too, I did something else.</span> <span id="s1677">I -- my father got into a deal with some of the farmers, to cut their hedges and some of the trees.</span> <span id="s1678">So my father was at the time [indecipherable] 57 years old.</span> <span id="s1679">And so we went there, and in exchange of what he did, he got half the wood that we cut down, because we had the wood stove, and that’s the only thing that worked, my mother cooked on the wood stove.</span> <span id="s1680">So we had heat in the winter.</span> <span id="s1681">I did that at the beginning, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: So let me ask you something, you’re now 20 years old, right?</span> <span id="s1683">19 -- you’re born in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: Not yet, not yet, I’m only 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: I thought we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: ‘22</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: -- we’re in 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: ’22 - ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: All right, we’re in ’41, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: I’m not going to be -- I’m not even going to be 21, because right now we’re in April 12th, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: We have to wait til August.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: You have to wait four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: Right, okay, forget [indecipherable] forget my question.</span> <span id="s1694">So how long do you do the farm work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: Well, farm work from let’s say, yeah it was the summer.</span> <span id="s1696">June ’41 til geez, when did they lock -- lock us up again?</span> <span id="s1697">August ’42.</span> <span id="s1698">Yeah, August ’42, when they round -- they -- they round -- the police rounded us up again, put us on truck and back to Gurs for deportation purposes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1700">Now, you have one or two relationships with young girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: You have some dates?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: You have some dates, or you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Oh, we -- well, I -- the one that I -- that’s a very strange story.</span> <span id="s1706">Like again, I said like truth is stranger than fiction.</span> <span id="s1707">Did you hear of Lourdes in your life, Lourdes, holy place, the Virgin, da da?</span> <span id="s1708">Anyway, the train from [indecipherable] Sainte Marie was close by Gurs to my parents, goes from -- to Pau and then Tarbes.</span> <span id="s1709">Tarbes is the big center, and the local train from my parent’s place, Castelnot and further up, comes there twice a day, once in the morning and once at night.</span> <span id="s1710">Remember, it’s war time.</span> <span id="s1711">So I’m sitting in this big -- you -- you know what the European rail station look like?</span> <span id="s1712">They’re like all glass, you know, tremendous ceilings and whatnot, you know?</span> <span id="s1713">And I’m sitting there, you have to wait for my train, I -- I got there li -- let’s say 10 - 11 in the morning, or 12, and my train is at four or five in the afternoon, right?</span> <span id="s1714">So I’m sitting on the bench, waiting, looking around, nothing is happening.</span> <span id="s1715">Tr-Train pulls in, and down yonder [indecipherable] I see two ladies.</span> <span id="s1716">I says, oh, it can’t be, it’s my mother and my aunt.</span> <span id="s1717">I says no, you’re hallucinating.</span> <span id="s1718">And as they come closer, lo and behold it’s my mother and my aunt.</span> <span id="s1719">Now my father knew I was going to get released that day, it was a Sunday, Easter Sunday.</span> <span id="s1720">My mother and aunt had left before the message got to them, and they decided [indecipherable] for my uncle, who was Christian decided, let’s go to Pau, couldn’t hurt.</span> <span id="s1721">Everybody else goes there for a miracle.</span> <span id="s1722">Ah, what else we got to do?</span> <span id="s1723">So they took the train to Pau, and then to Lourdes.</span> <span id="s1724">And they got off the train from Lourdes because they had to change it at Tarbes, same that I did, and man was that emotional.</span> <span id="s1725">Totally -- I’m -- I’m telling you, truth is stranger than fiction, there’s my mother and my aunt in the same station, the day I got released from the camp.</span> <span id="s1726">Okay, fine.</span> <span id="s1727">Now, how did I know -- get to know this little girl?</span> <span id="s1728">We’re waiting for the train, go into a compartment and then three people come in the compartment, a man around 50, woman around 28, and a real nice looking young lady around 17 - 18.</span> <span id="s1729">Looks interesting, okay.</span> <span id="s1730">The weirdest thing is they get up at the -- get off at the same station we did.</span> <span id="s1731">My mother happened to know them, which she told me later, blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s1732">They were Belgian.</span> <span id="s1733">The f -- the husband must have been very rich because he bought the local castle, chateau, okay?</span> <span id="s1734">And they also sold some dairy products.</span> <span id="s1735">So the following morning my mother says, look, why don’t you go up the road there and see -- try to get a few eggs, maybe something else, cottage cheese, whatever.</span> <span id="s1736">I don’t remember what.</span> <span id="s1737">So I go there, and there’s a big gate and two Dobermans, black things.</span> <span id="s1738">No -- was never too fond of dogs, ever since I was bitten at the ripe old age of 11 by a dog to whom I didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1739">So I was ah -- but fortunately they didn’t do anything to me.</span> <span id="s1740">So, you know, a castle, big driveway, you know, circular driveway.</span> <span id="s1741">So I walk on to the side entrance there, and that’s where they used to sell stuff from.</span> <span id="s1742">Th-Th-They were cultivating the farm, they were using the farm.</span> <span id="s1743">And who is there?</span> <span id="s1744">This magnificent creature.</span> <span id="s1745">So now, I never lose time beating a dead horse.</span> <span id="s1746">No, I knew this was going to work.</span> <span id="s1747">I ask her, would she like to have a date, you know, something like that.</span> <span id="s1748">So she says, I have to ask my -- whoever it was.</span> <span id="s1749">Couldn’t have been her mother.</span> <span id="s1750">At 28 you don’t have an 18 year old kid, I don’t care what age you start.</span> <span id="s1751">Relative, somebody, [indecipherable] brother-in-law, so [indecipherable] so the lady says, you sure don’t waste any time.</span> <span id="s1752">You know, says [indecipherable] so I picked her up on Sunday, and we hit it off pretty good, but it didn’t last too long because after awhile the man of the house, who was 50, realized hey, what’s this foreigner doing with my whoever it is, shall we say protégée?</span> <span id="s1753">Gets better.</span> <span id="s1754">And I couldn't see her any more.</span> <span id="s1755">So they locked the door, they locked the gates when I was supposed to pick her up.</span> <span id="s1756">And his foreman was a big dude about six three or four.</span> <span id="s1757">He says to me, you know, I like you, but if you know what’s good for you, desist.</span> <span id="s1758">Cease and desist.</span> <span id="s1759">So I can take a hint.</span> <span id="s1760">Funniest thing is one day while I was waiting for my -- let’s say girlfriend to get ready, the lady of the house says, gee, would you like to see the place?</span> <span id="s1761">Now you gotta understand one thing.</span> <span id="s1762">This is not the United States.</span> <span id="s1763">The United States I would have been shall we say a little more up to date and not as naïve as I was, okay?</span> <span id="s1764">I was -- you know, I was not necessarily shy, but -- I don’t like to discuss things like that, but anyway.</span> <span id="s1765">So she takes me up to her bed-bedroom.</span> <span id="s1766">Carpeting that high, white.</span> <span id="s1767">Now, what I didn’t realize at the time is I [indecipherable] the spot, her for the little girl.</span> <span id="s1768">She was going to get for -- go for me in a big way.</span> <span id="s1769">But I was too dumb and young.</span> <span id="s1770">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1771">The husband, big guy, look at the co -- position I’m in, I’m -- I’m -- I’m -- I’m like under the gun with the police.</span> <span id="s1772">All anybody has to say, I’m dead meat.</span> <span id="s1773">So she got very, shall we say depressed once they openly got together outside, the husband and the young lady.</span> <span id="s1774">You always saw them together in the carriage, you know.</span> <span id="s1775">You know, a s -- little horse carriage, you know, for two people.</span> <span id="s1776">And she, from what the rumor had it, she jumped out of the first floor balcony, you know, trying to kill herself.</span> <span id="s1777">Of course, she was -- she was going to make sure it wasn’t deathly.</span> <span id="s1778">So that was my story with that sweet thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: So it didn’t work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: First of all, I didn’t have -- had sex at my ripe old age because I spent most of my time in places like Gurs etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1783">And the war got in between a lot of things and the reason I didn’t have sex is because A, I didn't have sex.</span> <span id="s1784">So I said to myself, what if you don’t do it right, and the lady isn’t happy with your efforts?</span> <span id="s1785">You know, that was my thinking.</span> <span id="s1786">I was always thinking about somebody else, never about myself.</span> <span id="s1787">You know, most people think about themselves, hey, I want to get laid, amen.</span> <span id="s1788">Sorry about the language, but you know, that wasn’t me, I just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: -- I did -- I did that twice, like a schmuck, but later on I caught on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: So are you, before you are captured again and taken away --</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: I was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: -- you’re doing far -- you’re doing this farm work the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: Yeah, oh -- only 16 hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: That’s all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: They actually want -- wanted me on Sunday too, but I says, uh-uh.</span> <span id="s1797">I c -- I could barely move.</span> <span id="s1798">The first thing I did for six weeks, they gave me a hoe and I hoe the vineyard.</span> <span id="s1799">Now, you know, vineyard is not from here to the door.</span> <span id="s1800">How many rows there are in a vineyard?</span> <span id="s1801">I was -- my back bent to the sun, I had to take shirt off, didn’t have -- I didn't even have money for a hat, wa -- had no money.</span> <span id="s1802">You know what they paid me at -- let -- let’s not exaggerate.</span> <span id="s1803">I think they paid me at the current exchange rate, 25 cents a day.</span> <span id="s1804">1941, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: Even that wasn’t a lot of money, even in 1941.</span> <span id="s1807">The only thing is, they fed me.</span> <span id="s1808">What they feed me morning, noon and lunch was, considering my gall bladder, not the right thing.</span> <span id="s1809">Pure, white lard for breakfast.</span> <span id="s1810">You know what that does to your in-intest -- gall bladder and liver?</span> <span id="s1811">That was my breakfast, huh?</span> <span id="s1812">Not bacon, bacon has -- got half -- half meat in there.</span> <span id="s1813">Pure, white lard.</span> <span id="s1814">Well, they didn’t have that much to themselves because the Germans took all their cattle out, you know.</span> <span id="s1815">So the only thing that left was pork and geese, you know, the geese that you fatten?</span> <span id="s1816">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: What -- what do you hear now about what’s going on in the east, because now Germany has attacked Russia, and they’re starting to kill Jews, as well as some other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: Who does?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: In 1941, do you hear anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: No, not a word.</span> <span id="s1823">We knew through the grapevine that there were camps and things like that, but we don’t know exactly what.</span> <span id="s1824">There was Dachau what -- that was in Germany, Buchenwald is Germany, and there was a couple other ones right in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: No, I’m talking about -- I’m talking about Poland now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s1827">Well, Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: But you don’t hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: -- we didn't know from yet.</span> <span id="s1830">It’s when they started trying to de-deport us in Gurs.</span> <span id="s1831">That’s when we knew it -- Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: Which is later, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: Well, you see, we met with a lot of Jews from various areas --</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: Who told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: -- and they had good intelligence, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: So how do you get captured, why do you get captured in ’43, I believe?</span> <span id="s1837">You’ve been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: Now ’42 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: -- two --</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: -- I got released after months.</span> <span id="s1841">Being that I was -- I told you I worked for the chief of the camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: -- and all his police inspectors were my buddies.</span> <span id="s1844">So when we came there they were sitting at the table, and they, you know, took your name and everything like that, and my brother.</span> <span id="s1845">So obviously I never showed up on the deportation list.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: My pals, right, I’ll tell -- I’ve -- I’ll tell you, it paid off, that one time I worked.</span> <span id="s1848">And you know how good the French were, and how good the people were at that time over there?</span> <span id="s1849">They let us keep our pocket knives.</span> <span id="s1850">They weren’t afraid that they [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1851">Can you imagine you go to -- you put a prisoner in one of the prisons here, and you let him have a nice pocket knife?</span> <span id="s1852">That’s -- that wa -- just what they’re looking -- I’m telling you, was different times and different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1854">Were you afraid about being deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: Well, I wasn’t exactly thrilled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: All right, what did you think?</span> <span id="s1857">Did you know anything at that point in ’41?</span> <span id="s1858">Wa [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: Well ha -- I -- I knew I’m as good as dead if I get on the train, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: That’s what you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: Yeah, that much we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: But you didn’t know how or why or where.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: No, Auschwitz we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: No, forget why.</span> <span id="s1865">You knew Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: We knew Auschwitz, the train was for Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: What year do you think that is, ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: The first year was ’42 in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: And they needed 5,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: And the few Jews they had left, they -- they were so efficient, they collected them all, there were more than 5,000, because there were a few left over, including my brother and me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: So after that first month, you get released --</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: -- and then you’re -- they you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: Go back to Castelnot --</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: -- then you get -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: -- go back to work on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1880">And then the police come to try to get you again, and you and Harry try to escape.</span> <span id="s1881">And you make it until what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: Well, okay.</span> <span id="s1883">We were prepared this time, we said --</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: -- next time we jump out the window, the side window.</span> <span id="s1886">We had a little suitcase, you know, each and every one of us, put some food in there, whatnot, and we’ll try to make it to a different town and get on the railroad and try our luck going that-a-way, which is stupid, but when you’re young, you’re stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: Which was that-a-way?</span> <span id="s1888">Which way is -- which way were you going to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: Towards central France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: To central France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: Central central.</span> <span id="s1892">Not just east or west, but halfway between north and south and the massive centrale, we had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: But still in Vichy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: Yeah, right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: So we made it through a few fields, the farmers looked at us a little strange, and the next thing you know, who is waiting for us?</span> <span id="s1897">One of the local cops.</span> <span id="s1898">On bicycle, as we were crossing the road.</span> <span id="s1899">So he said to us, how can you do this to me?</span> <span id="s1900">I says, excuse me?</span> <span id="s1901">He was insulted that we run away because that puts a bad -- it puts him in a bad light.</span> <span id="s1902">And that’s when my parents left Castelnot because they knew.</span> <span id="s1903">They’re down on us now, you know?</span> <span id="s1904">Now, I had that one time, we had some friends by the name of Rothchild, which Rothchild also denotes serious deniros, you know?</span> <span id="s1905">And they had the son, one and only son.</span> <span id="s1906">They lived in the nearby village, also residents.</span> <span id="s1907">And the son tried to make it to Spain.</span> <span id="s1908">Well, he paid big money to some of the what do you call it, guides, and the guides --</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: No, wait, let’s stop for -- let’s stop for a minute.</span> <span id="s1910">Okay?</span> <span id="s1911">Sorry, he’s choking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: Okay, so they had a son, and he paid somebody big bucks to get him out of France over the mountains.</span> <span id="s1913">Well the guy took it from both sides.</span> <span id="s1914">Took his money, took the German’s money and that was the last time you heard from him.</span> <span id="s1915">So you know, money isn’t the answer to everything.</span> <span id="s1916">But, what they did for us, they managed to get authentic, blank false papers.</span> <span id="s1917">Okay, blank.</span> <span id="s1918">So like I said, I don’t know, I saw in retrospect, I’m amazed at myself how talented I was.</span> <span id="s1919">I managed to forge those papers so efficiently, I forged the mayor of the village’s handwriting that he could have sworn he signed it.</span> <span id="s1920">Couldn’t do it today any more.</span> <span id="s1921">So my parents had false paper making them French people, you know.</span> <span id="s1922">And the right age, right everything, you know they were, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Where did you get the false papers from?</span> <span id="s1924">From th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: From the Rothchilds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: From the Rothchilds, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: See, they had -- they had -- they had more money than God, so they could buy anything they wanted, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: And why were they willing to give you the false, blank --</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: We were friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: My parents and them were friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: My parents had a lot of friends, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: Okay, so y --</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: -- very likable people, my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: So you -- you got them these forged papers that you forged for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: Mm-hm, and that’s when they pssshhht.</span> <span id="s1938">After they nailed us the second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: They took you away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: In August ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: Now that time it didn’t go too good because I wasn’t released.</span> <span id="s1943">Oh, I was released.</span> <span id="s1944">I was released in the custody of the German slave labor.</span> <span id="s1945">Organizatione Tote, working on the Atlantic wall.</span> <span id="s1946">That was a lot of fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: And what camp are you in when you’re doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: La -- Labenne.</span> <span id="s1949">Labenne Oceane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Labenne?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: Yeah, from Gurs, we di -- we were -- got on a train, and da da da da da, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: Wait a minute, now.</span> <span id="s1953">We did -- we didn’t actually do this.</span> <span id="s1954">In ’43, after you’ve released for a month and you go back, they you’re captured again and you go to Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: And from Gurs --</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: In ’42 I was released, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: -- re-released again in ’43 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: ’43, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: -- then we run away, then they put us on the truck in front of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1965">And you go to Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: And then Gurs.</span> <span id="s1967">There’s a little side story, very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: All right, hold the side story for the next tape, cause there’s not a -- End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: All right, so you’re in Gurs, you’re taken on the truck to Gurs.</span> <span id="s1971">Harry is with you.</span> <span id="s1972">Am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: So you go to Gurs, and you’re there for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: Oh, as -- as long as it took to make a convoy, but they didn’t put me on the convoy again, because like I said, when you get checked in, my pals were the ones that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Got you out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1978">Or didn’t put me on the list.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: So at that point they were deporting Jews to Auschwitz as far as you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: No, that was the second time, in ’42 they deported them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1981">In ’43, they fi -- the Germans figured there must be enough Jews left to make another convoy.</span> <span id="s1982">So that was ’43 in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1984">But you don’t get put on that and Harry doesn’t get put on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: But you and Harry do not stay together at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: They separate you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1990">See, he was young yet, still younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: He’s still younger, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: But already of age of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: Yeah, he’s past 18 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: -- something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: -- right?</span> <span id="s1996">You’re 40 -- you’re 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: Yeah, yeah, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">Q: So he’s past 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">A: ’43, I’m -- yeah, I -- I’m 21 right then on my birthday, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: Right, August.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: So, what happened, after a little while they segregate us and they pick me and a few other guys, and they send them to the Germans on the Atlantic coast for slave labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Now, we went with a truck from Gurs to Labenne Oceane, which is the name of the site, and strange as it seems, we pass right in front of the Lourdes Cathedral, you know, where all the miracles happen?</span> <span id="s2004">And the truck stops dead.</span> <span id="s2005">So we all have to get off the truck and push it up the hill until it starts cranking again.</span> <span id="s2006">That was ver -- very strange things happen in life.</span> <span id="s2007">And if you -- you can add meaning to it if you want to, or just add it to coincidences.</span> <span id="s2008">So I -- personally I think it’s coincidence you know, but whatever.</span> <span id="s2009">So, but you can make things out of that, you know.</span> <span id="s2010">And then I wound up with the Germans, and the first thing I know -- they show us where we sleep, and then they march us out to the worksite.</span> <span id="s2011">Now, 5,000 people swarming around there, okay?</span> <span id="s2012">They weren't Jews.</span> <span id="s2013">We were the only Jews, eight of us.</span> <span id="s2014">At that time they didn’t know it, too -- n-no -- no -- they’ve ra -- okay, let’s put it that way, not everybody knew we were Jews, okay?</span> <span id="s2015">So, they put us to work right there.</span> <span id="s2016">I’m facing a mountain of gravel a little bit higher than the ceiling, you know, like this is 15 feet, let’s say 20 feet and a good 150 feet long.</span> <span id="s2017">And they give us shovels, and we have to shovel wa -- I don’t remember where, most likely in wheelbarrows.</span> <span id="s2018">And we have to shovel that throughout the night.</span> <span id="s2019">And I said to the foreman, in German -- German foreman, I says, look, I’m exhausted, can’t we get a little sleep?</span> <span id="s2020">He says, a war -- there’s a war on, nobody sleeps.</span> <span id="s2021">That took care of my complaint, okay?</span> <span id="s2022">Later on, being that I spoke German, he made me sort of like in charge of translating from him to the rest of the world, okay?</span> <span id="s2023">So was pretty good because once in awhile we traded something for some food, you know, e -- they -- they got fed.</span> <span id="s2024">We -- we got -- the -- the -- it’s not a repeat of Gurs, but it’s pretty close.</span> <span id="s2025">Boiled pasta for lunch and supper.</span> <span id="s2026">Now that don’t do much for your system either, you know, like beriberi?</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: You know?</span> <span id="s2029">Which happened to hit me after X amount of time.</span> <span id="s2030">So I go to the nurse, I didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s2031">Could be measles, could be rubeola, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2032">I says, look I got red spots all over myself, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2033">Well, the re -- German nurse, of course.</span> <span id="s2034">She didn’t know what it was either, but just to be on the safe side, she was going to put me in insulation, right?</span> <span id="s2035">So I don’t affect --</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: Isola -- isolation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: -- ins -- isolation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: Or insulation, isolation --</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: No, isolation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: -- same difference.</span> <span id="s2042">I was in -- isolated from everybody, but insulated too, but okay, fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: So just at that time, our friendly camp commandant comes in, points to me, he says, “What’s the matter with this bastard?”</span> <span id="s2045">The nurse tells him, he blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s2046">Oh, he goes to his holster, unstraps the holster, takes off his gun and says, “I’m gonna shoot that bastard right here.”</span> <span id="s2047">So the nurse said to him, of course in German, “You are not going to do any such thing Herr Commandant, in my office.”</span> <span id="s2048">Well, he actually didn’t shoot me, but she put me someplace and I stayed there for a little while.</span> <span id="s2049">And I got hold of some real type food, and after a little while I got better, and I got back to where I was.</span> <span id="s2050">Now, after a little while --</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q: Why would she do that, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: Why did she protect you?</span> <span id="s2054">Or was she --</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: Well, first of all she might not have known I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2056">Secondly not all Germans were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2057">She was a nurse, she wasn't there to kill people, she was supposed to heal them.</span> <span id="s2058">So she didn't want to -- I swear to you [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2059">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: But he also could have taken you outside and shot you.</span> <span id="s2061">If he was going to pay attention to her, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: She took the wind out of his sail.</span> <span id="s2063">Oh, not only that, wait.</span> <span id="s2064">She said to me, yeah you’re pretty sick, let me give you a pass so you can go on leave.</span> <span id="s2065">Oh, I says, well, I got nobody.</span> <span id="s2066">She [inaudible].</span> <span id="s2067">So that’s when she put me in the isolation, you know.</span> <span id="s2068">Was very funny, she was a -- a nice -- a nice human being.</span> <span id="s2069">I mean, I ge -- that’s all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: And this was in Labenne?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: Labenne Oceane.</span> <span id="s2072">And you know, I tell you, we were right on the ocean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: Actually the bluffs overlooking the ocean, because you can’t dig on the beach, because there you hit water, that’s no good.</span> <span id="s2075">So we used to dig for the emplacement for the bunkers.</span> <span id="s2076">Oh, that’s all by hand ha -- no machines, everything by shovel.</span> <span id="s2077">We used to dig a hole that was maybe 30 feet deep and 40 feet square and then flaring up to about a hundred feet at the top so that the sand doesn’t run down, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s2078">Was all done by shovel, can you imagine how many people it took?</span> <span id="s2079">Was like the Chinese coolies.</span> <span id="s2080">And anyway -- and we worked until everything was finished.</span> <span id="s2081">From -- from -- and we -- what I -- what my specialty was -- I didn’t pick it, you know what rebars are?</span> <span id="s2082">Rebars are those steel rods that they put in reinforced concrete.</span> <span id="s2083">So the first thing before you pour the concrete, and I think we -- the walls must have been about 12 feet thick if they were an inch.</span> <span id="s2084">We built the rebars from the bottom up like this, then straight across and then this way.</span> <span id="s2085">And they gave us a bunch of wire, you know, wire, and we -- when rebars met, we tied them like that and a pair of pliers to -- to cut it off.</span> <span id="s2086">And we were like -- like frigging monkeys hanging onto those rebars and the gale from the ocean was something unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2087">Cold?</span> <span id="s2088">Oy.</span> <span id="s2089">And that was already March at the time, or what -- whatever time it was.</span> <span id="s2090">No, first time was August, this was -- this was February, March.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: And this is when you’re building the -- what’s called the Atlantic wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: Well, let me ask you something, be -- between Gurs and Labenne Oceane, did you go to Camp Albi?</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: No, no, that’s later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: That’s later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: That comes after -- after Labenne Oceane.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A: So, anyway, we’re still building the stuff there.</span> <span id="s2101">Just to tell you how nice the Germans were, first of all they came by, they took the biggest guys they could find, of course, with the biggest German Shepherds you ever saw and they pat -- and they patrolled the work area.</span> <span id="s2102">And s -- believe me, you didn't want to be reminded to work harder by them.</span> <span id="s2103">They didn't do it kindly.</span> <span id="s2104">One day -- I’m not inventing things -- they found a guy, they says, guy’s not working hard enough, let’s teach him a lesson.</span> <span id="s2105">They grab him -- do you know what a grease gun is?</span> <span id="s2106">For -- for automotives or machinery?</span> <span id="s2107">They took the grease gun, inserted this in his rectum, filled it with grease, and that was the end of that particular episode, and man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: And you saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: No.</span> <span id="s2110">I was told firsthand, by firsthand.</span> <span id="s2111">I mean, I didn’t see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: So is this period of time the first time that you’re in a situation where there’s a lot of brutality?</span> <span id="s2113">Because the other situations, they may have been uncomfortable and you didn’t have enough food --</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: No, Gurs they die -- they -- they died too, in the winter, plenty of people died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: No, no, I’m not talking about dying.</span> <span id="s2116">I’m talking about brut -- brutality.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: Oh yeah, it’s the first time I saw brutality, yeah.</span> <span id="s2118">Oh, they were -- th-th-they used to cou -- ther -- you see, you’re working 16 hours a day in hard labor, you get a little tired.</span> <span id="s2119">So once in awhile it would be logical for you to sort of like rest on your shovel a little bit and so on.</span> <span id="s2120">And if they caught you, they brought you back to life, you know.</span> <span id="s2121">So anyway.</span> <span id="s2122">So one day I’m coming back, the food still was horrible, and it’s suppertime, we’re sitting at a table, and the next thing I know, our commandant -- there’s a few more episodes in between there.</span> <span id="s2123">They actually paid you.</span> <span id="s2124">The organization paid you, not -- we happened to fall in there because we happened to be Jews, we don’t really belong there, but we were there, okay?</span> <span id="s2125">So one day he found out we were Jews, well that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s2126">He came at night to scream at us while we were sleeping.</span> <span id="s2127">And he happened to be a gay, and he had a retinue of young men with him, shall we say?</span> <span id="s2128">And then, when he came time to get paid, well you know, they sit at the table there, with the paychecks and whatnot, you know?</span> <span id="s2129">And well, by the time -- by that time he knew who was Jewish -- well, every two weeks, I guess -- and what he did when he saw us come up, he took his gun, and he put it on the table right next to the pay envelope.</span> <span id="s2130">And you knew better than to grab for the pay envelope, okay?</span> <span id="s2131">That’s how we managed nicely.</span> <span id="s2132">So one day he realized [indecipherable] that’s not enough, I gotta get those guys.</span> <span id="s2133">He called the Gestapo and one night when we came home from work, the eight of us Jews were taken off and put on train, in a compartment that’s enough for eight, with the head Gestapo dude, and a soldier at each end of the train, do you -- the -- the car, you know, whatever it is, you know, what you call that, a b -- the unit, a car unit, so that you couldn’t run out, whatever.</span> <span id="s2134">And -- and the guy was very nice, but what he really was, he was trying to con these yi -- they were all young men, into revealing where their relatives and parents were, just in case they were hiding.</span> <span id="s2135">And they were so stupid, I’m tell -- no, the -- the young guys there, I’m telling you.</span> <span id="s2136">That’s when I realized the whole world is not exactly what you’re supposed to have heard about it.</span> <span id="s2137">People are mostly stupid.</span> <span id="s2138">I’m telling you, how c -- you could fall in this trap?</span> <span id="s2139">Write me a letter, I -- I’ll make sure it gets mailed, give me the address.</span> <span id="s2140">And they did.</span> <span id="s2141">How stupid can you get?</span> <span id="s2142">I mean honestly, they didn’t have the brains they were born with.</span> <span id="s2143">And they weren't stupid people, but they’re stupid.</span> <span id="s2144">You gotta be -- you gotta be up to every occasion that comes along.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: So what --</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: How the heck you going to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: What did you do when they asked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: Oh, I have -- I have nobody, I’m all alone in this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: Not only that, I spoke German, okay?</span> <span id="s2153">The other one might have been Polish --</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: So where did they -- where did they take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: Well, to the nearest fortress, which was Bayonne, an old French fortress that the Germans had taken over for a regiment of whatever it was, and they threw us in a prison cell, was very narrow, and there was a steel door, with a little flap that you could open to look out.</span> <span id="s2156">I mean, not from the inside, from the outside.</span> <span id="s2157">So I think only four people fitted in a cell.</span> <span id="s2158">And I remember the -- the German officer corps came and looked at what Jews look like.</span> <span id="s2159">You know, I mean what the heck?</span> <span id="s2160">He comes in there, hey -- hey Jews, we’ll pick them up tomorrow morning, but I just wanted to keep them overnight.</span> <span id="s2161">And the place was run by the German army, which wasn’t really bad.</span> <span id="s2162">And I remember in the morning they let us out to go and wash up.</span> <span id="s2163">And whether it was courage or stupidity, so you heard the phrase that you hear a lot in the funny German sitcoms, mach schnell, mach schnell, right?</span> <span id="s2164">That means hurry up.</span> <span id="s2165">So I had this orderly there, the German orderly was watching us while we were washing, or something.</span> <span id="s2166">And he saying this mach schnell, mach schnell.</span> <span id="s2167">I got so mad and I start tearing him to pieces in German.</span> <span id="s2168">I mean, really ripping into him in German, you know.</span> <span id="s2169">Told him, what the heck you think you’re doing?</span> <span id="s2170">Who the heck do you think you’re dealing with and whatnot.</span> <span id="s2171">You know, not a peep, not one repurs -- reparcation -- repercussion, it was the most amazing thing.</span> <span id="s2172">I could have gotten shot [indecipherable] on the spot.</span> <span id="s2173">Once in awhile you’re -- you know, it -- it pays to get mad.</span> <span id="s2174">So anyway, so the fellow --</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: This -- this was in Bayonne?</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: Bayonne.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: Bayonne.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: Bayonne.</span> <span id="s2179">There’s a fortress there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: I’m sure it’s still there.</span> <span id="s2182">Only because it’s 60 years later, doesn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s2183">Must have been built 60 years prior to that too.</span> <span id="s2184">So anyway, they put us on a train, and up north we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: And we stop at Albi.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">A: That’s the name of the railroad station and town.</span> <span id="s2189">And the Gestapo man must have called ahead to the militia and said, I want a contingent of militia men, I’m coming with some criminals, whatever he must -- I don’t know what he said, I just saw the result.</span> <span id="s2190">There’s eight of us, we’re coming, get them out of the train, there’s 40 black-clad, helmeted, armed, militia men for eight guys.</span> <span id="s2191">They didn't know it, that was that -- how many we were.</span> <span id="s2192">So they send him 40 militias.</span> <span id="s2193">So -- and they told them -- and they only kept maybe a half a dozen to guard us.</span> <span id="s2194">Put us in the truck and we wound up in this camp.</span> <span id="s2195">And this camp was not for Jews or foreigners, this camp was for the French resistance fighters that were caught by the Germans, or by the French sympathizers.</span> <span id="s2196">You know, either -- either or, right?</span> <span id="s2197">And they were going to get deported to Germany to do slave labor.</span> <span id="s2198">The Germans use any kind of slave labor they could get their hands on, and they were all young people, obviously.</span> <span id="s2199">But this was a very upscale camp, as far as camps go.</span> <span id="s2200">Clean, neat, beds.</span> <span id="s2201">They actually had some decent food.</span> <span id="s2202">I was shocked.</span> <span id="s2203">But I know that this couldn’t last, so after a few days -- now, it -- you gotta remember, I lived for five years with my uncle who was an officer in the French army, high ranking officer, and I used to hang out with all his cronies all the time, you know, the colonels and the majors and their wives, and all the -- because they used to take me over for tea.</span> <span id="s2204">In France there’s a big thing, you have tea in the afternoon, you know, little cake, whatever.</span> <span id="s2205">So I was young, they used to schlep me, my aunt used to schlep me along, all the ladies liked me, you know, I didn't make the nuisance of myself, so I knew how to, you know, behave.</span> <span id="s2206">And I had the nerve, I asked for an audience with the camp commandant.</span> <span id="s2207">I had -- his name I remember.</span> <span id="s2208">His name was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2209">He was a Corsican.</span> <span id="s2210">Yeah, I didn’t think he was that bad because after the war they had -- they h-hu-hung him as a -- as a war criminal, but I didn't think he was that bad [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2211">Not for me, it’s for the French people that he did in, you know?</span> <span id="s2212">Anyway, so I said to him in my best military upper class voice, I says, mon commandant, I know we are miscast here, we don’t belong here, and if you permit me, I would tell you who to contact to get rid of us.</span> <span id="s2213">Lo and behold, think that I sound one of his kind, picks up the phone, calls the commandant of Gurs.</span> <span id="s2214">Now I know the guy loved me, I worked for him for you know -- and he says, I got this guy here, blah, blah, blah, you know, I understand you are -- you’re -- you’re in charge, would you take him?</span> <span id="s2215">Oh, s-sure, send him over.</span> <span id="s2216">So again, in handcuffs, on the railroad, you know [indecipherable] such a wonderful with the -- wi-with the regular people, you gotta understand.</span> <span id="s2217">So they looked at us, man, some criminals, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2218">Was very embarrassing, you know -- tell you.</span> <span id="s2219">And so we got --</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: All eight of you were sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">Q: All eight of you were sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">A: Yeah, well I take the ra -- take the eight with me, what are we going to do, just me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: When I was young I saved a lot of people, I got a flash for you.</span> <span id="s2226">I really mean that, not a joke.</span> <span id="s2227">We’ll get to that later, maybe.</span> <span id="s2228">So, we get there, put us on a truck, drive us to Gurs.</span> <span id="s2229">Now Gurs had a big gate there, and be -- you know, the gate, it says Gurs and blah, blah, blah, big portal that.</span> <span id="s2230">And you know, the most touching scene I’ve ever seen in my life, the whole administration of the camp was there to welcome us, on account of me.</span> <span id="s2231">Now, that is touching.</span> <span id="s2232">You know?</span> <span id="s2233">The most -- the police inspectors that I knew.</span> <span id="s2234">The boss, his assistant and whoever else, was a whole bunch of people.</span> <span id="s2235">Really very touching.</span> <span id="s2236">And at that time, the camp that used to hold on the average, 13,000 inmate, male, female or whatever, was down to 16 people.</span> <span id="s2237">Germans worked very good.</span> <span id="s2238">From 13,000 to 16, it’s not bad.</span> <span id="s2239">And the reason that the French were able to save them, they said we need maintenance personnel for the camp.</span> <span id="s2240">Now, who did they keep is the -- the top of the line, of course.</span> <span id="s2241">The doctors, the dentist, the lawyers, you know.</span> <span id="s2242">A musician, I remember him.</span> <span id="s2243">His sister was the nurse, and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s2244">So they were -- they were there, you know?</span> <span id="s2245">And then the -- the eight of us.</span> <span id="s2246">And now all of a sudden we have 24, it was great.</span> <span id="s2247">We also -- we s -- still lived in the barracks, but not in the barracks barracks.</span> <span id="s2248">We lived in the barracks that the police inspector -- oh yeah, they also didn’t need all the police inspectors any more because it was only 24 people, right?</span> <span id="s2249">They only needed administrative people.</span> <span id="s2250">So they put us up, again I luck out.</span> <span id="s2251">I got my own room, a real bed, a stove, you know?</span> <span id="s2252">The only -- the only, the -- oh, i-it gets better, even.</span> <span id="s2253">The only drawback is, in order to justify us, we all had to become lumberjacks.</span> <span id="s2254">So they took us out in one of those famous cars.</span> <span id="s2255">Was a Chevy as a matter of fact, station wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: What, that was run on coal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">Q: I mean on charcoal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: A 1936 Chevy station wagon.</span> <span id="s2260">And they drove us up in the woods, you know, like the mountains, the beginning of the mountains is woods.</span> <span id="s2261">And the foresters had marked up the trees that needed to be cut.</span> <span id="s2262">Now, they were all dead oak.</span> <span id="s2263">Now, oak by itself is very hard.</span> <span id="s2264">If it’s dead, it’s like trying to cut steel.</span> <span id="s2265">Not only that, you had to clear away the underbrush, you know?</span> <span id="s2266">So first you had to clear the underbrush, I had -- well, I had the -- the other guys with me, eight guys and me.</span> <span id="s2267">Teams of two there with the saws.</span> <span id="s2268">You know those long saws that slightly curve [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2269">So I was the hatchet man, the axe man because I have experience in Castelnot as a lumberjack.</span> <span id="s2270">I did that for quite a long time in the winter over there.</span> <span id="s2271">They send me in the woods, they told me which trees to cut down all by myself.</span> <span id="s2272">Anyway, so I have plenty experience, I was the axe man.</span> <span id="s2273">So I was the one that had to clear the underbrush.</span> <span id="s2274">And if you notice, if you look at the tree, the roots grow up like this.</span> <span id="s2275">The roots don’t grow underneath, they grow outside.</span> <span id="s2276">And when they’re oaks and when they’re like a hundred years old, I mean we’re talking.</span> <span id="s2277">So you had to chop that up before you could get at the basic tree trunk, and the prerequisite was not like the lumberjacks over here with the power saw at arm’s height like this, cutting the thing, no.</span> <span id="s2278">You had to cut it right flush with the ground.</span> <span id="s2279">Wonderful, wonderful exercise.</span> <span id="s2280">And I have to decide which way the tree would fall, so I had to notch it in various ways, and then the saw team came and they went opposite of the notch, and -- and then we had to cut it in three foot lengths, you know, stack the wood, cords of wood, and split it.</span> <span id="s2281">I mean, can you imagine splitting trees that big around?</span> <span id="s2282">Oh, such fun.</span> <span id="s2283">And then at night they took us back.</span> <span id="s2284">The reward was, we ate in the noncommissioned officer’s mess, and we wore civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s2285">And that saved our life, because after a little while, the Germans in Pau, in the commandanture must have heard that there’s some Jews around there someplace in Gurs.</span> <span id="s2286">Will never do.</span> <span id="s2287">So one night we’re eating in the mess, and all of a sudden I see a pair of my favorite black suited militia come in.</span> <span id="s2288">French.</span> <span id="s2289">Okay.</span> <span id="s2290">Get nervous already.</span> <span id="s2291">Then I see another pair coming in.</span> <span id="s2292">And another pair.</span> <span id="s2293">So I said to the guys, we’re all eating at the same table, I says, look fellows, let’s not make it obvious.</span> <span id="s2294">Let’s just go out here one or two at a time like we’re finished eating.</span> <span id="s2295">We weren’t finished eating but that was no time to stick around, right?</span> <span id="s2296">So we got out and [indecipherable] out and we saw -- see, there’s the main route, what they call route nationale was running alongside the camp.</span> <span id="s2297">I told you, the camp was like a mile long.</span> <span id="s2298">Would you believe they had truckloads of these militia men that surrounded the camp every 50 or a hundred feet, so that nobody could escape?</span> <span id="s2299">So, what to do, you know?</span> <span id="s2300">The guy’s already in the camp, but I happened to be very good friends with one of the -- it was one of the older police inspectors in his -- must have been 40’s or some like that.</span> <span id="s2301">And he was married and he was still living in the camp, across the street in Quonset huts.</span> <span id="s2302">Very civilized though, and he had two kids.</span> <span id="s2303">So I have one guy with me also, big guy, but he was a real baby.</span> <span id="s2304">He says, what are you gonna do, what are you g -- I says, what, I’m going to try to sneak through the wire and run across to in -- it was night, and see whether this inspector would put me up overnight until they have left and done their dirty deed, right?</span> <span id="s2305">He’s like, please take me along, take me along.</span> <span id="s2306">I says, hey man, what are you crazy, nobody knows you.</span> <span id="s2307">Well, he made such a pest of mys -- of himself, I took him along.</span> <span id="s2308">So -- you -- you remember, it was the war, so there’s blackout, there’s no lights anyplace.</span> <span id="s2309">Knock on the door and either he or his wife open up the door, I says, blah, blah, blah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: Kurt, excuse me, I have to stop, cause we need to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: All right, so you’re now in the process of escaping with this other guy, and you’ve knocked on the commandant’s door and the wife answered.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">A: No, not the commandant, one of the inspectors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: Oh, I mean one -- one of the inspectors, I’m sorry, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2317">And I says -- explained my situation whether we could come in and you know, I have a problem.</span> <span id="s2318">Oh, she pulls us in, and explained to them.</span> <span id="s2319">Oh, she says, sure.</span> <span id="s2320">Now you gotta understand how good the French are.</span> <span id="s2321">I listen to them being torn apart all the time, and I don’t listen to this.</span> <span id="s2322">She had two children.</span> <span id="s2323">First thing she did, she took the kids out of bed, where did she put them to sleep, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2324">Then, I haven’t slept in a bed in how long, I don’t know how long.</span> <span id="s2325">She goes ahead and changes the sheet.</span> <span id="s2326">I said, lady, you don’t have to change the sheet.</span> <span id="s2327">She changed the sheet.</span> <span id="s2328">Now, you know why I say that.</span> <span id="s2329">You couldn’t get soap in France, or stuff you use to do a wash.</span> <span id="s2330">I mean a -- I’m telling you, it -- it -- it was a horror show.</span> <span id="s2331">So she insisted on giving us fresh sheets.</span> <span id="s2332">So we spent the night there, we slept together in the bed, of course, and then the following morning we went back and we saw how much damage the German did.</span> <span id="s2333">Couple of guys managed to get lucky, but they got a few, you know.</span> <span id="s2334">And then that was a signal for me that it’s getting towards the end, you can not hang out here any more.</span> <span id="s2335">So I took a gamble.</span> <span id="s2336">I was -- I told you, when I was the orderly there at this little room, the recepti -- reception room, and next to me was the radio operator, you know, in touch with who knows what.</span> <span id="s2337">So his name was Otis.</span> <span id="s2338">So I go and see him, I says, Otis, gotta ask you something.</span> <span id="s2339">Do you by any chance know anybody on the underground that’s a guy that takes people over the Pyrenees?</span> <span id="s2340">Took a gamble.</span> <span id="s2341">Could have handed me over to the police, too, right, or the Germans?</span> <span id="s2342">Says, let me see, come back in a little while.</span> <span id="s2343">He set up an appointment with me -- for me with some mountain type guy, and we met, supposedly some sort of bridge, I -- I could get out, you know.</span> <span id="s2344">I me -- I worked for the assistant and he -- he had the gate right behind his house, so I knew how to get out of the place without getting through the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s2345">So I met him, and meanwhile it became known for some reason that I was gonna get out of the camp.</span> <span id="s2346">And the next think I know, I got four guys bugging the bejeebers out of me to take them with m -- with me, along.</span> <span id="s2347">There was only one drawback.</span> <span id="s2348">After I saw the guide, he says it’s -- argument-wise, 5,000 whatever it is per person.</span> <span id="s2349">I says okay.</span> <span id="s2350">I had -- I always had some money, I worked.</span> <span id="s2351">Even in the camp when I was the orderly I made money, fine.</span> <span id="s2352">Always had money.</span> <span id="s2353">But the other dudes didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s2354">So what are we gonna do?</span> <span id="s2355">I have to rustle up a fortune of money.</span> <span id="s2356">So in the middle of the night we used to sneak out of the camp and sell everything we could get rid of, we didn’t need.</span> <span id="s2357">So eventually -- and then I went to some guy I know who had a lot of money, and I says, look, blah, blah, blah, I’m shy so much money, how about it?</span> <span id="s2358">So he gave it to me.</span> <span id="s2359">So finally I have got all the money and when we went out the camp at night, was the winter anyway, it was January the 21st, 1944 -- so I gave him the money and the money wasn’t for him.</span> <span id="s2360">He -- during the day they had to hide us in a farmhouse and the farmer had to feed us.</span> <span id="s2361">In order to buy food they needed money, that’s what the money was for.</span> <span id="s2362">And you know the Pyrenees fooled me a lot.</span> <span id="s2363">I had no idea, I’m telling you, I’m naïve in every re-respect.</span> <span id="s2364">Only once though, you don’t do it twice with me.</span> <span id="s2365">But the first time around, anything goes.</span> <span id="s2366">I saw the mountain, I says, oh, you climb that mountain, on the other side is Spain, no big deal.</span> <span id="s2367">Imagine my disappointment when we get on top of the mountain, what’s across the s -- from me as far as I can see, another mountain, just as high.</span> <span id="s2368">Well, there were six of them.</span> <span id="s2369">I’ll make it short because w-we don’t have a week.</span> <span id="s2370">The last week -- the last day, we hit the glacier, we were that high up already, you know, past the snow line, glacier.</span> <span id="s2371">Now, we weren’t exactly dressed.</span> <span id="s2372">Remember this is between January 21st, and January 27th, alright?</span> <span id="s2373">And in the mountains that’s not exactly summertime weather.</span> <span id="s2374">And especially without the proper equipment.</span> <span id="s2375">So we hitting this glacier -- oh, by the way, those guides were all volunteer.</span> <span id="s2376">They walked the whole night, and then they c -- they -- they could walk much better than us, then the following -- well, the following morning, they ran back to the -- their day job.</span> <span id="s2377">Some of them were e-engineers on a -- on a train.</span> <span id="s2378">Some did ta -- they -- th-they did that -- they didn't get any sleep for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s2379">They did that without a nickel of remuneration.</span> <span id="s2380">The money was strictly for the farmers so they could buy food for us.</span> <span id="s2381">Logical situation, which we didn’t know but we found out.</span> <span id="s2382">So we climbed during the night.</span> <span id="s2383">The reason that it took so long -- there’s a perfectly good road that goes along in the valley, the only trouble is that it’s patrolled by Germans, because that’s the road between Spain and France.</span> <span id="s2384">So we went over every mountain without any roads whatsoever.</span> <span id="s2385">Was horror show.</span> <span id="s2386">I once fell down the side of a mountain cliff just like that.</span> <span id="s2387">And it’s just like in the movies, th-the only thing that stopped me between heaven and earth, there was this shrub sticking out from that cliff.</span> <span id="s2388">And I get ahold of it.</span> <span id="s2389">So now I’m looking up and I see the guys on top and I look down below.</span> <span id="s2390">And the guides came, he was like s -- more of a mountaineer, right?</span> <span id="s2391">You see, there was -- the pass was that wide, there was no light.</span> <span id="s2392">And it had eroded, there was a hole like that and I didn’t see, and I stepped right in that hole.</span> <span id="s2393">The way we could see is -- you know what a musette is?</span> <span id="s2394">That’s like a bread bag that they have in France for the soldiers or for anything, a -- a bag, and they’re usually in light canvas.</span> <span id="s2395">So, was flung over the back from the guy, so that’s what you were focusing on because him you couldn’t see, you know?</span> <span id="s2396">Phew.</span> <span id="s2397">So he came and got me back up again.</span> <span id="s2398">Oy.</span> <span id="s2399">That was scary.</span> <span id="s2400">I didn’t scream, either.</span> <span id="s2401">Not a peep out of me, I wasn’t giving anybody away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: So you were walking for six nights?</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2404">And I mean, walking up the mountain is bad, you can’t believe what it is to walk down the mountain.</span> <span id="s2405">You can’t walk down the mountain, you run, because there’s no way -- anything to stop you.</span> <span id="s2406">It’s so steep, you run.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Now one of these guys had a little dog with him, didn’t he?</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2409">Oh yeah, tha -- tha -- that’s nice.</span> <span id="s2410">That -- I-I said to him -- that’s the guy whose job I got through -- you know, who did some tricks, but he loved his dog.</span> <span id="s2411">Okay, fine.</span> <span id="s2412">A small German Shepherd, or young German Shepherd.</span> <span id="s2413">I says, he is totally insane, I couldn’t talk him out of it.</span> <span id="s2414">All right.</span> <span id="s2415">So the first step, the first night, we’re on the -- off a cliff i-in a shepherd’s hut, you know, trying to get a little warm, you know, and get a little rest.</span> <span id="s2416">And it was on a cliff overlooking down below.</span> <span id="s2417">After a little while, whatever it was, we’re walking out of there and I’m the last guy out and I happen to look down there.</span> <span id="s2418">Down there’s a German patrol with a Shepherd, and the Shepherd is barking to beat the band.</span> <span id="s2419">Why?</span> <span id="s2420">He smelled the other dog.</span> <span id="s2421">Not us so much as the dog.</span> <span id="s2422">Man, did we have to run, and the guy didn’t even have any pepper or anything like that he could have sprinkled around on the track.</span> <span id="s2423">That was a good one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: But the dog he had never barked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">A: No [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">Q: That’s quite amazing, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">A: Look, I don’t analyze things, not at that time.</span> <span id="s2428">Later on you have time to analyze.</span> <span id="s2429">While it’s happening there’s no psychoanalysis, you know?</span> <span id="s2430">So after six days we’re now faced -- oh yeah, excuse me.</span> <span id="s2431">On the six days we met two more groups.</span> <span id="s2432">One group was people that were very well heeled, with the proper equipment, you know, mountain equipment you know, and -- and the shoes with spikes, and then the right kind of rucksack, you know, and the nice warm clothes, you know, filthy rich people.</span> <span id="s2433">They didn't like it any more either.</span> <span id="s2434">I don’t know whether they were Jewish or not, most -- more likely they’re not.</span> <span id="s2435">And lo and behold I inherit five allied flyboys.</span> <span id="s2436">Four Americans and a British.</span> <span id="s2437">They have -- have been channeled by the French underground all the way back to where our meeting point was.</span> <span id="s2438">You know, the French used to hide them at night.</span> <span id="s2439">You know, maybe they came all the way -- I don’t know from where, but they were shot down over, you know, German territory.</span> <span id="s2440">So for some reason they -- the rich people went their own way -- they elected me as their leader.</span> <span id="s2441">Okay?</span> <span id="s2442">I’m not a soldier or anything like that, I’m their leader, hallelujah.</span> <span id="s2443">Same way I was the leader of the other dudes.</span> <span id="s2444">They all were older than me.</span> <span id="s2445">So we’re facing this glacier there, sheer wall.</span> <span id="s2446">So the mountain man, he has this pick, you know this -- they got these things, they’re those picks, and he’s hacking a step into the ice, one step at a time.</span> <span id="s2447">So here -- it’s like a bunch of monkeys, we’re all hanging on for dear life, one hand in this -- in -- in the step and the other one was standing there, and the guy in front of you is standing there.</span> <span id="s2448">Finally you make it to the top.</span> <span id="s2449">And the top is one sheer field of ice, going down like this.</span> <span id="s2450">Anyway you want to look at, sheer ice.</span> <span id="s2451">Well, we get to the top and guide says to me, well okay, this is th -- that -- this is one for the ages.</span> <span id="s2452">You follow that river, and that will lead you to civilization.</span> <span id="s2453">I said to him, river?</span> <span id="s2454">What -- what the heck are you talking about?</span> <span id="s2455">I don’t see any river.</span> <span id="s2456">I have 20/20 vision, didn’t see any river.</span> <span id="s2457">I says, you’re in -- you’re not going to leave me here.</span> <span id="s2458">You take me where that river allegedly is.</span> <span id="s2459">Comes with me and it was ice, I’m telling you, it’s like I said, it’s a sheer glacier.</span> <span id="s2460">So -- and underneath, all of a sudden, there’s a slight discoloration underneath the ice, it’s grayish.</span> <span id="s2461">He says, you see that?</span> <span id="s2462">That’s the river.</span> <span id="s2463">You follow that, okay?</span> <span id="s2464">That’s how a river starts someplace, I guess.</span> <span id="s2465">I can vouch for it because it turned into a river.</span> <span id="s2466">So like good pedestrians, we walk on the right side of nothing, underneath the ice.</span> <span id="s2467">And slowly, slowly -- if you ha-have ever been to New Hampshire, you see in those rapids over there, splashing over the stone.</span> <span id="s2468">Scary.</span> <span id="s2469">Not very deep, but scary when you don’t know that.</span> <span id="s2470">So all of a sudden, we’re on the right side and there’s no place to walk any more because there’s a sheer cliff like that, the -- the river must have gouged it out.</span> <span id="s2471">But the opposite side is perfectly nice and flat.</span> <span id="s2472">There’s only one thing wrong.</span> <span id="s2473">By now that quote, no river, was maybe, let me see, I want to keep it within the framework of reality.</span> <span id="s2474">Maybe 40 - 50 feet wide.</span> <span id="s2475">And it’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2476">So we took off our shoes and then we looked whether there was a stone to step on, and we made it to the other side.</span> <span id="s2477">Now the other side was mud, but was plenty room to walk, and it was like the Grand Canyon.</span> <span id="s2478">It was completely gouged out like this, yo -- you know?</span> <span id="s2479">It -- like a cover.</span> <span id="s2480">And we kept on walking and walking and walking and walking, there’s hours, you know.</span> <span id="s2481">And the only sound that you heard once in awhile was the axe of a lumberjack, someplace, you know, that carries very far in the -- in an icy neighborhood and in the woods with no other noise, you know?</span> <span id="s2482">And once in a blue moon we saw a Spaniard.</span> <span id="s2483">Now, two of the guys were Spanish Civil War veterans, so they spoke Spanish, so [indecipherable] you know, whatever, so a -- ah -- they thought we were Spaniards.</span> <span id="s2484">Here goes.</span> <span id="s2485">We come around the corner, and we froze.</span> <span id="s2486">What’s in front of us like -- hard to say accurately, let’s say 500 feet.</span> <span id="s2487">A platoon of Germans with trucks and everything.</span> <span id="s2488">I says, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.</span> <span id="s2489">And you know who was the most scared?</span> <span id="s2490">Hate to tell you.</span> <span id="s2491">The soldier boys.</span> <span id="s2492">They were going to hightail it.</span> <span id="s2493">I says, boys -- I spoke English -- as -- not as well as now, but spoke some English enough to get by.</span> <span id="s2494">I says, hold it.</span> <span id="s2495">If these are Germans they’re going to shoot you the minute you start running.</span> <span id="s2496">Let’s take it easy, they don’t seem to be all that dangerous.</span> <span id="s2497">They keep on staring at the Germans there.</span> <span id="s2498">German helmet, German boots, German uniforms, German everything.</span> <span id="s2499">Something -- and all of a sudden I saw what was different.</span> <span id="s2500">The belt and the bandoliers were bright yellow.</span> <span id="s2501">Well, the Germans are either brown or black.</span> <span id="s2502">So then I knew they were Germans.</span> <span id="s2503">So we had no choice but to walk up to them.</span> <span id="s2504">So the allied sold --</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">Q: The soldiers were not German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">A: Of course not, not with a b -- yellow bandolier, you know, and a yellow belt.</span> <span id="s2507">With -- the Germans have black and -- or brown.</span> <span id="s2508">You know, that’s what -- that’s what stopped me, I knew there was something different.</span> <span id="s2509">And so we walk up to them, and the other guys identified themselves as allied soldiers, showed their dogtag, whatnot.</span> <span id="s2510">They put them on the truck, drove them to the nearby embassy in -- it must be Bilbao or some town there, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2511">Okay?</span> <span id="s2512">They were home free.</span> <span id="s2513">Us, we don’t deserve, because we weren’t the only guys that came across, we don’t deserve no trucks.</span> <span id="s2514">We haven’t walked enough, only six days, or six nights.</span> <span id="s2515">So we’re walking, and we’re schlepping, we’re schlepping.</span> <span id="s2516">The next thing we know, they threw us into a one cell dungeon, the filthiest place I ever seen in my life.</span> <span id="s2517">Window up there, no place to sleep or nothing.</span> <span id="s2518">So the following day we wind up -- I don’t know whether we got on a truck, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2519">I can’t swear, I ga -- what I can’t swear to, I’m not saying.</span> <span id="s2520">We wind up in Bilbao.</span> <span id="s2521">Where did they take us?</span> <span id="s2522">To Spanish Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s2523">Pure marble everything.</span> <span id="s2524">I don’t mean the outside, I don’t mean the wall, I don’t mean the floor.</span> <span id="s2525">I mean the benches you sat on, all marble.</span> <span id="s2526">This is after Franco [indecipherable], I don’t know, it’s -- this is 1941 -- ’44, and the war is over in ’39, and they were poor as church mice, proverbial.</span> <span id="s2527">So each and every one go -- gets interviewed.</span> <span id="s2528">Now, obviously we didn’t come along with papers.</span> <span id="s2529">Now being that I’m as good as any Frenchman ever was, all of a sudden I’m French.</span> <span id="s2530">Took my France -- French name, birthplace, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2531">The only thing that I did, I lied.</span> <span id="s2532">The only time in my life actually -- you don’t have to believe me, but it’s true.</span> <span id="s2533">I fudged my age.</span> <span id="s2534">All of a sudden I was 17 years old.</span> <span id="s2535">I looked very young, I was emaciated, haven’t eaten in four years.</span> <span id="s2536">So, you know, I looked very young.</span> <span id="s2537">They bought it.</span> <span id="s2538">Saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">A: Well, if you were of army age, right?</span> <span id="s2541">Meaning 18 - 19 - 20 - 21 or older, you wound up in Miranda.</span> <span id="s2542">Miranda was a death camp like Andersonville from the Civil War.</span> <span id="s2543">Just as bad as the German concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2544">Just as bad.</span> <span id="s2545">So I wound up with the old people and the children.</span> <span id="s2546">Fantastic.</span> <span id="s2547">Wound up in a little rest -- no, first in town they put us up in a real nice restaurant, the first decent meal I had had in five years -- four years, okay?</span> <span id="s2548">Of course I was with the French, you know, I was French.</span> <span id="s2549">No paper, but I was French.</span> <span id="s2550">And nobody was going to say I’m not French.</span> <span id="s2551">Nobody would believe me if I would have told them, which at one time I did, and nobody believed me anyway.</span> <span id="s2552">Couldn’t be.</span> <span id="s2553">Couldn’t be that I’m not French.</span> <span id="s2554">Okay, fine.</span> <span id="s2555">So the following day they take us and we wind up in a small -- let’s say town, way up in the mountain and in a nice, little hotel.</span> <span id="s2556">Now I’m living, together with older people, you know.</span> <span id="s2557">I don’t know how many, let’s say 15 -17 or so.</span> <span id="s2558">And we were plenty of food.</span> <span id="s2559">The Spaniard for some reason had food, and I want to tell you how that came about.</span> <span id="s2560">The -- they -- they tho -- spanic -- spa -- Spain is very arid and poor, and all they grew was olive and o-oranges.</span> <span id="s2561">Well, how come they had food?</span> <span id="s2562">Well, for every allied prisoner that they turned in to the allies, the United States gave them a 75 kilo bag of grain, or 175 pound bag of grain.</span> <span id="s2563">Wheat.</span> <span id="s2564">And they paid them X amount of dollars per prisoner.</span> <span id="s2565">So they had a marvelous business to -- even though they were leaning towards Hitler -- you know, Franco, well, you can’t pass up a good deal like that.</span> <span id="s2566">The allies were smart.</span> <span id="s2567">So they bought all of their prisoners and th-that’s how come the Spaniards had food.</span> <span id="s2568">And at for -- they got strangest eating ours, but that’s not here nor there.</span> <span id="s2569">At four or five o’clock in the afternoon they made chocolate, you know, hot chocolate?</span> <span id="s2570">But they don’t make it like powder, they take chocolate bars, and you know when the chocolate is finished, you can put a spoon in and it stays upright, that’s how thick that chocolate is.</span> <span id="s2571">But we had a lot of nice food there.</span> <span id="s2572">That didn't last too long.</span> <span id="s2573">Then they threw me again in another camp with hundreds upon hundreds of hundreds and hundreds of French people, young people, also refugees from France, also in the mountains, and they put us in a -- well, that must have been the spa in peacetime, you know, like a big hotel, and with plenty of rooms, and -- and -- and dining room and things like that.</span> <span id="s2574">So we stayed there for a little while and then they transferred us to another one that was actually even nicer, but by that time it’s already going on towards spring.</span> <span id="s2575">Now anybody that tells you that Spain is warm is mistaken, he has never hang -- hung around northern Spain, it is freezing.</span> <span id="s2576">It is freezing.</span> <span id="s2577">And we always had to get out there for the colors, you know, like -- you know, when they raise the flag and things like?</span> <span id="s2578">One night we -- we had to stand there.</span> <span id="s2579">One of their things, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s2580">And then we wound up -- oh yeah, and I -- I was under the misconception that oh, I’ll get out of here in no time flat, you know, wound up in North Africa.</span> <span id="s2581">So I never bothered learning Spanish.</span> <span id="s2582">So one month goes by, I’m still there.</span> <span id="s2583">Two months goes by, I’m still there.</span> <span id="s2584">After three months a light goes on, I says, fella, you were vastly mistaken, you’re net gotten -- you’re not getting out of here so fast, better learn Spanish.</span> <span id="s2585">Not bragging, stating facts.</span> <span id="s2586">I learned perfect Spanish in three weeks.</span> <span id="s2587">I was so good in Spanish that I used to write love letters for the -- for the fellas to write -- to send to the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: Before you learned Spanish, where did you think you would go?</span> <span id="s2589">Why did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">A: North Africa, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">A: That’s where the French were, free French.</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">Q: I see, so you thought the Spanish would send you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">Q: What [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">A: Not the Spanish, the Spanish hand me over to the free French who’d take care of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: No, that’s what I meant, that’s what you expected them to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">A: Yeah, and they eventually did.</span> <span id="s2599">The only problem was the French had the marvelous system.</span> <span id="s2600">You could tell them any kind of fairy tale like I found out in the Foreign Legion, not for myself, but for other people, and by the time they had you screened, which took a few weeks, you gotta reme -- realize that French was occupied territory, they knew exactly who you were.</span> <span id="s2601">They knew your police record if you had one.</span> <span id="s2602">They knew where you were born, you knew -- they knew your real name.</span> <span id="s2603">That -- they let you tell them anything you wanted, but they wanted to investigate and they could find out.</span> <span id="s2604">So naturally I didn’t have any papers, I have to come clean.</span> <span id="s2605">So what was my choice?</span> <span id="s2606">The Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s2607">I wanted the French army, right?</span> <span id="s2608">Couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s2609">I wasn’t French, you know, and they didn’t -- you know.</span> <span id="s2610">So I wound up in the Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s2611">And the Foreign Legion, eventually we were sent to Casablanca, you know, from[indecipherable] which is Gibraltar, to Casablanca, you know, these -- take the ship there.</span> <span id="s2612">It’s across the Straights, it’s very -- you know, the two oceans collide, the Mediterranean and the Pacific -- and the -- and the Atlantic, and let me tell you, it’s not a peaceful meeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: Whew, my God, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2615">That was my second sea storm, but anyway -- well that one was the first one, anyway.</span> <span id="s2616">And so we wound up in a big army base in Casablanca and they interrogate me and the British were there that were doing the interrogation and they were very thrilled with all the information I could give them about the Atlantic Wall.</span> <span id="s2617">You see, what, where, how much, how fast, how big, how deep, what was the weaponry, what -- I had all that information and [indecipherable] to get a guy firsthand information, okay?</span> <span id="s2618">So we were together with French Colonial troops and there also were Americans on the base.</span> <span id="s2619">Now I said to myself, the Foreign Legion, I’m not that crazy about it.</span> <span id="s2620">From what I hear, it’s not a place to be.</span> <span id="s2621">So I saw two army officers, American, coming by.</span> <span id="s2622">Being that I spoke a little English, I went up to them, I says, “Gentlemen, excuse me, I would really like to join the American army.”</span> <span id="s2623">Oh, obviously they were from the quartermaster depot.</span> <span id="s2624">They were uninterested, you know?</span> <span id="s2625">That was my chance of serving in the American Army.</span> <span id="s2626">I knew that the Foreign Legion was going to be the absolute pits of the world, which it was, but that’s a -- you know.</span> <span id="s2627">So -- and I saw the strangest things there.</span> <span id="s2628">The Moroccans were the nicest of all Arabs, I tell you.</span> <span id="s2629">The further east you go, the worst they get.</span> <span id="s2630">The Moroccans are the nicest.</span> <span id="s2631">The Algerians already, forget it.</span> <span id="s2632">The Tunisian, no good.</span> <span id="s2633">Libya, after that, forget, it’s the end of the world.</span> <span id="s2634">But the Moroccans aren’t bad.</span> <span id="s2635">They were real nice.</span> <span id="s2636">That’s the first time I saw pot.</span> <span id="s2637">I didn't know what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: Saw what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: Pot.</span> <span id="s2640">Marijuana.</span> <span id="s2641">And [indecipherable] in the bags just sitting outside, and there’s this Moroccan dude, some older gent.</span> <span id="s2642">He pulls a tiny little s -- white ceramic pipe, with a thimble type bowl.</span> <span id="s2643">And he’s stuffing the thing.</span> <span id="s2644">And I said to him, in French obviously, I says, what’s that?</span> <span id="s2645">He said, kief.</span> <span id="s2646">You want a shot?</span> <span id="s2647">Do you want to try it?</span> <span id="s2648">I said, oh, no thank you.</span> <span id="s2649">So kief is the first time I met with marijuana.</span> <span id="s2650">He was smoking kief.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2652">You -- you were fighting, am I -- am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Q: You were -- you were actually fighting at some point, at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2656">Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">Q: In France and Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2659">You know, after they screened us and blah, blah, blah, and I was attached to this French legion division, and to that one and this, that, eventually we wound up in the desert as an assembly point, then we took the LST’s, you know, the big landing craft, you put the doors open in the front?</span> <span id="s2660">And we went from [indecipherable] to Marseille.</span> <span id="s2661">Marseille was a French port, we could -- right into the town, you know, because the -- like, what they call the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2662">It was like the -- a wall, you know, a -- what you would call a seawall, you know, you could -- and you just dropped the doors and it went over, it was very -- actually it was be -- between me and my lieutenant we were the first one off the ship, you know?</span> <span id="s2663">And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">Q: Let -- I think I have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2668">So you’re on a -- some sort of a vessel, right, that goes into Marseille and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2670">We’re landing in Marseille, and then we follow up the Rhone river valley, because it had been clear already by previous troops, Americans possibly, you know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2671">And what amazed me the most and what most people don’t realize was how rich a country France was.</span> <span id="s2672">The Germans had to abandon all the cars that they took from the French trying to get home with them.</span> <span id="s2673">On each side of the road -- this is hard to believe -- for, let’s say a minimum of three - 400 miles, were abandoned cars, three rows of abandoned cars.</span> <span id="s2674">Now, can you picture how well the French were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">A: That’s for hundreds of miles, three beside.</span> <span id="s2677">Anyway, we went -- we wound up at the triangle -- the triangle of [indecipherable], Vivier, and I forget the other town, and there we have a little stopped, and then we hit -- oh what’s -- what’s the town called there?</span> <span id="s2678">Belfort.</span> <span id="s2679">And you know, that’s -- you know, little fighting, little this and we are stuck in mud again.</span> <span id="s2680">The halftracks are stuck, the trucks are stuck.</span> <span id="s2681">I mean, it’s unbelievable the mud, and it’s like where the Ardennes are, the Vosges come together, you know, the mountains where all the World War І battles were fought.</span> <span id="s2682">S-Same story all over the world, never changes.</span> <span id="s2683">And then we slowly, when it really gets cold, we advance into Germany.</span> <span id="s2684">Actually, we stayed in Alsace-Lorraine near Strasbourg for a little bit, and then, sometime later, must have been April or something, we crossed the Rhine at -- I don’t know, a -- a -- a -- where.</span> <span id="s2685">The Americans had built a pontoon bridge, you know, and one cami -- one -- one truck at a time, you know, boom, boom, and then we’re rolling into Germany, and things like that.</span> <span id="s2686">And then we went from one village to the next, from one town to the next.</span> <span id="s2687">And then eventually we wound up in this lovely, lovely little town, shortly before the end of the war, and the people were very nice.</span> <span id="s2688">Got myself a girlfriend obviously, and that’s first thing I did.</span> <span id="s2689">Had p -- I had plenty of freedom, I was -- I don’t know whether -- I didn’t mention it, I won’t think so.</span> <span id="s2690">As a private first class, that’s as h -- far as I got, I was running the motor pool.</span> <span id="s2691">Can you imagine that, all by myself?</span> <span id="s2692">No stripes, no nothing.</span> <span id="s2693">I had more clout than any officer ever had.</span> <span id="s2694">I ran the whole motor pool.</span> <span id="s2695">Jeep, GMC trucks, Dodge trucks, halftracks.</span> <span id="s2696">You name it, I ran it all.</span> <span id="s2697">I ordered the parts, wa -- I used to be -- I-I told you, I spoke some English.</span> <span id="s2698">So all the orders have to be written or filled out in English, because requisitions were in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: Why were they in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: Well, the Americans were supplying us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">A: We got supplied by the Americans.</span> <span id="s2703">Food, weapons, uniforms.</span> <span id="s2704">Everything was American, you know?</span> <span id="s2705">And that was great because -- as long as the war lasted.</span> <span id="s2706">After that it wasn’t so good.</span> <span id="s2707">So anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: So at this point, how much do you know about what the Nazis have done in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A: At that time we weren’t talking Nazis any more, we were just talking fighting the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Q: I know you -- I know you weren’t necessarily talking about it, I want to know what you knew.</span> <span id="s2711">Did you know anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">A: Wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">Q: Did you know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">A: -- I knew from before, I knew that there were Auschwitz, and that people didn’t come out of it.</span> <span id="s2715">That’s what I knew from --</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">Q: Did you know there were gas chambers?</span> <span id="s2717">Did you know that people were being gassed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">A: I -- I -- I -- I -- I might have known, I can’t swear to you -- to it, because this was very removed from the stress of hour to hour living.</span> <span id="s2719">We’re not talking day to day, you know?</span> <span id="s2720">Even while I was in Castelnot, it was never a relaxing thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">A: Either I was totally exhausted from work.</span> <span id="s2723">There was -- for weeks I couldn’t straighten out my hands after six weeks of hoeing the vineyards.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">A: They were cramped like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">Q: No, the only reason I’m asking you Kurt, is not to be critical or anything, it’s a question of trying to figure out what people knew when, and what difference did it make, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">A: For -- for -- for -- for -- ’42, it was a -- was a known fact.</span> <span id="s2728">In ’42 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">Q: But you really didn’t know what it meant at that point.</span> <span id="s2730">But that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">A: No, it just meant death.</span> <span id="s2732">That’s the only thing that we knew, that the German were killing the Jews in Auschwitz, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">Q: Did you know there were other camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">A: In terez -- yeah, Theresienstadt, whatever, you know?</span> <span id="s2735">Bergen-Belsen and d-d -- Dachau was well known because that’s in Germany.</span> <span id="s2736">You know, Dachau and the -- and a couple of more there which escape me right now.</span> <span id="s2737">So that we knew, because we knew that they didn’t treat the Jews nicely when they picked them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A: They were very, very cruel and gruesome.</span> <span id="s2740">I mean, they did it to their own people.</span> <span id="s2741">Hitler used to hang his own bodies from meathooks, you know, when he was unhappy with them, so you can imagine how well they treated the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: Did your mother and father lose family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2744">My mother lost a sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">Q: Is that the sister who stayed with her grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">A: No.</span> <span id="s2747">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: I mean, the grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A: The oldest one, the oldest one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">A: The oldest one that didn’t want to send my namesake boy --</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">A: -- to live with my aunt in France.</span> <span id="s2754">They stayed there, they died.</span> <span id="s2755">That’s her side of the family.</span> <span id="s2756">My father’s family, everybody, his father, 85, his two brothers, his sister that married a Catholic, and the nuns hid her and her daughter, because you see, because you’re married to a Catholic, and Jewish, doesn’t count.</span> <span id="s2757">It even makes the guy that married you a prime target for retribution, you know?</span> <span id="s2758">So she swore that if she ever got out of that alive, that she’ll convert to Christianism -- or Christianity or whatever.</span> <span id="s2759">So -- and then her two children were obviously -- well, not obviously, they were born Jewish.</span> <span id="s2760">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s2761">But, you know, they were half and half, so it’s very hard to say.</span> <span id="s2762">So my father was the most people, because he had -- my -- my g -- grandfather died before.</span> <span id="s2763">My grandm-mother died before him on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s2764">My mother got out, my aunt in France got out, my aunt in England got out.</span> <span id="s2765">It’s only the sister that insisted, oh, they’re not going to touch us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">Q: One of the sisters stayed with your grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">A: Yeah, that’s the youngest one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">Q: And did she get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Q: She got out, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">A: -- in ’39 she got out to England, it only cost everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">A: The house, the store, every kind of last nickel that she had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">Q: When you met up with your parents after you -- I know you were very sick at the end of the war, you had amoebic dysentery, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q: And you came back to be with your parents and you were still quite ill.</span> <span id="s2777">Did you -- did your parents then know what had happened to other members of the family, by then, or not?</span> <span id="s2778">You don’t -- or you don’t know.</span> <span id="s2779">Maybe you were too sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">A: Well, I can tell you, the business of living and staying alive was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2781">Let me tell you how sick I was.</span> <span id="s2782">There was nothing to eat in France, so my mother went around, she was very good friends with the baker lady.</span> <span id="s2783">She went over to the baker lady, trying v -- v -- everybody was on ration, I mean the French, everybody, so -- trying to get a slice of bread for me or something like that.</span> <span id="s2784">Now, couldn’t get a slice of bread, couldn’t get nothing.</span> <span id="s2785">Vegetables, yes.</span> <span id="s2786">There were vegetables, you could get some eggs, chicken once in a blue moon, but no meat.</span> <span id="s2787">Once in a blue moon you got a -- a -- on your ration cards you got like a pound of meat for the month, or something like that.</span> <span id="s2788">Maybe.</span> <span id="s2789">Not sure yet.</span> <span id="s2790">I rem -- I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2791">I know one [indecipherable] was over, you know.</span> <span id="s2792">Or anyway.</span> <span id="s2793">So she’s sitting there with the baker lady, goes to show you what shape I was in, says, Monsieur Claude -- and my name was Claude in France, not Kurt.</span> <span id="s2794">Kurt and the French and the Germans, so Claude was a little safer.</span> <span id="s2795">Ah, Monsieur Claude is such a nice young man.</span> <span id="s2796">What a shame he has to die.</span> <span id="s2797">That’s the shape I was in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">A: See, the farmers, this was a farm community, are far more at ease with life and death than city people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">A: All right, we’re not talking now, but you know, in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">Q: So how long were you sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">A: God almighty.</span> <span id="s2804">I’d sa -- I got back to North Africa from Germany, must have been June 1945.</span> <span id="s2805">I must -- must have taken -- yeah, that was the second time I had maybe dysentery when we left for France, you know, for the invasion.</span> <span id="s2806">But that was the first time and that was quite -- quite a long time, and the -- when I went back to France and I got some decent food, at midnight I used to go over to the farm ladies and says, could you maybe bake me a little apple pie or something?</span> <span id="s2807">So they did and I took care of myself, all right?</span> <span id="s2808">I mean, the Americans supplied us too, but you know, k-rations and such, it’s not -- you know.</span> <span id="s2809">But anyway, so I beat it eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: The second time, being that I had still the germ in me, obviously, it took two weeks before I was flat on my back again.</span> <span id="s2812">But being a soldier you have no choice.</span> <span id="s2813">The Foreign Legion is not too much into people.</span> <span id="s2814">The Foreign Legion is much more into equipment.</span> <span id="s2815">They would sacrifice 20 men to save a truck, easy, no problem.</span> <span id="s2816">Oh, we’ll get 20 more tomorrow, no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">Q: When you went back to s -- when you went f --</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">A: So anyway, just to answer the question --</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">Q: Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">A: -- from July, all the way to the end of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">Q: That’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">A: Augu -- July, August, September, October, November, five months.</span> <span id="s2823">And I looked it, I have pictures to prove it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">Q: Did your parents think you were alive?</span> <span id="s2825">Did they -- did they have any idea where you were?</span> <span id="s2826">So when -- how did -- did you write to them first, or did you just walk up to the door, sick as you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">A: But at that time -- at that time, from North Africa, which was French, I was able to communicate with my aunt and uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">A: I really didn’t know at that time where my --</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">Q: Where your parents were, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">A: -- parents were, but my aunt and uncle, or my aunt at least, was in touch with my parents, so henceforth they knew I was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">A: But for quite a few years my parents didn’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">A: -- where I was, or whether I was alive, you know, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2837">And where were your parents when you finally saw them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">A: In Castelnot Rivierbas, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">Q: They -- oh, they went there again, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">A: Well, I don’t know what -- well, that’s the place that they knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">A: -- and they were well known there, and by that time they must have had some remorse, you know, the police department and they treated them rather well, you -- if you know what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">Q: Did you and your brother go to Grenoble?</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">A: Yeah, my brother, from Castelnot -- I stayed a long time, I wasn’t well, I couldn’t walk let’s say from that end to that end.</span> <span id="s2847">I mean, I couldn’t, I was so weak.</span> <span id="s2848">Anyway, my father got the doctor.</span> <span id="s2849">We had one doctor in the village, and he was very good diagnostician, and he prescribed little ampules.</span> <span id="s2850">You know what ampules are?</span> <span id="s2851">Glass vials and they’re filled with cultures.</span> <span id="s2852">So my father t-take the train to the big city, have the prescription filled, come back with the prescription and then I a -- I drank this twice a day in some water.</span> <span id="s2853">And eventually -- the doctor had it right on the money, slowly, slowly, slowly.</span> <span id="s2854">But the strength was slow in coming because there was no food for me --</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">A: -- to get strong on, or with.</span> <span id="s2857">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">Q: So Harry goes first?</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">A: Harry knew that in Castelnot there’s only farm work, that’s no future.</span> <span id="s2860">So Grenoble was a wonderful college city -- university city actually, and in the house actually, little bit, you know.</span> <span id="s2861">Very pretty, beautiful buildings.</span> <span id="s2862">And he start -- he found a job there.</span> <span id="s2863">And then, when I was strong enough, well, I couldn’t stay in Castelnot, again there was nothing there for me, so I went, and we both lived in the same sm-small room, furnished room that I had rented, and in the small, itsy-bitsy s -- bed with the sagging mattress until I started working and made a living and could afford my own furnished room, in the same place, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2865">Now I understand that your parents and Harry left for the United States in 1947?</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: And why did they come to the United States if things were starting to go okay in France, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: What my father going to do at that age?</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">Q: He was over 60.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">A: He can’t -- he can’t make -- he can’t make a -- in France he can’t make the living, you -- it’s not like the United States, you come, you apply for a job, if the guy likes you, you get it.</span> <span id="s2871">Uh-uh.</span> <span id="s2872">Over there the papers, you gotta see.</span> <span id="s2873">I got papers that you wouldn -- you wouldn’t believe what it takes in France to get a job, you know?</span> <span id="s2874">So my aunt from Germany, the single one that stayed with my grandfather, got to England, was in the United States and had married an American fellow, I think, and he had an extended family, wonderful people, and they put up the bail for me to come to the United States and for my parents.</span> <span id="s2875">You know how much you have to put up for me when I came a year later?</span> <span id="s2876">10,000 dollars so I would -- shouldn’t fall, you know, th-that the state would have to take care of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">A: That’s when you immigrate illegally -- or emigrate.</span> <span id="s2879">That’s the difference between then and now.</span> <span id="s2880">And not only that, had to go to the embassy in Paris and the doctor screened me like I was a -- a Michelangelo there.</span> <span id="s2881">You know, checked me for being defect free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">Q: Did you want to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">A: I was doing very well in France, I had a marvelous job.</span> <span id="s2888">Had a lot of respect, had 25 people working for me.</span> <span id="s2889">Imagine, I was a big 24 - 25 years old at the time.</span> <span id="s2890">And -- and t -- they treated me wonderful.</span> <span id="s2891">The only thing is that my parents and my brothers used to hound me with letters.</span> <span id="s2892">How can you stay there, you’re all alone, you’re all single, whatev -- first of all, I wasn’t all alone.</span> <span id="s2893">Number two, I had my aunt and my uncle in Vichys that I used to go and visit every once in awhile, my second set of parents, you know?</span> <span id="s2894">And I had a girlfriend that took real good care of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">Q: So why --</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">A: So what the problem, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">Q: So why did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s2898">A: They kept on hounding me to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">A: You can’t stay there, da da da.</span> <span id="s2901">I came over here -- of course, it was an experience, an eye-opener, because the United States, even though it was originally populated by white people from Europe, is so different from Europe, like night and day.</span> <span id="s2902">There’s no -- there’s not even -- you can’t even compare.</span> <span id="s2903">The closest you could conceivably come to compare one with the other is Germany and the United States.</span> <span id="s2904">But even that is really a stretch.</span> <span id="s2905">The attitude, the mentality, the -- it’s totally different here.</span> <span id="s2906">Look, I want to just explains to you how -- let’s forget Hitler which was the worst thing in the world.</span> <span id="s2907">Happened to the world, not just the Jews.</span> <span id="s2908">Germany had social security under Bismarck, we’re going back to the 19th century, okay, okay?</span> <span id="s2909">They were pretty advanced, right?</span> <span id="s2910">You work in France [indecipherable] twice, doesn’t matter who your boss is, you can change jobs five times a year.</span> <span id="s2911">As long as you work a four months, you get credit for that four months.</span> <span id="s2912">For every month you work -- I’m going back to 1948 -- ’46 -- ’47, you get one and a half days vacation, right?</span> <span id="s2913">Which means 18 days a year, working days.</span> <span id="s2914">Plus a bonus, not your salary, but a little extra, so you should actually be able to enjoy a vacation.</span> <span id="s2915">I think that’s very progressive.</span> <span id="s2916">You’re not at the mercy of a boss.</span> <span id="s2917">This is state mandated.</span> <span id="s2918">You retire at the ripe old age of 60 with 80 percent of your earning.</span> <span id="s2919">Over here you get Social Security, if you make 20 percent you’re doing real good.</span> <span id="s2920">You -- you -- you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s2921">So there -- there are differences, and these are the large difference that you don’t even know when you come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">Q: But did you like it when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2925">Do you like it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">A: Oh, I -- I -- let me put it to you this way.</span> <span id="s2927">I just loved and admired the United States okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: Now, the way that things were set up and the way I was abused at the beginning, work-wise, I wasn’t exactly my cup of tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">A: See, the first job that I had, took a long time to find, the minute they found out I was not an American citizen, they cut my salary, that’s for openers.</span> <span id="s2932">Then they cheated me out of overtime, until I found out and of course, as much as my English wasn’t as fluent as it is now, I eventually got my overtime.</span> <span id="s2933">But that’s the attitude -- you know, how can you -- in France I never had to ask for a raise.</span> <span id="s2934">They came around to ask the supervisor, foreman, management, whatever, and says, who do you have that merits raise this month?</span> <span id="s2935">You never had to ask for a raise, if you were worth it.</span> <span id="s2936">And we’re working on merit there, not on bullshit.</span> <span id="s2937">That’s the big difference.</span> <span id="s2938">So it takes a little while to get used to this.</span> <span id="s2939">No, the best thing that ever happened to me here was meeting my wife, and obviously I had the good sense and the perseverance to marry her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">Q: This is Barbara?</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">A: Beg pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">Q: What’s her name, Barbara?</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">A: Barbara.</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">A: I -- I mean, there’s one philosophy I always had.</span> <span id="s2946">Wherever you are, you marry a girl of this particular country, you know.</span> <span id="s2947">Like in France I had a French girlfriend.</span> <span id="s2948">In Germany, I had German girlfriends, you know.</span> <span id="s2949">So, no sh -- she was wonderful, it’s -- I miss her big time, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">A: -- I have to keep on -- my d -- my -- my daughter wants me to keep on living forever.</span> <span id="s2952">You know, my -- my -- my oldest daughter wants the house, you know, when she retires.</span> <span id="s2953">So I don’t know how long I can accommodate her.</span> <span id="s2954">See, as long as I’m self sufficient, it’s not much of a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">A: But I can see myself, I guess, in some of the people around here.</span> <span id="s2957">Especially, you go to doctors, I mean, I have to see doctors, whether I’m sick or not, I mean you have to go and see doctors, blah blabber of all stripes.</span> <span id="s2958">So you see people and you says, oh God almighty.</span> <span id="s2959">You know, they -- they’re really -- they’re really in a bad way, I mean, and they’re still clinging to life with everything they got.</span> <span id="s2960">I just don’t understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">Q: Tell me, when you look at the war years, do you think you missed out on a lot because of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2963">I never had a youth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">A: From the time I was 17 until I was -- well, okay, I had a girlfriend in France, I tried to catch up a little bit.</span> <span id="s2966">But for six years, forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">A: I mean, not only was I in horrible places, you know, see I -- we can’t discuss all the horrors in detail, we just have to gloss over the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2969">But when I think about all the things or places, whatever happened to me, and the only way that I was able to handle it is because I was young.</span> <span id="s2970">You have no concept of anything.</span> <span id="s2971">That’s why whoever you send to fight a war is a young person.</span> <span id="s2972">You don’t see 40 - 50 year old people going in the front line, getting themselves shot up.</span> <span id="s2973">You find 18 - 20 year old getting -- getting themselves killed.</span> <span id="s2974">So it’s the same thing with me.</span> <span id="s2975">I didn't know any better.</span> <span id="s2976">That’s the way it is, that’s the way it is.</span> <span id="s2977">But I felt bad when I had time to reflect, especially now, I says, gosh, I c -- I -- I couldn’t have survived six months under the conditions that I had to live.</span> <span id="s2978">I mean, we discussed a lot of things but we omitted an awful lot of horror shows, you know.</span> <span id="s2979">And that’s basically all I can say.</span> <span id="s2980">But of course my [indecipherable] see, the nice thing is when I married Barbara, I had a ready made family.</span> <span id="s2981">Her mother, her father, her brother, relatives, grandmother, you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s2982">So then I felt like I sort of like, belonged.</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">A: It’s important, that feeling.</span> <span id="s2985">You know, all by yourself you’re floundering around, I mean, okay you’re alive, you eat, you do this, you do that and whatnot.</span> <span id="s2986">But it’s not -- it’s the feeling -- belonging is very important to me, you know.</span> <span id="s2987">And so sh-she was just plain wonderful, you know.</span> <span id="s2988">Great.</span> <span id="s2989">On top of that, she was over nine years younger than me, which was a good thing in retrospect, because she died.</span> <span id="s2990">She was 70 or 71.</span> <span id="s2991">So think about it, you know?</span> <span id="s2992">If she wouldn’t have been younger, what -- what kind of a nightmare that would have -- and I could take care of her, wha -- you know, I took care of her all the rest of -- ever since the roof started caving in, you know?</span> <span id="s2993">She had the first open heart surgery in May of 1992, and the second one in December seventh, 19 -- yeah, 1993, in Houston by the biggest butcher known to mankind, Dr. Denton Cooley.</span> <span id="s2994">Wh-Why do I say that?</span> <span id="s2995">Because he works on an assembly line, he doesn’t take one patient at a time, he’s got five or six or seven scheduled for the day.</span> <span id="s2996">So, if he has to do a little more that he didn’t si -- foresee, that’s too bad for the patient, sew ‘em up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">Q: Is there anything that we haven’t talked about that you think we must talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">A: Do you remember anything that needs to be said?</span> <span id="s2999">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3000">I mean, I -- what I can talk about is I have the most wonderful daughters and grandchildren.</span> <span id="s3001">My two daughters, one is 49 and one is 44.</span> <span id="s3002">They haven’t given me, not as of late either, one minute of aggravation their whole lives.</span> <span id="s3003">Now, who has a parent can say something like that?</span> <span id="s3004">And I was a very straight father.</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">A: You know, what’s that, tough love?</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">Q: That’s what [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">A: Paid -- but the kids love me.</span> <span
