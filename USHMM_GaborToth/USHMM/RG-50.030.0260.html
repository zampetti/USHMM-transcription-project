It was an old, old street.</span> <span id="s30">And my father was a barber, men's barber.</span> <span id="s31">And ... he had his own barber shop in the middle of the town.</span> <span id="s32">He made a good living, pretty good living.</span> <span id="s33">He also he, my, he also played music.</span> <span id="s34">He played the violin, the trombone, all kinds.</span> <span id="s35">My father comes from a family of 10 children, and there were four boys and six daughters.</span> <span id="s36">All four boys, they were musicians.</span> <span id="s37">Beside that, they had also professions.</span> <span id="s38">One was a tailor; one was a watchmaker; my father's second profession was a barber.</span> <span id="s39">We made ... My father made a pretty good living.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Did you go to a public school or a Jewish school?</span> <span id="s41">Were you religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: We were not really religious, but we were a Jewish home, a Jewish kosher home.</span> <span id="s43">And I went to a regular -- it's not, excuse me.</span> <span id="s44">I started off with a public school but for one year.</span> <span id="s45">But then my grandma started to yell, "Oy vey!</span> <span id="s46">you know, she's not going to go.</span> <span id="s47">She has -- " So they put me in a Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s48">I started off with Yavneh for the first two, three years, I think, and then Tarbut, Hebrew Tarbut.</span> <span id="s49">In my house, they used to speak Hebrew, all three children, Yiddish, and Russian.</span> <span id="s50">Deutsch was Poland then, but they used to speak Russian.</span> <span id="s51">And I went to Hebrew Tarbut.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Did you have a lot of Jewish friends, non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">01:03:01</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: I had mostly Jewish friends because of my upbringing, also.</span> <span id="s55">Not that we were separate or whatever.</span> <span id="s56">My mother had non-Jewish -- the best girlfriend was non-Jewish ... next door to us.</span> <span id="s57">My father had a lot of non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s58">We had good neighbors, non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s59">But I remember having Jewish friends from, from the school, from the Hebrew Tarbut.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Now, were your parents or other people in your family involved in any political organizations any Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s62">They were not involved in any political organizations, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: What ... Tell me a little bit about what happened when the Germans invaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Well, in 1939, we were invaded by the Russians.</span> <span id="s65">Two years later, I think in the month of June, we were invaded by the Germans.</span> <span id="s66">And ... six months we stayed in our own house, and then they took us to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s67">They made a ghetto, which it was towards, towards some waters.</span> <span id="s68">It was like the center of the town and towards the waters.</span> <span id="s69">And we lived in a house.</span> <span id="s70">They gave us one room.</span> <span id="s71">Can I go one second before, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s73">And, actually, I wanted to hear a little bit about before the ghetto was formed.</span> <span id="s74">Your memories of when the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Well, the Germans came in, and my father, He, as I said before, he was a barber.</span> <span id="s76">He worked in the middle of the town in his own barber shop.</span> <span id="s77">So food, we had enough.</span> <span id="s78">He used to bring in from the peasants who -- those years, they didn't have those shaving things that you shave yourself and you threw it away.</span> <span id="s79">I mean, they had to come to a barber to take a shave, and to take a haircut.</span> <span id="s80">As a matter of fact, in the ghetto, the war in the ghetto, my father worked in his own barber shop for the Germans, because they needed him for this particular reasons.</span> <span id="s81">They couldn't shave themselves, I guess.</span> <span id="s82">They needed a barber.</span> <span id="s83">And after six months being in our own home, they told us that we’re going to the ghetto, and this is where the ghetto's going to be.</span> <span id="s84">Where there were two synagogues, so they took up the area of the synagogues and towards the water and they, they, segregated with barbed wire -- it was extremely tall barbed wires -- and a peasant next-door neighbor came.</span> <span id="s85">My father told him to and asked him to, and they came and they put us, whatever little belongings -- we took very little, and they put us in this wagon, we were six people, and I was walking.</span> <span id="s86">I didn't want to go on the wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">01:06:10 I remember when I left my house, I looked back and I cried my -- as little as I was, as young as I was, I knew I'll never come back.</span> <span id="s88">I cried my eyes out.</span> <span id="s89">And we went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s90">They gave us a room.</span> <span id="s91">I mean, one of my -- my father requested it, that they gave it to us just because he worked in this barber shop, and he knew a lot of German soldiers.</span> <span id="s92">So they gave us -- there were two families in this room, very small room.</span> <span id="s93">And we slept like two, three in a bed.</span> <span id="s94">We were six people, and there was another other two people, also a barber, but only two people.</span> <span id="s95">There was no family, they elderly people.</span> <span id="s96">And my mother never took me down to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s97">I never saw how the kitchen looked.</span> <span id="s98">There was one kitchen for about ... at least 20 families, 15 families.</span> <span id="s99">So I guess they didn't want children there just to take up the kitchen.</span> <span id="s100">And there was really nothing much to cook there, I guess.</span> <span id="s101">Whatever, as far as I could remember, whatever my father used to smuggle in through the gates, because in the morning he used to go to work, come back at night, as a barber.</span> <span id="s102">So he used to hide on him something, because you, you were not allowed to smuggle in any food.</span> <span id="s103">So he used to hide, let’s say a piece of fish or a piece of bread, or a piece of potato to smuggle in, they shouldn't see it on him.</span> <span id="s104">And this we lived on.</span> <span id="s105">And then I saw my mother was swollen.</span> <span id="s106">I said to my mother, I said, "Why are you so swollen?"</span> <span id="s107">She was only 36 years old.</span> <span id="s108">She said, "Nothing, nothing, nothing."</span> <span id="s109">But then I find out that what she did whatever food she had, she gave it to the kids, and she never ate.</span> <span id="s110">And she got swollen, and then she had also an olderly mother who lived with her older sister.</span> <span id="s111">And they had nothing because they couldn't go out of the ghetto to bring in any food.</span> <span id="s112">So they had to live on whatever they gave them in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s113">And the little kids died of hunger.</span> <span id="s114">There were little ones.</span> <span id="s115">And my grandma was dying, so she used to send me whatever she had to give it to grandma.</span> <span id="s116">Finally, she died a hunger.</span> <span id="s117">I came one day with the food, and I saw her laying against the house where they lived in, dead.</span> <span id="s118">I don't know how long she was laying there.</span> <span id="s119">There was -- they didn't give any funerals or something.</span> <span id="s120">They just took her away, I guess.</span> <span id="s121">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s122">I really don't remember.</span> <span id="s123">This is how we lived for six months.</span> <span id="s124">At least six -- between six and eight months, I think it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Did you have any activities, or did you just stay home?</span> <span id="s126">School?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">01:09:01</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: I -- there was -- I did not go to school.</span> <span id="s129">I went to -- I actually worked.</span> <span id="s130">They used to send me, they used to send my mother, actually.</span> <span id="s131">But my mother was a pretty woman, and one German was after her.</span> <span id="s132">So instead of her, I went to work.</span> <span id="s133">What was my work?</span> <span id="s134">My work was to dig graves for other people, so they used to pick us up like ... half a day, like 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock, and bring us back like in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s135">And we used to dig those long, long, long ditches.</span> <span id="s136">Long, long, long -- I didn't know what it, what it was for what.</span> <span id="s137">This was night after night and mother was home with the younger kids and with my grandma and this was my job.</span> <span id="s138">But as far as I hear, there was no schools but they did -- it was some kind of a little activity there.</span> <span id="s139">There was little activities there, but I really don't know what it was because I never went.</span> <span id="s140">In my girlfriend's book, she, she knows more details.</span> <span id="s141">But it was something -- she had an older sister.</span> <span id="s142">But I think that it was -- life was going on.</span> <span id="s143">There people were in love.</span> <span id="s144">Some of even got married, I've heard, later on.</span> <span id="s145">Like just a huppa, you know, or something and some kind of a life, but people were dying of hunger.</span> <span id="s146">In six months, eight months, people were dying of hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Do you remember seeing people sick on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: My grandma.</span> <span id="s149">My grandma.</span> <span id="s150">Later on I saw, but not at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: And you didn't know what you were digging?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Was this on the outside of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Outside of different towns, not our town.</span> <span id="s155">What they did, the Germans, they used to send from those towns to dig our graves.</span> <span id="s156">And from my home town, we dug different, from different towns the graves.</span> <span id="s157">And that's what I used to do, until, until one point.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Were you aware of the governing structure in the ghetto, the Jewish Council and all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s160">Not much, though.</span> <span id="s161">There was a committee.</span> <span id="s162">I have all the names written down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s164">But if you can just tell me as much as you remember.</span> <span id="s165">You don't have to name names, but ...</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yes, yes there was a committee, and they were really in charge.</span> <span id="s167">If -- let's say, they took count of the people.</span> <span id="s168">If one person would be missing, the Germans said they're going to take the whole family and other families, and they're going to be killed in front of everybody.</span> <span id="s169">They knew that there are Russian partisans or underground in other areas.</span> <span id="s170">If one young man were ... be missing and take off, the committee has to deliver a certain amount of people to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">01:12:04 So, of course, this didn't happen because, they were afraid that instead of one -- the truth was that really people didn't believe that they gonna do it.</span> <span id="s172">That they gonna kill us like that.</span> <span id="s173">Something's gonna happen.</span> <span id="s174">Something's is gonna give.</span> <span id="s175">Something will change.</span> <span id="s176">Because nobody really saw, and nobody -- you couldn't travel.</span> <span id="s177">You couldn't go from one town to the other to find out what happened to the other people in the other town.</span> <span id="s178">They didn't let anybody out, and people were afraid to -- I'm sure that young people would’ve taken off, going into the woods.</span> <span id="s179">But he was afraid that if he's going to take off, they're going to kill all his family.</span> <span id="s180">They were family oriented people, whole mishpachus, like sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s181">Married with children, grandchildren.</span> <span id="s182">And just because if I'll run away, they're going to kill my whole family.</span> <span id="s183">Who would have known that they're going to be killed anyway?</span> <span id="s184">And that's exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s185">They were killed anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: So people really weren't taking off?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: No.</span> <span id="s188">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: And did the Jewish Council have to give names?</span> <span id="s190">Did they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s192">They would of.</span> <span id="s193">They, they would of otherwise would have been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Were there any selections or roundups or anything before the uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Not by us, no.</span> <span id="s196">Not by us.</span> <span id="s197">Not in our ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Do you remember any resistance activities in your ghetto?</span> <span id="s199">I mean, was there an underground, or ...</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: They was some kind of a connection, but very -- they knew that there’s some place underground.</span> <span id="s201">But nobody left; they were afraid to leave.</span> <span id="s202">Nobody left.</span> <span id="s203">Not until the ... uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: But was there organizing going on in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Yes, there were organizing going on, yes.</span> <span id="s206">Among the men and young boys, young men.</span> <span id="s207">Let's say, the younger generation, the younger people.</span> <span id="s208">They knew that the older ones couldn't make it, and the very young ones couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s209">But they made up among themselves if they're gonna come and take us to kill, to kill us, they will make a revolt.</span> <span id="s210">We had, they had no guns, just with hammers and hacksaws and all kinds a sticks and ... This, they were prepared, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: And do you think that the Jewish Council was involved in the organizing with the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s213">They were.</span> <span id="s214">But everything was, of course, in a quiet way.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Did you know people involved with the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: No.</span> <span id="s217">I knew the people who was -- they were on the committee in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s218">I have all the names written down.</span> <span id="s219">I have all the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">01:15:02</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Were any of those friends of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Friends of my father, yes.</span> <span id="s223">They were my father's age, in their 30s.</span> <span id="s224">My father was ... what?</span> <span id="s225">38, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: The reason I'm asking this is, I mean, you know that in other ghettos sometimes the Jewish Councils were not so -- I mean, they had to do their jobs, and they weren't -- they often followed the German orders.</span> <span id="s227">They weren't as sympathetic to an underground activity because they were afraid, I guess, for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes, it's true.</span> <span id="s229">But luckily in our ghetto, they did not ask for a certain amount of people to give them out to kill.</span> <span id="s230">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s231">So they really didn't have to do this, this job.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: So why don't you tell me a little bit about your memories of the uprising, how this all came about?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s234">I came in the middle of the night from my work.</span> <span id="s235">This ghetto was already surrounded by trucks, ammunition, guns.</span> <span id="s236">There were soldiers all around the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: German soldiers.</span> <span id="s239">There were already Polish people, peasants, they were already standing there looking into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s240">But mostly trucks and trucks with, with all kinds of ammunition on the trucks.</span> <span id="s241">When we came in, I knew right away.</span> <span id="s242">I mean, you didn't have to ask questions.</span> <span id="s243">So nobody said a word to each other.</span> <span id="s244">We had two ghettos and there's a street separating us.</span> <span id="s245">And that there was one ghetto, I was in the second ghetto.</span> <span id="s246">The young people, they were accumulating themselves, mostly men, in the first ghetto in case they're going to start taking us on trucks to kill.</span> <span id="s247">They gonna to try to break the gates and see how much, how many people could be saved, run.</span> <span id="s248">Saved.</span> <span id="s249">You can't save your child, you just run.</span> <span id="s250">Whatever will happen will happen.</span> <span id="s251">So we knew.</span> <span id="s252">I came into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s253">Nobody was sleeping anymore.</span> <span id="s254">My mother was waiting for me.</span> <span id="s255">My father and my brother wasn't there anymore.</span> <span id="s256">I asked them where they are, and my mother said to me "They are in the other ghetto getting organized.</span> <span id="s257">Maybe they'll be able to run."</span> <span id="s258">And everybody was already crying and yelling, "Shema Israel," and crying.</span> <span id="s259">I couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s260">Like you saw in "Schindler's List," this little girl who was hiding in the toilet, I went -- the toilets were, let's say, outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s261">Little ... It's like a -- it's like a little, you know, a little boot standing on the ground.</span> <span id="s262">And, you know, you made there and you walked out.</span> <span id="s263">I went there -- to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">01:18:03 I sat down; I closed my ears, and I was, it was quiet there.</span> <span id="s265">I was sitting there for a while, and I said ... I can’t -- somebody else came in, and I had to get out.</span> <span id="s266">And I had no place to go.</span> <span id="s267">I was sitting there maybe ... more than a half an hour.</span> <span id="s268">I just for some reason I couldn't hear the people crying and screaming.</span> <span id="s269">I went back to bed.</span> <span id="s270">I came into the room.</span> <span id="s271">Everybody was, for some reason, dressed.</span> <span id="s272">And my mother and I hide ... I hide under the covers.</span> <span id="s273">And I closed my ears, and I was laying there -- over my head not to listen to this yelling and screaming and crying.</span> <span id="s274">All of a sudden, my mother said to me "Feigele, come out of there."</span> <span id="s275">I said, "What's the matter, Ma?</span> <span id="s276">Are we gonna get killed?"</span> <span id="s277">He says, "We gonna get killed, but not you."</span> <span id="s278">I said, "Ma, why me?"</span> <span id="s279">She said, "Don't ask questions.</span> <span id="s280">Here, put this on."</span> <span id="s281">She put in one of her red little rubies she had from her ring, she put it in there, and she said, "You go to the second ghetto.</span> <span id="s282">I don't know what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s283">You might get killed there, too," she said, "but people are going to try and run from there.</span> <span id="s284">They're going to rip the gate.</span> <span id="s285">This is what they made up, so you go there."</span> <span id="s286">I didn't ask any questions.</span> <span id="s287">I got dressed.</span> <span id="s288">My sister ran after me, and I said, she said, "Feigele, I want to go with you."</span> <span id="s289">This is the first time I'm telling this.</span> <span id="s290">I never mentioned this to nobody.</span> <span id="s291">I just -- maybe I was cruel.</span> <span id="s292">I don't know.</span> <span id="s293">I said to my sister, "Where are you going to go?</span> <span id="s294">You're just a little girl.</span> <span id="s295">You -- you can't run."</span> <span id="s296">So she stayed here; I still see her standing there.</span> <span id="s297">And I tried to, and I ran.</span> <span id="s298">I ran, I saw other people standing there.</span> <span id="s299">I tried to open the gate.</span> <span id="s300">The gate was closed already, locked.</span> <span id="s301">You couldn't go through anymore.</span> <span id="s302">I started to yell; theylet me out from this gate.</span> <span id="s303">So there was this street in the middle, and outer gate was locked.</span> <span id="s304">I came there, and I said -- I went across the street and I start banging, and they wouldn't let me through.</span> <span id="s305">They said, "Too late."</span> <span id="s306">All of a sudden, I see -- I hear shooting.</span> <span id="s307">I see fire.</span> <span id="s308">I see the buildings are burning.</span> <span id="s309">The other ghetto, not this ghetto where I lived.</span> <span id="s310">So I guess the Germans thought well, she gonna die anyway.</span> <span id="s311">Why -- let her in, this kid, you know.</span> <span id="s312">So they opened the gate, and they did let me -- I was the last one to cross the gate from one ghetto to the other.</span> <span id="s313">I came in, it was -- I ran in there.</span> <span id="s314">It was really chaos.</span> <span id="s315">Everything was burning.</span> <span id="s316">Everything was shooting on everybody.</span> <span id="s317">I didn't know if the gate was ripped or not.</span> <span id="s318">I saw the Rabbi and I saw my aunt and this girl here, my first cousin, standing on the porch of a building, and the Rabbi was wrapped in a tallis with hands up crying, "Shema Israel."</span> <span id="s319">The house was on fire.</span> <span id="s320">Every building was on fire, and people were just falling right in front of me.</span> <span id="s321">Just like flies, shooting, blood all over the place.</span> <span id="s322">I ... All of a sudden, people are running in this direction towards the gate.</span> <span id="s323">And I'm running, and they are running and I'm running.</span> <span id="s324">And people are just falling in front of me.</span> <span id="s325">I step over.</span> <span id="s326">I don't know if they were alive or dead, or just falling full of blood.</span> <span id="s327">I didn't look.</span> <span id="s328">I was running.</span> <span id="s329">All of a sudden, something hit me, and I fell.</span> <span id="s330">I fell on two people, and there were people on both sides of me.</span> <span id="s331">I see blood all over me.</span> <span id="s332">I touched myself.</span> <span id="s333">I said, "I'm alive.</span> <span id="s334">Get up.</span> <span id="s335">I'm alive.</span> <span id="s336">Run."</span> <span id="s337">I got up, and I ran.</span> <span id="s338">I ran over people, not over the ground, over people.</span> <span id="s339">The ghetto, I think, was about 2,600 and 800 people there, and whoever was still a little bit alive, they ran and I was running.</span> <span id="s340">We ran to the main, to the main, to the main place where, you know, how you call it?</span> <span id="s341">A mark.</span> <span id="s342">The mark, they used to call it.</span> <span id="s343">A mark.</span> <span id="s344">People used to get together there for business, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: At the square?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: At the square, right.</span> <span id="s347">Small square.</span> <span id="s348">And I went through my house.</span> <span id="s349">I went through my house with the garden, and I couldn't run anymore.</span> <span id="s350">I was -- I saw the house, and blood was coming over me.</span> <span id="s351">I still didn't know what happened to me, and we came to a place by the name of Pripet.</span> <span id="s352">It was water there.</span> <span id="s353">And the Germans were still chasing us, I guess.</span> <span id="s354">When I looked back, and I saw the whole town was on fire already.</span> <span id="s355">And we came to that place, Pripet, and Zina, my girlfriend, met me there.</span> <span id="s356">She was also running with her brother, I think.</span> <span id="s357">A father and sister, she left behind.</span> <span id="s358">Her sister, I think, got killed while she running, so was my brother.</span> <span id="s359">And she saw me, she says to me "Feigele," she said, "look at you.</span> <span id="s360">You're all ripped to pieces."</span> <span id="s361">My whole back was ripped.</span> <span id="s362">My shoulder was ripped.</span> <span id="s363">She said, "Well, whatever will be will be."</span> <span id="s364">If I'll live, I live.</span> <span id="s365">If I’ll die, I’ll die.</span> <span id="s366">She said, "Your father's not with you?"</span> <span id="s367">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s368">She said, "He was in the other ghetto where everybody was running.</span> <span id="s369">Maybe he was there."</span> <span id="s370">I said, "I didn't see him anymore."</span></p> <p><span id="s371">01:24:04 I just didn't see anybody anymore.</span> <span id="s372">So she took off her shirt from her back.</span> <span id="s373">She ripped it in pieces and she bandaged me.</span> <span id="s374">And we were sitting on that Pripet.</span> <span id="s375">Unfortunately, there were also a lot of grownup men, but they didn't want me.</span> <span id="s376">They said to me "Go home."</span> <span id="s377">I said, "Where am I going to go home?</span> <span id="s378">Where's my home?</span> <span id="s379">Look at my home.</span> <span id="s380">It's burning on fire.</span> <span id="s381">I'm sure that everybody's dead by now."</span> <span id="s382">They were putting on trucks and taking those people to the graves.</span> <span id="s383">They put ‘em all around, shoot them out, throw ‘em in the graves, put some -- I guess something on top.</span> <span id="s384">And then again and again, until they killed everybody.</span> <span id="s385">This was a Thursday at 11 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s386">Einun Tzvansig Togen Elul in Jewish; I have it written down.</span> <span id="s387">This was exactly to the moment because I was there.</span> <span id="s388">And then I met some other girls, some other children that, unfortunately, the grownups left them behind.</span> <span id="s389">They didn't want them to run after them.</span> <span id="s390">I was skinny, I was sick, I was swollen.</span> <span id="s391">When I was running, I lost my shoes, and this was like September, I think.</span> <span id="s392">It must have been September just before Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s393">And that time, they take off -- the peasant, they take off the weeds.</span> <span id="s394">You know, they cut the weeds.</span> <span id="s395">And it's very, very -- it's like the little things of thread is like needles.</span> <span id="s396">And they go into your bare feet.</span> <span id="s397">So my feet were swollen and ripped in pieces because I was barefoot.</span> <span id="s398">I lost my shoes while I was running.</span> <span id="s399">And then the grownup people, I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s400">They really tried to leave the kids behind.</span> <span id="s401">Whether they were wounded or not wounded, whatever it was, they really tried to leave us behind.</span> <span id="s402">And ... that was me, two girls who live in Israel now, Zina, my girlfriend; the two sisters from Romanowsky, Evelyn and Genia Romanowsky; and her father, one man.</span> <span id="s403">And I got close to them.</span> <span id="s404">He was kind of a relative, a distant relative of my mother.</span> <span id="s405">I don't know how, my mother's maiden name is Ravitz, and his name is Ravitz, so I said, "I'm a relative of yours.</span> <span id="s406">Let me stick to you."</span> <span id="s407">And he had two of his own kids there, and he just had pity over all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Where were all the other people who were running at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: In different directions.</span> <span id="s410">They ran in different directions.</span> <span id="s411">Most of them ran to the Pripet.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">01:27:00 But they were grownup people, and maybe they did business with the peasants and they knew who -- where to go and who to run.</span> <span id="s413">And we remained there; I don't know what happened to the -- yeah, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s414">We -- let's say, we had some grownup people, so I was kind of close to them.</span> <span id="s415">And the night came on, and we all tried to sleep under a big, big stack of hay.</span> <span id="s416">And I knew if I'm gonna fall asleep, they're going to leave me there.</span> <span id="s417">Here I was wounded and sick and hungry, of course, for the whole day.</span> <span id="s418">So we used to put our hands into the mud, take up a little water with my hand.</span> <span id="s419">Make my mouth wet and just sit there.</span> <span id="s420">There's no place to go.</span> <span id="s421">I woke up -- and I fell asleep under the stack of hay.</span> <span id="s422">There's nobody there.</span> <span id="s423">I'm all by myself.</span> <span id="s424">There's no place to go.</span> <span id="s425">There's woods, mud, and darkness.</span> <span id="s426">All of a sudden, I heard some talking, but I didn't know if it was Jewish or German.</span> <span id="s427">So I followed from where the sound came, and I found some of my people.</span> <span id="s428">And ... they were not happy to see me.</span> <span id="s429">They were not happy to see me.</span> <span id="s430">They still kept on saying, "Go to your parents.</span> <span id="s431">Go home," unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: They left their families behind.</span> <span id="s434">I was a sick, young child, wounded.</span> <span id="s435">They were afraid that I wouldn't be able to run with them, to keep up with them.</span> <span id="s436">And sooner or later, they will have to let me either die there in the mud and I'll tell them that there are more Jewish people around here, whatever.</span> <span id="s437">I don't know.</span> <span id="s438">People came, people became like animals.</span> <span id="s439">They were looking out for themselves.</span> <span id="s440">They had nothing to account for.</span> <span id="s441">They had no life, no future.</span> <span id="s442">They didn't know where they were going.</span> <span id="s443">Maybe they've heard that older people knew that someplace in this direction there must be some underground going on.</span> <span id="s444">So maybe they tried to follow there.</span> <span id="s445">I didn't know where to go, I had to follow them.</span> <span id="s446">I had to run after them.</span> <span id="s447">Then there was no food.</span> <span id="s448">There was absolutely no food.</span> <span id="s449">You looked at the berries, and you ate some berries.</span> <span id="s450">A lot of them were not poison berries, so -- or -- and the water from the mud.</span> <span id="s451">So this was the first night.</span> <span id="s452">They left me twice.</span> <span id="s453">The second night, too.</span> <span id="s454">They left me again the second night, and a few other kids; they left me.</span> <span id="s455">And this was about two, three days later when I found the Romanowsky, two sisters and the father.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Did you just find them by chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: By coincidence.</span> <span id="s458">Just by walking, just walking.</span> <span id="s459">And I just found them there, and there were some other few kids.</span> <span id="s460">She was there, Zina was there.</span> <span id="s461">Two girls in Israel.</span> <span id="s462">The must have been seven or nine children there, including his two daughters.</span> <span id="s463">And there was -- I've seen cruelties on this Pripet.</span> <span id="s464">There was a father who left his little son there to die.</span> <span id="s465">There was a mother who left her little son there to die.</span> <span id="s466">I saw it.</span> <span id="s467">I saw the Rabbi's little boy wandering a daze; he had no place to go.</span> <span id="s468">He was wounded.</span> <span id="s469">He died there right in front of me.</span> <span id="s470">I'll never forget his face.</span> <span id="s471">I had to leave him and go on.</span> <span id="s472">I was a wounded little ship myself.</span> <span id="s473">A lot of people left there on the Pripet.</span> <span id="s474">They run away from the ghetto and they were wounded like I was, and they died on this, on this Pripet.</span> <span id="s475">They just died.</span> <span id="s476">They had no place to go.</span> <span id="s477">They died from hunger.</span> <span id="s478">It was cold already, very cold at night.</span> <span id="s479">There was sitting -- all nine of us -- there was still another woman there with a little boy.</span> <span id="s480">And we saw the Germans walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">01:31:15 They came with dogs for us.</span> <span id="s482">They knew that the people ran there to this place, so they came to look for us the second day and I saw the boots.</span> <span id="s483">How in the world he didn't see us is beyond me.</span> <span id="s484">Just a miracle that God picked us to live and to tell this story.</span> <span id="s485">This is my reason, I think, that God said somebody has to live to tell this story later on, it shouldn't happen again.</span> <span id="s486">Because I saw them, I saw the dogs.</span> <span id="s487">Why wouldn't the dogs smell us?</span> <span id="s488">I saw the boots of the, of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Right near you?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Right near me.</span> <span id="s491">We were nine kids and a mother and this father, the Romanowsky father.</span> <span id="s492">And they didn't see us, the dogs didn't smell us.</span> <span id="s493">And I was wounded and this woman, unfortunately, when they left, she said to me "You moved."</span> <span id="s494">I said, "I didn't move.</span> <span id="s495">If I would of moved, they would of seen me."</span> <span id="s496">She took a stick and she beat me up, a Jewish mother who had her own child there.</span> <span id="s497">(Nods her head).</span> <span id="s498">Anyway, we were there for about seven days, I think.</span> <span id="s499">How did we survive?</span> <span id="s500">This man, Romanowsky, knew more -- he was a rich guy in my home town -- he knew where a peasant lives.</span> <span id="s501">He went there and he said to him "You know what?"</span> <span id="s502">He said, "If you gonna bring us little food every day, take us over the river.</span> <span id="s503">Over the river, they are partisans there.</span> <span id="s504">They are underground people.</span> <span id="s505">Maybe they'll protect us.</span> <span id="s506">I'll tell you where the gold is in my house, hidden.</span> <span id="s507">You could go after the war and pick up the gold."</span> <span id="s508">This man brought us every little day a little -- a small fish for everybody, for each of us.</span> <span id="s509">Or maybe a small piece of bread every single day until he took us over the Pripet.</span> <span id="s510">We survived the seven days or nine days, I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s511">I drank the water from the mud.</span> <span id="s512">Cold at night.</span> <span id="s513">Lice, full of lice.</span> <span id="s514">Full of lice.</span> <span id="s515">Our hands couldn't come out of my hair and I had a lot of hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Was there lice from the ghetto, or from ...</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: This was laying there.</span> <span id="s518">We probably brought from the ghetto the lice already.</span> <span id="s519">But laying there, there was more lice, you know.</span> <span id="s520">And he took us over the Pripet in a small, little -- it's not a boat.</span> <span id="s521">A small, little, like a kayak, the size of a kayak probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">01:34:06 And as small, as young as the kids were, they were smart.</span> <span id="s523">They left this man, the last man in case he decided to take off with his two daughters and leave us behind, so we made sure that he stayed the very last with his daughter.</span> <span id="s524">And only one or two people could fit into this kayak and take us over the water.</span> <span id="s525">That fear I'll never forget, that they gonna leave us behind.</span> <span id="s526">They gonna leave us behind to die, but this man was a nice man.</span> <span id="s527">Unfortunately, he died too young.</span> <span id="s528">He was sick too young, and he didn't deserve to die that young -- in this country.</span> <span id="s529">And they took us over the Pripet, and we were really under his wings, and then we were on our own.</span> <span id="s530">So this guy, the Russian peasant, he took off, and we were left there just like that.</span> <span id="s531">So, what?</span> <span id="s532">How did we survive?</span> <span id="s533">We walked like somebody said towards the underground people.</span> <span id="s534">The underground was someplace in this area, let's say.</span> <span id="s535">So this, we followed this man, his name is Romanowsky; we followed him.</span> <span id="s536">We had no other way.</span> <span id="s537">There was that woman, too, but she didn't know nothing, with this little boy.</span> <span id="s538">We used to -- at night, you see, the peasants they go to for their harvest early in the morning, like 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning when it's still dark outside.</span> <span id="s539">So we used to sneak into the house, grab a piece of bread because homes were open, or a pancake or whatever we grab our hands on.</span> <span id="s540">You know, whatever we could touch.</span> <span id="s541">Some people gave us to eat, we -- if you came in, let's say, and they knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s542">I had black hair and they knew it was a Jewish group of kids, dark, dirty.</span> <span id="s543">Didn't wash themselves for a few weeks, full of lice.</span> <span id="s544">They didn't even let us into the house.</span> <span id="s545">They said, "Okay, here, my child."</span> <span id="s546">Here -- They felt sorry for us.</span> <span id="s547">"Here, my child, here's a piece of bread, but go, go, go."</span> <span id="s548">Because if somebody would squeal on them, they would have been killed.</span> <span id="s549">They would’ve been dead.</span> <span id="s550">And this was going on for a few weeks like that.</span> <span id="s551">We used to either crawl in, sneak into a house, and steal a piece of bread -- or it was also in the gardens, they had like raw potatoes, raw beets, raw corn.</span> <span id="s552">So we used to steal these from the garden and have a raw potato, eat a raw potato.</span> <span id="s553">But you couldn't make a fire, you couldn't let anybody know where we are or whatever.</span> <span id="s554">Even not even the peasants, because they would have given us out.</span> <span id="s555">Or ... The beets, the taste of the beets, raw beets day after day, I'll never lose the taste in my mouth.</span> <span id="s556">This is the most horrible, horrible thing.</span> <span id="s557">Potatoes, I thought I'll never have a raw potato in my life.</span> <span id="s558">Now, I love potatoes, I love potatoes.</span> <span id="s559">And this was going on for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s560">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s561">01:37:17</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Let me just ask you a question.</span> <span id="s563">Do you remember any really striking experiences with the Russian peasants that either they were really terrible to you or really tried to help you significantly?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Some of them -- not significantly, no.</span> <span id="s565">They used to give us food.</span> <span id="s566">They gave us food.</span> <span id="s567">And they just "Go, go."</span> <span id="s568">They didn't want us near them because the truth was that they would’ve been killed.</span> <span id="s569">If a German would have found out that this peasant gave me a piece of bread, he would have shot him immediately.</span> <span id="s570">So they really were afraid unless like that guy who gave us to eat on the Pripet that he knew that he's going to find a whole pot of gold someplace.</span> <span id="s571">The truth was he was killed after the war.</span> <span id="s572">Somebody gave him out, and they killed him; the Germans killed him.</span> <span id="s573">Because we were looking for him, they wanted to help him and do everything possible for this guy.</span> <span id="s574">But we couldn't find him anymore.</span> <span id="s575">They told us he was dead.</span> <span id="s576">And ... was sitting there in one forest, it was a few weeks later.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Do you remember the name of the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s579">It was between Lachva and Slutsk already.</span> <span id="s580">But Pest, let's say, in the war between Poland and Russia, there was a, how you call it, a boundary.</span> <span id="s581">It was a -- how you call it in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: A border?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: It was a borderline, exactly.</span> <span id="s584">But there was no border then because it was already Germans.</span> <span id="s585">Between Poland, where I was, and Russia which is Slutsk is in Russia.</span> <span id="s586">It was already Germans, there were Germans there.</span> <span id="s587">So we -- there was no line there.</span> <span id="s588">There was no borderline there.</span> <span id="s589">So we crossed, I guess, the Russian -- that used to be Russia.</span> <span id="s590">And we were sitting, laying there in the woods and I was already almost dead.</span> <span id="s591">And we hear somebody talking from a distance either German or Russian or German or or Jewish.</span> <span id="s592">I couldn't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s593">I couldn't go anymore.</span> <span id="s594">I couldn't see straight anymore.</span> <span id="s595">It was quite a few weeks later, and all of a sudden, they say, they, “They Jewish, Jewish.</span> <span id="s596">It's not German; it's Jewish."</span> <span id="s597">And I opened up my eyes -- I was laying there three-quarters dead -- and I see my father.</span> <span id="s598">And, of course, I start yelling and falling on him.</span> <span id="s599">He had a beard.</span> <span id="s600">He was already bearded and he was skinny and he was only 37 years old, 38 maybe.</span> <span id="s601">And I used to yell -- I yelled to him, this was still in Jewish, I said, "Tatinge, it's me your daughter, Feigele."</span></p> <p><span id="s602">01:40:12 He looked at me, he didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s603">He said, "No, this is not my Feigele.</span> <span id="s604">This is not my Feigele."</span> <span id="s605">I said, "Tata, it's Feigele."</span> <span id="s606">And he looked at me again, and he passes out.</span> <span id="s607">He dies on me.</span> <span id="s608">I grabbed him as much as I could, and all the other people, I said, "I have my father."</span> <span id="s609">And he died right in front of my -- in my hands.</span> <span id="s610">And I said, "Tata, Tata, it's me; it's Feigele.</span> <span id="s611">Tata, wake up."</span> <span id="s612">He opened up his eyes, he looked at me.</span> <span id="s613">Of course, he recognized me then.</span> <span id="s614">I weighed maybe, who knows, maybe 50 pounds; there was nothing left of me.</span> <span id="s615">A head of hair like this, full of lice crawling all over my face.</span> <span id="s616">How could anybody recognize?</span> <span id="s617">So he had in his pocket -- of course, he recognized me -- he had in his pocket what he used to work in the barber shop outside of the ghetto, his razor and the thing that he cut his hair.</span> <span id="s618">You know, the old fashioned type of things.</span> <span id="s619">He ... took me under his wing.</span> <span id="s620">At that time the whole group fell apart.</span> <span id="s621">Everybody went in different directions.</span> <span id="s622">Romanowsky said he's not going anyplace.</span> <span id="s623">He knows people in that area, he's going to stay there.</span> <span id="s624">First we walked for a while.</span> <span id="s625">We walked for a few weeks together, and then we split apart.</span> <span id="s626">That woman with the child, I told my father about she hit me stick with a stick.</span> <span id="s627">And my father said, "You go your way.</span> <span id="s628">I'm taking my daughter.</span> <span id="s629">I have a profession in my hands.</span> <span id="s630">If I find the underground people, if they'll take me."</span> <span id="s631">Fine.</span> <span id="s632">We had no ammunition.</span> <span id="s633">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s634">My father just had this razor and the thing that you cut your hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Who was your father with at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: My father was with a few men from my home town, but not my brother.</span> <span id="s637">He lost my brother running.</span> <span id="s638">He run with my brother.</span> <span id="s639">My brother got wounded just as much as I was, but much worse.</span> <span id="s640">And he was in the back of him.</span> <span id="s641">My father was running, but by the time he turned around, he didn't see my brother anymore.</span> <span id="s642">He collapsed in the middle of the town.</span> <span id="s643">Unfortunately, it was not far from where I lived.</span> <span id="s644">The people that recognized my brother, they said, "This is Gitelman's son."</span> <span id="s645">And they finished him off with sticks.</span> <span id="s646">(indecipherable.)</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: The Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Somebody saw that afterwards, I take it?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s651">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: These were your former friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s654">Some of them who knew us.</span> <span id="s655">Who knew my father, and ... Jewish kid, and they finished him off with sticks.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">01:43:04 They didn't need much to finish him off.</span> <span id="s657">He couldn't run anyway anymore.</span> <span id="s658">He was more wounded than I was.</span> <span id="s659">My father was not wounded, so my father took me under his wings.</span> <span id="s660">The first thing he did -- I'll never forget -- he cut off my hair, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s661">He just left a small piece here, and the whole head, he cut off the hair to get rid of the lice.</span> <span id="s662">During the day, he made a fire to burn the lice out my whatever clothing I had on me.</span> <span id="s663">You just take off, let's see, whatever I had on me.</span> <span id="s664">I think I remember I had my school outfit where I used to go to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s665">And you make like a knot out of it, and then when you make a fire and you let go, lice gets killed.</span> <span id="s666">They go into the fire.</span> <span id="s667">That's what he did.</span> <span id="s668">And then he -- we went into a peasant's house ...</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Now, is this just the two of you?</span> <span id="s670">I want to be clear.</span> <span id="s671">Or were there other friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Just the, just the ... two of us.</span> <span id="s673">Just the two of us.</span> <span id="s674">He left everybody behind.</span> <span id="s675">And he spoke fluently Russian, and he had a profession.</span> <span id="s676">So he used to knock at the peasant door and said if they need a haircut, or a shave.</span> <span id="s677">And he said he has to clean up his daughter.</span> <span id="s678">So one family -- I remember just like today, a nice peasant family -- they took me in.</span> <span id="s679">They gave me a bath.</span> <span id="s680">She said, "I have nothing to wear for you," she said.</span> <span id="s681">But she went into the pig house -- they had, they raised pigs -- and they took off the blankets from a pig and she wrapped me around.</span> <span id="s682">And she gave me a little kerchief to put on my head, and she says, "Look, I would love to help you, but I can't.</span> <span id="s683">You have to leave the house immediately."</span> <span id="s684">But I cleaned up, she cleaned me up, you know.</span> <span id="s685">She gave me a bath and she gave me this, this wrap around from a pig, you know; this had no lice, you know.</span> <span id="s686">And they killed the lice from this little outfit I wore.</span> <span id="s687">And we had to leave, so we left.</span> <span id="s688">So we left, and this is what we did for quite a few months.</span> <span id="s689">Walking at night -- walking daytime, sleeping in the woods at night, and looking for the underground people.</span> <span id="s690">Where are the underground people?</span> <span id="s691">Which my father didn't know.</span> <span id="s692">He used to go in -- then we met some other Jewish people from different towns, and -- my father was a smart man.</span> <span id="s693">He knew if there gonna be a lot of us, somebody was going to tell on us from the peasants; they gonna get us.</span> <span id="s694">Sure enough, we joined some Jewish groups, and we went into this house, and my father said, he said, "You know," he said, "we have too many people.</span> <span id="s695">Let's get out of here."</span> <span id="s696">And he grabbed me and we left, we left this way.</span> <span id="s697">From this side, the Germans were already there.</span> <span id="s698">They killed everybody out.</span> <span id="s699">There were just me and my father, who took off right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: How did you know that?</span> <span id="s701">Did you learn that afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: My father -- no, I was there.</span> <span id="s703">I knew it.</span> <span id="s704">I knew that everybody, he told me that everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s705">The peasants told us that everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s706">There were quite a few -- most of them you've seen, younger people.</span> <span id="s707">Like I was the youngest always.</span> <span id="s708">Always the youngest.</span> <span id="s709">I -- the truth was that I didn't know what, what, happened to the other girls.</span> <span id="s710">Later on, I found out that they were not in the partisans, but in a, like in a family group working, let's say.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">01:47:00 Working, doing nothing, maybe peeling potatoes, maybe washing clothes, maybe whatever.</span> <span id="s712">But they were never in the group in the partisans; they were really not.</span> <span id="s713">They were outside of the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Now how long, how long did all of this last, going from house to house, trying to find someone, sleeping in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: At least maybe few months, I guess, maybe six months.</span> <span id="s716">Living in the woods, until -- let's say, after a while, after a while, my father used to give peasants a haircut, and my grandpa also knew how to sew.</span> <span id="s717">So my father said he knows how to sew, so when we went into a peasant house during the night when we could take off -- because we didn't know if we could trust them or not, you know -- he said he could sew something.</span> <span id="s718">So they gave him something, like to make a little jacket or whatever, and they gave us a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s719">And also we lived on stealing potatoes and beets and corn.</span> <span id="s720">So most of it, we lived on this.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Did you ever get caught stealing the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: No, but I caught in ghetto once.</span> <span id="s723">I went out -- somebody said to me, you know, I was a child, and somebody said to me, she said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s724">Let's try and get out of the ghetto, and maybe we'll go to the peasants and they're gonna give us a piece of bread or whatever."</span> <span id="s725">But we had to walk through some gardens, and we got out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s726">There was like a hole underneath, we got out of the ghetto, me and my friend, and I went to my house where I used to live and asked for food.</span> <span id="s727">They gave us food, but then on the way back, we had to -- from my house the people, they threw me out.</span> <span id="s728">But another guy, another peasant man gave us some food, a piece of bread probably.</span> <span id="s729">But we had to go through some gardens, and while we were passing the gardens, we were caught by the Germans.</span> <span id="s730">They beat the living hell out of us.</span> <span id="s731">I thought this is it, they're going to send us straight to the concen -- I didn't even know if it was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s732">We didn't know about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s733">We knew about the ghetto, but I knew they gonna shoot us.</span> <span id="s734">So I said to them, "My father works for you.</span> <span id="s735">My father is a barber, works here and there and there."</span> <span id="s736">My brother, as young as he was, he worked in a stable in ghetto.</span> <span id="s737">They, he e used to bring in a piece of bread or piece of orange peel or whatever they gave the horses to eat, you know.</span> <span id="s738">He used to bring in from the food of the horses, he used to bring into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s739">My mother used to cook something there from this here.</span> <span id="s740">Anyway, they almost killed us, not by gun, by sticks.</span> <span id="s741">I came in and crawled back into the ghetto from, you know, and I got caught then.</span> <span id="s742">But stealing by the peasants the food, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">01:50:09 Because we were stealing, let's say, like during the night.</span> <span id="s744">I mean, how much do you steal?</span> <span id="s745">A potato or two, but no, never got caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Were you aware of any German troops or ...</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: We were aware.</span> <span id="s748">We were aware, yes.</span> <span id="s749">We had raids, they knew that this whole area is full of underground people and partisans because while the Russians were taking off, the German took it over, that whole area.</span> <span id="s750">They were, I think, about three weeks without a government altogether.</span> <span id="s751">The Russians, they, they just took off.</span> <span id="s752">And the Germans weren't there yet, but then the partisans, the underground people, they were groups and groups, armies left in Belarus.</span> <span id="s753">This was Belarus area.</span> <span id="s754">Armies were left there behind, and they just, the Russians, they, they took off.</span> <span id="s755">So when the Germans took it over later on, this must have been in '42, right?</span> <span id="s756">The beginning of '42. '</span> <span id="s757">39, two years with the Russians, and then the Germans came in '42, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Fall of '42, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Fall of '42, right.</span> <span id="s760">When did the Germans ...</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: I think the uprising was in September '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: September '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: So this was after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yes, this must be, this was -- this was after that.</span> <span id="s765">So they were all around.</span> <span id="s766">We knew, my father knew, if you have some kind of ammunition on you, a gun, a revolver ... any kind of ammunition, they took you in.</span> <span id="s767">They didn't want me, they didn't want me even I knew how to shoot or whatever.</span> <span id="s768">They wouldn't take me in because I was a child, and I was sick, undernourished, of course.</span> <span id="s769">I could hardly walk.</span> <span id="s770">My father, they needed it, so they didn't want neither of us.</span> <span id="s771">They didn't want us, so that's what my father used to do for quite a while.</span> <span id="s772">He used to give somebody a haircut.</span> <span id="s773">They used to even take him into the partisans and let him work there as a barber or as a tailor or play the violin for them.</span> <span id="s774">There was an army, an organized army.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: He had his violin?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s777">An organized army.</span> <span id="s778">Actually, it was not his violin.</span> <span id="s779">He found this violin by another guy, by a peasant man.</span> <span id="s780">It was way, way later.</span> <span id="s781">And he played with it, and he took it.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: When you say it was an army, you're talking about a partisan group or the Red Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: A partisan group, part of the Red Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">01:53:05 Partisans groups, part of the Red Army.</span> <span id="s785">Armies, whole armies.</span> <span id="s786">Organized groups of armies, but first of all, they didn't want Jews.</span> <span id="s787">They didn't want children, Jewish children, girls, and they didn't want to feed us.</span> <span id="s788">They didn't need us.</span> <span id="s789">They didn’t -- But the truth was that they were not allowed to kill us either, but we were killed.</span> <span id="s790">A lot of us got killed there, a lot.</span> <span id="s791">They used to -- whoever had a chance to run away from ghetto or from any other place as a Jew, they came to the partisans.</span> <span id="s792">They didn't have a gun or a rifle or whatever -- who had a gun and a rifle?</span> <span id="s793">So they took ‘em right away someplace and they killed them.</span> <span id="s794">And they were not allowed ...</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: The partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: They were not allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: So you and your father were wandering?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Wandering.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: And occasionally he would go into these army groups, give them a haircut, play for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s801">And as soon as they said -- he said that he has a child with him, they didn't want him.</span> <span id="s802">And I was not a baby, I was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s803">But I shrank to a baby, you know, and they didn't want me.</span> <span id="s804">What use can I, can they have for me?</span> <span id="s805">I'm not a woman to have sex with me, and I'm not -- which they probably did -- I know they did to another girl, a young woman, a Jewish young woman.</span> <span id="s806">She had to go in there because she had no other choice.</span> <span id="s807">And I had a father with me, and I was nothing.</span> <span id="s808">I was like a stick without hair.</span> <span id="s809">I had no hair at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Did they let you cook for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Well, later on -- they didn't need that either, because they had cooks.</span> <span id="s812">The really had cooks.</span> <span id="s813">They had contact with Russia, with Moscow.</span> <span id="s814">They really wanted me -- they wanted my father so badly there.</span> <span id="s815">They needed him, they needed him.</span> <span id="s816">Not that they wanted him, they needed him, that they, they told my father if -- they'll take him in if -- they had contact with planes, even, planes used to come in there, come in and out.</span> <span id="s817">My father told me this, I didn't know it.</span> <span id="s818">That they're going to take me to Russia on a plane and keep my father in the Russian partisans, in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s819">And my father told me.</span> <span id="s820">He said, "Look, mein Kind," he said, "you could save your life.</span> <span id="s821">I don't know if I'll be alive or not.</span> <span id="s822">I don't know if I'll survive.</span> <span id="s823">There's Hitler here; there's a war here, but you could be saved."</span> <span id="s824">We didn't know where the German army was.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">01:56:02 At that time, they were still way, way before Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s826">They were way -- they were still maybe in Belarus, I'm not sure where they were.</span> <span id="s827">But, so he said to me "But you could save your life."</span> <span id="s828">I said, "No, my father.</span> <span id="s829">If we'll survive, we'll survive together.</span> <span id="s830">If we're going to die, we're going to die together."</span> <span id="s831">And every time -- there were a lot of raids there because they knew this is the area from the partisans -- I always used to lay right next to my father.</span> <span id="s832">I said if we're going to be killed, it’s gonna be both of us together.</span> <span id="s833">I will not be killed by myself.</span> <span id="s834">Or mainly, I didn't want to left by myself without my father.</span> <span id="s835">I was on the Pripet for a few weeks without anybody.</span> <span id="s836">And I even looked worse now than I looked then.</span> <span id="s837">So he used to -- once, he grabbed me by my arms, there was hours of raiding in that area.</span> <span id="s838">And the bombs were falling all around us.</span> <span id="s839">They're trying to get the partisans out of there.</span> <span id="s840">He grabbed me, he pulled me out, off this grave, you know, where we used to hide in ditches if there was a ditch.</span> <span id="s841">I turned around and as soon as he left, I was right on top of him.</span> <span id="s842">And we survived together, we did survive together.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: We're going to stop right now because we're almost out of tape.</span> <span id="s844">This is a good time to change and take a little break.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Okay, yeah.</span> <span id="s846">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">01:57:34 End of Tape #1 TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s849">02:00:00</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Was this before you were with this partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: This was before, way before.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Okay, let's pick up, I guess, where we left off.</span> <span id="s853">You and your father ...</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Well, we were walking and walking days and nights.</span> <span id="s855">And, of course, there was no showers or bathtubs -- for washing for yourself except washing at night, not during the day.</span> <span id="s856">They shouldn't see us, sleeping us barns.</span> <span id="s857">Nobody should see us.</span> <span id="s858">Or in the woods most of the time, nobody should see us.</span> <span id="s859">Steal a potato in the gardens or steal a piece of carrots.</span> <span id="s860">Or it was right at -- it was harvest time.</span> <span id="s861">It was like in September, and until we did, we reached the area where they said there is partisans there, groups and groups, armies of partisans.</span> <span id="s862">Armies.</span> <span id="s863">After then, then we started -- so my father got in touch with somebody that told us where they are.</span> <span id="s864">Well, they wanted my father, as I said before, but they didn't want me.</span> <span id="s865">So we stayed like this for a few weeks, and then my father said to me, "Well, let me go the partisans.</span> <span id="s866">I'm going to leave you with this family."</span> <span id="s867">This whole area was occupied by Russian partisans, so really there was no Germans there.</span> <span id="s868">But I was in a peasant house; I was not in the partisans, they were in the woods in underground.</span> <span id="s869">And I lived in a house with some peasant people, peasant family, and I was a maid there and I did whatever they told me to do.</span> <span id="s870">I slept on a ... on this oven in the back which was hot.</span> <span id="s871">There was no blanket there, and it was concrete.</span> <span id="s872">It was behind the oven, they call it.</span> <span id="s873">That heat, I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s874">I used to lay on one side, bake it well until it was on fire.</span> <span id="s875">Turn around on the other side, turn on my back, turn on my stomach until the morning.</span> <span id="s876">And I couldn't wait to get off.</span> <span id="s877">And then I went to the woods -- to the fields and worked -- worked with them.</span> <span id="s878">I wore a kerchief because of my little black hair here, they shouldn’t recognize me I'm Jewish, and my nose.</span> <span id="s879">And they used to hide me, of course.</span> <span id="s880">They were nice.</span> <span id="s881">They were afraid of the partisans to touch me, to hurt me because my father was in the partisans.</span> <span id="s882">And he said if something happens to me, they're going to be all dead.</span> <span id="s883">So they used to really keep an eye on me, watch me, feed me whatever it was left over.</span> <span id="s884">But if you had bread and a potato, you had food.</span> <span id="s885">It was luxury.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Did you change your name or pretend you were Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: My name -- no, no.</span> <span id="s888">I was Jewish, but my name was Fania, but I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s889">I mean, they looked at me and I was Jewish, you know.</span> <span id="s890">And ... so they knew, so they had to be very careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">02:03:02 After a while when they kept me, they were afraid to open up their mouth for two things.</span> <span id="s892">First of all, for the Russians, because they were not allowed to kill anybody who is Jewish legally, you know.</span> <span id="s893">I mean, illegally, they caught them in the woods, they kill them.</span> <span id="s894">But there were a lot of leftover Jews, let's say, who ran away from a small town who didn't go to a ghetto or one somebody who says well, he didn't think that they're going to kill his family.</span> <span id="s895">He just took off.</span> <span id="s896">So it's like lost sheeps, they were here and there scattered around.</span> <span id="s897">There was even -- my father told me this -- there was even a whole family of five people came: a father, mother and three kids.</span> <span id="s898">They had no ammunition on them.</span> <span id="s899">They had no guns.</span> <span id="s900">They had no rifles.</span> <span id="s901">They had nothing.</span> <span id="s902">They just disappeared.</span> <span id="s903">They just, they were gone.</span> <span id="s904">My father never saw them again.</span> <span id="s905">Then my father asked what happened to this family.</span> <span id="s906">They said they transferred them to another group, which it wasn't true; they killed them.</span> <span id="s907">And then my father told them that he's in the partisans and they had to take care of me.</span> <span id="s908">That's it.</span> <span id="s909">So they kept me there.</span> <span id="s910">I was there for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: With the peasants?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: With the peasants, yeah.</span> <span id="s913">I was there for about a year.</span> <span id="s914">Then also, the partisans, like Zina was, they was a group of people like -- they called themselves in Russian semeyny otryad, they were like families type of things there.</span> <span id="s915">They didn't let them into the group, into the army, in the partisans' army, but they were outside like protected by the Russian, by the partisans.</span> <span id="s916">So they put me there, but not, Zina knew already where I am.</span> <span id="s917">Zina knew.</span> <span id="s918">When they came, when my father came to pick me up and put me in the other group, Zina came with him on the wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Your father had found your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: She found my father.</span> <span id="s921">She found my father.</span> <span id="s922">She found out in which group my father is from the partisans, and she came to see him.</span> <span id="s923">And when he told her that I lived with some peasant family; he's going to pick me up and bring me to the other group where Zina was but in a different group of -- like connected with the partisans.</span> <span id="s924">They like took care of them.</span> <span id="s925">They fed them.</span> <span id="s926">They had it better than I had with this peasant family, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s927">So Zina came with my father.</span> <span id="s928">I remember he put together a small piece of four jackets, from, a ship, a ship jacket like from small pieces.</span> <span id="s929">He brought it over and he made, he himself made for me a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s930">I don't know how, because all this time, I had no shoes.</span> <span id="s931">In Russia in those areas, they make they call it lapti in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">02:06:00 It's made out of the corn sticks, and they make shoes out of this here.</span> <span id="s933">And this is what I had, the peasants made me a pair of shoes like that, and this is what I walked in.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: The peasants made you, or your dad made you?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s936">They made me because I was barefoot.</span> <span id="s937">So I wore this type -- before that, too, somebody made me a pair of shoes like this, also from the peasant people.</span> <span id="s938">They gave me a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s939">It's not shoes; its laptis.</span> <span id="s940">It’s -- I mean, if you went into the water with them, the water came to your neck.</span> <span id="s941">But it didn't stick into your flesh, these sharp things didn't stick into you.</span> <span id="s942">And they wore it, too.</span> <span id="s943">They wore this type of shoes, the peasants wore.</span> <span id="s944">So my father brought me a pair of leather shoes that he put together by himself, I don't know how, from small pieces of some kind of a leather.</span> <span id="s945">I don't know where he got this leather.</span> <span id="s946">I guess in the partisans, maybe.</span> <span id="s947">Maybe it came from deep Russia some place, I don't know.</span> <span id="s948">So Zina came, and they picked me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: I think we need to just explain for the record who Zina is because I know Zina but ...</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Yes, Zina is a friend of mine that lived next door to us.</span> <span id="s951">She came -- she comes from a family -- let's see, she came with a father and three children into my home town.</span> <span id="s952">When the Germans invaded half of Poland, her father with the three children took off and came to my home town.</span> <span id="s953">They called them bierzences, like misplaced people, let's say.</span> <span id="s954">And they lived next door to us.</span> <span id="s955">She was the oldest of the two children, and I think, I think she mentioned it to me that her mother and the other three young ones were supposed to come over later, but they never did.</span> <span id="s956">They never came.</span> <span id="s957">So they lived like next door to us, and my mother felt sorry for them.</span> <span id="s958">There were three small kids with a father.</span> <span id="s959">The father was a shoemaker who couldn't make a living.</span> <span id="s960">They were starving.</span> <span id="s961">And my father had food because as a barber, he used to bring in food to the house.</span> <span id="s962">My father was, My mother was a very, very good-natured woman, extremely good-natured woman, and she used to bring into her house food.</span> <span id="s963">Sometimes she used to call into Zina to my house, wash her, comb her hair, brush out her hair from the lice, and take her, give her something to eat.</span> <span id="s964">Do some cooking and bring into her house.</span> <span id="s965">This is my girlfriend, Zina.</span> <span id="s966">And this is the one who actually took off the shirt out of her back and made a bandage on my back.</span> <span id="s967">This is my friend, Zina.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Okay, so Zina found your father in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: That's where we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: She didn't find my father in the woods.</span> <span id="s972">She found out through from other people where my father is, and she was looking for him.</span> <span id="s973">She's a devil, this Zina.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">02:09:02 She's a devil, and she went to my father to the group of the partisans to find out what happened to me.</span> <span id="s975">She didn't even know it.</span> <span id="s976">So when she found the partisans, the group where my father was, and she saw him, she asked him about me, of course.</span> <span id="s977">So my father told her that I am like miles away in this peasant’s family, and I'm far away and I'm being taken care of, more or less.</span> <span id="s978">So she said she would like to see me.</span> <span id="s979">So, finally, they came, they picked me up, and they brought me to this camp, family camp next to the partisans.</span> <span id="s980">And I stayed with them for a while, which it's hidden in the woods, actually.</span> <span id="s981">Everything in the woods; everything was like hidden in the woods.</span> <span id="s982">And I was there.</span> <span id="s983">During the day, they used to take me in to the partisans.</span> <span id="s984">I scrubbed potatoes.</span> <span id="s985">I still have calluses after now 50 years later, I still have calluses.</span> <span id="s986">Once, they told me to wash the, the big, big -- they used to call it the kotiel.</span> <span id="s987">It's a big, big pot where they used to cook the food for the partisans, and they told me to wash it.</span> <span id="s988">I crawl inside, it was huge, I washed it.</span> <span id="s989">Didn't come out clean.</span> <span id="s990">One of the guys took a stick and beat me up.</span> <span id="s991">Just because it didn't come out for the partisans already, it didn't come out clean.</span> <span id="s992">So my job was sitting, peeling potatoes for them and knitting gloves and socks for the, for the feet.</span> <span id="s993">This was my job.</span> <span id="s994">So my father used to come to this camp, pick me up, bring me into the partisans.</span> <span id="s995">I did some cleaning for them, cooking for them, and bring me back to that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: And your father was working for the partisans; was he fighting, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: He was fighting, as well, yes.</span> <span id="s998">He was in the partisans fighting, as well, yes.</span> <span id="s999">There were once a raid on us, a air raid, and, of course, I was not together with my father and everybody was running.</span> <span id="s1000">We had to leave that area, and my father ran with the partisans and I ran with this little group here.</span> <span id="s1001">I don't know where we were running, I guess away from the raids.</span> <span id="s1002">And we're supposed to cross a river, and I don't know how to swim.</span> <span id="s1003">I knew how to swim, but I was drowning as a young girl so I was afraid of water, actually.</span> <span id="s1004">And this particular time some other people, the men from this camp, they took a rope and somebody swam through.</span> <span id="s1005">And two people were holding the ropes, one on this side and one on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">02:12:02 And we're supposed to walk on this rope.</span> <span id="s1007">I walked halfway through, and I fell in.</span> <span id="s1008">And somebody saw me falling in there, and after a while, I don't know how it happened, this person saw my father.</span> <span id="s1009">And they told him -- so he said, "Where is my daughter, Feigele?</span> <span id="s1010">She was there and there and there.</span> <span id="s1011">Did she ran, did she hide herself?</span> <span id="s1012">Is she alive?"</span> <span id="s1013">He said, "No, your daughter's not alive; your daughter's dead."</span> <span id="s1014">"What do you mean?</span> <span id="s1015">Did you see her dead?"</span> <span id="s1016">He said, "Yes, I saw her falling into the water.</span> <span id="s1017">She drowned.</span> <span id="s1018">I never saw her come out."</span> <span id="s1019">I never came out this way, I came out the other way completely away from my people.</span> <span id="s1020">I just -- it wasn't deep enough that it was maybe to my neck, and I crawled out on the other side which there were only about two or three people left there.</span> <span id="s1021">There were two people, two Oriental people from the Russian army, I came across there.</span> <span id="s1022">I was all by myself, all by myself, and I found these two people.</span> <span id="s1023">But the people behind me saw me drown, and then they ran back.</span> <span id="s1024">Unfortunately, most of them got killed, but I survived.</span> <span id="s1025">And they told my father I'm dead.</span> <span id="s1026">My father said, "No, she's not dead.</span> <span id="s1027">My daughter's alive.</span> <span id="s1028">My daughter's alive.</span> <span id="s1029">My daughter's alive."</span> <span id="s1030">I stumbled over these two Oriental people.</span> <span id="s1031">They were from deep Russia, and they left families, I think, in Russia.</span> <span id="s1032">They took me under their wings, and they took care of me.</span> <span id="s1033">They watched me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: For how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: They watched me for quite a while.</span> <span id="s1036">Maybe a few months.</span> <span id="s1037">They didn't ask for nothing.</span> <span id="s1038">They didn't touch my body.</span> <span id="s1039">I remember every night, I felt a hand on my back, you know.</span> <span id="s1040">And I said uh-uh, they're going to do something to me, but they didn't.</span> <span id="s1041">They took off the shirt, the jacket from their back and they covered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: These were men, or ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Men.</span> <span id="s1044">Men.</span> <span id="s1045">They really didn't touch me sexually; they didn't.</span> <span id="s1046">There was nobody to touch sexually to begin with, but those years, they were animals.</span> <span id="s1047">They didn't care who they touched, they really didn't.</span> <span id="s1048">They touched me to see it my body's naked, you know, just whatever I had on me to cover me up.</span> <span id="s1049">They took off whatever they had on their backs and they covered me, which is the truth.</span> <span id="s1050">And I was -- they were watching me, also, same story.</span> <span id="s1051">Stealing a piece of food.</span> <span id="s1052">Eating some berries or whatever, water from the, from the swamps until we hit a town.</span> <span id="s1053">We came into a town, and they were leftover partisans there in this town.</span> <span id="s1054">There were leftover partisans and there was a typhus, everybody was sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Do you know the name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">02:15:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Lublin.</span> <span id="s1058">The name of the town is Lublin.</span> <span id="s1059">And I came in, we came into this town, and these two people -- there was one more guy there, but he was not a China man.</span> <span id="s1060">All with the small eyes, I call them Chinese people because I didn't know from where they are, but they were from deep Russia.</span> <span id="s1061">But they were really good to me.</span> <span id="s1062">They really saved my life at that time.</span> <span id="s1063">And there's no place for me to go, a child.</span> <span id="s1064">The same story, nobody wants me.</span> <span id="s1065">Nobody cares for me, nobody wanted me.</span> <span id="s1066">Everybody is pushing me away.</span> <span id="s1067">I said I'm a nurse.</span> <span id="s1068">I know how to be a nurse and know how to give a needle.</span> <span id="s1069">I didn't have the slightest idea.</span> <span id="s1070">Also I make beds, just keep me there; my father is someplace with the partisans.</span> <span id="s1071">I don't know where he is because everybody knew we had a raid, and everybody was running someplace, you know.</span> <span id="s1072">He was with the army, he was with the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1073">I ... was on my own here.</span> <span id="s1074">I was in this house, and I took care.</span> <span id="s1075">They let me, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1076">They let me make the beds.</span> <span id="s1077">The doctor, there was some kind of a feldsher; it wasn't a doctor.</span> <span id="s1078">He knew how to give a needle somehow.</span> <span id="s1079">From where did he get the needles, I honestly don't know.</span> <span id="s1080">I think he had some left over.</span> <span id="s1081">He was also from the partisans left over.</span> <span id="s1082">He run away, you know, when -- in the raid.</span> <span id="s1083">He taught me how to give a needle.</span> <span id="s1084">I got sick.</span> <span id="s1085">I got temperature.</span> <span id="s1086">They were sick on typhus and stomach typhus.</span> <span id="s1087">And I start to vomit blood, and I got sick with a high temperature.</span> <span id="s1088">And there was -- they put me already, there was laying there dead people on the -- it was not a bed, but it was barracks and each soldier was laying there.</span> <span id="s1089">Some alive, some dead, some dying from the typhus.</span> <span id="s1090">And I was so sick that they put me there already.</span> <span id="s1091">They put me there, and there was another raid in this town.</span> <span id="s1092">The house was on fire.</span> <span id="s1093">If somebody is just meant to live, it's, it’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1094">It's just not normal, if you go back, you think how those things happen?</span> <span id="s1095">I mean, it's, it’s miracles that just people cannot believe, it's just not possible to believe.</span> <span id="s1096">It was like a different person, and I must have probably have read it in a book someplace.</span> <span id="s1097">It's like fiction; it's not real.</span> <span id="s1098">There was laying dead people from -- dying on typhus -- and typhus.</span> <span id="s1099">I crawled off that barrack, the bed.</span> <span id="s1100">It was a bed for 25 people probably.</span> <span id="s1101">I crawled out of the house.</span> <span id="s1102">The house was on fire.</span> <span id="s1103">I crawled out, I went behind the barn and I lay down there to die.</span> <span id="s1104">All by myself.</span> <span id="s1105">My -- all of a sudden, I open my eyes, I see my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">02:18:04 He was asking, he was asking around if anybody saw me.</span> <span id="s1107">If anybody saw me, if anybody saw a girl with black hair, a kerchief on her head, a skinny child.</span> <span id="s1108">And he was going, you know, for some reason stumbled on this type of people who knew, more or less.</span> <span id="s1109">One said, "Check this house.</span> <span id="s1110">Maybe she's -- people are dying there on, on typhus.</span> <span id="s1111">Maybe she's there."</span> <span id="s1112">The house was already on fire.</span> <span id="s1113">People were on fire.</span> <span id="s1114">He went behind the barn, he found me there.</span> <span id="s1115">He grabbed me, and he’s carrying me on his back.</span> <span id="s1116">He was carrying a rifle.</span> <span id="s1117">He was really one of the leftover partisans, you know.</span> <span id="s1118">He was carrying a rifle.</span> <span id="s1119">He carried me on his back.</span> <span id="s1120">He carried whatever food he could, of some clothing, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1121">And they wanted to kill me, the people, the partisans.</span> <span id="s1122">He schlepped me into the partisans with them because they knew more or less where they were going, or they had contact with somebody, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1123">And I hear them say, "Kill her.</span> <span id="s1124">We're not gonna take her with us.</span> <span id="s1125">She’s gonna ... If she's alive, and you gonna leave her, she knows that we are partisans.</span> <span id="s1126">They're going to look for us."</span> <span id="s1127">He said, "No.</span> <span id="s1128">If you want to kill my daughter, the bullet has to go through me."</span> <span id="s1129">I, I, I, I was listening, I wasn't unconscious.</span> <span id="s1130">He schlepped me like this on his back for months.</span> <span id="s1131">Months and months.</span> <span id="s1132">Months.</span> <span id="s1133">And they kept on begging him to kill me.</span> <span id="s1134">Begging him to leave me and to kill me.</span> <span id="s1135">"Finish her off."</span> <span id="s1136">I was walking with a stick way, I just couldn’t -- even after the war.</span> <span id="s1137">I was liberated, I still had the stick on me.</span> <span id="s1138">I couldn't walk without the stick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: How big were these groups of partisans that you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: In the thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: They could hide out in the thousands?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1143">In the thousands.</span> <span id="s1144">Armies.</span> <span id="s1145">Leftover armies, Russian armies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: So these groups you were with were huge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Huge.</span> <span id="s1148">Huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Did you experience a lot of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1151">Yeah, a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Like what?</span> <span id="s1154">If a Jewish person came in, as I said before, some wandering that they wandered away whatever the reason was.</span> <span id="s1155">They ran away, they wandered away, they were left over, they had the guts to run into the woods and come across the partisans and they had no ammunition on them, they killed them immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: And if they had ammunition?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: They might have taken ‘em in.</span> <span id="s1158">If they had a rifle on them or a gun or something, they might have taken them in, yes.</span> <span id="s1159">Some, some, they took it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: In these groups that you were with, how many other Jews were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Not too many.</span> <span id="s1162">Not too -- There were me and my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">02:21:02 There was another girl with her brother, which -- she was my age.</span> <span id="s1164">There was another girl from Minsk, an older girl, who -- with her brother.</span> <span id="s1165">Her brother got killed and one of the -- and the, they used to go on the assignments, let's say, to put bombs on the trains.</span> <span id="s1166">He got killed on one of those bombs.</span> <span id="s1167">And this is all I know about Jewish people, not really.</span> <span id="s1168">I was in the worst Jewish -- well, actually, my father was in the worst Jewish partisans' group, the most anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: They needed him so badly that they had to keep him there.</span> <span id="s1171">And they was -- I know exactly.</span> <span id="s1172">Nickoli, Nickoliovich, the commander was Nickoli Nickoliovich.</span> <span id="s1173">And the name of the partisans was the Stakhanovtsy.</span> <span id="s1174">They were the worst anti-Semitic groups, but they needed my father badly and they kept him there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: When you say the "worst anti-Semitic partisans," are there examples?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1177">The example is that if any Jew showed up, he was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: But while you were amongst them, they didn't mistreat you or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: No.</span> <span id="s1180">No.</span> <span id="s1181">Of course, I stayed away from their sight.</span> <span id="s1182">I did my job.</span> <span id="s1183">I went in the middle of the night, I peeled my potatoes, and I went home.</span> <span id="s1184">That's it.</span> <span id="s1185">This was my job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: What's this noise?</span> <span id="s1187">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1188">Have we been hearing that noise?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Videographer: I caught a little bit, but I didn't know ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: On the other hand, they did saved a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s1191">They did.</span> <span id="s1192">Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.</span> <span id="s1193">Unfortunately, my father died in '62 on cancer, but he survived because of them.</span> <span id="s1194">And Zina survived because of them.</span> <span id="s1195">The Romanowskys survived because of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Were you aware of any mistreatment of women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1198">They used to rape women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: You knew women who were raped?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1201">My girlfriend was raped, the older girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1202">And she had the child, and they choked this child with a pillow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: So that was common practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1205">They used to rape in the town.</span> <span id="s1206">Even the non-Jewish women, the partisans used to rape them.</span> <span id="s1207">It was against the law.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">02:24:05 But, but this Jewish girlfriend of mine, she had a child.</span> <span id="s1209">And later on, she had to live with one officer in order not to be touched by other people.</span> <span id="s1210">She was a full developed, beautiful, beautiful girl, and she was with one officer.</span> <span id="s1211">So this way, she was protected.</span> <span id="s1212">I was protected by my father.</span> <span id="s1213">And my other little girl was protected by her father.</span> <span id="s1214">So, let's say, if one of the nights I stayed with my father in the group, I always used to sleep at the very end of the -- how do you call this -- barracks?</span> <span id="s1215">Not a barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: A bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: A bunk, yeah.</span> <span id="s1218">Like, one, one piece of board.</span> <span id="s1219">Like 20 soldiers used to sleep on the same ... a bunk, yeah.</span> <span id="s1220">So I used to sleep, let's say, if I did stay overnight with my father I stayed always at the end, he kept me.</span> <span id="s1221">But they wouldn't dare touch me, they wouldn't dare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Were any of the women fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1224">All of them, whoever was there.</span> <span id="s1225">I had a rifle.</span> <span id="s1226">I used to clean the rifles for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Did you ever use the rifle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Once.</span> <span id="s1229">Once, I used the rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: You killed a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: I did not kill, but I let them know that they are coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Do you remember much about your father and his actual fighting?</span> <span id="s1233">I mean, how much responsibility they gave him, what role, what his responsibilities were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: His responsibility was during the day, he worked as a barber.</span> <span id="s1235">And also, if any of the clothing got ripped, it was his job to sew it up.</span> <span id="s1236">At night everybody had to stand guard, and, let's stay, like -- everybody lived under the ground.</span> <span id="s1237">It was like a regular army.</span> <span id="s1238">They had a regular kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Underground, everything was underground.</span> <span id="s1241">And -- my father used to stay guard.</span> <span id="s1242">I stayed a few times, as young as I was.</span> <span id="s1243">And ... and his responsibility was -- they never send him to kill or to stay in the front or to fight or to do things that he should be killed, because they really needed him for other things.</span> <span id="s1244">For being a barber, sewing, sometimes playing music for them.</span> <span id="s1245">He was very much musically inclined.</span> <span id="s1246">Mainly, for being a barber and for sewing, they kept him there.</span> <span id="s1247">But at night he had to stay guard.</span> <span id="s1248">He was also inside in the committee a lot, too, with them, too, because he was working for them there in the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Did you move around a lot, or was it ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s1251">We moved around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">02:27:02 We stayed in one place, say, like six months or eight months.</span> <span id="s1253">I was actually only, I think, two years there.</span> <span id="s1254">I think for about two years.</span> <span id="s1255">We were liberated two, a year earlier before the concentration camp people, a whole year.</span> <span id="s1256">So we were there for two years with them moving around from one place to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Every few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: Like every few months, yes.</span> <span id="s1259">If there were raids, we moved more, but everything underground.</span> <span id="s1260">Everything underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: They were -- it just was built?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Built, made like -- like, you know, a grave underground, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Do you have any other memories of some of the bombing raids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1265">There were quite a lot of bombing raids, yes.</span> <span id="s1266">A lot of bombing raids, and people got killed right and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: What would you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Run, just run.</span> <span id="s1269">When I came to this country, I was still running, and when I, when I was in a regular bed -- I didn't feel this much after liberation, I don't know why, in, in, in displaced camp.</span> <span id="s1270">When I came here, and I almost got killed because I was running through a window.</span> <span id="s1271">My husband caught me in the back.</span> <span id="s1272">I was already married with a child, and I heard a plane probably flying very low.</span> <span id="s1273">And boom, I was running for the outside, and I went straight -- I guess in my dream or something, I saw the raid.</span> <span id="s1274">I felt the raid.</span> <span id="s1275">And he caught me, and he said, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s1276">I said, "We are being bombed."</span> <span id="s1277">He said, "No, you're not being bombed.</span> <span id="s1278">You're in America.</span> <span id="s1279">You're safe.</span> <span id="s1280">Go back to bed."</span> <span id="s1281">And this was going after me for many, many, many years.</span> <span id="s1282">Many years, the raids.</span> <span id="s1283">The raids and also that I was left on the Pripet from the people that -- it was in me that they're going to leave me, leave me.</span> <span id="s1284">Funny, very funny, I cannot -- which I cannot explain, until when my father died this fear went away from me.</span> <span id="s1285">It's like was taken, lifted off of me.</span> <span id="s1286">Until my father died, I had "Tatinge, don't leave me.</span> <span id="s1287">Don't leave me.</span> <span id="s1288">Don't leave me."</span> <span id="s1289">It was -- I mean years later -- ’till '62.</span> <span id="s1290">He died in '62.</span> <span id="s1291">I had this fear I was not a mother really -- I was a good mother, overprotective, very overprotective.</span> <span id="s1292">But this fear in me that I'm in the war, I'm being bombed, I'm being left behind, this -- I wasn't home.</span> <span id="s1293">I really was still floating, I was still running.</span> <span id="s1294">But when my father died, it kind of was like this curse was lifted off me.</span> <span id="s1295">Like, I'm home now.</span> <span id="s1296">I'm in a free country and I'm home now.</span> <span id="s1297">I cannot explain why.</span> <span id="s1298">I cannot explain why.</span> <span id="s1299">I used to say it to my father, I said, "Daddy, you're not going to leave me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">02:30:05 You're not going to leave me.</span> <span id="s1301">There’s ... I'm home.</span> <span id="s1302">I'm in a free country.</span> <span id="s1303">It's after the war.</span> <span id="s1304">It’s after ... ” I dreamed night after night I was running, running, running.</span> <span id="s1305">My grandma was dead.</span> <span id="s1306">She was running after me, I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1307">For years.</span> <span id="s1308">I even told Zina this dream.</span> <span id="s1309">I, I don't know why she's after me.</span> <span id="s1310">Why is she running after me?</span> <span id="s1311">Until 1962, until the day my father died, it's like I'm home.</span> <span id="s1312">I'm not running anymore.</span> <span id="s1313">My father either got to go away, which he didn't leave me.</span> <span id="s1314">I know he didn't leave me, he really didn't.</span> <span id="s1315">If there is something there, he's watching over me.</span> <span id="s1316">And I'm not afraid anymore for some reason.</span> <span id="s1317">I'm kind of protected.</span> <span id="s1318">I don't know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Is there anything else about that period?</span> <span id="s1320">I know that at some point, didn't the Red Army send reinforcements into that area where the partisans were fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Not soldiers, but ammunition.</span> <span id="s1322">Because by running from one place to the other, they used to leave ammunition behind.</span> <span id="s1323">But -- so they used to send planes with ammunition, but I don't think so that they had soldiers down.</span> <span id="s1324">Just because soldiers, they had plenty.</span> <span id="s1325">Armies of soldiers they left behind.</span> <span id="s1326">But ammunition, they used to throw down.</span> <span id="s1327">Food, they used to throw down.</span> <span id="s1328">We used to even see them dropping with parachutes ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: From the Red Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Whatever it was from the Red Army, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Would you just explain when you say that there were armies, who were these armies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Armies.</span> <span id="s1333">Left over, leftover soldiers from the Red Army.</span> <span id="s1334">Battalions, armies.</span> <span id="s1335">I mean, as far as ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: When they had to retreat -- I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: When they retreated, there was nothing to retreat.</span> <span id="s1338">I think they were sold out.</span> <span id="s1339">I mean, even the books, even history tells us, I think, that they were, they just didn't fight.</span> <span id="s1340">They just didn't fight.</span> <span id="s1341">The Germans came in, and they just took it over and there was no war there anymore in Belarus.</span> <span id="s1342">They just left everything behind, and what -- whoever took off, I don't know if they took off.</span> <span id="s1343">But there was other armies there waiting for them, I guess.</span> <span id="s1344">But all the Belarus armies, there were armies from all over Russia.</span> <span id="s1345">Armies, in the thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Anything else about your two years of hiding out or fighting or ... that you think we should know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: I don't -- as of now, I don't remember really.</span> <span id="s1348">I was there -- I was there right behind them, next to my father.</span> <span id="s1349">Being with my father.</span> <span id="s1350">Thanks to him I'm alive.</span> <span id="s1351">I knew that my parents -- my mother was killed.</span> <span id="s1352">My brother, my sister was killed; I knew that.</span> <span id="s1353">I was doing whatever I had to do.</span> <span id="s1354">They used to bring me, when I was hiding outside of the partisans, they used to bring me to knit sweaters, socks, gloves, clean ammunition for them.</span> <span id="s1355">I cleaned ammunition for them.</span> <span id="s1356">They brought me food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Were there many women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: No.</span> <span id="s1359">Not too many women.</span> <span id="s1360">Really not too many.</span> <span id="s1361">As far as -- nobody was allowed to be married there.</span> <span id="s1362">As far as I remember, there were three of us, unless somebody did have women outside of the partisans' groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">02:34:00 They were, let's say, they had like women in the towns, they used to go to them, whatever.</span> <span id="s1364">For sex or whatever, but nobody was -- no women, there were no women in the army.</span> <span id="s1365">Just this Jewish woman, Jewish girl, older than me, and the two younger ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Did you run into a lot of family camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1368">There were a few.</span> <span id="s1369">Not too many, but there were a few family camps, yes.</span> <span id="s1370">But they were like behind the Russian armies who they kept an eye on them, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: How did liberation come about?</span> <span id="s1372">Where were you?</span> <span id="s1373">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: This was -- we were in the area of the Slutsk area, the area of Slutsk.</span> <span id="s1375">And we knew -- I mean, people used to come, I guess.</span> <span id="s1376">They knew through the partisans where the Germans are, that they were pushed back all the way back already, and we're going to be liberated.</span> <span id="s1377">The raids were going on every single day.</span> <span id="s1378">There were bombings and bombings and bombings.</span> <span id="s1379">They knew that this is areas from the partisans, and the partisans' private camp, the family camps.</span> <span id="s1380">Maybe somebody had women there, too.</span> <span id="s1381">I mean, wives.</span> <span id="s1382">They had also wives in Russia, too, left behind.</span> <span id="s1383">And maybe they had new wives and kids here, too, which I really don't know.</span> <span id="s1384">But most of them, they were like Russian people, Jewish people left over like Zina was left with her father and brother.</span> <span id="s1385">The Romanowskys, I think they were in a different camp, but the two sisters, Anna Romanowsky; Genia Romanowsky; and the father, Barra Romanowsky.</span> <span id="s1386">And there were quite a few camps, but not, not too many.</span> <span id="s1387">Little by little they tried to eliminate, really, because they were a nuisance to the partisans.</span> <span id="s1388">They couldn't kill ‘em, and they didn't want to keep them, really.</span> <span id="s1389">They had no use out of them.</span> <span id="s1390">They had no use for them.</span> <span id="s1391">They were just a nuisance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: How did the partisans know that the war was almost over?</span> <span id="s1393">Were they communicating with ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Communicating with Moscow, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Through a radio, or ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Through a radio or through planes or through whatever communication they had with Moscow.</span> <span id="s1397">They knew that they are closing in already, that the Germans are leaving.</span> <span id="s1398">And whatever day they left, they used to bomb us out.</span> <span id="s1399">Try -- A lot of people got killed, Russians.</span> <span id="s1400">Well, not too many -- this was not the Jewish area, really.</span> <span id="s1401">This was just a coincidence that we had some Jewish people there.</span> <span id="s1402">Let's say, there was a big town, Pinsk.</span> <span id="s1403">Nobody survived from there.</span> <span id="s1404">Slutsk people, nobody survived as partisans or as camps in the partisans.</span> <span id="s1405">Whoever went to deep Russia, they survived.</span> <span id="s1406">But from that area, if the Germans didn't kill us, the peasants killed, killed us.</span> <span id="s1407">Or Minsk or the other smaller towns like Luninets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">02:37:03 Nobody, nobody -- Lachva survived, a few, because only because of this uprising only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Okay, so ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: But, otherwise, from all around there's maybe one from each town or maybe nothing.</span> <span id="s1411">There are towns that completely got wiped out that not one person survived.</span> <span id="s1412">Whole towns of that area.</span> <span id="s1413">Minsk, Slutsk, Babruysk, Mikashevichi, Koshana -- those are all smaller places, and Pinsk is big.</span> <span id="s1414">Minsk is big, you know.</span> <span id="s1415">But to survive in that area, nobody did.</span> <span id="s1416">Everyone, as I said before, if the Germans didn't kill us, the Russians killed us.</span> <span id="s1417">The people killed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: So how did you get liberated?</span> <span id="s1419">When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: So this was in -- I think in '45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: '44, the end of '44, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1424">Maybe July.</span> <span id="s1425">I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: It was June or July, I think.</span> <span id="s1427">I think it was -- was it June or July '45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: '44 probably.</span> <span id="s1432">And we knew that they are closing in.</span> <span id="s1433">I wasn't with my father again for some reason.</span> <span id="s1434">Through the bombing, we got separated again, you know.</span> <span id="s1435">And, and then he found me again, also in the woods.</span> <span id="s1436">Well, there was only woods there.</span> <span id="s1437">And all of a sudden, there's no raiding; there's no bombing; we don’t, we know there is no Germans; there’s no contact with Moscow; there's nobody.</span> <span id="s1438">And then somebody came and said to us, "Ach, the Germans are gone.</span> <span id="s1439">The Germans are gone."</span> <span id="s1440">And we started to walk towards Slutsk.</span> <span id="s1441">Slutsk is a big city.</span> <span id="s1442">And we started to walk towards that town.</span> <span id="s1443">Well, people knew where to walk, I mean, and I followed them.</span> <span id="s1444">I was still with a stick walking.</span> <span id="s1445">I still couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1446">I was still very, very sick.</span> <span id="s1447">And while were walking through the paths, we knew already that the Germans are gone.</span> <span id="s1448">But we should watch how, because there leftover Germans.</span> <span id="s1449">If they'll catch -- if they'll catch somebody, they're going to kill us.</span> <span id="s1450">So while we're walking -- we walked already on the, on the streets, and there's no pavement on the streets, you know, in the smaller towns, you know.</span> <span id="s1451">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1452">And we saw Germans hanging on the posts.</span> <span id="s1453">What happened was whoever -- they were also left over there.</span> <span id="s1454">We were three days without any government at all when we came to Slutsk.</span> <span id="s1455">There was no Russians or Germans.</span> <span id="s1456">The Germans left, and the Russians didn't take us over yet.</span> <span id="s1457">So we were just walking towards Slutsk, and beside every pole, there was hanging a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">02:40:05 I'll never forget that scene.</span> <span id="s1459">As much as I was mad and hurt, I couldn't look at it.</span> <span id="s1460">I just couldn't look at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Who had hung them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: I guess the partisans.</span> <span id="s1463">The -- If they caught a German, they hung him up right down on the pole, on the electric poles.</span> <span id="s1464">And I couldn't look.</span> <span id="s1465">My father couldn't look.</span> <span id="s1466">We got sick, we just couldn't.</span> <span id="s1467">And we walked already in the streets, on the streets.</span> <span id="s1468">Not in the woods anymore.</span> <span id="s1469">And we were like lots and lots of groups together, so we weren't really afraid.</span> <span id="s1470">And my father stuck me, he said, "Go in the middle.</span> <span id="s1471">Go in the middle," you know.</span> <span id="s1472">"Don't walk on the sides."</span> <span id="s1473">Because if somebody’s -- you know, they were still shooting there.</span> <span id="s1474">There was still leftover shooting; not army shooting, but leftover shootings.</span> <span id="s1475">And we walked for about a few days.</span> <span id="s1476">By the time we came to the town Slutsk, we got there and there was nobody there.</span> <span id="s1477">There was no government there.</span> <span id="s1478">There was no Russians, and there were no Germans there.</span> <span id="s1479">And the partisans gathered the leftover Germans, the leftover Russian people who wanted to turn into Germans and work for the German government and they were mean to everybody.</span> <span id="s1480">Not just to Jews, I guess to non-Jewish people, too, and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: The Belorussians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: The Belorussians.</span> <span id="s1483">And I hear that the Ukrainians, they were even worse than the Belorussians.</span> <span id="s1484">The Ukrainians was even worse, they were worse.</span> <span id="s1485">And there's one point that they -- we came into like the middle of the town, and there were a big, big stack of people like worms.</span> <span id="s1486">Who were they?</span> <span id="s1487">Germans, leftover Germans.</span> <span id="s1488">And I've never seen such a huge group, one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s1489">Like they caught somebody, and they just threw him on.</span> <span id="s1490">They caught somebody, a German left over, and they threw him on this, on this -- not a bunch, but it's like a mountain of people.</span> <span id="s1491">And some of them are wounded.</span> <span id="s1492">Some of them were dead already there.</span> <span id="s1493">Some of them were bleeding.</span> <span id="s1494">I could still see them.</span> <span id="s1495">I visualize them.</span> <span id="s1496">And one guy, a partisan, says to give my stick to my father, and he said -- not a stick, he gave him a rifle.</span> <span id="s1497">He turned around and he says to my father "Here, Mr. Gitelman," he said in Russian, "They killed your family.</span> <span id="s1498">Killed your wife, they killed everybody here.</span> <span id="s1499">Now, you have a chance to give it back to them.</span> <span id="s1500">Hit them."</span> <span id="s1501">And they did to me the same thing, they gave me -- I never touched anybody, I couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">02:43:02 My father turned this around, gave one zat to somebody there.</span> <span id="s1503">He fainted, he was out.</span> <span id="s1504">He couldn't do it either.</span> <span id="s1505">Neither ... my father couldn't touch anybody and me, forget about it; I couldn't touch anybody.</span> <span id="s1506">And this was how we were liberated, without a country, without anybody, without family.</span> <span id="s1507">I knew my family's dead.</span> <span id="s1508">My mother's dead.</span> <span id="s1509">I knew that.</span> <span id="s1510">The rest of my uncles.</span> <span id="s1511">I had -- my mother had a sister with five children, I knew if they were there in Lachva, they were all taken to this mass grave and they were all shot.</span> <span id="s1512">Because from there, nobody went from that ghetto.</span> <span id="s1513">If anybody went, it's from this ghetto.</span> <span id="s1514">And my family was in the other ghetto.</span> <span id="s1515">I was hoping still for my brother.</span> <span id="s1516">I was really hoping, but but then, by then I didn't know if he's dead or alive.</span> <span id="s1517">I knew if he was in this ghetto, if he's in this ghetto maybe, maybe he's someplace.</span> <span id="s1518">But there's somebody who saw what happened to him, they told us.</span> <span id="s1519">That, this was after the war.</span> <span id="s1520">We stayed in Slutsk.</span> <span id="s1521">My father became a barber again.</span> <span id="s1522">The Russians wanted to send me away to school again way to deep in Russia.</span> <span id="s1523">I said, "I'm not going," but they were forcing me to go.</span> <span id="s1524">So I went away.</span> <span id="s1525">I came, I went to my home town.</span> <span id="s1526">I said, "I'm not going no place.</span> <span id="s1527">I'm staying with my father."</span> <span id="s1528">So I went to Lachva.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Alone.</span> <span id="s1531">I left my father in Slutsk.</span> <span id="s1532">He was a barber, and I went to Lachva; I took a -- then there no trains yet.</span> <span id="s1533">But any train that was going, those army trains so I snuck on top on the train.</span> <span id="s1534">I was laying all the whole night on the top on the train, on the roof.</span> <span id="s1535">And I came to Lachva, I jumped off.</span> <span id="s1536">Now, you see a 16-year-old kid, they are babies.</span> <span id="s1537">But they were, yes, people with experience, and I stayed there for a week.</span> <span id="s1538">I couldn't stay there.</span> <span id="s1539">I stayed with Zina and the Romanowsky two sisters.</span> <span id="s1540">I couldn't stay there.</span> <span id="s1541">I went back to Slutsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: Before you go back to Slutsk, did you learn then what happened to the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: Can you tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1546">Well, that's what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1547">When we were running, whoever was there specially the first ghetto and the second ghetto, the one that was on fire, whoever they grabbed, they put them on this truck, as I said before.</span> <span id="s1548">Took ‘em to that massive grave, shot -- make them to get undressed, all of them.</span> <span id="s1549">They got all undressed.</span> <span id="s1550">They lined them up, shoot them, and they threw them into this -- put this white antibi- -- I don't know what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Lime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Lime or whatever.</span> <span id="s1553">You know, it shouldn't smell or it shouldn't whatever.</span> <span id="s1554">And the layer on top on layer on top on layer and who, and they killed everybody, and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: And that was what happened to your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: To my grandma, to my, to my mother, to my sister, and they probably threw my brother in there, too.</span> <span id="s1557">I don't know how they buried him.</span> <span id="s1558">But they killed him right in the middle of this town, but I guess they took him over there, and they probably threw him then, you know, dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: How many people do you think were in that grave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: In that grave was about, I have it written down, about 2,600 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1562">So you made your way back to Slutsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: I came back to Slutsk and then my father says to me, "We're not going to stay -- " my father meantime met this woman, he got married.</span> <span id="s1564">He knew that my mother's dead.</span> <span id="s1565">He married her.</span> <span id="s1566">He wanted to give me a home, but the truth was he didn't.</span> <span id="s1567">She was a mean woman, she was very mean to me.</span> <span id="s1568">Very cruel to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">02:47:09 She used to -- this was my second world war, another war I had with her.</span> <span id="s1570">She used to lock the food from me, after the war.</span> <span id="s1571">She was just a mean, mean woman.</span> <span id="s1572">She's dead now, but she was a mean woman.</span> <span id="s1573">A real stepmother that you read in the books.</span> <span id="s1574">And my father said, well, he married -- he got married, and, but this is not a way to stay.</span> <span id="s1575">This is not a way to live.</span> <span id="s1576">We're not going to stay here.</span> <span id="s1577">And it was always kind of he knew how to get into people that were organizers, and he got in touch with some people in Slutsk.</span> <span id="s1578">People that knew what's happening, and he got in touch with the Haganah.</span> <span id="s1579">And they told him that people are being smuggled from place to place, and, of course, our goal was Israel.</span> <span id="s1580">How to find a way to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1581">He also had two sisters in America and a brother in New York, and -- but there was no mail yet.</span> <span id="s1582">There was no connection yet there, and he didn't remember the addresses.</span> <span id="s1583">He didn't remember nothing.</span> <span id="s1584">He didn't remember my age.</span> <span id="s1585">He was so blocked out that he didn't remember my age.</span> <span id="s1586">He knew more or less approximately how old I am, but exactly to the date, he didn't know it.</span> <span id="s1587">This I found out in this country, my age.</span> <span id="s1588">So we went -- they told us to go to somebody making papers, and we went to a place by the name of -- we went to Lachva.</span> <span id="s1589">In Lachva, we went to a place by the name of Baranovich, a town Baranovich.</span> <span id="s1590">And there my father somehow through the Haganah and ... and through other different -- already that I guess from Israel -- organized groups that knew tried to gather all the leftover Jews, whoever survived to get us together to bring us -- they opened up DP camps in Germany, and they accumulated everybody.</span> <span id="s1591">Whoever wanted, you had to go.</span> <span id="s1592">There was no other place to go.</span> <span id="s1593">And here we were cared for, they organized us, they gave us money, they gave us tickets.</span> <span id="s1594">False names, false -- everything was false.</span> <span id="s1595">And they brought us into Germany.</span> <span id="s1596">I think, I think from Baranovich to Germany we went as Greek Jews, I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1597">But we were not allowed to speak any Yiddish or any other language, just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">02:50:03 they didn't know what it means, Greek language.</span> <span id="s1599">So they told us to keep quiet, and we smuggled into, to borderlines from one country to the other.</span> <span id="s1600">This was everything was done, I think, by the Haganah by the Israeli Haganah or Bricha or whatever Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s1601">And this is how we came to Germany to a DP camp by the name of Pöcking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Where was it near?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Near München, near Munich.</span> <span id="s1604">There they all kinds of, I think, everything -- maybe America woke up a little bit, too.</span> <span id="s1605">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1606">My father found out the names -- not the names, but where his sister live.</span> <span id="s1607">I guess that the Jewish groups, the Israeli groups, maybe the Haganah, to find out for us the addresses of his sisters.</span> <span id="s1608">And we got contact with the sisters, and they wanted us to come to America.</span> <span id="s1609">The truth was we wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1610">In Israel those years were very, very -- we were already in Germany in 1946 in Pöcking, in a camp by the name of Pöcking.</span> <span id="s1611">And we wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1612">I met my husband there in Pöcking.</span> <span id="s1613">And we survived.</span> <span id="s1614">They used to send me packages, Care packages from America, clothing, food.</span> <span id="s1615">Courage that we had a family finally, you know, and they wanted us to come here.</span> <span id="s1616">But my father -- my stepmother had a daughter.</span> <span id="s1617">I mean, she's, she’s still alive.</span> <span id="s1618">And the daughter had a boyfriend in Germany in this camp, Pöcking, and she had a fight with him.</span> <span id="s1619">So she got up and she went to Israel on her own without anybody asking if the family's going, the mother's going, I'm going.</span> <span id="s1620">She went to Israel, so, of course, her mother pulled to Israel.</span> <span id="s1621">My father was ... wanted to go to America to his sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s1622">But she wanted to go to Israel, so my father went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1623">And when he came -- this was still not legally, it was before 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: So it was difficult to get to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: It was very difficult, and when my father came there and he saw the sewers there, the problems there, and in the meantime I got married to my husband and I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1626">So he said, "You go to my sister's, to America.</span> <span id="s1627">They promised me the world here.</span> <span id="s1628">They promised me a home.</span> <span id="s1629">They promised me everything I needed, everything I want to."</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">02:53:07 And that's how it was.</span> <span id="s1631">I happened to have a very, very, not -- unfortunately, they're all dead -- but they were very good to me, very good to me.</span> <span id="s1632">And so I went to America with my husband and a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: So you were in the DP camp about how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: In the DP camp, we came in ... I think it January '46 and then Pöcking was closed.</span> <span id="s1635">This, the camp, the DP camp was closed, and they sent us to another DP camp by the name of Föhrenwald where my son was born.</span> <span id="s1636">And I came to the United States in 19 -- I got married in 1948.</span> <span id="s1637">My father went to Israel in 1948, and I came here and I give birth, 1948 -- I got married in 1948, and I came to this country in 1949, I think the 15th of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: So you were in the camps for two or three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: But I think it's two and a half years.</span> <span id="s1640">It's January 1946 'til 1949, ‘til July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: And that also means, then, you were liberated, but not in the camps, in Slutsk for a year and a half or so before you went to Germany, or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s1643">Well, almost, I think I was almost about two years.</span> <span id="s1644">I think I must have been there with the -- in the ghetto six months.</span> <span id="s1645">And then I think with the Russians, I was there for about less than two years, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1647">How much tape do we have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Videographer: More than five minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Another thing I wanted to ask you about was getting back to the uprising.</span> <span id="s1650">It was very unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: It was one of the first ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: First, very first ones, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: So there was underground activity that you weren't involved in ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: But what did your father know about all of this?</span> <span id="s1657">Was he involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: He was not -- he was involved in a way.</span> <span id="s1659">Because I remember him going to meetings.</span> <span id="s1660">I remember he coming in to -- because he had access out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1661">He had also connections, I think, also with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1662">Because I remember he knew exactly, later on he told me, he wasn't allowed to talk.</span> <span id="s1663">He knew exactly when they -- when this, they were gonna to kill us.</span> <span id="s1664">He knew that that particular morning -- he told me later on that he was praying to God that I should never come back from work.</span> <span id="s1665">I should run away, I should be killed there, that he shouldn't see me back being killed and taken to this.</span> <span id="s1666">He knew exactly how it's going to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">02:36:00 The Germans told him, and one German said to him -- one German said to him, he said, "You know," he said, "If there is a way for you to, to run away, you cannot take your family with you, but if you could run away, because you're going to be killed tomorrow morning."</span> <span id="s1668">So he knew.</span> <span id="s1669">My brother knew because he was working in the stable by horses.</span> <span id="s1670">He was cleaning the horses, and the -- one German said to him, he said, "You're a young kid.</span> <span id="s1671">If you could run away now because you gonna be killed tomorrow morning."</span> <span id="s1672">He said, "But I have my father and mother there.</span> <span id="s1673">Where can I go?</span> <span id="s1674">How?</span> <span id="s1675">Where should I run?</span> <span id="s1676">Where should I run?"</span> <span id="s1677">My father knew, my father knew where to run.</span> <span id="s1678">He knew it, he knew that area.</span> <span id="s1679">He was older, he knew where to run.</span> <span id="s1680">I didn't, I was running wherever -- like hurdles of cows.</span> <span id="s1681">Everybody was running;
