1989</span></p> <p><span id="s12">WH: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">MS: In Galicia, Poland, in Dukla.</span> <span id="s14">I had two brothers and three sisters.</span> <span id="s15">The sisters had already come to America and the brothers didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s16">I was born in 1919.</span> <span id="s17">I wasn’t in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s18">I was in hiding in various places, in peoples’ houses, on the roof of a stable.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">WH: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">SS: In Valkydobrani, Czechoslovakia which, after 1938, became Hungary.</span> <span id="s21">It was 27 km from Munkacs.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">WH: Were either of your parents Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">SS: Not mine and not my husbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">WH: Where were you during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">SS: In 1944 we were taken to the concentration camps, to Auschwitz for seven months, and after that to a labor camp in the Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s26">While in Auschwitz we didn’t work, just sat around, waiting.</span> <span id="s27">We were 1,000 in a block, counted twice a day.</span> <span id="s28">We were just numbers.</span> <span id="s29">My brother and sister also survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">WH: Why did you come to the U.S. and not Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">SS: I had three uncles there.</span> <span id="s32">For us Israel was Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s33">It was like a fairy tale, something you know about but you don’t really think of it as something real.</span> <span id="s34">That’s how we were brought up, chasidish.</span> <span id="s35">And I met my husband on the boat over, the Marine Flasher.</span> <span id="s36">I took the boat in Bremen and my wife got on in LeHavre.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">WH: You’re from Galicia and you’re from Hungary.</span> <span id="s38">Since these areas are near each other is it really the same area culturally?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">MS: I would say so.</span> <span id="s40">Before WWI there was no border there.</span> <span id="s41">As a matter of fact, my mother was from Slovakia and I had an aunt who lived in Munkacs.</span> <span id="s42">Of course, this wasn’t true of all Polish families.</span> <span id="s43">And I lived close to the Czechoslovakian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">WH: How come you came to Cleveland?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">SS: Both of us had relatives who lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">WH: Were you religious then?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">MS: Not right after the war.</span> <span id="s48">My sisters weren’t and my beliefs were shattered.</span> <span id="s49">But once we got married and my wife was religious, I decided it’s not right.</span> <span id="s50">I’ll go back to what I was used to.</span> <span id="s51">Not that I believed it, but it’s what I was used to.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">WH: How come you made aliya?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">MS: I instigated it.</span> <span id="s54">We weren’t Zionists.</span> <span id="s55">I was in the slipcover business and we came here in 1972.</span> <span id="s56">I began to be excited about Israel when the State was created in 1948.</span> <span id="s57">I always read about the country’s achievements.</span> <span id="s58">And my excitement kept growing.</span> <span id="s59">I read the Jerusalem Post in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s60">I talked about Israel all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">WH: Did you feel as though you were really a minority in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">SS: I think that although we appreciated what America had done for us, we couldn’t completely shake off the war’s effects.</span> <span id="s63">It’s not that we wanted to leave America.</span> <span id="s64">It’s that we wanted to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">WH: But you were there for 26 years.</span> <span id="s66">Did you think it could happen there?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">SS: Well, you still didn’t feel you were completely welcome in America.</span> <span id="s68">There was still a dividing line.</span> <span id="s69">You’d listen to a radio program.</span> <span id="s70">And always there was underlying hatred.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">MS: I believed it could happen in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">WH: How did you live in Cleveland?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">SS: In a private house that we bought cheap at the time, for $18,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">MS: In 1962, we came for a pilot visit.</span> <span id="s75">We saw you needed at least $50,000 to come, so we went back to save some more.</span> <span id="s76">My daughter came here and worked on a kibbutz where she liked it very much.</span> <span id="s77">Our son came on a trip through the Cleveland Hebrew Academy.</span> <span id="s78">He was also excited about it after spending the summer here.</span> <span id="s79">So he started challenging us: “Daddy, you talk and talk, but you’re not going.”</span> <span id="s80">So, eventually we went.</span> <span id="s81">We knew our standard of living would be reduced but we accepted that.</span> <span id="s82">We were prepared for it.</span> <span id="s83">We decided to burn our bridges behind us and sell the house.</span> <span id="s84">We knew that if we didn’t we might be tempted to come back.</span> <span id="s85">Anyway, we needed the money from selling the house to live here.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">SS: We had it harder than others.</span> <span id="s87">We weren’t 25 and didn’t have so much stamina, but we weren’t old enough to retire.</span> <span id="s88">Our children were very good about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">WH: Do you believe God gave this land to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">MS: It’s not a question of that.</span> <span id="s91">I believe in that, but the main thing is that in our lifetime, Israel became a fact.</span> <span id="s92">This is where we belong.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">SS: We believe that all the things that happened in Europe are going to happen again, if not in our lifetimes, then in 100 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">MS: I also felt that Jewish history is being made here and I didn’t want to be a bystander to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">WH: What adjustment problems were there here?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">MS: I wasn’t used to working for others.</span> <span id="s97">I had been independent.</span> <span id="s98">But the slipcover business was not a business for here.</span> <span id="s99">But I got a break.</span> <span id="s100">A relative took us to someone in this business, in the drapery business.</span> <span id="s101">And he sold us his knowhow and the business.</span> <span id="s102">We had a language problem but that wasn’t the main problem; we got along.</span> <span id="s103">We started off in a very poor and depressing absorption center near Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s104">It doesn’t exist anymore.</span> <span id="s105">They had nothing that Americans were used to.</span> <span id="s106">We were used to a carpet, to different food.</span> <span id="s107">After three months we hit rock bottom but then we started going back up.</span> <span id="s108">There was no other place to go but up.</span> <span id="s109">After a while we moved to Rishon Letzion.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">WH: Didn’t it bother you that you weren’t living anymore in Jerusalem, the city of your dreams?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">SS: No, because we started there and had a bad experience there.</span> <span id="s112">And also, it was too cold there.</span> <span id="s113">In Rishon we spent five miserable months.</span> <span id="s114">There was no work there.</span> <span id="s115">We were discouraged but we couldn’t go back.</span> <span id="s116">We felt that if we returned we would say that we never gave it enough time, enough of a chance.</span> <span id="s117">But I worried because I saw it was affecting my husband’s health.</span> <span id="s118">He would wake up at two or three in the morning and wouldn’t be able to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">WH: So how well did you do here?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">MS: I never really made a living here.</span> <span id="s121">The success that I had was that I started working here.</span> <span id="s122">But we have a nice apartment because of money we had from the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">WH: What do your children do?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">SS: My daughter married to someone who works in computers.</span> <span id="s125">They have four children.</span> <span id="s126">Our son works on a Kibbutz.</span> <span id="s127">He was in the Army.</span> <span id="s128">They’re both religious.</span> <span id="s129">He is in Maale Gilboa.</span> <span id="s130">In the beginning he lived in Sde Eliyahu.</span> <span id="s131">He’s single and he’s 33.</span> <span id="s132">It’s a young couples’ kibbutz.</span> <span id="s133">He loves the outdoor world.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">WH: What achievement are you proudest of?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">MS: That we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">SS: I feel that same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">WH: How are the values different here?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">SS: I don’t know how to explain it but even though my children struggle here, they’re more productive here.</span> <span id="s139">Their lives have more meaning.</span> <span id="s140">If I buy a dress for my granddaughter, she’s so happy with it.</span> <span id="s141">In the U.S., so what!</span> <span id="s142">They’re not impressed.</span> <span id="s143">That’s not a present.</span> <span id="s144">That you expect.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">MS: You asked what I’m proudest of.</span> <span id="s146">I should have said first my marriage.</span> <span id="s147">We’re married as long as this country exists.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s149">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0111
