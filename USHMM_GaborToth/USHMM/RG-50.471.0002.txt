CY: At first, nothing. I didnt realize what it will be, and if somebody said theyll go to kill us or what, we didnt believe it. We thought they dont know what theyre talking about. But in a couple of days we find out. For instance, when I went for bread, you had to have a card. When the Germans came in and they didnt give me a card because Im Jewish. Then they took my husband, the Lithuanian army took my husband, they, to the army, because they thought that theyll fight. But he came right back. And then we had to go to the ghet- to.

SB: And, did you, you noticed that one side was moving faster than the other?
CY: Yeah.
SB: Tell me about it.
CY: I dont know why what one side was moving faster, and where I was, where we were staying was moving slow.
And I couldnt stay anymore. I was pregnant, it was cold, and it was too much for us, so I said, Lets go on the other side. And we tried to go on the other side where they were moving faster, but a German or a Lithuanian pushed us back.

CY: They took them to the fort.
SB: How do you know?
CY: Because this is what we heard. And they shot, the graves was ready. See they used to come in the ghetto say, We heard theyre digging graves again. So we knew already for what it is the graves.

CY: This would look better if you would hold it on my face. No matter how bad it is, I make a joke. If not I would not be alive. But thanks to her husband and family, nothing would be worth. I lost interest in everything, I live just within death (?)
SB: Tell me about the hospital burning.
CY: We had a hospital in the ghetto. I dont remember when it was, but on Yom Kippur they burned the hospital with the doctors with the mothers with the children, everybody. Everybody who was in Kovno in the ghetto knows it. We saw the fire, and this was Yom Kippur.
They knew the day was for us the best.
TH: Tell about your friend who had the baby in the
hospital.
CY: Its better that I dont think. I never talked, I never mentioned nothing. My cousins, I had here uncles, aunts, cousins, my cousin said you know, you dont tell nothing. Now I start to tell everybody who listens, especially not Jewish people. I dont think even a lot of American Jews who want to hear and want to know.
Thats my feeling.
