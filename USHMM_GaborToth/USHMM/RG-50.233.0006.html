<span id="s52">No, no.</span> <span id="s53">That was when he was twenty years old and they grabbed him and they took him to Russia.</span> <span id="s54">It’s not like a World War veteran.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: So he never really fought in the war, he just got taken to --?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: That’s

yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: --when you were younger?</span> <span id="s63">Did you play with, did you have lots of Jewish friends and also gentile friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Mostly it was Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s65">As a matter of fact, we are here like six or seven boys and one girl which we went together to school.</span> <span id="s66">Which they survived, a lot of them did not survive.</span> <span id="s67">That girl, right, she’s a grandmother, she lives in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s68">A few boys here, old friends, which we went together to cheder.</span> <span id="s69">We went from the first to the seventh class, we are together.</span> <span id="s70">I have a friend here, not far from here and we meet together.</span> <span id="s71">We have our -- everyone, that’s since 1900’s that emigrated here, they made societies, like our society, the Krasnik Society, which we meet every month and we do in charity everything and so on between us and for Israel and in general.</span> <span id="s72">Now, for instance, in the wintertime we don’t have because we all older people, so they are in Florida here and there.</span> <span id="s73">March, we start again, which we used to meet in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s74">Now, most live in Brooklyn so we meet here in ______ Heights Congregation.</span> <span id="s75">We make a party once a while; we have our own cemetery and so on.</span> <span id="s76">That’s almost every hometown has but a lot, like the youth, don’t go in so they give up.</span> <span id="s77">Which I’m trying now to take in my kids to it.</span> <span id="s78">Of course we had friends; we played together, we went to school together, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s79">Other than Jewish friends, very little.</span> <span id="s80">I especially had a few because, as I said, we lived in a street, one side was Jews and one side was non-Jews.</span> <span id="s81">But mostly like the little towns, most of it populated from the Jews.</span> <span id="s82">Like the surroundings around, like the farmers and this, they lived around the town.</span> <span id="s83">They called it in Jewish ____________ the shtetl.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: I would say a big city for us a Lublin, that was different.</span> <span id="s86">But the little towns where I come from, that was --.</span> <span id="s87">The few Jews lived in the city and the surrounding around lived the non-Jews but we went together to school and everything.</span> <span id="s88">Naturally, the public school, not the cheder.</span> <span id="s89">The cheder, Jews.</span> <span id="s90">It was like a ghetto life.</span> <span id="s91">That time we didn’t realize now.</span> <span id="s92">Now we realized, we live in a big city, all kinds of nationalities, we realized that it’s a different life.</span> <span id="s93">But those days, was that kind of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Do you remember any instances of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Oh, yes, plenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Can you tell me about some of those?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: See here two bones?</span> <span id="s98">That’s still a memory.</span> <span id="s99">When it came, not that I’m going to be prejudiced whatsoever but I have to talk out the way it was then.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s102">Like for instance, here we celebrate a Christmas altogether nice whether you believe or not, we celebrate together.</span> <span id="s103">I lived with neighbors, Italian; I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s104">It’s Hanukkah, I put out the candles; they put out whatever it is.</span> <span id="s105">It’s mutual.</span> <span id="s106">But there it wasn’t unfortunately.</span> <span id="s107">I have to say the way it is whether you’re Christian, whether you’re believer or not.</span> <span id="s108">You do this, to say as it was.</span> <span id="s109">Very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s110">The Polaks, very stupid.</span> <span id="s111">They only know one thing.</span> <span id="s112">We Jews killed our God!</span> <span id="s113">That’s what they knew.</span> <span id="s114">For instance, it came, let’s say twice a year you have for two or three weeks, a holiday from the school.</span> <span id="s115">Once a year, vacation, two months.</span> <span id="s116">Let’s say that twice a year like Christmas time or Easter, right?</span> <span id="s117">The two holidays is about Jesus Christ -- I wouldn’t say us Jews.</span> <span id="s118">We knew a little bit more those days what’s with Jesus and what’s the story.</span> <span id="s119">They didn’t know nothing; they only knew one thing.</span> <span id="s120">You killed our God!</span> <span id="s121">If he is a god, how can you kill him?</span> <span id="s122">Alright, now I am different than I was then.</span> <span id="s123">Tough on Judaism also.</span> <span id="s124">Because I know more the reality; I am more educated and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s125">That time I was Jew 100%.</span> <span id="s126">Now I’m born Jew, I am Jew but I’m different.</span> <span id="s127">Not agreeing with everything -- so going, let’s say it was the Christmas holiday, the last day of the holiday, the last day in school before the holiday.</span> <span id="s128">Then the action for two, three weeks.</span> <span id="s129">They came with strings and to the string attached weights, like a kilo weight, a half a kilo weight and that’s the way.</span> <span id="s130">They knew that they were going out from the school.</span> <span id="s131">If it happened during the day, I go to the teacher and I put a report, something happens.</span> <span id="s132">Not too much, but something.</span> <span id="s133">But this time he knows in the afternoon, he’s out from the school for three weeks -- kill that Jew, hit that Jew.</span> <span id="s134">So that’s the way they were hitting.</span> <span id="s135">You came home bloodied, with blood, with faces like this.</span> <span id="s136">You killed our God!</span> <span id="s137">That was the only thing.</span> <span id="s138">That was Christmas time.</span> <span id="s139">It came ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: It came before Easter, I remember, like today, when you went to school, how far was it?</span> <span id="s142">A mile?</span> <span id="s143">You went through the main street like they call it here Kasioska, there was the movie.</span> <span id="s144">As a matter of fact, from the movie was a Jew.</span> <span id="s145">At that time wasn’t movies like today.</span> <span id="s146">There was outside all the pictures what the movie is.</span> <span id="s147">The movie was calling G____.</span> <span id="s148">Now, why, it’s not Polish, maybe it was ---.</span> <span id="s149">That was all the story when Christ raises and so on and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: When you pass there, it’s the same thing, it’s the same thing.</span> <span id="s152">Anti-Semitism was very big.</span> <span id="s153">Let’s say Saturday afternoon, we were juvenile boys, we went out for a walk in the main street.</span> <span id="s154">As I said, the whole shtetl was Jews.</span> <span id="s155">Around -- so Polaks _______ when they came out.</span> <span id="s156">Unfortunately it happened to me this week I told you.</span> <span id="s157">When they came out, we were walking.</span> <span id="s158">Oh, you Jew!</span> <span id="s159">Bang!</span> <span id="s160">It happened to me this week, almost the same thing.</span> <span id="s161">Where I work on Seventh Avenue between 38th and 37th Street.</span> <span id="s162">I leave work at a quarter to six.</span> <span id="s163">You go out, it’s a big traffic of people.</span> <span id="s164">I have to go this way to 42nd Street station but people, _____ they going en masse to the station, to the Penn station.</span> <span id="s165">One young fellow, taller than you -- it was raining.</span> <span id="s166">Alright, a short fellow like me with the umbrella, maybe I didn’t have it down, the umbrella.</span> <span id="s167">Alright, while walking you walk this way, this walk that way.</span> <span id="s168">But one tall guy, a young fellow came towards me and like this with his rear almost to my face.</span> <span id="s169">What’s the memory?</span> <span id="s170">I shouldn’t say what.</span> <span id="s171">You son-of-a-bitch – he could have gone and killed me.</span> <span id="s172">I was sorry after what I said but it remind me of the years in Poland.</span> <span id="s173">But alright, sometimes, as I said, you said excuse me, he didn’t, alright.</span> <span id="s174">But this, a young fellow, so it remind me of this.</span> <span id="s175">Of course, there was anti-Semitic and so on and so on but I wouldn’t let them think you heard, you Jew, you Jew.</span> <span id="s176">You killed our God, you Jew killed our God.</span> <span id="s177">I loved the school, I was going to the school.</span> <span id="s178">I loved it, I wanted to go further whether I could afford or not.</span> <span id="s179">But unfortunately, the anti-Semitism was very big.</span> <span id="s180">We had in our hometown, we had the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s181">It’s like here, college.</span> <span id="s182">Here gymnasium is like for the ______.</span> <span id="s183">But very seldom a Jew could go in, even if he could pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yes, anti-Semitism was very, very big.</span> <span id="s186">A Jew couldn’t get too much of it.</span> <span id="s187">They say it is -- they say -- he couldn’t get to a higher -- no.</span> <span id="s188">They felt it in the school, on the street; they felt it all over, all over.</span> <span id="s189">The Germans, they knew where to make the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s190">They didn’t make too many in Czechoslovakia, different people.</span> <span id="s191">Same Catholics, different.</span> <span id="s192">But in Poland, all the crematoriums, all the camps were in Poland.</span> <span id="s193">I was in the camp in the beginning, near our hometown.</span> <span id="s194">I didn’t have to run away.</span> <span id="s195">I could have walked away but where?</span> <span id="s196">You walk away and the Polak will give you for a kilo ______, for two pounds of sugar.</span> <span id="s197">If not for him, I would run, always on the run.</span> <span id="s198">He didn’t let me.</span> <span id="s199">The last three months we were not together.</span> <span id="s200">This because they separated us whatever.</span> <span id="s201">But whenever I wanted to go, run --.</span> <span id="s202">One year we were on the camp near our hometown.</span> <span id="s203">I was going out from the camp.</span> <span id="s204">I was that time, I was a bricklayer.</span> <span id="s205">Bricklayer, cememting, this and that.</span> <span id="s206">You were looking for places that you should be inside.</span> <span id="s207">Because fighting with hunger is one fight but fighting with the weather and the cold, two fights was way too hard.</span> <span id="s208">You were looking for – but looking; it’s not you’re given application.</span> <span id="s209">But I ws a young fellow, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s210">They tell me that I am smart and this and that.</span> <span id="s211">Fine, inside, going out for sand, for this.</span> <span id="s212">Let’s say a village nearby and going out for lime, to dig lime, I could have gone away.</span> <span id="s213">That was in 1942, I had no guards over me.</span> <span id="s214">Only me and the polka with the horse and carriage.</span> <span id="s215">All of a sudden I hear a voice.</span> <span id="s216">What is the voice?</span> <span id="s217">Hey you, boy-fellow, how can I get into the camp?</span> <span id="s218">I saw he’s a Jew.</span> <span id="s219">I says, who are you?</span> <span id="s220">He tells me the name.</span> <span id="s221">In the villages, very few Jews lived.</span> <span id="s222">The ones who lived, you knew his name even if you didn’t know him.</span> <span id="s223">I am Zalek Division he said.</span> <span id="s224">I look at him.</span> <span id="s225">Why do you want to go into the camp?</span> <span id="s226">I haven’t got place where to go.</span> <span id="s227">I gave them away everything – all mine whatever, gone.</span> <span id="s228">I don’t want to hear.</span> <span id="s229">I haven’t got where to go.</span> <span id="s230">I’m sick and tired already.</span> <span id="s231">What’ll happen, will happen, what we were told will be with me.</span> <span id="s232">I says don’t do it.</span> <span id="s233">It’s not so easy to get in because you got all -- they counting you, you come in, they counting you.</span> <span id="s234">It was not a question to run away.</span> <span id="s235">The question was, where will I hide?</span> <span id="s236">I see the German, the uniform, I run away from him.</span> <span id="s237">But I see a Polak, do I know which one is good and which one is no good?</span> <span id="s238">But I still wanted to run away.</span> <span id="s239">But he didn’t let me.</span> <span id="s240">He was then -- he like 24 years difference from me.</span> <span id="s241">I was a young boy, 18, 19 years.</span> <span id="s242">Run, no.</span> <span id="s243">Besides this, if you going to run away, they take the next ten and they kill.</span> <span id="s244">Especially first was the family, it’s the same name, you can’t deny.</span> <span id="s245">So that was the story.</span> <span id="s246">We suffered in this hometown -- it was four kilometers from the hometown.</span> <span id="s247">When we got to work they came for this work with a horse and carriage to give a day’s duty, performance, whatever.</span> <span id="s248">What did they do for us?</span> <span id="s249">They didn’t have to do, just look away.</span> <span id="s250">yes, you gave them the good shirt from your body, they gave you a kilo bread.</span> <span id="s251">But we knew, for two pounds of sugar, the Germans gave a proclamation: If you bring one Jew a family, two pounds of sugar, they did it.</span> <span id="s252">Isn’t that a shame?</span> <span id="s253">Don’t do for me good but don’t do it for me either.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about when the Germans first got to your ---, when the war started and the Germans first come to your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Well, the war started September the 1st.</span> <span id="s256">Naturally, as the war is, bombs with everything, whatever.</span> <span id="s257">I didn’t understand too much.</span> <span id="s258">I didn’t know too much.</span> <span id="s259">Two weeks later, the Germans came into our hometown.</span> <span id="s260">It happened, it was the first, or the second day of Rosh Hashanah, the New Year’s.</span> <span id="s261">Of course, we didn’t believe it or not in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s262">It’s not like the big town, every corner you had a synagogue.</span> <span id="s263">In the little towns, I don’t know how it was in the big towns, the little town was a shul and a basm _____ .</span> <span id="s264">That means one is the synagogue and one is like other than a synagogue.</span> <span id="s265">Let’s say the synagogue every Saturday, the basm ____ was for every day, day and night, even to go in for a whole night, if you were cold, to warm up.</span> <span id="s266">So it’s Rosh Hashanah, New Year’s.</span> <span id="s267">Before New Year’s people like leaders grabbed the scrolls, the Torah, which you probably know, the scroll and they brought them.</span> <span id="s268">Let’s say, this one brought to his house and around the neighbors, we prayed there.</span> <span id="s269">Was the first day or the second day of Rosh Hashanah, we heard, of course, shooting and this and that.</span> <span id="s270">A week before, it was bombs, which people got killed already, in front of me.</span> <span id="s271">One woman got killed -- I run out with a cover to cover her and so on.</span> <span id="s272">The second day they came in so naturally, we all start praying, we were afraid.</span> <span id="s273">After the Germans start to go around, nothing will happen, everything is quiet, we should go out on the street normal.</span> <span id="s274">About two, three days later started the feelings of the German.</span> <span id="s275">First they took -- in Polish they call it _____, hostages.</span> <span id="s276">Let’s say this one is a rich one, they went into the magistrate, to the ______- and they got through the big Jews.</span> <span id="s277">They took this one, they took this one, they took this one.</span> <span id="s278">One they killed right away to show us what’s all about it if we don’t -- if we revolt against them or what.</span> <span id="s279">It started, they were there.</span> <span id="s280">Naturally -- and we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s281">Now we know what the politics was between Stalin and Hitler.</span> <span id="s282">They made some kind of --.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Pact?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Pact.</span> <span id="s285">We didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s286">All of a sudden, we hear the Russians are a couple of kilometers from our town.</span> <span id="s287">The next day they came in a patrol; with a tank and the school square where I went to school.</span> <span id="s288">We all around to look; everybody looked.</span> <span id="s289">The Germans were laying down looking at the tank ______ and so on.</span> <span id="s290">I didn’t understand Russian but it’s almost similar.</span> <span id="s291">All the people understood.</span> <span id="s292">They said like they are twenty kilometers from us.</span> <span id="s293">It’s more possibility that they’re going to turn back till the Bok, the River.</span> <span id="s294">That’s what happened, they turned back.</span> <span id="s295">A lot of people in those towns where they were, not far from us, they went along with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: They went with the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s298">Youth, mostly youth.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Did you think about doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: That’s what I want to bring out.</span> <span id="s301">My grandmother, she was my mother, she brought me up.</span> <span id="s302">She ways to me, Avul _____ that means my name, Avul ____ run, run.</span> <span id="s303">I said how can I leave you.</span> <span id="s304">The grandfather was laying in bed paralyzed.</span> <span id="s305">He couldn’t move, he couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s306">It was naturally, seven years already.</span> <span id="s307">The only one because he and me, we were in the town.</span> <span id="s308">But he was a businessman with his wife and children and I was near my grandmother.</span> <span id="s309">So nobody understood it, only me.</span> <span id="s310">For instance, they bombed before they came in.</span> <span id="s311">I took him on my back, as little as I was, and I dragged him to a cellar whatever.</span> <span id="s312">He says I don’t want to live no more.</span> <span id="s313">So nobody understood him, that’s enough for me.</span> <span id="s314">My grandmother says, go run.</span> <span id="s315">I says, where I’m going to run?</span> <span id="s316">Leave you with the sick grandfather?</span> <span id="s317">No.</span> <span id="s318">Those days wasn’t

id="s638">He gave him a deal, so you should say that I was calling you and you didn’t hear him.</span> <span id="s639">In case they ask me, I will say the same thing.</span> <span id="s640">They were civilians from Yugoslav; they were like Germans, they brought them and they were our masters.</span> <span id="s641">We worked together and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s642">But they were on the free; they had living conditions and so we made up like this.</span> <span id="s643">When he went off and--- Where were you?</span> <span id="s644">So he said, ______ you know the title.</span> <span id="s645">I’m sorry I didn’t hear you, my master called me -- that means the meister -- he always had that machine carbine and a whip with end, a weight.</span> <span id="s646">You swine, he says, when I am calling you, nobody’s g--d-- business, you have to come to me.</span> <span id="s647">Everybody was looking in his hands, what he’s taking, either the machine, carbine or the whip.</span> <span id="s648">He took the whip.</span> <span id="s649">Give him like this over the head.</span> <span id="s650">_____ that means disappear.</span> <span id="s651">He had here, after the war in Germany, when liberated, a German big doctor told him to remove it because that might take cancer.</span> <span id="s652">I have here also, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: But I was tested, it’s nothing.</span> <span id="s655">That is an appeal.</span> <span id="s656">That’s a story that _______.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q:P That happened in ’43, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: That happened in ’43?</span> <span id="s660">That happened in Krasnik?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: No, that happened already in the camp because 1942 was Judenrein, that means clean.</span> <span id="s662">Nobody’s under free and that happened in the _____.</span> <span id="s663">Here, also, they’re fixing the fence in Krasnik camp.</span> <span id="s664">Where they got those pictures, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s665">Here, you see a horse and wagon and the dead people they put in there and _____</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: 1942, do you remember when in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Around September, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: It happened like this.</span> <span id="s670">We were at work.</span> <span id="s671">The women and the children were like in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s672">The ghetto was around the synagogue.</span> <span id="s673">It wasn’t fenced, you can call it a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Was there some sort of barrier?</span> <span id="s675">So you couldn’t get out or---?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No, you could get out but where could you go?</span> <span id="s677">If you go outside the ghetto, the Polak will catch you and bring you to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s678">Then they going to shoot you because you did something wrong.</span> <span id="s679">So there were the children, the women and the non-working people.</span> <span id="s680">Otherwise, everybody was, whether in this place working; they were in three places working, which after that they were camps.</span> <span id="s681">Naturally, you ask me question, how did we live, from what?</span> <span id="s682">We had counts for provision.</span> <span id="s683">One evening I come home from work -- yes, so they going to give Judenkarde, that means a “J”.</span> <span id="s684">A J that means Juden.</span> <span id="s685">Whoever get the J card is legal.</span> <span id="s686">Who will get those J cards?</span> <span id="s687">My mother-in-law if I would have it, only a wife and thst’s it.</span> <span id="s688">So whether it belonged to my grandmother, nowhere.</span> <span id="s689">We were hiding her, in a basement.</span> <span id="s690">We brought her down to eat, within the ghetto.</span> <span id="s691">One evening I come home for work, I says to my aunt, to uncle’s wife, give me the soup, I’ll go down to Grandmother and give it.</span> <span id="s692">She says I gave her already.</span> <span id="s693">What do you mean, you gave her.</span> <span id="s694">I want to go and see her.</span> <span id="s695">Don’t go.</span> <span id="s696">I says no.</span> <span id="s697">Then she revealed to me, they took her away.</span> <span id="s698">All those that they didn’t have the J-card, that means the work-card, they took them away.</span> <span id="s699">Where they took them away, there is a town, 20 kilometers, a little, little town.</span> <span id="s700">So they took them there.</span> <span id="s701">There is less publicity and from there the station four kilometers, and from there, it’s gone.</span> <span id="s702">But in the same time, when they took them, something was with the partisans, a shooting and a lot in the middle of the road.</span> <span id="s703">What’s the difference, this way or the other way, they got killed or something, bombing, gone.</span> <span id="s704">Now remains all the legalized people and all the working people and we are working.</span> <span id="s705">From Friday morning, it was Friday morning, yeah I think.</span> <span id="s706">Friday morning, that all those up that have the Jew card, they legalized; they have to go to the public bath.</span> <span id="s707">The public bath was a Jewish bath, for religious purposes, forv cleaning purposes, the bude, the bath.</span> <span id="s708">The Jewish, they have to, it was for all kind of purposes.</span> <span id="s709">Usually it is a Friday.</span> <span id="s710">was working because for the Saturday; all those people have to go that have the Jew card and clean themselves and so on and there they will get the real card and legalize.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: It was the Jewish commandant of the town, his name was Piza_____.</span> <span id="s713">He knew everything before.</span> <span id="s714">Like if he knew something before, he gave a signal to his family and so it spread a little bit.</span> <span id="s715">He, even didn’t know.</span> <span id="s716">Friday morning, they took them all to the bath.</span> <span id="s717">The minute they took them to the bath , after they were inside, they supplied horse and wagons, they called it a ____.</span> <span id="s718">When they came out from bath______comes around and says, they put him and also _____ out of that town.</span> <span id="s719">We came home Friday from work, nobody’s there.</span> <span id="s720">That means it’s Judenrein, that means clean of Jews.</span> <span id="s721">That was 1942 in September.</span> <span id="s722">From there it started.</span> <span id="s723">My uncle they took to Budzyn, me they took to that ___________ what I said and that’s it.</span> <span id="s724">If you remained in the city, that means the shtot came, the shtetl came.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: So you went to this camp now?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A; They took me to that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: How far from the city was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: That was like, I would say, two kilometers.</span> <span id="s729">That camp where uncle was, Budzyn, was like four kilometers.</span> <span id="s730">After two weeks like or three weeks, they took thirty-five people which I was in the 35 and they brought me to Budzyn, to Uncle.</span> <span id="s731">They made a selection themselves.</span> <span id="s732">When I came into that camp, was a happy day, a black day.</span> <span id="s733">105 people that day, the minute they went out to work, they selected and there was the grave.</span> <span id="s734">What I tell you they took from the -- they shoot 105 people by the grave --that day I came to Budzyn.</span> <span id="s735">My uncle saw me and ---.</span> <span id="s736">Since then, ’42, they were in Budzyn.</span> <span id="s737">So I would like to say we went to the camp, to the camp was -- from the barracks, the camp, to the werk which they called in German, the werk, that mean the place where we working, all those men and everything was like four kilometers.</span> <span id="s738">But in the colony where you see those buildings, where those Yugoslavia-German lived, there, all of a sudden I became a bricklayer.</span> <span id="s739">So life fiest what was the fiest on those blocks.</span> <span id="s740">The kitchen wasn’t like here, it was a brick.</span> <span id="s741">They came from Yugoslavia and they lived there.</span> <span id="s742">We went ahead_____ and we lived there.</span> <span id="s743">That was like ten minutes to the camp which I told you the story with those bushes were burning.</span> <span id="s744">We were there and the Ukrainian were our guards.</span> <span id="s745">It was hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Can you describe the town for me a little -- not the town, I’m sorry, the camp for me a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Budzyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s749">What it looked like?</span> <span id="s750">Was it fenced in or ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: It was like those barracks, you saw those barracks.</span> <span id="s752">No windows, nothing.</span> <span id="s753">You saw more or less ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Was the camp fenced in?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Fenced, double-fenced, with an electric fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: It had an electric wire?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Electric wire and guards around day and night.</span> <span id="s758">Whoever didn’t want to live no more, he went to the wire.</span> <span id="s759">Either the wire killed him or the guard killed him.</span> <span id="s760">The Ukrainians were the guards but beside the Ukrainians was the lagerfuhrer, the SS man, that Fiess and he has his helper and a few officers but they were with the guards.</span> <span id="s761">Those Ukrainian guards, they were not allowed to go in the camp.</span> <span id="s762">They were allowed their duty, not in the camp.</span> <span id="s763">You ask me a question, what did they have a business to go in the camp?</span> <span id="s764">there was a lot of business.</span> <span id="s765">For instance, you came home -- we had a stock market, as I told you, we had bargain of this.</span> <span id="s766">They didn’t have too much to eat so they, from the guard, they came in, not all of them, whoever was duty-free and they was looking by us.</span> <span id="s767">Or sometimes, when we came in by the gate, counting so they can pull you out.</span> <span id="s768">In the boot, this they were allowed and to strip you and to look.</span> <span id="s769">Sometimes you find money also.</span> <span id="s770">Anything you were not allowed you could find, otherwise, we were not able to survive and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s771">In 1943, when it was the Warsaw uprising and the rest of the people, they brought to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s772">Why I mentioned this?</span> <span id="s773">it’s a connection.</span> <span id="s774">From Treblinka, 800 people, they brought to us, to Budzyn in that camp.</span> <span id="s775">Eight hundred people, well-dressed,_______ they brought them to us, 800.</span> <span id="s776">When they brought them to us, so the Ukrainian______ I’m an old calhoon but those arte the new ones and they knew, the Germans didn’t know so much as the Ukrainians, they knew that they have money and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s777">Going in from work,_____, that’s a new one, a Ukrainian pulled him out, stripped him --they stripped once my uncle also.</span> <span id="s778">They came in, in the barracks.</span> <span id="s779">Once, if the lagerfuhrer, that Fiess or his helper, adjutant, came in and saw in the guard.</span> <span id="s780">And the guard said, this one, where are they?</span> <span id="s781">Right away you guard, you are not allowed to do that – shoot him.</span> <span id="s782">So they were sleeping, those var_____people and this and that.</span> <span id="s783">Many came over to me, they say this all the time, I’m an honest guy and so on.</span> <span id="s784">Abie, do me a favor.</span> <span id="s785">Here’s 5, 600 zlotys, hide them.</span> <span id="s786">Where did you hide them?</span> <span id="s787">At wotrk.</span> <span id="s788">If tomorrow you didn’t go there, -- I had a young fellow, a Yugoslavian.</span> <span id="s789">He was a year older than I am.</span> <span id="s790">I remember his name, German, which he was my master, I worked for him.</span> <span id="s791">I had to____________.</span> <span id="s792">I had a hiding____, he knew.</span> <span id="s793">I didn’t tell him exactly and I had the key.</span> <span id="s794">There were no honest people, listen, when it comes to a piece of bread, it’s a different story.</span> <span id="s795">But they saw the honesty in me, this one gave me 800 zlotys, this one gave me 500, to hide it every time.</span> <span id="s796">They give me and I had it on the top, on the attic in the sand.</span> <span id="s797">Once I came there and it was dry there, nothing there.</span> <span id="s798">Somebody looked, they see what I’m doing, can’t say a word, you got to keep your mouth shut because --.</span> <span id="s799">That’s the way when the Russian people came to us and they were________.</span> <span id="s800">They told us stories from Treblinka and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s801">Then they decided to liquuidate that camp.</span> <span id="s802">Before that liquidation of the camp, all of a sudden, there was typhus.</span> <span id="s803">There was no water.</span> <span id="s804">That was, I think, in ’43.</span> <span id="s805">There is typhus.</span> <span id="s806">Are you surprised?</span> <span id="s807">Whoever was sick, there were both – the stomach typhuses and there is a planastic like a rash from.</span> <span id="s808">I had both.</span> <span id="s809">Whoever sick, they took one barrack and there they put the people.</span> <span id="s810">Every morning that Fiess came in before breakfast.</span> <span id="s811">We called his machine gun, this hunsagle.</span> <span id="s812">What is a hunsagle, we always called it, he shouldn’t understand because a lot of Jewish is like German.</span> <span id="s813">Hunsagle means like hands-up and that carbine, machine carbine looked like it.</span> <span id="s814">He’s going already with the --.</span> <span id="s815">Every morning he came in and he took us people, he rush them off from the barrack and running.</span> <span id="s816">Besides this, there wasn’t those blocks, those blocks you saw.</span> <span id="s817">Was block 2, outside from the fence, right across the street.</span> <span id="s818">There was that block and in that block was a lazarett.</span> <span id="s819">It means a hospital.</span> <span id="s820">If you was sick, they took you there.</span> <span id="s821">It was like, it was -- in camp was tailor place, shoemaker place, it was for us.</span> <span id="s822">But in that block was for the SS.</span> <span id="s823">Some people were there and there was a lazarett also.</span> <span id="s824">Other times, he took out and he shoot.</span> <span id="s825">He was already in the typhus.</span> <span id="s826">But listen, he was a man of 35 at that time, 38, a strong guy.</span> <span id="s827">He could make it.</span> <span id="s828">I was a little kid 18 years old.</span> <span id="s829">But we didn’t go that far, we worked in the colony so it was like ten minutes from the camp.</span> <span id="s830">Every day I want to work.</span> <span id="s831">I went to work.</span> <span id="s832">I dsat down, I sit.</span> <span id="s833">I couldn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s834">That guy, Brumula, what is the hell the matter with you?</span> <span id="s835">I said, keep your mouth shut.</span> <span id="s836">I was returned like this.</span> <span id="s837">He only pray to God he should be an SS man and I should be in his camp.</span> <span id="s838">I said you shouldn’t live to that.</span> <span id="s839">His father was one foot shorter and he wass in the werk there and he was an SOB.</span> <span id="s840">He brought me to eat from his house.</span> <span id="s841">If he should know that, he should spend with me again.</span> <span id="s842">It was – (female voice: it was life or death every minute).</span> <span id="s843">So you go into a story.</span> <span id="s844">I could not survive to stay in camp, it’s the death.</span> <span id="s845">If I would have to go the three, four kilometers to the barrack, but here ---.</span> <span id="s846">We had the obermeister, that was the head supervisor from the milers.</span> <span id="s847">He was so short, Schultz, a German from Ostowiec.</span> <span id="s848">He had here an STP National Organization with the H_____.</span> <span id="s849">He was a good guy, they were good_______.</span> <span id="s850">Not from the Lithuanians, Ukrainians but from the Germans, but fortunately I have to say the truth.</span> <span id="s851">He comes in, hey Morris to him.</span> <span id="s852">What is with your son Brumula.</span> <span id="s853">If he’s sick, he has tp.</span> <span id="s854">He said to me, meister Schultz, sh --, sh --.</span> <span id="s855">No he has to stay in the lazarett.</span> <span id="s856">That means the hospital.</span> <span id="s857">Comes over to me, how you feel?</span> <span id="s858">I feel all right.</span> <span id="s859">You don’t be ask me, you don’t feel right.</span> <span id="s860">You got to stay in the hospital.</span> <span id="s861">You were not allowed to tell outside what is going on inside.</span> <span id="s862">If they found out, so you know what is the result, what the verdict is.</span> <span id="s863">But whoever wanted to find out something, he found out.</span> <span id="s864">One day he comes over to me, tell you that time I was as tall as him.</span> <span id="s865">I know already what’s going on here.</span> <span id="s866">I keep my mouth shut.</span> <span id="s867">You’re afraid to go because Fiess every time he shoots, you’re dead.</span> <span id="s868">I don’t say a word.</span> <span id="s869">That’s an interesting story.</span> <span id="s870">I know already what to do.</span> <span id="s871">I don’t answer nothing.</span> <span id="s872">What is he going to do but ---.</span> <span id="s873">I says I’m going, kill, kill me, what’s the difference?</span> <span id="s874">He went over to that Fiess and he told me,______ and Heil Hitler, you know, break bodice.</span> <span id="s875">Hey, listen, I have by me such a good faulker and so on and so on but he’s thinking he needs a lazarett.</span> <span id="s876">So let him go in.</span> <span id="s877">He says sh, sh.</span> <span id="s878">I won’t guarantee, not in that barrack.</span> <span id="s879">I want him in the lazarett.</span> <span id="s880">That’s the way he told me the story.</span> <span id="s881">I didn’t hear.</span> <span id="s882">You stay tomorrow in lager and you will go to the lazarett and don’t be afraid of nothing.</span> <span id="s883">Tomorrow they took me into that block 2, to that lazarett.</span> <span id="s884">Than that block 2 in lazarett in this bed was laying a man probably I have in the picture, that his sister, like that Stochman was from the men, the leader, his sister was from the women.</span> <span id="s885">Her brother was laying in one bed with something I sign here.</span> <span id="s886">They put me next to his bed and they also put me in something like 00 I don’t remember what it was, a sign.</span> <span id="s887">He, as he went to that camp in, how far was it?</span> <span id="s888">Across the street from his location to run around to those people.</span> <span id="s889">Then he went to him to the lazarett in block 2 also.</span> <span id="s890">He comes in, he looks around and he goes away.</span> <span id="s891">he wanted, usually from there, they didn’t take out.</span> <span id="s892">One day, I don’t know that but that’s what they told me, I was in the high fever.</span> <span id="s893">You have high fever, you shouldn’t know from it, and you don’t know where you stand.</span> <span id="s894">Let’s say every morning he came in high bush, v_______ how you feelo?</span> <span id="s895">Went away.</span> <span id="s896">He saw him going away already, thank God, but I was in very high fever.</span> <span id="s897">He came in and he asked something.</span> <span id="s898">Instead to say something, I swing with my arm.</span> <span id="s899">I don’t know, till today I don’t believe it but the next door man, when he get out, he said to my Uncle Morris, you know what your Brumula did?</span> <span id="s900">I don’t know of nothing.</span> <span id="s901">When I swung like this, of course I didn’t hit him, he said (female voice: he was delirious) in German, like the gendarme in German, du_______, that means you dog, a swine is like a pig, you had luck.</span> <span id="s902">If not for this, I don’t know of nothing.</span> <span id="s903">I can’t say nothing.</span> <span id="s904">I don’t want even to put in the record because ----.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: You don’t remember it?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: (He was delirious, he had periodic delirium) That’s what they said.</span> <span id="s907">You get out from the sickness, they give you three, four weeks, you can stay in the camp.</span> <span id="s908">A big deal, you can stay in the camp.</span> <span id="s909">Everybody wants to get out from the camp.</span> <span id="s910">The next day I’m going to work.</span> <span id="s911">He sees me, he yells at me.</span> <span id="s912">I didn’t answer.</span> <span id="s913">He went through 14 days with it.</span> <span id="s914">I stood and I worked, that’s all.</span> <span id="s915">The same story, when it came that typhus and everything, Trawniki, what I mentioned, there is Pl_______ another camp like this.</span> <span id="s916">We worked for Henklewerk.</span> <span id="s917">Henklewerk is a big air/space ----.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: German company, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: They, I don’t know for who they worked.</span> <span id="s920">One Sunday, and we heard about Pl_______, Trawniki, that they burned the camp because of the typhus, to the ground.</span> <span id="s921">One Sunday, that was in ’43, yeah, one Sunday, we are not going out to work.</span> <span id="s922">The guards like double or tripled who knows.</span> <span id="s923">There is standing already little pumps with gasoline to do us the same thing.</span> <span id="s924">People want already to jump on the wires.</span> <span id="s925">They say I rather get killed from the wire that he should kill me.</span> <span id="s926">All of a sudden, stop.</span> <span id="s927">What is the stop?</span> <span id="s928">That Fiess, that lagerfuhrer, he didn’t want to lose his post.</span> <span id="s929">As I mentioned, because where is he going to go.</span> <span id="s930">In the front, nobody want to go – all patriots up front.</span> <span id="s931">He’s something, had a conversation with Lublin with Henklewerk there and Henklewerk stopped it.</span> <span id="s932">They called to Germany, to the headquarters whatever that is.</span> <span id="s933">I don’t Know thE Story goes.</span> <span id="s934">The story ends that they stopped, they took away everything and they didn’t burn us.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: When was this, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Forty-three, I think, ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Late ’43, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: I wouldn’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Sometime in ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Sometime in ’43.</span> <span id="s941">They didn’t and the next day as usual, as before, whoever is sick stays in the barracks, whoever is good goes to work, thanks to Henklewerk and that SOB Fiess.</span> <span id="s942">Then in ’43, things changed it.</span> <span id="s943">That was camp, things changed.</span> <span id="s944">We were building the camp in the barrack because to say what will have to go.</span> <span id="s945">There is no_______.</span> <span id="s946">They probably were afraid of the partisans because when we walked to work, a lot of times disappeared and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s947">They had to cross the main road and this and that.</span> <span id="s948">They brought in a little town what they were still in that town; they brought them in.</span> <span id="s949">so they started to disappear so they figured different.</span> <span id="s950">Why here, be there.</span> <span id="s951">They build another camp.</span> <span id="s952">It became, instead of camp, became KZ.</span> <span id="s953">That means concentration camp.</span> <span id="s954">A lot of them have the KZ.</span> <span id="s955">Instead I have the number.</span> <span id="s956">In that time, from civil we changed, if it’s concentration camp, we had to change to the stripes.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: You had civilian clothes on, up to this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: In Budzyn, yes.</span> <span id="s959">Some civilian clothes was here marked a KZ.</span> <span id="s960">It was something and we came to the verrick which you’re familiar with what I mean the verrick.</span> <span id="s961">In the same time, no more Ukrainians but SS replaced the guard, no more Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s962">You can imagine SS and we were there.</span> <span id="s963">We were there and when it started more with the war and so on and so on and Germany is squeezed so they started little by little to liquidate that camp.</span> <span id="s964">Because they figured and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s965">As I said what they did there, they brought_______tanks, one soldier, we had to fix in the tanks from the Ukrainians’ Russia, they were pigs, dead ones.</span> <span id="s966">_______which we had a_______by that and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s967">Then from that KZ camp which it was in the veld, every time we start fight from that people to send some_______.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Oh, you started sending 500 people out from camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Every time, every time.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Did they know where they were going?</span> <span id="s971">Did anyone say where they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s973">One was going to another shtetl, one was going to another shtetl, where it was a camp like this.</span> <span id="s974">Finally, we are almost the last ones.</span> <span id="s975">They were sending to M__________, V________ which there is also Henklewerk and there is salt, where you taking out salt from the ground.</span> <span id="s976">There they got the KZ.</span> <span id="s977">It remains like the last groups.</span> <span id="s978">My uncle knew a little bit that Stochland so he always begged him; written in camp, was like a Jewish shtetl let’s say.</span> <span id="s979">We had our police, we had our leaders.</span> <span id="s980">Let’s say I had a complaint from you.</span> <span id="s981">I went in and I complained to______.</span> <span id="s982">In the nice Jewish way that ultimately they should know from it.</span> <span id="s983">So my uncle talked with that Stochland; I would like to go where you go.</span> <span id="s984">Besides this, if not, I would like you should not separate us, you should know it’s a father and son.</span> <span id="s985">It came before the last group to go where?</span> <span id="s986">To Majdanek.</span> <span id="s987">He said to my Uncle Morris, I can’t help no more.</span> <span id="s988">I wish I knew where I am going.</span> <span id="s989">So far, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s990">You see, even_______which they are here, from one family, the mother, the husband and wife and two little boys; they survived all.</span> <span id="s991">How,

<span id="s1007">It was like, you know, those trucks, open trucks and with wires around and the guards standing that you shouldn’t jump around.</span> <span id="s1008">They brought us to Majdanek.</span> <span id="s1009">We saw Majdanek, we didn’t see yet.</span> <span id="s1010">All those guards and all those fields.</span> <span id="s1011">Majdanek, if they didn’t ten fields in a crematorium, they didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s1012">They brought us in to field one.</span> <span id="s1013">That was a camp set for every field was a different field.</span> <span id="s1014">In that camp, they took us out to work within the camp.</span> <span id="s1015">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s1016">Across the wires, in another field we saw fellows, one without an arm, one without a leg, one saw.</span> <span id="s1017">We didn’t know who they were but they started rumors, they are Russians from the front.</span> <span id="s1018">They are prisoners,

working by the kitchen because they gave him a break but that time when we went to the work, there was no more on the calendar to work.</span> <span id="s1025">His foot wasn’t so – so we get out on that appell.</span> <span id="s1026">It was healed, he wasn’t in the hospital at camp, he was healed.</span> <span id="s1027">They go and they take us to Majdanek out the next day and to separate us

out, want to be together.</span> <span id="s1031">I didn’t know it’s in the place, I thought maybe they send away.</span> <span id="s1032">The policy was to look that you should be inside.</span> <span id="s1033">As I said, ine fight with the hunger, with the weather, with the cold was ---.</span> <span id="s1034">But you tried, you push yourself.</span> <span id="s1035">He is behind.</span>
