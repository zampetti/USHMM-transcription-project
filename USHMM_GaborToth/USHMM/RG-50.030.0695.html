Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: And why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Because when Christmas – when they on the first night Christmas and they saw a Jew, was lucky, you are lucky, because Jesus was a Jew.</span> <span id="s349">So then they were, come in, come in, they have cookies, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s350">I didn’t know why, but then when I grew up, I find out why, because Jesus were a Jew, and according to the thing, they say maybe this is Jesus, you know, a reincarnation of him.</span> <span id="s351">So this is very nice to me.</span></p>

stranger over there.</span> <span id="s358">And that’s why most of the Jews, they spoke very bad Polish, because they spoke only Yiddish.</span> <span id="s359">Because you don’t like them, they don’t like you.</span> <span id="s360">And the whole day, wherever you go in this, you could hear Żyd – I don’t know if you understand, Żyd go to Palestine; Jew, stinkin’ Jew, go to Palestine.</span> <span

even though they were very religious, they didn’t have much choice as far as schooling for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: R-Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: First thing, you have to go to school –</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: – because you have to read and write in this language where you live.</span> <span id="s405">So you have to learn.</span> <span id="s406">But only [indecipherable] Jews always spoke Yiddish language.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: What were your experiences like

treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s421">So where did this come from then?</span> <span id="s422">If the teachers, which were – represent authority, were decent, why do you think the other kind of behavior was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yeah, but why – why do we have it here too?</span> <span id="s424">The Jews are rich, and the Jews are this – you know,

officers.</span> <span id="s707">They used to say go, move, move.</span> <span id="s708">We are not killing.</span> <span id="s709">But the others coming in and they are the – so, everybody run.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Well, Manya(ph) mentioned an instance where her sister was ordered – was it Esther?</span> <span id="s711">Was ordered to go to the town square?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: This I n – I knew – I knew something about it.</span> <span id="s713">I knew something, but I don’t know what happened, and why.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Did you run separately from your sisters, or did you, as a family, go together?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: We went together.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: You went together?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: We went together, except during working, I told you what’s happened, the bomb, and they disappeared, you know, and nobody will know where you are.</span> <span id="s718">People [indecipherable] to somebody – somebody else there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: So the bomb was falling before you left the San – before you crossed the San River, or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: No, we – after, after.</span> <span id="s721">Before already – before the Russian came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: While we were on the Russian side, the Russian wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s724">Was all Ukrainian, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: So this after –</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: We went to a small town, a Terapa(ph) – Teraba(ph), something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Terra(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Ter – yeah Terra(ph).</span> <span id="s731">Terra(ph), I think it’s t-r-w-a, something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s733">And why that place?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: We supposedly have some of our rel – our relatives, I mean, through marriage relatives.</span> <span id="s735">And they’re in there, they won’t let us in.</span> <span id="s736">We have a – still a – a horse, and a wagon, and w – and – and we were sl-sleeping outside.</span> <span id="s737">Says yeah, okay, in the backyard you can sleep out on the grass, over there.</span> <span id="s738">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: But they wouldn’t let you in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: No.</span> <span id="s741">They had other people already.</span> <span id="s742">That’s what he said.</span> <span id="s743">There was jealousy, ma – my father was rich.</span> <span id="s744">But anyway, in the morning we got up and want to continue running; a wheel is missing from the whole thing.</span> <span id="s745">We know who took it, they took it, yeah, because they had horses too, and cars.</span> <span id="s746">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: And what good would this wheel do them?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: No, because we thought maybe we could go – but we were on the border almost, almost.</span> <span id="s749">So we thought maybe we could go a little deeper away to the – towards Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: I understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: What I don’t understand is when they took the wheel away, what value is that wheel to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Well, they were staying over there, they didn’t want to move, they are – they went – because there’s the Russians coming, they are back home.</span> <span id="s754">And this happened a couple days later, Russia came in.</span> <span id="s755">So they were there.</span> <span id="s756">We didn’t have nothing there [indecipherable] in the house, and I don’t know how long we were there, for a while.</span> <span id="s757">Then when the Russia tell us, go in there, they call it shal – shal – shalone(ph) – shallon(ph)?</span> <span id="s758">Their train, cattle train.</span> <span id="s759">And they took us to – t-to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Tell me, how did that happen?</span> <span id="s761">Why would they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Fir-First of all, we were not any more a citizen of any country, because the – our country was occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: And he needed people.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Who needed people?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Stalin needed people.</span> <span id="s767">Is it to work, or is – or is it in – in a gold mine, not – a coal mine, so he says, whatever.</span> <span id="s768">In the end, he probably think now, we in Russia, we became communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Did your parents have any views on communism, pre-war?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Yeah, we all.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: We all have, yeah.</span> <span id="s773">We – we – we liked – we didn’t like communism as such, but to be free, we are the same.</span> <span id="s774">Me and you are the same.</span> <span id="s775">This what all they liked about it.</span> <span id="s776">And then you bit in the beautiful apple, and the apple was very sour, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: So, it was – it was not having had direct experience yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s780">Oh, what did I want to ask?</span> <span id="s781">But it still sounds a little funny to me: I can’t understand the logic.</span> <span id="s782">Did your relatives, the ones that were jealous of you, did they betray you to the Russians and say take –</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: – you know, so how – why was it that you would be taken?</span> <span id="s785">Why would –</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Not only we.</span> <span id="s787">There are – all of them were escape from Germany to Ukraine, they take all of them, those people away.</span> <span id="s788">And especially rich.</span> <span id="s789">We were rich.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Well, how did they know?</span> <span id="s791">How did the Russians know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: How they – everybody knew, til they me-me-mention the name, only the name, they knew, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s794">So this – the village wasn’t that far from Sanok?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: No.</span> <span id="s796">I would say by car now, maybe 20 minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Oh, not far at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Make – may – may – maybe more – more or less, but – by car.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: And the Germans, with cars and tanks, for them it’s a couple hours there.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s802">So – but when the Russians first came, did you feel some relief?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s804">Oh, we were so happy.</span> <span id="s805">At least we could go on.</span> <span id="s806">You’re not afraid to be shot, you’re not afraid to be kicked around, or nothing.</span> <span id="s807">We was very happy, sure.</span> <span id="s808">Freedom, first time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: You said you went with suitcases when you left your home.</span> <span id="s810">What had happened to your father’s businesses?</span> <span id="s811">It – what was it – what was – I mean, when the Germans came, how could he be a banker any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: He wasn’t, he left everything; the house and the bank, the – everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s814">Manya(ph) mentioned that by that point the bank had gone under.</span> <span id="s815">Was that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: It had gone under?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Okay, he had lost the bank?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Yeah, before the war, we – again, because people didn’t buy from us any more, and – not buy, I mean deal with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Is that so, was because of that reason?</span> <span id="s822">Okay.</span> <span id="s823">And what about the lumberyards, the lumber mills?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: No, they were still – I don’t know [indecipherable] s-still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Did your life at home – I’m going back now to Sanok, before the war, when things started to go badly, did you feel that at home where – was the money tighter?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: I – I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: We were kids, but you – you lived the same thing, we had the same, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: We knew that something is going wrong here.</span> <span id="s831">Everybody was losing already.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Did your mother have help at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: And always have help.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s837">Were there many people who helped her out, or was it

of.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: And a huge household.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Yeah, well, Father could afford it.</span> <span id="s843">We –

If you want, you paid a couple dollars.</span> <span id="s847">But so long as they have something to eat, and he – and there – there – we buy them a dress, or whatever, this was enough,

have to paint [indecipherable] expensive.</span> <span id="s890">Cement house.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s892">Oh, I had a – I had a question in my mind, and then I – it just – it just slipped me.</span> <span id="s893">Going back to – going back to the village that you were in on the Ukrainian side, did you ever experience these types of – first of all, when we talked earlier, you know, about Poles saying all of these terrible things when you were growing up, and not feeling safe, was it the same thing – wa-was the same thing true of others?</span> <span id="s894">Like, would the Ukrainians talk in the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: No, much nicer.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Much nicer.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Much nicer, we

ask is you said that 90 percent of Sanok was Ukrainian.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: So the Ukrainians in Sanok behaved differently than the ones in this village?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s910">Why?</span> <span id="s911">Because the Russians were – came in, over – over – over maybe a couple days before he came in, so we all go free, all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s912">It was the promise, everybody have the same income.</span> <span id="s913">So, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Yeah.</span></p>

your experience in Poland before the war, your experiences in Russia, and the things you learned after the war.</span> <span id="s1803">Those are three distinct parts, but what would you want them to understand about each of those segments of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: I don’t think they’ll ever understand, thank God, thank God.</span> <span id="s1805">You grow up here, you just

id="s1808">Straw on a piece of wood.</span> <span id="s1809">And no underwear, in the same uniform you were sleeping and eating.</span> <span id="s1810">When an inspection from the United States came, before he came there, everybody get a piece of white linen, put it over here, make believe we have a shirt.</span> <span id="s1811">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: Di – I didn’t ask you much about your army day – your year in the – in the Soviet army.</span> <span id="s1813">Did you do any fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: No, we were just training, and then keep, you know, the prisoner – watching prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: So you were watching people who had been like

id="s1821">Q: You were watching Russian prisoners?</span> <span id="s1822">A: Yeah, it was not prisoners, it was – it was a torture.</span> <span id="s1823">What it was is, I had 16 years old and 90 years old, all kind.</span> <span id="s1824">This is Stalin had thing to scare people to talk.</span> <span id="s1825">You couldn’t talk about Stalin bad thing.</span> <span id="s1826">So to scare you, almost every month, or every week sometimes, somebody has to disappear from your neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1827">So this is you keep your mouth shut.</span> <span id="s1828">The way they did it, never did – never arrest you at your house, or never at work.</span> <span id="s1829">On the way home from work, usually the girls [indecipherable] girls start to talk to you, or they just have to ask you something, in the police station.</span> <span id="s1830">You never came back.</span> <span id="s1831">Used to [indecipherable] I met them over there, you know, I was a good guy, because I – I was part of them, almost, but they didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1832">So they told me, one – a couple over there, from the wedding, they took him, for no reason [indecipherable] the people, just to scare.</span> <span id="s1833">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: So they were just normal people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1836">I told you I had a friend of mine, became very friendly.</span> <span id="s1837">He was that commissioner, whate-whatever you call him –</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: Commissar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: – mayor.</span> <span id="s1840">So I spoke with him a lot, he says, we have to.</span> <span id="s1841">We have to do it.</span> <span id="s1842">Li-Like, for example, we have – you had lawyers, right?</span> <span id="s1843">If you go to court over there at the time, they had – they had lawyers.</span> <span id="s1844">The lawyers can’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s1845">If you tri – the lawyer will try to show you are innocent, so you are against the government.</span> <span id="s1846">So you’ll be punished.</span> <span id="s1847">So you just staying there like a – like mummy, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1848">And listen.</span> <span id="s1849">And this is the way –</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Well, I understand what you mean by saying it would be good if they never have to understand it – that is young people.</span> <span id="s1851">Do you think that then – I mean, it’s – it’s one thing when you have someone who’s gone through an experience, there’s a cost in remembering, there’s a price to remember.</span> <span id="s1852">Are you saying it’s better that people are never really informed of these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: Not informed, yes.</span> <span id="s1854">But – but they wouldn’t understand you, because I don’t believe it any more.</span> <span id="s1855">You had to go through, you know, because it’s a – impossible –</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: – to – to – to accept, not to be a human being where you are one.</span> <span id="s1858">Treat you like a – you are – yeah – o-or in the army – not in the army himself, in the toilets.</span> <span id="s1859">There was a big hole with a piece of wood.</span> <span id="s1860">And male or female, we all sitting together.</span> <span id="s1861">Come on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: So you – you – you are used to almost nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: It’s very hard for people who have not been reduced to almost nothing, to know what it’s like.</span> <span id="s1865">And I suspect it’s very hard to have words to put to that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: We were in the army, I told you [indecipherable] there, watching those prisoners.</span> <span id="s1867">It was winter.</span> <span id="s1868">For three months we didn’t had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1869">No – nobody cared to get – get to us, so we finally yu – saw a field where the farmers took off their cabbage.</span> <span id="s1870">Was no cabbage there, the roots.</span> <span id="s1871">We dig it out the roots, nothing wash it [indecipherable] shanell(ph), they call shanell(ph) the uniform [indecipherable] this is the soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: [indecipherable] they just couldn’t understand, they thought that somebody make up story.</span> <span id="s1874">Or – or like my brother [indecipherable] you know, the showers.</span> <span id="s1875">Forget about shower [indecipherable] we had a – not a hole, a piece of stone over there, with a couple blankets hanging, they’re outside a fire.</span> <span id="s1876">You put snow, and from the snow we get steam.</span> <span id="s1877">And this was our shower.</span> <span id="s1878">You didn’t get sick, you went without shoes, without the winter.</span> <span id="s1879">This were your shower.</span> <span id="s1880">Could you believe it?</span> <span id="s1881">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: [indecipherable] remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: What was it like when you live in the United States?</span> <span id="s1885">Does it – did it ever feel lonely that there wasn’t anybody you could talk about these things to?</span> <span id="s1886">Or that – who’d understand.</span> <span id="s1887">Not that you’d need to talk about it, but who could understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: Only the foreigner, who went through more or less the same thing, will understand, yeah.</span> <span id="s1889">Not from the other side.</span> <span id="s1890">This was paradise.</span> <span id="s1891">It was – here, when we came, we just couldn’t believe it, we had the – we couldn’t believe it, we are talking with a nice human being, you know.</span> <span id="s1892">Thank God.</span> <span id="s1893">Food all over.</span> <span id="s1894">You don’t have to stay in line, like you used to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: You used to stay in lines for hours, and then they haven’t got any more.</span> <span id="s1897">Like I – I – I love watermelons.</span> <span id="s1898">I says, for one week or two weeks I was living only on watermelons.</span> <span id="s1899">I had no money, I had nothing to buy [indecipherable] the watermelons were growing over there, just growing, you know, wild.</span> <span id="s1900">And this the only food what I ate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: Do you think – are there – well, here’s a – a question that’s a little provocative.</span> <span id="s1902">Do you think that there are people who endured the Holocaust, who were never close to Russia at all, who don’t understand what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: I’m sure there are plenty of it.</span> <span id="s1904">For one reason that I – I-I-I tried to understand, is it true?</span> <span id="s1905">I – I start not to believe what [indecipherable] look at me, and I’m still here, and I have a office, with kid, with children.</span> <span id="s1906">How could I live?</span> <span id="s1907">But yeah – I mean, you start to think, you go [indecipherable] details.</span> <span id="s1908">You went through more than y-you could take, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Do you have – do you have – sometimes Russian Jews who have emigrated to the United States have felt alienated because people haven’t understood their experiences.</span> <span id="s1910">There’s – I’m talking in the 70s, in the 80s, and the 90s and so on.</span> <span id="s1911">Do you think there’s something to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: The worst thing is, if you can’t share with nobody.</span> <span id="s1913">It’s always, you know, locked in the – in the – and you ask yourself what has happened [indecipherable] is it true?</span> <span id="s1914">Some years, are you still alive, you know?</span> <span id="s1915">So it’s very hard to tell my kids.</span> <span id="s1916">Okay, sure [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1917">You can’t.</span> <span id="s1918">If you don’t go through, you don’t understand, yeah.</span> <span id="s1919">Same thing with a patient, if you never have pain, oh yeah, don’t worry about it, couple minutes you’ll be finish.</span> <span id="s1920">For you a couple minutes, but the patient is suffering couple hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1923">And same thing [indecipherable] not expected to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: Did you learn something about yourself as a person, having gone through these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: Oh, a lot.</span> <span id="s1926">I think a lot.</span> <span id="s1927">I don’t know why, it’s all – in all of us.</span> <span id="s1928">We afraid to throw out the piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1929">It wa – it’s just, it’s too expensive – no, it’s not expensive, it’s – it’s bread, you know, it’s – it’s something like a holy thing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: And then you did a thing for everything.</span> <span id="s1932">Every step you’re doing here, you can’t believe it, that it – you – I used to – I here, free?</span> <span id="s1933">Do whatever I wanted, you know.</span> <span id="s1934">A-Alive.</span> <span id="s1935">And to me at least, start to believe you have a God.</span> <span id="s1936">You have somebody who does it for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: So it strengthened your belief?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: Yes, yes, yes, more, more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: But somebody would say, if He was a God, how did He allow this suffering?</span> <span id="s1940">I mean, it’s the perennial question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: Yeah, everybody ask it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: Everybody asks this question.</span> <span id="s1943">How will you answer them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: You look for a – for wa – answers.</span> <span id="s1945">You ask, maybe, maybe this guy did something different.</span> <span id="s1946">Maybe this guy did some – something [indecipherable] to somebody, that’s why he has to be punished.</span> <span id="s1947">Maybe.</span> <span id="s1948">You don’t know.</span> <span id="s1949">I never spe – spoke with God.</span> <span id="s1950">I try.</span> <span id="s1951">He has no telephone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: Or the line is busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: I don’t think the line is busy, but – but you mean, somebody who is victimized could be – could be responsible for that?</span> <span id="s1955">They – they’re guilty of – themselves, of being victimized?</span> <span id="s1956">Is that what you’re saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: Maybe.</span> <span id="s1958">I mean, if you going back to God now, make believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: We don’t know why – you ask the same question.</span> <span id="s1961">I was – I had the prisoners, I mean, medical thing, it – only killers, maximum, right.</span> <span id="s1962">But the people there were 90 years old, 70 [indecipherable] never got sick.</span> <span id="s1963">Why is this [indecipherable] die?</span> <span id="s1964">That’s the question, who shall I ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: The same thing here, it’s hard to tell why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: But my question to you is more for those people who want to dismiss that there is a God, and say, if the – why – if there is one, why did he allow such suffering?</span> <span id="s1968">And you say your faith was strengthened.</span> <span id="s1969">How do you answer that question for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: Well, to me, what I went through is many miracles.</span> <span id="s1971">Who else [indecipherable] miracle than God.</span> <span id="s1972">Somebody higher and stronger than me helped me to go through this.</span> <span id="s1973">Wha – two slices of bread a day for two years or three years?</span> <span id="s1974">Working [indecipherable] and – and it’s not that – you have to finish this amount.</span> <span id="s1975">If you don’t finish, you can work all night.</span> <span id="s1976">Otherwise you wouldn’t get nothing.</span> <span id="s1977">It’s not like eight hours [indecipherable] eight hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Yeah, it’s a quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1980">So the – the – you had so many questions.</span> <span id="s1981">[indecipherable] some are why.</span> <span id="s1982">Why did this guy die, he was so strong, working with me?</span> <span id="s1983">How come I am and he is alive?</span> <span id="s1984">Why – you know, and it’s so many questions you can’t answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: And like everybody else, you have to believe in something stronger than you are.</span> <span id="s1987">So where you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1989">To the telephone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1991">You can’t afford [indecipherable] the telephone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: Any final thoughts?</span> <span id="s1993">Any – anything else you’d want to say for the kids, for the grandkids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: I’m just – I just thank God they don’t have to go through it, and I have to understand.</span> <span id="s1995">Thank God for that.</span> <span id="s1996">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1997">And everybody, they don’t know what kind of country we have, really.</span> <span id="s1998">You’re born in good, so you don’t know, the same thing.</span> <span id="s1999">At home I didn’t know what the – what mean hungry.</span> <span id="s2000">I didn’t the guy he is hungry, because hungry you don’t see.</span> <span id="s2001">You see he is working, I am working.</span> <span id="s2002">If he [indecipherable] know what hunger means.</span> <span id="s2003">The same thing with this.</span> <span id="s2004">I wished I never really understand it, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: Thank you very much.</span>
