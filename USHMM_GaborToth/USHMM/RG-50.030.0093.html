And I come from a family of three children, my parents, my grandparents, bunch of aunts, uncles, lot of cousins.</span> <span id="s21">As a matter of fact, my mother's family--all of them--settled in Teplice-Šanov after the First World War.</span> <span id="s22">And my father was a poor refugee who just happen to come to Teplice, just to look for a job.</span> <span id="s23">And fell in love with my mother.</span> <span id="s24">And the rest of this is history.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Tell me about Teplice.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Teplice was a very good city.</span> <span id="s27">I mean, I grew up there; went to elementary school, went to high school there.</span> <span id="s28">And what's amazing about it is, I never encountered anti...antisemitism.</span> <span id="s29">I mean, I never knew, even... Matter of fact, I never even knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s30">Because I didn't know Judaism is a connotation with a religion, or anything else.</span> <span id="s31">So I was Jew by religion, but it was not part of my personality.</span> <span id="s32">And I must have been, maybe, 11 or 12 years old and my best friend ... His name is--I shan't forget--his name was Egon.</span> <span id="s33">And as we playing in our backyard... Because I..</span> <span id="s34">.</span> <span id="s35">my father build me cages for rabbits.</span> <span id="s36">And I had so many rabbits.</span> <span id="s37">So during this play-thing, or whatever it was, he says to me, "Beno, my father says this you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s38">Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s39">And I said to him, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s40">Because I never realized, as he asked my religious affiliation, or it was a part of a playing thing.</span> <span id="s41">And is the last time I saw Egon.</span> <span id="s42">And never saw Egon since; and he was a very good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s43">And I always asked my parents what is the reason, how come I didn't see Egon.</span> <span id="s44">They never told me why.</span> <span id="s45">And I lost Egon.</span> <span id="s46">And this was...and as a childhood was quite a good one until it was getting bad.</span> <span id="s47">And college, I couldn't go to anymore; so I went to Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Tell us about Budapest, and what you did there as a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: At...at Budapest, this was at that time the capital.</span> <span id="s50">It was almost like Paris, you know.</span> <span id="s51">It was a very lively, very vivacious city.</span> <span id="s52">Not for me, because...uh...financially, I couldn't afford anything else.</span> <span id="s53">But it was fairly good to me.</span> <span id="s54">Even in poverty, it was fairly good enough.</span> <span id="s55">And through...I don't know...circumstances, I got a job in the movies.</span> <span id="s56">I played in extras.</span> <span id="s57">I met S. S. Cuddles.</span> <span id="s58">I think here in America, they called him S. S. Cuddles.</span> <span id="s59">Actually, his name is S. S. Sagal.</span> <span id="s60">I made two movies with him...with him; and a actress at that time which was very, very popular in Europe--[Barsa Nirosi (ph)].</span> <span id="s61">By the way, the reason also I got the job is because I was at that time bilingual.</span> <span id="s62">So the movies, at that time, were made in Hungarian and in German.</span> <span id="s63">So I could speak both languages.</span> <span id="s64">So when we took one take, I didn't have to change roles.</span> <span id="s65">I could stay in the same role for the German take and for the Hungarian take.</span> <span id="s66">And...and plus we played with Hans Virbis (ph).</span> <span id="s67">He's supposed to make a picture with Martha Eggar, except at that time she fell in love with Jan Kippur.</span> <span id="s68">And she came to America, and she left the Jan Kippur in America.</span> <span id="s69">And...and this was my youth, 'til my parents came...also came to Hungary; and it was getting... because Czechoslovakia became very unpleasant at that time.</span> <span id="s70">And...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: What was happening to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Uh...My parents came and tried to settle in.</span> <span id="s73">.</span> <span id="s74">in Hungary.</span> <span id="s75">They felt this maybe in Hungarian, because at that time Horthy was more fascistic.</span> <span id="s76">So they felt that maybe Hitler's gonna spare Hungary.</span> <span id="s77">And plus, my father had a older brother living in Hungary.</span> <span id="s78">And he couldn't get any...in that between Hungary and Czechoslovakia, it was not very pleasant circumstances.</span> <span id="s79">There were already talking about war rumbling.</span> <span id="s80">So...uh...it was very rough, and my father couldn't get the papers to, uh...couldn't get papers to become a citizen or...or allowed to be stayed...allowed to stay there.</span> <span id="s81">So, through some acquaintances, my mother knew Mr. Beck.</span> <span id="s82">I think...I think Beck was at that time Foreign Minister of Hungary.And she went to his office, and she bribed him quite--I don't know, let's call it bribe--when she gave him a tremendous amount of money.</span> <span id="s83">At that time, this was a big money for us; because it's all what my parents almost had.</span> <span id="s84">And after this, she gets an invitation and my father gets an invitation to a dinner which is in honor of Mr. Beck.</span> <span id="s85">So they were very elated, because they thought this gonna be the chance that he'd finally...he'd gonna give a..</span> <span id="s86">.</span> <span id="s87">the papers which they needed to stay in Hungary.</span> <span id="s88">So during the conversation... During this dinner, he knocked on the glass; and he says, "I have another question to ask.</span> <span id="s89">I want to ask Mr. Helmer how come he gave me this tremendous amount of money."</span> <span id="s90">So it's a good thing that my father said, "I'm giving it to the Hungarian Red Cross."</span> <span id="s91">And with this sentence, he lost all his money.</span> <span id="s92">Because Mr. Beck didn't take the money.</span> <span id="s93">The Hungarian Red Cross got the money.</span> <span id="s94">And my parents were deported.</span> <span id="s95">And it was my parents, my brother and my sister; and they were deported to Poland.</span> <span id="s96">Because they had a chance to go to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s97">You had a chance to go to any border they choose; and they choose Poland.</span> <span id="s98">And shortly after this, I was deported also.</span> <span id="s99">Matter of fact, I shall never forget; I came home from a movie which I saw--Modern Times, with Charlie Chaplin.</span> <span id="s100">This was the movie I saw.</span> <span id="s101">And I came home; and they woke me up during the night and arrested me.</span> <span id="s102">And they deported me to Poland.</span> <span id="s103">And I wound up in the city of _ód_.</span> <span id="s104">Always almost exactly the Friday before the war.</span> <span id="s105">And before the war.</span> <span id="s106">So we stayed in somebody's apartment.</span> <span id="s107">I don't know who it was, where it was apartment.</span> <span id="s108">By that time, the German war started.</span> <span id="s109">I think it's October 1st, 1939.</span> <span id="s110">The occupation was immediate.</span> <span id="s111">We couldn't escape anyplace, anyways.</span> <span id="s112">And, uh...because of financial difficulties, at that time was nothing left.</span> <span id="s113">So...because a lot of people escaped.</span> <span id="s114">So we found a place in _ód_ on...in a attic.</span> <span id="s115">Matter of fact, it was...the attic was so low that I don't think we ever...</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s117">I can't hear you.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">1 István Csáky was Foreign Minister of Hungary from 1938-1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">2 Germany invaded Poland in September 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: The attic was very low.</span> <span id="s121">This was on the roof, underneath the roof; so we couldn't even stand up.</span> <span id="s122">So we only could stand up where the pitchwork came together.</span> <span id="s123">Otherwise, we always had to hunch over.</span> <span id="s124">And it was...the whole room consisted of one double bed and a big basket--like, uh...like a steamer trunk.</span> <span id="s125">And this where...all our possessions were in this steamer trunk; and that's the place where I slept.</span> <span id="s126">Because all four of them slept in this bed.</span> <span id="s127">And just when the ghetto was formed, this was part of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s128">This attic was part of the ghetto, _ód_ ghetto.</span> <span id="s129">So we didn't have to move.</span> <span id="s130">We stayed there, which was uh dire circumstances.</span> <span id="s131">No toilet, which was four story down in...in the yard.</span> <span id="s132">No water, which we had to carry in pails all the way up to...four flights.</span> <span id="s133">Bed chambers [NB: chamber pots] at night time, and emptying.</span> <span id="s134">It was horrible circumstances.</span> <span id="s135">And couple of weeks after, my father was arrested.</span> <span id="s136">No, I'm...I'm... I have to retract.</span> <span id="s137">I have to retract a little bit.</span> <span id="s138">Before we went in a ghetto, before the Germans came, my father went back to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s139">And he was joined the underground in Czechoslovakia; and got himself a job through his brother-in- law, through my uncle, in an insurance company.</span> <span id="s140">In a big insurance company.</span> <span id="s141">And he changed his name.</span> <span id="s142">He got papers.</span> <span id="s143">His name was Pollack.</span> <span id="s144">Mr. Pollack, a widower with two children.</span> <span id="s145">And he...he was quite active in the underground.</span> <span id="s146">In one of the newsletters--the office newsletters--there was a letter written as...as...a letter to the newspaper, or a letter to the editor.</span> <span id="s147">It says, "How come there is a man here with allegedly two...a widower with alleged two children, but we feel he's here under different circumstances?"</span> <span id="s148">So he felt this letter was written about him.</span> <span id="s149">So he packed up; and through the underground he... They gave him money to smuggle it out of Hungary, to bring it to...to smuggle it out of Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s151">Smuggling what?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Money.</span> <span id="s153">Cash for the underground, to be...underground in Poland.</span> <span id="s154">So they gave him money.</span> <span id="s155">So he got money belts around him and he... Plus the shoes.</span> <span id="s156">The shoes was...instead of leather, the...they stuff--all the big denominations they stuffed in in the shoes.</span> <span id="s157">And plus, wherever they could, they taped money to him.</span> <span id="s158">And they smuggled him to back to Poland.</span> <span id="s159">Except, on the border they caught him.</span> <span id="s160">And they caught him...and not only... This was not the German who caught him; it was the Polish who caught him.</span> <span id="s161">They took all his money away.</span> <span id="s162">Everything take his money away from him.</span> <span id="s163">Only thing they didn't find was the money in his shoes.</span> <span id="s164">And they sent him back to Germany.</span> <span id="s165">So when he was back in Germany, he smuggled himself back--finally lucky--back to...to Poland.</span> <span id="s166">Because of this...all this walking what he did, he rubbed his soles through.</span> <span id="s167">And matter of fact, the cash he had had holes in it because of...of the walking.</span> <span id="s168">So, actually, the money was...was worthless, or much less worth than it was supposed to be.</span> <span id="s169">And he stayed in the city of Krak...uh, Kraków.</span> <span id="s170">And after this, there was a struggle between the fraction [NB: faction] of the underground; between the Russian fraction and the English fraction.</span> <span id="s171">So anyways he came and joined us in _ód_.</span> <span id="s172">And this where finally the war caught on.</span> <span id="s173">We wind up in the ghetto, which was 28 Francziskanska Ulica.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Tell us about...tell us about life in the ghetto, in addition to the attic.</span> <span id="s175">What was your daily life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Now, our daily life was...uh... I mean, the daily life was...uh...the daily life was--not only us and everybody else--was to...to find food.</span> <span id="s177">The struggle was to find food; because we were constantly hungry.</span> <span id="s178">I mean, hunger was the pri...primary requisite just of survival.</span> <span id="s179">And...and the only thing...I mean, to compensate hunger, we were drinking water.</span> <span id="s180">I mean, water's fine, fills the stomach; but you're still hungry.</span> <span id="s181">So Father got a job to supply groceries.</span> <span id="s182">You know, whatever was there, to certain outlets which was giving the...the...which were giving out.</span> <span id="s183">So...so sometime he gets a little bit more flour; because that's all what he was delivering-- flour.</span> <span id="s184">So we had a little bit more flour; so Mother used to make a paste and make something like a Matzah or something out of it.</span> <span id="s185">I don't know what she did about it.</span> <span id="s186">I left quite early in 1941.</span> <span id="s187">I already got a job...or 1942, I got a job from a man--name is Goodman.</span> <span id="s188">And he got me a job outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s189">I was working for...for...for the Germans.</span> <span id="s190">So what was...I was working in a..</span> <span id="s191">.</span> <span id="s192">because I was studying architecture.</span> <span id="s193">So they needed some kind of building, the Germans.</span> <span id="s194">So they took a forced labor out of the ghetto, so we should work in the...in the...in the construction there.</span> <span id="s195">Since I had a so-called background of two days, so...so (laughing) so they made me in charge of it.</span> <span id="s196">But what's only good about it was this: they gave us a half a loaf of bread coming home.</span> <span id="s197">So we sustained ourself, at least, with this half a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s198">Mother sliced...sliced it very thinly, or she made bread...uh...soup out of it.</span> <span id="s199">She boiled water and put the bread in it; and that's all what we had.</span> <span id="s200">It's bread soup.</span> <span id="s201">Except it was expanded so much, it became more filling.</span> <span id="s202">And it was...I mean, uh...plus I mean that what's bad about it was is also bodies...lot of bodies all over.</span> <span id="s203">Wherever you went, you saw bodies dying.</span> <span id="s204">And it's becomes part of it.</span> <span id="s205">You know, [the] first two, three or four, you find them as a shock.</span> <span id="s206">But later, you find them...it's...you gets quite used to them.</span> <span id="s207">It's...it's...it's like part of your nature.</span> <span id="s208">I mean, you just see a body and you disassociate yourself completely from it.</span> <span id="s209">It's...it's...it's...it's completely somebody else.</span> <span id="s210">It's...it's has nothing to do with you.</span> <span id="s211">Filth was also tremendous.</span> <span id="s212">Filth.</span> <span id="s213">It was filthy.</span> <span id="s214">It was filth even the building where we lived.</span> <span id="s215">I mean, in the winter time.</span> <span id="s216">I mean, the toilet was...it was...it was ice.</span> <span id="s217">It was all ice; and then the feces and the urine all over.</span> <span id="s218">Was overflowing...overflowing there.</span> <span id="s219">And...and sometime, they took you to forced labor.</span> <span id="s220">I mean, one incident happened.</span> <span id="s221">They...they took us into a home.</span> <span id="s222">The German came and they...they lined everybody up.</span> <span id="s223">They lined everybody up.</span> <span id="s224">And there was...you know this was like in a semi-circle.</span> <span id="s225">You were standing in a semi-circle; and there was a lady there with a child.</span> <span id="s226">And, uh...(deep sigh) (deep sigh) And he ask, "Whose, this child?"</span> <span id="s227">And the woman who was the mother, she did not admit the child.</span> <span id="s228">So he took the child by the legs, and he swung it against the wall.</span> <span id="s229">And he killed the child.</span> <span id="s230">And I looked at the mother; and it was like somebody else's.</span> <span id="s231">It wasn't her child.</span> <span id="s232">She completely cut this child off...out of her emotions.</span> <span id="s233">She cut this child off completely away.</span> <span id="s234">And I realized at that time the self-survivals is of most...more primary in your life.</span> <span id="s235">It's more than...than even your own child!</span> <span id="s236">And this was just terrible.</span> <span id="s237">So this was one of the experiences.</span> <span id="s238">I got a job aft...also to empty cesspools.</span> <span id="s239">Because they used this as fertilizers at that time.</span> <span id="s240">So to empty a cesspool, they gave me a job.</span> <span id="s241">They gave me a pot--a cooking pot.</span> <span id="s242">And this is how I was emptying cesspools.</span> <span id="s243">In front, went into the hole up to the waist, whatever; how you stayed in it.</span> <span id="s244">And, uh...you emptied it into a bucket.</span> <span id="s245">And later, two men took the bucket and emptied it in those containers--metal containers.</span> <span id="s246">This was one of the jobs they gave us.</span> <span id="s247">I was...I had a job cutting roots out of...you know, they'd be cutting down trees and...and excavating the roots.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">And I think they made camphor out of it.</span> <span id="s249">I don't know; some kind of chemicals they made out of it.</span> <span id="s250">So they gave us ax...ax and shovels.</span> <span id="s251">And it's very hard to dig a tree.</span> <span id="s252">So if you didn't do it, we got a hit a few times.</span> <span id="s253">You know, it seems they had a quota.</span> <span id="s254">We had to do a quota.</span> <span id="s255">So this was one of the more pleasantness thing of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s256">So this was it.</span> <span id="s257">Was only survival.</span> <span id="s258">My father was getting weaker and weaker.</span> <span id="s259">And once in a while they came down, they closed off the building.</span> <span id="s260">They closed off the block.</span> <span id="s261">And they took the men or women; and if the people looked sick, unhealthy, as they just took them away.</span> <span id="s262">To regress, before they go...close...closed the ghetto, my father's youngest brother went also to Poland.</span> <span id="s263">Because my father was there, so thought he gonna be there.</span> <span id="s264">And he decide, when the German marched in, this he gonna escape toward Russia.</span> <span id="s265">So had a..</span> <span id="s266">.</span> <span id="s267">a horse and buggy, or horse and carriage or something.</span> <span id="s268">To see his wife and two children--my cousin Lisa and the boy.</span> <span id="s269">Went towards Russia; and they froze to death in...in the...in the [Bergen (ph)].</span> <span id="s270">We just found it out by coincident.</span> <span id="s271">Matter of fact, we... Not true.</span> <span id="s272">I found it out after the war; because somebody knew them.</span> <span id="s273">This they froze to death, just to...it was so cold, it was bitter cold.</span> <span id="s274">And...and it seems like they fell asleep, and they never woke up.</span> <span id="s275">And on the ghetto again, so this was the job.</span> <span id="s276">So finally I got a job through Mr. Goodman; and I met somebody in the underground.</span> <span id="s277">A French lady.</span> <span id="s278">I never knew her second name.</span> <span id="s279">Her name was [Renée (ph)], or actually we called her "Renya."</span> <span id="s280">And she got me a job with a German family.</span> <span id="s281">And I got a job not far from _ód_.</span> <span id="s282">I went to Cz_stochowa, which is where they have uh the Black Marie.It's the seat, I think, of the Cardinal's seat there.</span> <span id="s283">They have the Matka [Mosca (ph)].</span> <span id="s284">Matka...yah, Matka [Mosca (ph)].</span> <span id="s285">And I got a job.</span> <span id="s286">And I got a job as a German in Entlösung Amtstadt [Ger: "State Redemption Office"].</span> <span id="s287">Entlösung Amtstadt is the uniforms which came back from...from the front--which were dirty, filthy, had to be cut.</span> <span id="s288">You know, repaired or something else.</span> <span id="s289">They came to this Entlösung Amtstadt, where they were repaired, sewn, cleaned and sent back to the front.</span> <span id="s290">My job was to see the divisions where they came from.</span> <span id="s291">So when I gave to Renya the numbers I saw--you know, I saw 70 uniforms from the 31st Panzer Division; I saw 20 uniforms from this and this division--what happened is, they knew approximately proportionately how many soldiers get injured or how many soldiers exchange uniform.</span> <span id="s292">They knew approximately...uh, approximately how many divisions, how many soldiers are in a particular front.</span> <span id="s293">And I..</span> <span id="s294">.</span> <span id="s295">I was with the job quite some time.</span> <span id="s296">And it's became quite, you know, finally you...you're acclimatized.</span> <span id="s297">You settled; the milieu became yours.</span> <span id="s298">You became the German.</span> <span id="s299">You became the milieu.</span> <span id="s300">Like as a German.</span> <span id="s301">I was thinking as a German.</span> <span id="s302">And we had the head of the charge was there; his name was [Frombuloff (ph)].</span> <span id="s303">He was nobility.</span> <span id="s304">And only thing, funny thing, is I speak German.</span> <span id="s305">But wherever I was in Germany, I always spoke with the wrong accent.</span> <span id="s306">So I never been in...from the right Germany where they wanted to be.</span> <span id="s307">I was there, I was Ausdeutschland.</span> <span id="s308">If I was...I was in Munich, I was a Berliner.</span> <span id="s309">If I was in Berlin, I was from Hannover.</span> <span id="s310">I never spoke the right accent to suit those people.</span> <span id="s311">But anyways, I was there; and it's became quite good.</span> <span id="s312">And I sitting there one lunch time... Lunch time, you know, and whatever they gave me--and they...being SS Ausdeutsch, I got little bit food from...from whatever they gave me.</span> <span id="s313">And the Germans gave me food there...the workers there, some of them.</span> <span id="s314">So I..</span> <span id="s315">.</span> <span id="s316">I don't know, it was some kind of conversation.</span> <span id="s317">I said to him, "Das ist der Hund begraben."</span> <span id="s318">Which is..."Das ist der Hund 3 NB: Black Madonna.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">begraben," means--like you say, you know, "the crux of it."</span> <span id="s320">You...or, you know, this is a..</span> <span id="s321">.</span> <span id="s322">you know, like he's gonna say there's a "Hund begraben" like "here is a dog buried," actually; but in German, means you know, uh...uh, like...uh... What is it?</span> <span id="s323">"Das Hund begraben," is "here's a dog buried"... Is like, you know, "You hit the nail on the head."</span> <span id="s324">Something like this.</span> <span id="s325">Like you hit the nail on the head.</span> <span id="s326">And he says to me, "You know, it's very funny.</span> <span id="s327">I never heard this in my life time.</span> <span id="s328">It's the only time I heard this saying before was from a Jew."</span> <span id="s329">So I said...(laughing) So it became quite, quite uncomfortable (laughing) for me.</span> <span id="s330">So I thought, "My God, now he associates me.</span> <span id="s331">Because of this one sentence, he associates me with a Jew!"</span> <span id="s332">But...uh...it's came over.</span> <span id="s333">And...and later this woman, Renya... This matter of fact, everybody says, he's somebody from the underground, or somebody does a little spying, it's very exotic.</span> <span id="s334">It's not.</span> <span id="s335">I only knew this Renya.</span> <span id="s336">This woman Renya.</span> <span id="s337">This was my only contact I ever had.</span> <span id="s338">You know, I met some...I met some, uh...people who were dropped from England; but I only met them on...on a one-to-one basis.</span> <span id="s339">Because we.</span> <span id="s340">.</span> <span id="s341">I did some sabotage work also.</span> <span id="s342">I became an expert in derailing trains.</span> <span id="s343">In 19...uh, at that time, the trains--I mean, the axle--I don't know [if] they didn't have ball bearings or if they had ball bearings outside the...the where the axle was and the wheel was.</span> <span id="s344">There's a housing.</span> <span id="s345">And this housing was threads--like rags or something.</span> <span id="s346">And those rags had a lot of oil in it.</span> <span id="s347">And this was grease...greasing the axles.</span> <span id="s348">So I became an expert as taking out...opening this little housing, this...and with one swoosh, taking out the oil in those rags.</span> <span id="s349">But you had to be very careful there shouldn't have any droppings on the railroad...railroad ties, or pebbles there.</span> <span id="s350">So you had to make sure that the oil should not drip on those pebbles; because they would see somebody did something to it.</span> <span id="s351">So the whole idea was to swoosh it out and throw it away, but there shouldn't be oil...any oil should be left on it, on those pebbles.</span> <span id="s352">So I became quite proficient in this...uh, this endeavor, whichever, which I was doing.</span> <span id="s353">And what happened is that as the train was running, the train froze, the wheel froze, and the train was derailed.</span> <span id="s354">I never saw it derailed myself, but we know the consequences of my doing that.</span> <span id="s355">And I stayed there for quite some time.</span> <span id="s356">And once I found out that my father was getting very sick.</span> <span id="s357">My father was very sick; and so I got back to the ghetto, eventually.</span> <span id="s358">No!</span> <span id="s359">One more...a funny incidents I had.</span> <span id="s360">I lived in the city of Cz_stochowa, and I'm walking up to this Polish-- allegedly Polish--family who was...where I was staying with this Polish family.</span> <span id="s361">Walking down; and I had a..</span> <span id="s362">.</span> <span id="s363">a open shirt, and I had a big cross.</span> <span id="s364">I wore a big black cross.</span> <span id="s365">It looked like a ebony, but it actually was out of wood.</span> <span id="s366">And just as a coincident, I walk up the hill and there's very few people on...on the street.</span> <span id="s367">And there's a man walking down the street, on the other side...on the other side of the street.</span> <span id="s368">He looks at me, points to me and says, "Parszywy _idje!"</span> <span id="s369">[Pol: "Lousy Jew!"]</span> <span id="s370">Says to me, "Smelly Jew!"</span> <span id="s371">From...I don't know what it was, but it is... I mean, it's the most amazing thing or he knew or he smelled it or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s372">But he says to me, "Parszywy _idje!"</span> <span id="s373">This was also my...my little endeavor in Cz_stochowa.</span> <span id="s374">So anyway, I went back to...to--that time was Litzmannstadt [NB: _ód_].</span> <span id="s375">They renamed it Litzmannstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: A street?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Litzmannstadt became _ód_.</span> <span id="s378">_ód_ became Litzmannstadt.</span> <span id="s379">_ód_ became Litzmannstadt.</span> <span id="s380">And I brought back some funny...I had an opportunity.</span> <span id="s381">I brought a..</span> <span id="s382">.</span> <span id="s383">smuggled myself...not me, but through these people.</span> <span id="s384">And I brought some horsemeat to my father, so at least it was a little longer.</span> <span id="s385">And he needed some injection.</span> <span id="s386">I brought him some kind of an injection.</span> <span id="s387">And...but it was getting...he was getting weaker and weaker.</span> <span id="s388">So matter of fact, once they cut off the street and I had to take my father... Instead of upstairs where we lived in the attic, somebody allowed us to use the ground floor apartment.</span> <span id="s389">And we lifted off the flooring, and we hid my father--or at that time, our father--under the floor.</span> <span id="s390">So when they inspected us, we looked much quite much healthier than he looked.</span> <span id="s391">So that we were spared.</span> <span id="s392">Because all those people who looked sickly or...or didn't look well enough, they took them away immediately.</span> <span id="s393">And this way, every time, every day, we...we postponed the inevitable.</span> <span id="s394">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: How long did... Slow down a little bit.</span> <span id="s396">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: How long was your father under the floorboards.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Oh, he was there for quite a few hours, because we had to wait 'til they come.</span> <span id="s399">Because we knew the whole neighborhood was closed off.</span> <span id="s400">So...uh, we had to wait 'til they went from house to house to house to house to apartment to apartment, to search for...for sick people, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s401">So he was there the whole morning; if not much, much longer.</span> <span id="s402">And...uh, and he was scared.</span> <span id="s403">We were scared that, you know, he shouldn't any noise; or when he steps on it, it shouldn't make a different squeaking noise...a different squeaking noise... noise than...than the floor would make.</span> <span id="s404">So, uh...we saved him 'til...um, 'til eventually all of us winded up in...in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s405">But.</span> <span id="s406">.</span> <span id="s407">but it was...so it was quite rough at that time.</span> <span id="s408">So...so the circum...not only this, but a lot of... There was also a..</span> <span id="s409">.</span> <span id="s410">you know, they had their own police department in.</span> <span id="s411">.</span> <span id="s412">in the ghetto at that time.</span> <span id="s413">Uh, Rumpow... Rumkowski was the head of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s414">He was not liked at all.</span> <span id="s415">He was not liked on; but I have no idea under circum...under those circumstances, anybody else would do better or worse.</span> <span id="s416">Every...every week or every day... No...no, not every week.</span> <span id="s417">Every day or every two days, always transports went...went out...out of _ód_ ghetto, under the heading that they're going to labor camp.</span> <span id="s418">And matter of fact, the propaganda was quite good; because nobody came back to complain.</span> <span id="s419">So...uh...it's...everybody toyed with the idea [that] maybe it's a good idea; because they told you you're allowed to take clothing, you're allowed to take whatever you want, and you take...take your sewing machine.</span> <span id="s420">Because you're going to go a labor camp, where they're gonna feed you and everything else.</span> <span id="s421">And a lot of them who came from Theresienstadt [NB: Terezín] at that time... In the beginning, Theresienstadt, Czechoslovakia, wasn't a very, very bad camp.</span> <span id="s422">So they felt that's going to be at least as good as Theresienstadt, it wasn't going to be too bad.</span> <span id="s423">So even a lot of them volunteered to go away in labor.</span> <span id="s424">Because the circumstances were...were just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s425">Unbearable.</span> <span id="s426">Especially for my parents and my sister and my brother.</span> <span id="s427">The winters were...were excruciating.</span> <span id="s428">I mean, the cold is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s429">It's freezing constantly.</span> <span id="s430">I mean, they slept clothing...with the clothing; and when I was there, it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s431">In one bed, just to keep ourself warm.</span> <span id="s432">And getting up in the morning was the same ordeal as going to sleep at nighttime.</span> <span id="s433">So it was bad thing; until...until...'til finally the transport, we were part of it.</span> <span id="s434">We went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s435">I could have escape Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s436">I could have escaped going to Auschwitz, because I could've be...be back in Cz_stochowa.</span> <span id="s437">Except I didn't want to leave my parents alone.</span> <span id="s438">And I fell under the same misconception, that...uh... we're going to something better.</span> <span id="s439">So if we go something better, I wanted to be with them.</span> <span id="s440">Especially, I felt, my father was very, very sick.</span> <span id="s441">Somebody had to take care of my mother, and my brother and sister.</span> <span id="s442">So I..</span> <span id="s443">.</span> <span id="s444">I..</span> <span id="s445">.</span> <span id="s446">I..</span> <span id="s447">.</span> <span id="s448">I didn't mind to go.</span> <span id="s449">They...they tried to talk me out of it.</span> <span id="s450">Matter of fact, he...even Mr. Goodman tried to talk me out of it.</span> <span id="s451">But I didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s452">I wanted to go with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Had you been doing work for the underground while you were in _ód_?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: _ód_--in the city of _ód_?</span> <span id="s455">No.</span> <span id="s456">In the city of _ód_, I was not doing the underground.</span> <span id="s457">I was...uh, they had a little farm.</span> <span id="s458">All the way outside the city of _ód_.</span> <span id="s459">And I only worked on this farm.</span> <span id="s460">It was an experiment in potato farming, you know.</span> <span id="s461">It just was...I only worked... I worked on this farm only because the border was not far from this farm--the border of...outside of...of the _ód_ ghetto, or the Litzmannstadt ghetto.</span> <span id="s462">So the guards saw me working on...on the farm.</span> <span id="s463">So when I went closer to the fence, they didn't shoot.</span> <span id="s464">They knew me.</span> <span id="s465">So they knew me, I was one of the farmers.</span> <span id="s466">So it was always a safe route for me to go out and come in.</span> <span id="s467">Except when I smuggled myself out, I did it also nobody [outside] of my family witness I was going out.</span> <span id="s468">Because you never knew who.</span> <span id="s469">.</span> <span id="s470">who you were working with.</span> <span id="s471">And the same thing coming back.</span> <span id="s472">So...so when I went out--and that was always whoever we found we had go somewheres else, I had to go see my parents; and I was on this farm only to get out...smuggle myself out of....of the ghetto, and coming in.</span> <span id="s473">So that's how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Tell me now, if you would, about that...the deportation.</span> <span id="s475">The train ride.</span> <span id="s476">How...?</span> <span id="s477">You were together with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s479">We went there...we went on a train ride.</span> <span id="s480">I think it was cattle farm...uh... Cattle trains, you know.</span> <span id="s481">And...and they took everything--all our belongings, which was very little; because we started...matter of fact we started the ghetto with very little.</span> <span id="s482">And I don't know... Did I tell you this?</span> <span id="s483">My father was arrested and got bitten by a dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Let's go regress.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Before they closed the ghetto, since we were foreigners in Poland, my father was arrested.</span> <span id="s488">Arrested by the Germans.</span> <span id="s489">So...uh...so seems likes that my mother...seems like a perpetual job to pay people off.</span> <span id="s490">Uh...Whatever we had left at that time in...we sold whatever we have--her jewelry, everything--was sold to get some money.</span> <span id="s491">And my father was released.</span> <span id="s492">He was released after a week or something.</span> <span id="s493">After a time; it was a week or two weeks.</span> <span id="s494">And the day of his release, the day of his waiting...we're waiting by the fence, my father should come with us.</span> <span id="s495">He was in the building where he was incarcerated.</span> <span id="s496">But there was a fence in front of it.</span> <span id="s497">But going from the exit of the building to the fence where we were staying [NB: standing], they sent...they pushed...they put the dog on him.</span> <span id="s498">And the dog bit him through his hand.</span> <span id="s499">This was his...his goodbye gift.</span> <span id="s500">Matter of fact, since then I'm scared of dogs.</span> <span id="s501">Uh, because they bit him right through his hand.</span> <span id="s502">This was...this was prior, before they even closed the ghetto.</span> <span id="s503">Yah.</span> <span id="s504">So now going to...to the ghetto...eh, going to Auschwitz, we were in a..</span> <span id="s505">.</span> <span id="s506">in a..</span> <span id="s507">.</span> <span id="s508">in a cattle--those things.</span> <span id="s509">Except, you know, if you were the first or second or third or 20th or 30th into the cattle [car], it wasn't as bad.</span> <span id="s510">But more and more people were pushed in, more and more depressed you became.</span> <span id="s511">More and more you knew that you did a bad choice; because you found out they're stop being humans.</span> <span id="s512">They're already started treating us as cattle.</span> <span id="s513">Even at the train where they promised us we going to go to...to Utopia or someplace else.</span> <span id="s514">So it was getting very bad; but there was nothing we can do.</span> <span id="s515">We had no toilet.</span> <span id="s516">There was nothing else.</span> <span id="s517">There was no food.</span> <span id="s518">And the stench became unbearable.</span> <span id="s519">I mean, natural stench.</span> <span id="s520">And we stayed in until we got to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s521">Got to Auschwitz...

Okay, he survived it enough-- because he had enough food, whatever he wanted--and he came in and out.</span> <span id="s596">So he was quite a big shot at that time.</span> <span id="s597">He was not a completely sane person.</span> <span id="s598">Matter of fact, his...his...his achievement and fame was, he always boasted is he raped a 70 year old woman against a tree in a forest; and he always said this was his biggest accomplishment, is this what he did.</span> <span id="s599">And he was in love...uh, he loved...in love with a Gypsy girl who ...who...who died before, but he slept with her dress.</span> <span id="s600">I mean, this man was completely deranged.</span> <span id="s601">So anyways, I am standing in this thing.</span> <span id="s602">And he walks over to me; and I speak German, so he says to me, "Bist du ein Jude?"</span> <span id="s603">[Ger: "Are you a Jew?"]</span> <span id="s604">So I says, "Ja."</span> <span id="s605">And he says... Can I say it in German?</span> <span id="s606">He says...I say, "Ja."</span> <span id="s607">So he says, "Nein, du bist nicht kein Jude!"</span> <span id="s608">[Ger: "No, you are no Jew!"]</span> <span id="s609">I says, "Ja, Ich bin ein Jude."</span> <span id="s610">[Ger: "Yes, I am a Jew."]</span> <span id="s611">He took a fist and hit me in the face.</span> <span id="s612">I spit out a tooth--I wish the dentist would do it as easily as he did it.</span> <span id="s613">Spit out a tooth; and I says, "Ja, bin nicht kein Jude."</span> <span id="s614">[Ger: "Yes, I'm no Jew."]</span> <span id="s615">So I admitted I'm not a Jew, and that's all he wanted.</span> <span id="s616">Seems like I was, at that time, blonde; and I was only, I think, Aryan looking fellow who he didn't want to become...he [NB: I] shouldn't be a Jew.</span> <span id="s617">So he gave me a job.</span> <span id="s618">And my job was to bring soup.</span> <span id="s619">And there where they fed us, we had to go down to the kitchen to bring those kettles of food- -which was...uh, our daily insult.</span> <span id="s620">And I'm standing in line there; and one day he sent me the kettles on reveille.</span> <span id="s621">So when he sent us down to...to fetch the soup, seems like it was too late.</span> <span id="s622">Because when the fellow called off "27," in...instead of saying, "Here," I didn't say, "Here."</span> <span id="s623">He said, "27!"</span> <span id="s624">Nobody said, "Here."</span> <span id="s625">He says, "28!"</span> <span id="s626">Before he finished saying, "28," I said, "Here."</span> <span id="s627">He didn't know whether it's means here for 28 or 27.</span> <span id="s628">So anyways, I was late.</span> <span id="s629">So he put me over a bench.</span> <span id="s630">Somebody held it...held me between his legs; and I got 15 on my behind.</span> <span id="s631">But he...he walked...he had a walking cane; and he had a tape--like a electric tape-- around it.</span> <span id="s632">And I got 15, which was a most excruciating pain at that time.</span> <span id="s633">At the first few of them...after this, it...it didn't matter anymore.</span> <span id="s634">After this, I got up.</span> <span id="s635">I'm going to the soup, which--I'm bleeding rectally.</span> <span id="s636">He says, "You forgot something."</span> <span id="s637">So what can you forget, if you're already getting 15 of it?</span> <span id="s638">He says, "You forgot to say, 'Thank you.'"</span> <span id="s639">So at this particular moment, I fainted.</span> <span id="s640">And when...in this place they had big squares which was full of water.</span> <span id="s641">In case of a air raid or fire, so the water was taken for the firemen of the fire brigade to douche the...the... So he threw me.</span> <span id="s642">So he kicked me into this water.</span> <span id="s643">This was, oh...uh, he kicked me in the thing.</span> <span id="s644">Only because I forgot to say, "Thank you."</span> <span id="s645">Coming back to the barrack at that time, I don't know what, he made me his cook.</span> <span id="s646">I don't know anything about cooking at all.</span> <span id="s647">But he had provisions.</span> <span id="s648">He got potatoes.</span> <span id="s649">He got extra this--not what we used to get.</span> <span id="s650">Not the food we used to get.</span> <span id="s651">So I don't know anything about cooking.</span> <span id="s652">So only thing he said, he likes sauerbraten or some kind of vinegar.</span> <span id="s653">So whatever soup--I only made soup.</span> <span id="s654">So whatever soup, I finished the soup.</span> <span id="s655">Before I served him, I took a tablespoon full of vinegar and put the vinegar into the soup.</span> <span id="s656">And he thought I was the most gourmet cook in the world, (laughing) because I made...I added vinegar to his...to his soup.</span> <span id="s657">And I always looked for details, details where I could get out of this particular camp...camp site to go to other camp; because I was looking for my parents.</span> <span id="s658">And specially, I'm looking for my brother.</span> <span id="s659">I thought he...if anybody gonna survive it, it's gonna be my brother gonna survive.</span> <span id="s660">So I got details...uh, cleaning toilets.</span> <span id="s661">I got a detail becoming--whatever gypsies were left, I became interpreter to the Gypsies.</span> <span id="s662">Only because I spoke Hungarian.</span> <span id="s663">I faked my Hungarian, they faked their Rumanian; so we somehow understood each other.</span> <span id="s664">And I always gave the answers--which I felt it was good--is what the German wanted to hear, instead of what the Gypsies said to me.</span> <span id="s665">But there were few of them left, already; because most of them perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Tell us about the Gypsies you met.</span> <span id="s667">What were they like, and what were they doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Now, I met Gypsies in the...in the men's camp.</span> <span id="s669">In the men's camp, they were bewildered.</span> <span id="s670">They were bewildered.</span> <span id="s671">Not only...they felt themself a minority of a minority.</span> <span id="s672">So...so ...so they felt alienated, even among the camp survivors--uh, camp prisoners there, they felt alien.</span> <span id="s673">So they kept as a group.</span> <span id="s674">So they tried to shut their personality as much as they could.</span> <span id="s675">In the ladies camp--this was a phenomena which was very interesting.</span> <span id="s676">They became--some of them became--in charge of...of the block...charge of the...the barrack in itself.</span> <span id="s677">And it's amazing thing.</span> <span id="s678">They assumed a manly personality.</span> <span id="s679">They used to do like this (rubbing chin), which a woman very seldom does.</span> <span id="s680">When they stood, they stood feet spread, you know.</span> <span id="s681">They...they became...they became a man.</span> <span id="s682">Maybe they...through being this manly personality, they became more assertive, or more... Became leaders of their particular group.</span> <span id="s683">So...so I think the men behaved more passively as...as the Gypsy ladies.</span> <span id="s684">The men became more passive than...than... than the women were.</span> <span id="s685">Anyways, I went and I never found anybody.</span> <span id="s686">Never found anybody in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Your family, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: No.</span> <span id="s689">I never found anybody.</span> <span id="s690">You know, it comes to a point, you know you don't expect.</span> <span id="s691">Well, first it's such a humanity.</span> <span id="s692">It's just a tremendous amount of humanity that you don't expect to.</span> <span id="s693">So the only thing I decided what I do in camp is, or since then I gonna do--since I don't think I have no answer to "left" or no answer to "right"--I don't gonna test fate.</span> <span id="s694">I don't gonna do anything against fate.</span> <span id="s695">If they tell me, "Stand there," I gonna stand here.</span> <span id="s696">If they tell me, "Stand here," I gonna stand here.</span> <span id="s697">If they say, "Go," I go.</span> <span id="s698">If they say, "Jump," I jump.</span> <span id="s699">Because since I don't know what to do, I didn't want to blame myself, you know.</span> <span id="s700">"I should...I went left, but they told me to go right.</span> <span id="s701">I should have gone right, because maybe right would be better than going left."</span> <span id="s702">This way, matter of fact, I dropped personal responsibility.</span> <span id="s703">I dropped my responsibility.</span> <span id="s704">I don't do anything.</span> <span id="s705">They tell me, I do.</span> <span id="s706">So one day, he comes in and the people come there with thing, and they stamp me.</span> <span id="s707">The stamp is right here on the chest; with a big black stamp.</span> <span id="s708">So it gives stamp; the stamp, I don't know what it is.</span> <span id="s709">So he says, "Anybody who's stamped has to go to Buna, to the coal mine."</span> <span id="s710">I said, "For coal mining, I don't...I gonna test fate.</span> <span id="s711">I'm not going where fate's going to send me."</span> <span id="s712">So I went and I tried to rub it off but I couldn't.</span> <span id="s713">The stamps seems like were very quite embedded, so I couldn't rub it off.</span> <span id="s714">So I went behind a barrack and I got dirt.</span> <span id="s715">And I rubbed my chest with dirt.</span> <span id="s716">So problem was this: my chest became, you know, raw.</span> <span id="s717">It's became here raw.</span> <span id="s718">So I was scared they should recognize that I..</span> <span id="s719">.</span> <span id="s720">I have a raw spot, that I rubbed off the stamp.</span> <span id="s721">So I rubbed all over.</span> <span id="s722">Wherever I found a little spot, I rubbed this dirt into it, too; that I should have the same blotches which I had here, I should have it all over my body.</span> <span id="s723">And I met a friend.</span> <span id="s724">Not a friend.</span> <span id="s725">I met a man--by his name of Monyek Ravel, the same as the composer-- and we became friendly.</span> <span id="s726">And we decided whatever [we] do, we shall try to do it together.</span> <span id="s727">So whatever happen, let's...let's stick it together.</span> <span id="s728">At least I..</span> <span id="s729">.</span> <span id="s730">I had somebody, I had a human being with me.</span> <span id="s731">It was the most bewildering thing.</span> <span id="s732">I was quite young at that time, you know.</span> <span id="s733">I was not the old...youngest one, but I was not one of the masses that were older than we were.</span> <span id="s734">And...and because it was getting very rough... Like in my barrack, there came a man who was a Litzmannstadt, or in the ghetto--who was allegedly a big shot in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s735">He was not liked.</span> <span id="s736">So he comes to my barrack and he says, "I don't know why they don't like me."</span> <span id="s737">You know.</span> <span id="s738">Said it loud, you know.</span> <span id="s739">"I am...was only a barber.</span> <span id="s740">I was only a barber."</span> <span id="s741">And the people says, "No.</span> <span id="s742">No.</span> <span id="s743">Your life is short-lived here."</span> <span id="s744">Sure enough, by next morning he was floating in.</span> <span id="s745">.</span> <span id="s746">in the cesspool.</span> <span id="s747">Seemed like they killed him, so... In the barrack.</span> <span id="s748">I mean, human life was not accountable.</span> <span id="s749">Human life was not important.</span> <span id="s750">Human life was the cheapest commodity, we always said.</span> <span id="s751">And we stayed in Auschwitz for some time; and after this, we wind up...started to transport to camps.</span> <span id="s752">I remember which camp was we go.</span> <span id="s753">We went from there.</span> <span id="s754">We went to a camp, which I remember because it was a short while.</span> <span id="s755">After this we wind up in a camp which was Kruppwerke.</span> <span id="s756">Krupp has a factory.</span> <span id="s757">We were working, Monyek and I. And we saw a lot of people were working in this camp.</span> <span id="s758">And one day, there is an air raid.</span> <span id="s759">And we see that it's a..</span> <span id="s760">.</span> <span id="s761">I don't know whose plane it was--American, French or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s762">And it's most amazing.</span> <span id="s763">We had nowheres to hide.</span> <span id="s764">We just stood there and...and looked in amazing.</span> <span id="s765">And we saw the bombs coming; and you felt...every bomb... Looking up, you felt every bomb is meant for you.</span> <span id="s766">Which...which they didn't hit...didn't hit us at all.</span> <span id="s767">They went quite out...out of...of the range of the Kruppwerke.</span> <span id="s768">But the panic in the Germans, I never experienced before.</span> <span id="s769">This is the first time I saw human panic.</span> <span id="s770">Not in us, but in my enemy.</span> <span id="s771">And I realized this, they're as...as scared as I was.</span> <span id="s772">And everybody cherished...cherished his own life, in his own fashion.</span> <span id="s773">And it...and Monyek and I, we says, "You know something?</span> <span id="s774">It's amazing.</span> <span id="s775">Amazing!"</span> <span id="s776">He says, "Without a gun, they would be the same as I." Except the only difference was, they had a bullet.</span> <span id="s777">And from there, we went to...</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Hold on.</span> <span id="s779">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s780">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">5 Probable reference to the coal mine operation conducted out of the nearby Jawischowitz subcamp.</span> <span id="s782">Jawischowitz was subordinated to Auschwitz III ("Buna") for administrative purposes in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: What was it like in the Kruppwerke?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: In the camp...in the factory?</span> <span id="s785">In the factory, we were working with a..</span> <span id="s786">.</span> <span id="s787">certain...we had certain jobs.</span> <span id="s788">I had a job making...making... I had a big thing making holes in...in certain...certain metals, I think.</span> <span id="s789">There was some supervisors, which were Germans themselves, which ran the factories.</span> <span id="s790">Elderly gentlemen, which were kind to us.</span> <span id="s791">I mean, they were...you know, they were there.</span> <span id="s792">They knew who we was.</span> <span id="s793">I don't know if they knew we were concentration.</span> <span id="s794">I'm sure they knew we were concentration inmates, but they were okay.</span> <span id="s795">I mean, they were a little bit if kindness.</span> <span id="s796">Let's put it.</span> <span id="s797">I mean, we encountered the first time a little bit of kindness to humanity.</span> <span id="s798">The first time we encountered a little bit of humanity from them.</span> <span id="s799">But, you know, if...if a soldier--I don't know a soldier, a sergeant or somebody with...with a uniform--they saw a uniform, the attitude changed.</span> <span id="s800">Which was just natural, I could see it.</span> <span id="s801">They were scared themselves, you know.</span> <span id="s802">But they never would give anything personal.</span> <span id="s803">I mean, with me they could converse, at least, speaking German; but there was never something personal.</span> <span id="s804">Give me a piece of bread, or give me...which was a welcome thing from them, but they would never.</span> <span id="s805">Never.</span> <span id="s806">Never.</span> <span id="s807">Never gave us anything like that.</span> <span id="s808">So we worked in the Kruppwerke.</span> <span id="s809">And from there, it seems like from there we went to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s810">And Buchenwald was one of the nicer camps, I think.</span> <span id="s811">Buchenwald was one of the nicer... I mean, the other camps I experienced since...before or...or since.</span> <span id="s812">And one day, we had to have a..</span> <span id="s813">.</span> <span id="s814">and by then I was started... My beard, I remembere over there the difficulty with growing; because they told me to I have to shave.</span> <span id="s815">I don't know how I shaved before, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s816">But over there, I remember.</span> <span id="s817">So they gave me a piece of glass to shave, because nobody wanted to give a razor or had a razor.</span> <span id="s818">So they gave me a piece of glass to shave.</span> <span id="s819">Which was unbelievable, too.</span> <span id="s820">But...so finally somebody was nice to me.</span> <span id="s821">One of the inmates, also.</span> <span id="s822">And he gave me a straight razor.</span> <span id="s823">And so...so I finally I shaved over there.</span> <span id="s824">It was the first time I shaved with straight razor over there, instead of the piece...piece of glass.</span> <span id="s825">And told us to wash.</span> <span id="s826">So this Monyek and I, we washed in a drinking fountain.</span> <span id="s827">Just a little drinking fountain.</span> <span id="s828">And we took a bath; and it was quite a welcome relief to...to be allowed to be washed.</span> <span id="s829">Because in...in the Kruppwerke, before, we worked in this greasy water; and this was always running, always black.</span> <span id="s830">And we always smelled from oil.</span> <span id="s831">And they didn't care about us at all.</span> <span id="s832">But Buchenwald, they...they allowed us to wash.</span> <span id="s833">And... but hunger was always there.</span> <span id="s834">Hunger was always there.</span> <span id="s835">Death wasn't any problem anymore, because we accepted it.</span> <span id="s836">It's eventually gonna happen, so we became less scared of...of dying.</span> <span id="s837">It became as a everyday occurrence; so it was not a big deal any more.</span> <span id="s838">From Buchenwald, we went to so many camps I don't remember.</span> <span id="s839">Uh, Buchenwald...</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: How long were you in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Time is not a factor with me.</span> <span id="s842">I have no...no conception of times anymore.</span> <span id="s843">Q: Can you...can you tell me some of the work that you did in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s845">Nothing.</span> <span id="s846">Nothing.</span> <span id="s847">The only thing, I set... met--somebody pointed out to me, I don't know whether it's were the truth or not--I met Schuschnigg, which was the Prime Minister of Austria.They said, "You see him?</span> <span id="s848">This is Mr. Schuschnigg."</span> <span id="s849">Plus, they showed me a lady who was Mrs. Rothschild.</span> <span id="s850">She was a Rothschild, a Viennese Rothschild.</span> <span id="s851">I met her; and...and you know, you had Mrs. Rothschild.</span> <span id="s852">But that's all that I remember about meeting Mrs. Rothschild and Mr. Schuschnigg in...in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s853">I don't know if it's the truth that he was Schuschnigg and she was Mrs. Rothschild, but this what is pointed out to me, was they were there.</span> <span id="s854">After this, it became...and we went to a camp by name of Ludwigslust.In Ludwigslust, we were working in a spring factory.</span> <span id="s855">Always with Monyek.</span> <span id="s856">Monyek...wherever I went, Monyek went with me.</span> <span id="s857">My friend, Monyek.</span> <span id="s858">Uh, I worked in the factory in...in making springs; and what's good about this is is our camp in...in the factory was almost a unit.</span> <span id="s859">So we didn't have to march too far from work to the thing.</span> <span id="s860">And... and...and the camp commander was uh quite a human being, at that time.</span> <span id="s861">I mean, he was...I mean, he could he could...always fed us... I mean, I don't try to make excuses for him; but...but he fed us.</span> <span id="s862">He fed us, or whatever it was there.</span> <span id="s863">I was making springs there for car door springs; except my job was I was on the night shift.</span> <span id="s864">Night shift consists of 12 o'clock 'til who knows when the hours in the morning.</span> <span id="s865">Except I was making--instead of springs, Monyek and I were making knives for the Germans for their own use.</span> <span id="s866">So we made this...we was...out of those big wheels we was polishing and polishing those knives to make the knives; and somebody else made those wooden handles.</span> <span id="s867">So for each knife, we got...he gave us half a slice of bread...as half a sandwich.</span> <span id="s868">Monyek got one half a sandwich, and I got half a sandwich.</span> <span id="s869">For making the whole night long work to make the bread.</span> <span id="s870">And the circumstances were not not good, but wasn't bad.</span> <span id="s871">Uh, the prisoners that...the...we already got bunks.</span> <span id="s872">We were allowed to sleep two...two to a bunk.</span> <span id="s873">Which was much better than we had in Auschwitz, or any other camp.</span> <span id="s874">They were almost like cots in...in big barracks.</span> <span id="s875">And the SS, or whoever watched over us, were elderly gentlemen.</span> <span id="s876">The...instead of those young punks, we had elderly gentlemen watching us.</span> <span id="s877">So it wasn't... uh, wasn't...wasn't extremely bad.</span> <span id="s878">It wasn't the worst circumstances I ever lived through was already there.</span> <span id="s879">And from there, we found out that we are...we had...we had a transport to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s880">Yes, we had...seems like Hitler tried to make a pact with the Austrian--with the Swiss, that he should get Swiss citizenship.</span> <span id="s881">And to show good faith, he allowed a transport of Jews--concentration camp Jews--to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s882">So we bec... Was it that time?</span> <span id="s883">Yes.</span> <span id="s884">We became a transport to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s885">I think it was that time, or before.</span> <span id="s886">And they gave us....</span> <span id="s887">No, it wasn't near Litzmann.</span> <span id="s888">It wasn't this camp.</span> <span id="s889">One camp afterwards.</span> <span id="s890">From there we went to another camp.</span> <span id="s891">This camp where we were, we...they gave us...we stayed in the camp for a short time, and that time we had... They created a transport to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s892">They gave us Red Cross packages.</span> <span id="s893">And they gave us each of us Red Cross packages.</span> <span id="s894">I had a job to open every Red Cross package, and take out the chocolate and give it to the Germans.</span> <span id="s895">So all...every Red Cross package, whoever got, was minus chocolate.</span> <span id="s896">And everything else came to us.</span> <span id="s897">And it was actually a bowl.</span> <span id="s898">And the bowl was fabulous, because we had food.</span> <span id="s899">Except we didn't know when to stop.</span> <span id="s900">So we almost 6 Dr. Kurt Schuschnigg was the Austrian Chief of State from 1934-1938.</span> <span id="s901">He survived the war and died at Innsbruck in 1977.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">7 Subcamp of Neuengamme.</span> <span id="s903">Located in the city of Ludwigslust, approximately 5 miles to the south of Wöbbelin.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">finished everything what they gave us at that time.</span> <span id="s905">The whole thing fell through.</span> <span id="s906">The transport fell through.</span> <span id="s907">Seems like that the Swedish government or the Swiss government didn't do it for Himmler.</span> <span id="s908">So the first thing what they did to us, they took the packages away.</span> <span id="s909">Whatever was left they...they took those packages.</span> <span id="s910">When humanity stopped, the bestiality started all over again; and they took another transport.</span> <span id="s911">And they took us on a transport in open cattle cars.</span> <span id="s912">But that time, was open with no roof.</span> <span id="s913">We were sitting, and completely exposed to the element.</span> <span id="s914">And we traveled; seemed like nobody wanted to take us because we were this...the privileged characters, we supposed to go to...to Sweden.</span> <span id="s915">Seems like at that time, whatever, the hierarchy didn't want...nobody wanted to take us.</span> <span id="s916">We traveled for three days in those open cars.</span> <span id="s917">No water, no food.</span> <span id="s918">Food wasn't a tremendous factor--at least for me.</span> <span id="s919">Thirst was.</span> <span id="s920">It came to a point that I..</span> <span id="s921">.</span> <span id="s922">my tongue swelling in my mouth.</span> <span id="s923">This I couldn't close my mouth.</span> <span id="s924">I was...thirst was unbearable.</span> <span id="s925">Unbearable!</span> <span id="s926">And my things...my lips swelled.</span> <span id="s927">My tongue swelled.</span> <span id="s928">And it was unbearable.</span> <span id="s929">And after three or four days, it seems like an eternity, they sent us to a camp which was being built by Russian soldiers--by Russian prisoners of war camp.</span> <span id="s930">Which was a brick camp for American flyers, which supposed to be a show camp.</span> <span id="s931">When it was finished, it was supposed to be a show camp--how...how humanely the American prisoners of war are being treated.</span> <span id="s932">This camp was doing construction.</span> <span id="s933">Seems like it was terrible there, because the Russian soldiers...uh soldiers practiced cannibalism.</span> <span id="s934">Uh, not on a live one; but cannibalism on whoever died.</span> <span id="s935">It seems like this...this part of the thumb was the biggest morsel they could eat.</span> <span id="s936">No water.</span> <span id="s937">There was one surface pump, which was for mak...mixing cement or something like this.</span> <span id="s938">And there were soldiers staying watching this pump; because this was surface water, which they were scared of typhus.</span> <span id="s939">So anybody who was drinking, want to drink, was shot immediately.</span> <span id="s940">It was not for the preservation of the prisoners, but it's for their own preservation of the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s941">So over there was...was very bad.</span> <span id="s942">And finally we came to this camp, too; not having water, not allowed... That's the first thing they told us, not allowed to drink this water.</span> <span id="s943">So a soldier, just to prove...just to prove he did... he meant this thing, he took a gun and he said, "Boom!"</span> <span id="s944">And he shot somebody.</span> <span id="s945">So he proved his point to me.</span> <span id="s946">So he took one life...or not to me, personally.</span> <span id="s947">So he proved...he took somebody's life to prove a point.</span> <span id="s948">So it was like saying, "Good morning," or, "Good evening," he shot this man.</span> <span id="s949">A Russian thing--I shall never forget--it was long...he had a hat with long ear muffs.</span> <span id="s950">And this man was wasted, just to prove I shouldn't drink his water.</span> <span id="s951">We stayed in this camp; and we was...we were working in this camp.</span> <span id="s952">We did not...no barracks at that time.</span> <span id="s953">We slept on sand...sand, which was mixing the cement.</span> <span id="s954">Rooves wasn't there.</span> <span id="s955">Under the elements, we only slept to them.</span> <span id="s956">Whatever...we was scared most of the Russian soldiers; more than of the Germans, because they were more with us.</span> <span id="s957">The Germans were outside.</span> <span id="s958">The Russians... because what they did during the night, they used to kill us and take the shoes away.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Who used to take the shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: The Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s961">The Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s962">Choke us to death or stab us to death.</span> <span id="s963">You know, the prisoners; so they could take the shoes away, or whatever.</span> <span id="s964">This flimsy piece, this one piece of...this pants and shirt, we had.</span> <span id="s965">No underwear.</span> <span id="s966">They took it away, because they didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s967">So Monyek and I, we always made sure we slept not laying down.</span> <span id="s968">We was sitting back to back so one could look forward and one could look backwards.</span> <span id="s969">And this way we always had a common protection.</span> <span id="s970">But hunger over there was unbearable.</span> <span id="s971">Hunger there was unbearable.</span> <span id="s972">So not far down the road was a sugar beet factory.</span> <span id="s973">In Europe, they're making sugar--not out of cane.</span> <span id="s974">They're making sugar out of beets.</span> <span id="s975">So...and one night I said, "Monyek, I'm going over and I'm going to eat as much as I want."</span> <span id="s976">He didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s977">I said, "You stay here.</span> <span id="s978">I come back."</span> <span id="s979">So I got out and I..</span> <span id="s980">.</span> <span id="s981">I put my pants.</span> <span id="s982">I tied...whatever pants I had, I tied on my... my leggings together.</span> <span id="s983">And I went in to...to the beets.</span> <span id="s984">But I couldn't carry the beets, because they were very heavy and I couldn't carry it.</span> <span id="s985">I was too weak.</span> <span id="s986">But seems like there's another pile which there's the shavings.</span> <span id="s987">Seems like before the beet is going to sugar--a mill or something--they do like rough shaving.</span> <span id="s988">Like pieces of wood, like wood shavings.</span> <span id="s989">So I filled myself up with these sugar beets and where I could; and I went through and I..</span> <span id="s990">.</span> <span id="s991">the sugar beets.</span> <span id="s992">Which I did a disservice.</span> <span id="s993">Not realizing you eat the sugars beets, this shaving of the sugar beets, you extend your stomach.</span> <span id="s994">So anybody who ate it, who ate a lot of it, they...they couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s995">They died because of the sugar beets itself; because the stomach just...just busted.</span> <span id="s996">Just busted.</span> <span id="s997">Seems like Monyek and I and quite a lot of other [of] us survived it.</span> <span id="s998">But a lot of them just...just couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s999">And...and we stayed there; and it was getting worse and worse and worse.</span> <span id="s1000">And all of sudden, the camp commander comes to us and he says, "The Russians are coming, and...uh they're going to kill us."</span> <span id="s1001">All the prisoners of war are going to kill us, because the Russians know we were helping the German economy.</span> <span id="s1002">So he says to us, "All people who wants to march gonna march with us."</span> <span id="s1003">And he points to me and says, "He's the first one who goes."</span> <span id="s1004">And I says, "No."</span> <span id="s1005">He says, "You will!"</span> <span id="s1006">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s1007">And this was the biggest beating I got in my lifetime.</span> <span id="s1008">I got from this man, with a--he didn't have a walking [stick], he had a long like a hiking stick.</span> <span id="s1009">A long...a long... Like a five-foot long stick.</span> <span id="s1010">And he made me as an example.</span> <span id="s1011">And he didn't stop beating me.</span> <span id="s1012">That...beat me in front.</span> <span id="s1013">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1014">And I..</span> <span id="s1015">.</span> <span id="s1016">it doesn't matter anymore.</span> <span id="s1017">By that time, didn't matter; because I couldn't walk anyways because the beating was so hard.</span> <span id="s1018">And he disappeared.</span> <span id="s1019">And no...no soldiers.</span> <span id="s1020">And we were free.</span> <span id="s1021">Except, there was no food.</span> <span id="s1022">In our adulation, in our happiness, there was nothing we could do about it.</span> <span id="s1023">We couldn't eat enough.</span> <span id="s1024">We only had those sugar beets, and we wouldn't eat those sugar beets.</span> <span id="s1025">Only thing we had a bowl was to drinking water.</span> <span id="s1026">We finally...not from this...not from the pump; but we found where they kept the drinking water.</span> <span id="s1027">And plus we were scared of the Russians.</span> <span id="s1028">The Russian--not the Russian soldiers which gonna come in, but the Russian prisoners of war because uh they were a rough bunch of guys.</span> <span id="s1029">Anyways, finally at two days later from the road, we see tanks coming.</span> <span id="s1030">And we see tanks with a five pointed star.</span> <span id="s1031">I didn't know how American tanks look, and I didn't know the emblem of an American tank.</span> <span id="s1032">So five-pointed stars looks like the Russian star.</span> <span id="s1033">Except they were American tanks.</span> <span id="s1034">So the American tanks passes by.</span> <span id="s1035">And finally, a few hours later, a little Russia--not Russian.</span> <span id="s1036">A little American solider comes in.</span> <span id="s1037">Very short, with the rucksack, with the pack, with everything else.</span> <span id="s1038">And a miracle, finally.</span> <span id="s1039">But this wasn't the biggest miracle I saw that day.</span> <span id="s1040">He says he's thirsty.</span> <span id="s1041">And I says, "There's no water here."</span> <span id="s1042">He says, "What about the pump there?"</span> <span id="s1043">I says, "You're not allowed to drink, because you're gonna die."</span> <span id="s1044">He went to the pump, put water in the canteen, put a pill into it, shook it and drank it.</span> <span id="s1045">This...and this was the biggest miracle I ever saw.</span> <span id="s1046">And I..</span> <span id="s1047">.</span> <span id="s1048">finally, I became a free man at that time.</span> <span id="s1049">So he said they... (Deep sigh) I'm a..</span> <span id="s1050">.</span> <span id="s1051">fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: This is a good time to stop and change tapes, anyways.</span> <span id="s1053">A: Yah?</span> <span id="s1054">Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: So let's do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">TAPE #2 TECHNICAL CONVERSATION A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: The day of liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: The day of liberation.</span> <span id="s1059">So the American soldiers dranking the water.</span> <span id="s1060">And he put this little pill in.</span> <span id="s1061">And I found it was the greatest miracle I ever saw in my lifetime, that he was allowed to drink things that we were killed for it.</span> <span id="s1062">We died for it.</span> <span id="s1063">And he drank it.</span> <span id="s1064">So he said that we should stay.</span> <span id="s1065">And I was in no circumstance.</span> <span id="s1066">I was sick and beaten up and bleeding.</span> <span id="s1067">I have a scar.</span> <span id="s1068">I still have a scar somewheres here.</span> <span id="s1069">(Pointing at his head) I have a scar from my back.</span> <span id="s1070">Uh, he says wait, they gonna send food for us.</span> <span id="s1071">Sure enough, a half a day later, they sending... There's a kitchen comes, uh a truck with a soup kitchen; and it was supplied by the French army.</span> <span id="s1072">And the French army says that before they're gonna give us soup we have to sing the "Marseillaise."</span> <span id="s1073">And I said, "Shove it."</span> <span id="s1074">And I didn't sing the "Marseillaise;" I didn't drink their food, and I walked out of camp a free man, without being subservient to the French for singing the "Marseillaise."</span> <span id="s1075">Monyek said, "Let's sing it."</span> <span id="s1076">I said, "Monyek, Goodbye.</span> <span id="s1077">I'm leaving."</span> <span id="s1078">My friend Monyek changed his mind and followed me.</span> <span id="s1079">And we didn't sing it.</span> <span id="s1080">We walked out.</span> <span id="s1081">So the first act of defiance, after not singing the "Marseillaise," I saw a German soldier and I..</span> <span id="s1082">.</span> <span id="s1083">I took his jacket away.</span> <span id="s1084">And I wore his jacket; because I was...I had nothing and I was bleeding.</span> <span id="s1085">So my jacket was ripped and I had no jacket.</span> <span id="s1086">So we were marching, and next day... We slept in the fields somewheres.</span> <span id="s1087">Next day, we saw American soldiers.</span> <span id="s1088">And they were throwing balls...a ball to each other with tremendous big gloves.</span> <span id="s1089">And I said, "Look at this foolish thing that they doing!</span> <span id="s1090">Why they don't catch them by hand?"</span> <span id="s1091">And this is the first time I was faced with baseball.</span> <span id="s1092">I never saw it before.</span> <span id="s1093">And it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1094">I found it extremely childish.</span> <span id="s1095">This look...big grown men throwing ball and catching it with a glove instead of catching it by hand.</span> <span id="s1096">And later, one fellow used a stick!</span> <span id="s1097">So it...it was quite amusing.</span> <span id="s1098">So we're marching; and we passing a field kitchen where the...uh...uh...a fellow, an American, cook.</span> <span id="s1099">And we saw there is a little fence; and there's a space and there was a table there, and there's...they were cooking some meat.</span> <span id="s1100">And he was cutting meat.</span> <span id="s1101">You know, meat.</span> <span id="s1102">And...and I was hungry.</span> <span id="s1103">And I said, "Food.</span> <span id="s1104">Food."</span> <span id="s1105">So every time he cut a piece of meat-- and I had a German...I want to emphasize, I had a German uniform on.</span> <span id="s1106">I had a German jacket on.</span> <span id="s1107">Every time he threw the meat, he threw it short enough I should never catch it.</span> <span id="s1108">Except he...there was a dog in front of me, on the other side of the fence.</span> <span id="s1109">So all the meat he threw towards me went to the dog.</span> <span id="s1110">And I never got the meat.</span> <span id="s1111">And I was extremely disappointed and extremely hungry.</span> <span id="s1112">So this was it.</span> <span id="s1113">But we...but that time we already had something to eat, you know.</span> <span id="s1114">A piece of bread here.</span> <span id="s1115">We got a little piece of bread here; whatever we could scrounge it.</span> <span id="s1116">But I never got this piece of meat from this cook, this American soldier.</span> <span id="s1117">And we decided we gonna march.</span> <span id="s1118">We gonna go to France.</span> <span id="s1119">We gonna go to France.</span> <span id="s1120">Why?</span> <span id="s1121">Because Monyek had a sister there before the war, and she always said it's a lovely life in...in France.</span> <span id="s1122">So we says, "Why not?"</span> <span id="s1123">"We go this way, or go this way?"</span> <span id="s1124">Finally, I said, "Which way you think is France?"</span> <span id="s1125">So he said, "This way."</span> <span id="s1126">"Okay.</span> <span id="s1127">Let's walk this way."</span> <span id="s1128">Didn't (laughing) matter to us.</span> <span id="s1129">So we marching to France.</span> <span id="s1130">A American soldier gets hold of us.</span> <span id="s1131">He says, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s1132">So...I don't know how they understood it.</span> <span id="s1133">We said we go to France.</span> <span id="s1134">He says, "That's fine.</span> <span id="s1135">Come on.</span> <span id="s1136">Go in the Jeep.</span> <span id="s1137">We take you to Paris."</span> <span id="s1138">I said, "How good can it be?"</span> <span id="s1139">We go to Paris; except he--I don't know where he took us--he took us to the detention camp.</span> <span id="s1140">So we stayed in the detention camp.</span> <span id="s1141">And uh...I says, "Monyek, I don't want to stay here.</span> <span id="s1142">I have enough detention camp."</span> <span id="s1143">He say he gonna stay, because he wants to go to Paris.</span> <span id="s1144">And we said goodbye to each other; and I never saw Monyek again.</span> <span id="s1145">We never saw him.</span> <span id="s1146">And I went...there was a group in this detention camp.</span> <span id="s1147">Was a group of Polish forced laborers.</span> <span id="s1148">People who were taken out of Poland--not in concentration camp, but were taken out as a family to work on fields in Germany.</span> <span id="s1149">And they were the forced...Polish forced labor.</span> <span id="s1150">Not Jews.</span> <span id="s1151">Forced labor.</span> <span id="s1152">So I decided I gonna go with them.</span> <span id="s1153">May as well go back to Poland, which is closer to Czechoslovakia than wherever I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Did you... Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1155">Did you explain to the Americans that you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s1156">You were still in this German uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: I had...I had nothing to explain.</span> <span id="s1158">I couldn't speak it.</span> <span id="s1159">I couldn't speak at all.</span> <span id="s1160">I couldn't speak at all that.</span> <span id="s1161">Couldn't even say that.</span> <span id="s1162">And with the Polish, I definitely would not say I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1163">The Polish are definitely against Jews.</span> <span id="s1164">So they put us to a camp; and we were in a camp which seemed like it was a big school or something.</span> <span id="s1165">Because they gave me a room to sleep, because next day they're gonna take me to...to Poland.</span> <span id="s1166">I speak Polish also, among other languages.</span> <span id="s1167">I speak, I think, seven of them.</span> <span id="s1168">So I..</span> <span id="s1169">.</span> <span id="s1170">except I speak Slavic languages, instead of speaking English.</span> <span id="s1171">And I slept on the floor that time.</span> <span id="s1172">And at least I slept in a room.</span> <span id="s1173">I mean, it was the first time I really slept in a room.</span> <span id="s1174">And they're taking us to...separate next morning, the families and everything else.</span> <span id="s1175">They take us on trucks.</span> <span id="s1176">And they take us over... Seems like between the Russian Army and the American Army, there was a no man's land.</span> <span id="s1177">They kept a separation--I think it was about a few miles.</span> <span id="s1178">It comes about evening...late in the evening and we go to the Polish...uh, go to the Russian side.</span> <span id="s1179">And now, of all things, I became Polish.</span> <span id="s1180">And... (laughing) and...and we get off...we going on the other side.</span> <span id="s1181">And it's quite late at night and we always get off the truck; and the Polish laborers they had...bundles, you know, and blankets, whatever.</span> <span id="s1182">And whatever they looted, whatever they robbed, and everything else.</span> <span id="s1183">They take the men, separate the men; and they separate the women and children.</span> <span id="s1184">And I became part of the men.</span> <span id="s1185">I walked in with the men; and even having a German jacket, I spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s1186">So...so that there was no uh ...uh, it didn't mean any difference.</span> <span id="s1187">They didn't expect me not to be Polish.</span> <span id="s1188">You marched to a field.</span> <span id="s1189">And a little fellow came up.</span> <span id="s1190">I mean, maybe five feet tall.</span> <span id="s1191">A Russian Colonel or a Russian General, whatever he was.</span> <span id="s1192">And he gives us a..</span> <span id="s1193">.</span> <span id="s1194">a speech.</span> <span id="s1195">He says that we have collaborated.</span> <span id="s1196">Doesn't mean me as a Jew, but me as Polak.</span> <span id="s1197">All of us...all of the Polish men.</span> <span id="s1198">We collaborated to the Germans, to the war machines of Germany, for the destruction of Russia.</span> <span id="s1199">And now we are his enemies, and we gonna be all shot.</span> <span id="s1200">For this, I went through a concentration camp--to be shot by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1201">So he said: but since the Russian government is.</span> <span id="s1202">.</span> <span id="s1203">is a good-hearted government, he exonerates us for only [one] reason--because we volunteer into the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s1204">And by stroke of this word, we became Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s1205">But by that time, Germany and Russia was already in chaos.</span> <span id="s1206">The whole thing was in chaos.</span> <span id="s1207">So they didn't have any pants to give us; so I had only pair...pair of German boots, and I didn't have no socks.</span> <span id="s1208">I had my striped...still had my striped pants on.</span> <span id="s1209">He took this thing away...this German thing away, gave me a Russian jacket.</span> <span id="s1210">And we were marching with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1211">Marched all night long, and uh...no food.</span> <span id="s1212">Absolutely no food!</span> <span id="s1213">So we come to a little village.</span> <span id="s1214">And there is a Russian--is a high echelon soldier.</span> <span id="s1215">I don't know what he was.</span> <span id="s1216">Colonel, or whatever he was.</span> <span id="s1217">And he looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s1218">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1219">I just felt he looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s1220">So I went to him, and I says, "You know, I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1221">You have anything to eat?"</span> <span id="s1222">But he said, "In Russia, everybody's the same.</span> <span id="s1223">We don't care if you're Jew or not.</span> <span id="s1224">Everybody's the same."</span> <span id="s1225">So I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1226">And we kept on marching in, with our job was looting.</span> <span id="s1227">We were looting.</span> <span id="s1228">They were looting...whatever they could get ahold of, they were looting.</span> <span id="s1229">I didn't need anything.</span> <span id="s1230">I didn't want anything.</span> <span id="s1231">So the only thing I found was sugar.</span> <span id="s1232">I found two bags.</span> <span id="s1233">I went to somebody's German home; and two bags of sugar.</span> <span id="s1234">Like...only thing, I don't know why it possessed me.</span> <span id="s1235">That's all what I was...from all the looting what possessed me, just to have the two pieces of sugar.</span> <span id="s1236">And that was....they fed us, you know, this pork stuff and everything else.</span> <span id="s1237">And I was...I was sick, and I was tired and I was filthy, and everything else.</span> <span id="s1238">Eventually getting to a German...big German farm.</span> <span id="s1239">Big German farm.</span> <span id="s1240">And it's dust around it.</span> <span id="s1241">So everybody drink.</span> <span id="s1242">There's a tremendous amount of vodka they're drinking.</span> <span id="s1243">Tremendous amount of alcohol they were consuming.</span> <span id="s1244">And more...more what they're drinking, the more boisterous they're becoming, and the more dangerous I felt my...myself there.</span> <span id="s1245">First thing, not being Russian; and not being Polish, and not being Christian.</span> <span id="s1246">So...so the whole thing was awful frustrating.</span> <span id="s1247">Anyways, I go to the farmer.</span> <span id="s1248">And I speak to the farmer in German.</span> <span id="s1249">I said to him, "I'm Russian..." So I never thought about that.</span> <span id="s1250">I said, "I'm a Russian soldier, and I never slept in a bed for weeks."</span> <span id="s1251">I says, "I would love to sleep in a bed," I said to him.</span> <span id="s1252">But he said, "You know there is no bed.</span> <span id="s1253">You people took everything out.</span> <span id="s1254">You took everything over.</span> <span id="s1255">We are ourselves sleeping in a barn.</span> <span id="s1256">There's nothing there."</span> <span id="s1257">I said, "You know, I have two bags of sugar."</span> <span id="s1258">So I gave him the two bags of sugar.</span> <span id="s1259">So he wants to...he said to me, "You know, it's very amazing.</span> <span id="s1260">You being Russian, how come you speak such a good German?"</span> <span id="s1261">I said, "I went to the language school in Kiev."</span> <span id="s1262">I mean, I just made up.</span> <span id="s1263">I didn't trust him.</span> <span id="s1264">He doesn't trust me.</span> <span id="s1265">So I said I went to the language school in Kiev.</span> <span id="s1266">So he gave me a bed.</span> <span id="s1267">It seems like in a barn where the cow...where the cows are standing, where they're eating, seems like for the help or something there was a room beyond... beyond those where the cows were standing and eating.</span> <span id="s1268">So he gave me this room; and I slept overnight for these two bags of sugar.</span> <span id="s1269">Reveille in the morning.</span> <span id="s1270">I sleep.</span> <span id="s1271">I don't want to get up.</span> <span id="s1272">And they holler and they holler.</span> <span id="s1273">And I am scared.</span> <span id="s1274">I said, "The only thing is happen if they catch me, they'll think I overslept."</span> <span id="s1275">With all this noise.</span> <span id="s1276">If they believe me, they believe me.</span> <span id="s1277">If they don't believe me, they don't believe me.</span> <span id="s1278">And I stayed there.</span> <span id="s1279">And I stayed there 'til maybe afternoon.</span> <span id="s1280">Scared.</span> <span id="s1281">Scared.</span> <span id="s1282">Scared.</span> <span id="s1283">Scared.</span> <span id="s1284">I mean, I didn't want to die.</span> <span id="s1285">This time now, I didn't want to die anymore.</span> <span id="s1286">I mean, finished.</span> <span id="s1287">The dying part...part is over.</span> <span id="s1288">And I was lucky enough...they weren't there.</span> <span id="s1289">They left me behind.</span> <span id="s1290">I go out.</span> <span id="s1291">It seems like somebody, another man, had the same idea what I had.</span> <span id="s1292">He had the same idea.</span> <span id="s1293">So him and I, we decided we're gonna go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1294">So this...this... They left the farmer with a horse and a..</span> <span id="s1295">.</span> <span id="s1296">and a..</span> <span id="s1297">.</span> <span id="s1298">like a carriage.</span> <span id="s1299">So he said, "Let's take the farmer's carriage, and let's go at night."</span> <span id="s1300">And I couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1301">I mean, he's the fellow who saved me.</span> <span id="s1302">He's the fellow who gave me a room to sleep.</span> <span id="s1303">So I says, "No, we're not going to take it.</span> <span id="s1304">Let's walk and find somewheres else."</span> <span id="s1305">So sure enough, we kept on marching and we saw a German with a..</span> <span id="s1306">.</span> <span id="s1307">with a same thing--with the horse and thing.</span> <span id="s1308">We took his, and we...we kept on going.</span> <span id="s1309">We didn't go too far.</span> <span id="s1310">They took us...the Russian...somebody, not Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s1311">They caught a transport of forced laborers, which same [as] with we went they took the men away.</span> <span id="s1312">This was a transport where the families was still together.</span> <span id="s1313">So they made...this man and I, we joined them in the event that we going on the way to Poland.</span> <span id="s1314">So we stop at night time.</span> <span id="s1315">We stop, and they separated the men and the women.</span> <span id="s1316">And it was like a..</span> <span id="s1317">.</span> <span id="s1318">a garage, in a big garage.</span> <span id="s1319">A car garage.</span> <span id="s1320">So the men slept in one garage, and the wives slept in the other garage.</span> <span id="s1321">The soldiers got themselves drunk, and they raped all the women.</span> <span id="s1322">The noise was unbearable.</span> <span id="s1323">And it was the worst thing was...was the husband or lovers or brothers had to listen to the yelling of the...the women.</span> <span id="s1324">Next morning, nobody looked at each other.</span> <span id="s1325">The women didn't look at the men.</span> <span id="s1326">The men didn't look at the woman.</span> <span id="s1327">It was tremendous embarrassment.</span> <span id="s1328">Tremendous embarrassment.</span> <span id="s1329">But anyways, we getting into Poland.</span> <span id="s1330">Poland...we came into Poland.</span> <span id="s1331">I escaped, and I decided... No.</span> <span id="s1332">No.</span> <span id="s1333">Not true.</span> <span id="s1334">We came into Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1335">We came into Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1336">The transports was going to continue into Poland.</span> <span id="s1337">I escaped from Poland.</span> <span id="s1338">It was in...in the city of Plze_.</span> <span id="s1339">I went back to Teplice...to Prague.</span> <span id="s1340">I went to Prague, I got sick.</span> <span id="s1341">I eventually wound up--with all the beating what I had, I wound up in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1342">And I stayed in the hospital for almost three weeks.</span> <span id="s1343">And I was quite sick; and I was staying by myself.</span> <span id="s1344">They thought they're going to cheer me up.</span> <span id="s1345">So they put me in a room with Russian Colonels or ranking officers, also which was sick.</span> <span id="s1346">One fellow was sick because he was shooting at some uh...nest with soldiers, so they gave him a medal.</span> <span id="s1347">And he was sick.</span> <span id="s1348">And I was in this room with the soldier; which was like a ball to me, because every time they brought in food for the Russians, I got extra above and beyond.</span> <span id="s1349">And in Czechoslovakia, at that time wasn't so good.</span> <span id="s1350">Except that one bad thing--that every time they were drinking vodka, they were making me drink the vodka.</span> <span id="s1351">So with all the medication I got, I never got better.</span> <span id="s1352">And they couldn't understand how come I..</span> <span id="s1353">.</span> <span id="s1354">There was no reason I wasn't getting better; because not realizing I was drinking alcohol constantly with those Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s1355">'Til somebody found the reason, took me out and I got better.</span> <span id="s1356">And I went back to Teplice, to the city where I was born.</span> <span id="s1357">And uh ...I was the only Jew who came back.</span> <span id="s1358">There was nobody left in the whole city.</span> <span id="s1359">(Deep sigh - choking up) And we had a big house.</span> <span id="s1360">And the house belonged to us, you know, when we left.</span> <span id="s1361">But they couldn't give me the house back; because Teplice, where I'm...where I am from, is known for three things.</span> <span id="s1362">It's known for coal mining.</span> <span id="s1363">Known as a spa.</span> <span id="s1364">By the way, my mother was president of the culture of the city of Teplice.</span> <span id="s1365">And they make crystals.</span> <span id="s1366">So the German who was using my house was the engineer from the coal mine.</span> <span id="s1367">They didn't want to antagonize him, because in case he should do sabotage in the coal mine.</span> <span id="s1368">This was after the war.</span> <span id="s1369">So they...after the war.</span> <span id="s1370">This was in 19...end of l945.</span> <span id="s1371">The war ends in May.</span> <span id="s1372">And so not to antagonize him, so he shouldn't do any damage to the coal mine.</span> <span id="s1373">So they gave me a lovely apartment.</span> <span id="s1374">They gave me a complete furnished apartment; uh, and they gave me a business.</span> <span id="s1375">They gave me a business.</span> <span id="s1376">The Czech government gave me a business.</span> <span id="s1377">I don't know, because I was a unique.</span> <span id="s1378">You know, the unique person.</span> <span id="s1379">Finally, somebody came back.</span> <span id="s1380">They gave me an electrical store with the repair.</span> <span id="s1381">You know, doing the repair shops, everything else; which was quite good.</span> <span id="s1382">And I'll tell you a little small incidence.</span> <span id="s1383">And they gave me food stamps.</span> <span id="s1384">Above and beyond.</span> <span id="s1385">They gave me like privileged class food stamps.</span> <span id="s1386">So I had quite a lot of food.</span> <span id="s1387">So...so life was coming to that.</span> <span id="s1388">But I had no family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Absolutely nobody.</span> <span id="s1390">But...but life as...as for physical need was quite good.</span> <span id="s1391">And I am staying once in a butcher shop, and a woman comes over to me.</span> <span id="s1392">And she says to me in German--and at that time all of a sudden nobody spoke German.</span> <span id="s1393">Because all of a sudden, you became a Czech patriot.</span> <span id="s1394">Matter of fact, when I was born, my...even my birth certificate was still written in German.</span> <span id="s1395">But all of a sudden nobody spoke German.</span> <span id="s1396">So immediately it became Czechoslovakia, nobody speaks German.</span> <span id="s1397">Anyways, she comes over to me and speaks in German to me.</span> <span id="s1398">She said, uh, "Excuse me, can I ask you something?"</span> <span id="s1399">Here I don't know, should I say I speak German or shouldn't I?</span> <span id="s1400">So I didn't mind.</span> <span id="s1401">So she says, "Are you Mr. Helmer?"</span> <span id="s1402">Which was the most amazing thing.</span> <span id="s1403">So I says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1404">She says, "I was a maid for your parents.</span> <span id="s1405">And you look the same as your father."</span> <span id="s1406">And she became a maid of mine.</span> <span id="s1407">Not only her, her daughter.</span> <span id="s1408">And she...she didn't become a maid for...for wages, but there came another maid.</span> <span id="s1409">She came to cook for me, to clean for me.</span> <span id="s1410">She didn't stay with me.</span> <span id="s1411">For food; because I had enough food.</span> <span id="s1412">So they didn't have enough food.</span> <span id="s1413">So...so I stayed there.</span> <span id="s1414">And... and I travelled...I travelled to Prague a lot of time.</span> <span id="s1415">I had a room there, and everything else.</span> <span id="s1416">And life was quite good 'til one day they come, a year later; and they decided they want to draft me in the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s1417">I mean, the Party was creating a Czech Army, and they wanted to create I should be go to Russia.</span> <span id="s1418">I said, "Listen, I just came through all this mess, all this thing I went through all my life.</span> <span id="s1419">I mean, I don't have to tell you."</span> <span id="s1420">He said, the man says to me at the interview...he says, "Let's face it.</span> <span id="s1421">Who going to miss you?"</span> <span id="s1422">So it was very bad.</span> <span id="s1423">And I refused to do so; and instead they gave me time to think about it.</span> <span id="s1424">I said, "Okay, give me time to think about it."</span> <span id="s1425">But at the same token, they started taking my food away.</span> <span id="s1426">They start taking the...uh, the food stamps away--the better food stamps away.</span> <span id="s1427">And not only this; they took my store away.</span> <span id="s1428">And I became a helper to an electrician in my own store.</span> <span id="s1429">I mean, the store wasn't mine anymore.</span> <span id="s1430">They gave it to a..</span> <span id="s1431">.</span> <span id="s1432">to a comrade who was better than I.</span> <span id="s1433">At least I had a job to go.</span> <span id="s1434">And life became quite unbearable.</span> <span id="s1435">Life became quite unbearable.</span> <span id="s1436">I went to Prague, and I met somebody who said he's going to go...smuggle himself out.</span> <span id="s1437">He's going to Israel.</span> <span id="s1438">I says, "You know something?</span> <span id="s1439">Israel is better than...than here.</span> <span id="s1440">How do I get out?"</span> <span id="s1441">What I wanted, at that time, I thought maybe I go to America.</span> <span id="s1442">I had...my mother had a sister, an older sister here.</span> <span id="s1443">"I go to America."</span> <span id="s1444">I said, "If not Israel, I want to go to America."</span> <span id="s1445">So I got in touch in....with the Haganah.</span> <span id="s1446">And the Haganah said, "You come to Marienbad [NB: Mariánské Lázn_], and we gonna smuggle you through back to Germany."</span> <span id="s1447">So I said, "What is..." They said, "No packages, no clothing.</span> <span id="s1448">You walk out of your apartment.</span> <span id="s1449">Make sure you keep the stove running, like you walked down to the grocery for a paper or something.</span> <span id="s1450">Leave the lights on.</span> <span id="s1451">Walk out, and not come back."</span> <span id="s1452">And exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s1453">I don't know what happened to the apartment, whatever was boiling there.</span> <span id="s1454">I went to Karlsbad [NB: Karlovy Vary].</span> <span id="s1455">I stayed in Karlsbad for a day, and to Marienbad.</span> <span id="s1456">The only thing which I didn't do, which they asked me to do, is they said they wanted to give all my papers up.</span> <span id="s1457">Which I did...wasn't ready to do so.</span> <span id="s1458">So I didn't give my papers.</span> <span id="s1459">I was smuggled...there was a group maybe of four.</span> <span id="s1460">There was a little...young girl, and there were two ladies and two men.</span> <span id="s1461">There must have been five of us.</span> <span id="s1462">And there was shooting with the thing; and finally we got to Germany.</span> <span id="s1463">I don't know if the Russians...I don't know if the Russians were shooting at us, or the Germans or the Polish--or the Czech were shooting us, or the Germans were shooting us.</span> <span id="s1464">There was shooting going on.</span> <span id="s1465">And I remember we came down a..</span> <span id="s1466">.</span> <span id="s1467">a like a ravine or something, on our behinds, you know.</span> <span id="s1468">But he says nothing.</span> <span id="s1469">And finally I wound up in the country of my enemy.</span> <span id="s1470">And I wind up in Germany again.</span> <span id="s1471">And I wound up in Munich.</span> <span id="s1472">And I had to... And at that time, a lot of Jews had...did a lot of black marketeering.</span> <span id="s1473">Black marketeering became...became a way of supporting self.</span> <span id="s1474">I just couldn't do it; so I got myself a little bit of a job with--not with HIAS--with the Jewish Restitution Committee, something.</span> <span id="s1475">And I..</span> <span id="s1476">.</span> <span id="s1477">I made not...didn't make enough, but I had enough.</span> <span id="s1478">And I stayed in the city in Munich, and bought a stye.</span> <span id="s1479">Which... I stayed with a lady whose son--she was German-- whose son was executed two days before the war ended.</span> <span id="s1480">Maybe you heard about it.</span> <span id="s1481">He was...he did the rebellion, the high school rebellion in the school.</span> <span id="s1482">He was one of her son.</span> <span id="s1483">So I stayed with this lady.</span> <span id="s1484">Then, from nowheres, Renya--the girl which I knew from the underground--pops up in Munich.</span> <span id="s1485">I don't know how she found me.</span> <span id="s1486">What happen is, she found me in Munich.</span> <span id="s1487">And she says, "You cannot give up responsibility."</span> <span id="s1488">And I joined the CIC, which is the counterintelligence; and I became an agent of the counterintelligence, looking for Nazis.</span> <span id="s1489">So...which was in itself not a bad thing, because this gave me an opportunity to travel and looking for my family.</span> <span id="s1490">So I wound up in Poland again.</span> <span id="s1491">And I wound up in the city of _ód_, in the city where I lived.</span> <span id="s1492">(Sigh) And I..</span> <span id="s1493">.</span> <span id="s1494">I went up to the apartment, and found food stamps.</span> <span id="s1495">The old food stamps, and some other papers which I donated to the Museum.</span> <span id="s1496">But I never found anybody else.</span> <span id="s1497">By the way, when I went back...the reason I went back to Poland is that the Colonel was in charge of me says, "I hear rumors that the Jews which go back to Poland are being killed."</span> <span id="s1498">So he said he wants to find out.</span> <span id="s1499">So I went back as a Polak.</span> <span id="s1500">And sure enough, there...they formed an organization which was called Armia Krajowa, "the Army of the Land."</span> <span id="s1501">So when a Jew came back to a small town and he wanted his home, his business, whatever this else, the fellow [who] was taking care of it found it legally became his all of a sudden after a year and a half.</span> <span id="s1502">So they used to kill them.</span> <span id="s1503">Matter of fact, I've pictures...report of those pictures also donated to the Museum with names mentioned and towns where those Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s1504">After coming back from all those years in the concentration camp, they were killed by the Armia Krajowa.</span> <span id="s1505">And I didn't find anybody else, and I couldn't wait to leave Poland.</span> <span id="s1506">Never went back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1507">Went back to Germany and looking for Nazis.</span> <span id="s1508">I looked a lot.</span> <span id="s1509">I was looking for a particular Nazi.</span> <span id="s1510">I was looking for who they said worked for UFA.</span> <span id="s1511">UFA is like a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer--a film company.</span> <span id="s1512">And I was...as a German, we says we want to see how he is.</span> <span id="s1513">We tried to get him as [if] we wanted him to form a former German organization.</span> <span id="s1514">We tried to get ahold of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1516">I don't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: We tried to...we didn't go to question the Germans as a Germans.</span> <span id="s1518">I questioned them as a ex- Nazi.</span> <span id="s1519">I didn't want to... you know, all of a sudden, "Here I am.</span> <span id="s1520">Good morning."</span> <span id="s1521">I mean, what you're looking for him as...as we want to get in touch with him where they are... Just to find out where they are.</span> <span id="s1522">Because after I knew where they were, it wasn't my job to get ahold of them, to catch them.</span> <span id="s1523">So long as we find where he was.</span> <span id="s1524">As a matter of fact, they sent me to this UFA--which, as I just said, was a film thing--I met a lady.</span> <span id="s1525">Who we were looking for this particular big shot from the city of Beckum, in Germany.</span> <span id="s1526">The reason we were looking...it's a very interesting thing is, I was looking for this particular Nazi all over.</span> <span id="s1527">The Colonel who was 8 Possible reference to the Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">my colonel of CIC, he came from Beckum.</span> <span id="s1529">He was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1530">When Hitler came to power, he went to England to school.</span> <span id="s1531">He stays in England.</span> <span id="s1532">And his parents lived in Beckum, a small town, as a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s1533">His mother passed away.</span> <span id="s1534">His father was getting old.</span> <span id="s1535">He was...had a maid--a woman who was taking care of the father, you know-- before the Nazis...the Nazis took over.</span> <span id="s1536">So she stayed in the same house, taking care of this old man.</span> <span id="s1537">This particular Nazi I was looking for got ahold of this lady; and he said, "You slept with a Jew."</span> <span id="s1538">Took this man and threw him down a flight of steps.</span> <span id="s1539">Took this lady, and put her in a garbage--at that time, you know, horse...horses were carrying...taking garbage out, you know, for garbage...to take to garbage dump.</span> <span id="s1540">So she was in this--reminds me of Robespierre, of the French Revolution.</span> <span id="s1541">They took them...they took this woman through the city on this garbage heap, with a big sign: "I'm a Jew lover.</span> <span id="s1542">I sleep with Jews."</span> <span id="s1543">So this was his vengeance.</span> <span id="s1544">He wanted to find this Nazi, just to revenge himself against...because ...against his father and this lady.</span> <span id="s1545">So this eventually wind up in UFA; and I met this lady which wanted a lot of money to tell me where he is.</span> <span id="s1546">So I went back to the Colonel; and he says, "Give it to her."</span> <span id="s1547">Money with him didn't matter or anything.</span> <span id="s1548">So I finally went with money; and she's changed her mind.</span> <span id="s1549">Says she will not do it.</span> <span id="s1550">So I never found him.</span> <span id="s1551">Actually, I never found him.</span> <span id="s1552">I found out years later.</span> <span id="s1553">I met a sergeant who was sergeant in this...this headquarters there.</span> <span id="s1554">He was...this same German we were looking for...was a cook in headquarters.</span> <span id="s1555">He never left the town.</span> <span id="s1556">He was always there.</span> <span id="s1557">And I was looking all over for him.</span> <span id="s1558">He was there as a cook.</span> <span id="s1559">And we found out because he had a girlfriend who finally...uh, reported him.</span> <span id="s1560">It was years after I already came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: What was the Nazi's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1563">I don't remember his name.</span> <span id="s1564">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1565">K..</span> <span id="s1566">.</span> <span id="s1567">K..</span> <span id="s1568">.</span> <span id="s1569">K..</span> <span id="s1570">.</span> <span id="s1571">Something with a</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">K. So...so...so I was looking.</span> <span id="s1573">So I never found.</span> <span id="s1574">And I never found anybody else.</span> <span id="s1575">So one day I go also looking, and going to Landsberg--which is outside of Munich.</span> <span id="s1576">And I'm looking...looking for...for...for Nazis.</span> <span id="s1577">I'm looking for my...anybody family.</span> <span id="s1578">Can't find it.</span> <span id="s1579">Landsberg was a prison camp, what Hitler wrote Mein Kampf.</span> <span id="s1580">Outside of Munich.</span> <span id="s1581">He was in jail, and he wrote Mein Kampf.</span> <span id="s1582">And they made a DP camp out it.</span> <span id="s1583">Looking now.</span> <span id="s1584">"Does anybody know Sonia?"</span> <span id="s1585">"You have a picture?"</span> <span id="s1586">I have no picture.</span> <span id="s1587">I don't have no picture.</span> <span id="s1588">Actually, I was not looking for Sonia.</span> <span id="s1589">I was looking for Helmers.</span> <span id="s1590">Any Helmer.</span> <span id="s1591">And actually, I was looking for Irving--my brother's name.</span> <span id="s1592">And Irving Helmer, I thought, "He's a man.</span> <span id="s1593">He's gonna..." He was young enough to survive.</span> <span id="s1594">He was around six years younger than I was.</span> <span id="s1595">If anybody survived it, he's the one survived.</span> <span id="s1596">Leaving Landsberg, as disappointed as I was always disappointed, you know.</span> <span id="s1597">And it's... And I'm... We getting to a traffic light.</span> <span id="s1598">And I hitched a ride.</span> <span id="s1599">I hitched a ride, and we're coming to a traffic light.</span> <span id="s1600">I'm going one direction; and there's a traffic light, and letting the traffic go.</span> <span id="s1601">And there's...and naturally, the other side, the same thing--staying for the traffic light.</span> <span id="s1602">You pass each other.</span> <span id="s1603">And I hear a voice.</span> <span id="s1604">I don't know if it's directed to me or not.</span> <span id="s1605">He says, "How is Sonia?"</span> <span id="s1606">My sister's name is Sonia.</span> <span id="s1607">(Crying) And I said, "She's dead."</span> <span id="s1608">And this voice... I don't know.</span> <span id="s1609">Sonia is a popular name, so it doesn't have to be addressed toward me.</span> <span id="s1610">He said, "I just saw her."</span> <span id="s1611">I don't know... I mean, since then, you know, my life completely changed at that time.</span> <span id="s1612">I had one aim in life: to look for my sister.</span> <span id="s1613">I'm still in Munich.</span> <span id="s1614">And once in a while I go to the British ...British headquarters; because I was working for the British CIC.</span> <span id="s1615">Because Renya, this woman, was involved with them.</span> <span id="s1616">So I don't know how she got ahold of me.</span> <span id="s1617">And I can't find her.</span> <span id="s1618">And I am once...I'm still involved officially with this UJA--with this...this Jewish Distribution Committeejust to have a legality, you know.</span> <span id="s1619">I meet a girl.</span> <span id="s1620">She knows me, allegedly.</span> <span id="s1621">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1622">She said, "I saw Sonia."</span> <span id="s1623">I says... So this was really good hope.</span> <span id="s1624">"She lives somewheres in Hannover."</span> <span id="s1625">So I go to Hannover.</span> <span id="s1626">There is no camps.</span> <span id="s1627">There is no camps where I can find Sonia.</span> <span id="s1628">And this woman's girlfriend lived in Hannover.</span> <span id="s1629">So I finally meet this woman; and she says, "Yes, I know Sonia Helmer.</span> <span id="s1630">She doesn't live far from me.</span> <span id="s1631">Matter of fact, we invited for a New Year's Day party there."</span> <span id="s1632">She says, "You want to come with me?</span> <span id="s1633">I go with you."</span> <span id="s1634">I said, "By all means."</span> <span id="s1635">I go with her.</span> <span id="s1636">So we go from Hannover to the city where Sonia lives.</span> <span id="s1637">Except at that time the trains weren't running at night time.</span> <span id="s1638">So we stayed in the station overnight.</span> <span id="s1639">And next morning--6 in the morning--we missed the New Year's Day party, but the train didn't run because it was New Year's.</span> <span id="s1640">Next morning, she finally walked.</span> <span id="s1641">She knows where she is.</span> <span id="s1642">She walks to Sonia['s place]; and she knocks on the door.</span> <span id="s1643">It's about 6 or 5:30 in the morning.</span> <span id="s1644">And Sonia lived with a girlfriend by the name of Hannah, who she went through the camp.</span> <span id="s1645">And Hannah opens the door and says, "Oh, my God, how come you came late?</span> <span id="s1646">You missed the party and everything else."</span> <span id="s1647">And I'm staying outside.</span> <span id="s1648">And uh...she said, "The train wasn't running.</span> <span id="s1649">But I brought a friend of mine."</span> <span id="s1650">So Sonia, meanwhile, comes out...comes out from the room.</span> <span id="s1651">I just hear it.</span> <span id="s1652">I didn't see it.</span> <span id="s1653">"Oh, somebody's here.</span> <span id="s1654">Oh, good!</span> <span id="s1655">Let me go in and put something on."</span> <span id="s1656">So she walks out, comes back and comes to me and says... Kisses this girl; and comes to me and says, "Hello.</span> <span id="s1657">How are you?"</span> <span id="s1658">Not realizing who I am.</span> <span id="s1659">And she fainted.</span> <span id="s1660">And this how I met my sister.</span> <span id="s1661">And by then, I already had my papers to come to America.</span> <span id="s1662">Because I had an uncle who lived in Israel got ahold of me.</span> <span id="s1663">And he said, "Don't come to Israel.</span> <span id="s1664">Circumstances are very, very bad.</span> <span id="s1665">Come to America...if you have a chance, go to America."</span> <span id="s1666">So I had a chance to go to America as--not as a displaced person, as...as a political refugee.</span> <span id="s1667">So I came as...as a political refugee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: What about Sonia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Sonia stayed there.</span> <span id="s1670">And she stayed here.</span> <span id="s1671">She had papers to go as a domestic to Canada.</span> <span id="s1672">And her...her life, winding up in Canada, is an experience in itself.</span> <span id="s1673">Terrible experience she had.</span> <span id="s1674">That this was after the war.</span> <span id="s1675">And I wind up going to Hannover, and coming to America.</span> <span id="s1676">Except I had the fortune to come on two boats.</span> <span id="s1677">It usually takes the trip between 5 and 6 days to come to America.</span> <span id="s1678">21 days.</span> <span id="s1679">I..</span> <span id="s1680">.</span> <span id="s1681">I took a boat ride for 21 days.</span> <span id="s1682">What is happen is, I left on the Marilyn Marlene, that lost the rudder in the English Channel.</span> <span id="s1683">And England didn't want to take us in.</span> <span id="s1684">They wouldn't take in a bunch of refugees and displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1685">So we...we bounced on the seas; and it was getting rougher and rougher.</span> <span id="s1686">Not enough life preservers.</span> <span id="s1687">So they put the men in the hull, hull with the bottom hull.</span> <span id="s1688">Not enough food.</span> <span id="s1689">Finally, after all those days food ran out.</span> <span id="s1690">So they only gave us Coca-Cola to drink.</span> <span id="s1691">And the boat was once up, once is down.</span> <span id="s1692">So the glasses--at that time, Coca-Cola came in glass bottles--were breaking against the hull, against the wall of the thing.</span> <span id="s1693">And so we were walking on...on glass.</span> <span id="s1694">When 9 Joint Distribution Committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">you walk, you were falling; so we sat.</span> <span id="s1696">They didn't have enough life preservers.</span> <span id="s1697">So after this, I left on Marilyn Marlene, a ship.</span> <span id="s1698">A boat, Ernie Pyle, came.</span> <span id="s1699">And we transferred on the high seas, in the English Channel.</span> <span id="s1700">Once the boat was here and once the life boat was there; so we was bouncing.</span> <span id="s1701">And under those circumstances, we came after 21 days.</span> <span id="s1702">I made America with six dollars in my pocket.</span> <span id="s1703">And... and I decided I gonna start a new life.</span> <span id="s1704">So I had six dollars and a suitcase of books.</span> <span id="s1705">I had no clothing.</span> <span id="s1706">So I had a coat ...a coat on.</span> <span id="s1707">I had a coat and my suit on.</span> <span id="s1708">So I took the coat, and I threw it in the Hudson River.</span> <span id="s1709">So I said, "If I start with nothing, it may as well be everything nothing."</span> <span id="s1710">So I threw my coat on April 1st in the Hudson River.</span> <span id="s1711">I came away with the books and a suit on my back.</span> <span id="s1712">And that's how I wound up in America.</span> <span id="s1713">And after this... I mean, I got a jobs.</span> <span id="s1714">And uh...my sister was in Canada.</span> <span id="s1715">And she had bad experiences.</span> <span id="s1716">The problem is, very good looking girl.</span> <span id="s1717">Got a job as a domestic for a doctor.</span> <span id="s1718">Bewildered.</span> <span id="s1719">Doesn't speak the language.</span> <span id="s1720">Doesn't know anything.</span> <span id="s1721">The first night in Canada, he sneaked into her room.</span> <span id="s1722">Was the most shocking experience she ever had.</span> <span id="s1723">And naturally, she made enough noise.</span> <span id="s1724">Went back to the camp, got scared of...of Canadians, wants to go back, doesn't want to stay in Canada because of this experience.</span> <span id="s1725">Wasn't raped.</span> <span id="s1726">She wasn't raped.</span> <span id="s1727">No, she wasn't raped.</span> <span id="s1728">She was...fondled.</span> <span id="s1729">Uh... But finally she got in touch with a doctor...with a Doctor Cohn in Hamilton.</span> <span id="s1730">And they adopted her as a child, as a daughter.</span> <span id="s1731">And matter of fact, now she consider the boys now as her brothers.</span> <span id="s1732">And...and she...she finally she made quite well.</span> <span id="s1733">Went to school, became supervisor of nursing, married...married very poorly, started in business with two thousand dollars, sold it for many, many millions.</span> <span id="s1734">And she's doing quite well.</span> <span id="s1735">And with me, I..</span> <span id="s1736">.</span> <span id="s1737">it was a struggle also.</span> <span id="s1738">Coming to America was a struggle.</span> <span id="s1739">Got a job.</span> <span id="s1740">Came here, and...and because...because a friend in the movies--we knew through somebody, through my cousin, knew Eddie Cantor.</span> <span id="s1741">And through Eddie Cantor--I never met him personally.</span> <span id="s1742">He said since I played with S. S. Cuddles--he was in Hollywood at that time, as S. S. Sagal.</span> <span id="s1743">But I don't speak English.</span> <span id="s1744">He said, "You have two chances."</span> <span id="s1745">One, I can become a usher at Radio City Music Hall; or, I can become a waiters somewheres upsta...in one of the Catskill resorts.</span> <span id="s1746">And I didn't want any of those two.</span> <span id="s1747">I just felt I don't want to be subservient, somehow.</span> <span id="s1748">I just...I just didn't want to serve.</span> <span id="s1749">I mean, it through...so through my cousin I got a job in S. Klein Department Stores, at that time.</span> <span id="s1750">And I got a job, I think, six days a week, 10 hours, a day; because I need hours.</span> <span id="s1751">And I came home with a big 22 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1752">And something interesting thing is, for months I was living on salami sandwiches.</span> <span id="s1753">The reason was S. Klein had a cafeteria.</span> <span id="s1754">I hardly spoke English.</span> <span id="s1755">Matter of fact, if I went to the elevator, if anybody spoke to me and if I went up the elevator, I used to point down.</span> <span id="s1756">And if I went down I used to point up; so long I don't have to travel with them, because just in case they spoke to me.</span> <span id="s1757">So I went to the cafeteria.</span> <span id="s1758">And I see on the boards there they have salami.</span> <span id="s1759">I say, "Salami!</span> <span id="s1760">Salami in any other language has to be Salami."</span> <span id="s1761">And so this was at that time a cafeteria; and I go to the window and I say, "Salami."</span> <span id="s1762">And he says something to me.</span> <span id="s1763">And I don't know what he's talking to me.</span> <span id="s1764">Except by luck there was bread on the...on the counter; and he was pointing with his big knife to breads.</span> <span id="s1765">So when finally he got the rye bread, I shook my head.</span> <span id="s1766">So he made me a salami sandwich.</span> <span id="s1767">To make this long story short is, for months I was eating salami sandwiches and a container of milk by the register.</span> <span id="s1768">They thought I was nuts.</span> <span id="s1769">Because I had a fetish for salami sandwiches.</span> <span id="s1770">So whenever I went, I already had...before I got to them, I had my salami sandwich and two containers of milk.</span> <span id="s1771">And this what I lived on--salami sandwiches and two containers of milk-- because I didn't speak.</span> <span id="s1772">So eventually, it got better.</span> <span id="s1773">And my sister lands in Canada.</span> <span id="s1774">So I had to forsake salami sandwiches, because I couldn't afford to eat salami sandwiches and send money to my sister.</span> <span id="s1775">So I learned not to eat lunches.</span> <span id="s1776">And which I still doing now, just because...because of my sister's salami sandwiches.</span> <span id="s1777">And...and...and that's how I became... And this is my whole escapade, I think.</span> <span id="s1778">Oh.</span> <span id="s1779">Let me tell you something else.</span> <span id="s1780">When we walked away from the Kruppwerke, we went to another...to another camp, at that time.</span> <span id="s1781">Because after bombardment, seems like they didn't safe...feel safe, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1782">We marched through the city.</span> <span id="s1783">And it's the most amazing thing is, we marched as a disheveled group.</span> <span id="s1784">I mean skinny, dirty, filthy, no shoes and no nothing.</span> <span id="s1785">And we marched finally...the first time we marched was a German town.</span> <span id="s1786">There was a most compassionate... compassionate people I saw.</span> <span id="s1787">Not compassion in...in outpouring of...of sympathy some.</span> <span id="s1788">But in their faces.</span> <span id="s1789">In their faces.</span> <span id="s1790">There was no hatred.</span> <span id="s1791">And they knew, obviously, that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1792">I mean, shoulders with the star and all the other garbage on it.</span> <span id="s1793">They knew about it.</span> <span id="s1794">But they were...they were compassion.</span> <span id="s1795">There...there was humanity in their faces.</span> <span id="s1796">Which was very, very seldom.</span> <span id="s1797">I never saw it, because I never encountered human...a population itself.</span> <span id="s1798">Only the SS and the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1799">And I want to say something else.</span> <span id="s1800">I was very hungry when I got freed out of the camp.</span> <span id="s1801">And when I finally I got to the camp which they took me as a Polak to Poland, to become a Russian soldier, I was quite hungry.</span> <span id="s1802">Because the American didn't give me...threw the meat to the dog, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1803">I met a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s1804">And I don't think he looked better than I did.</span> <span id="s1805">But anyways, he was a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s1806">And I was very hungry; and I ask him for food.</span> <span id="s1807">I don't know why I ask him for food.</span> <span id="s1808">So he had a knapsack in the back.</span> <span id="s1809">He opened his knapsack, had a big round bread.</span> <span id="s1810">Big bread.</span> <span id="s1811">Big bread.</span> <span id="s1812">Took his knife, took a knife and cut the top of the bread--which was maybe two...two inches thick.</span> <span id="s1813">I thought, "Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s1814">This is the biggest meal I ever get."</span> <span id="s1815">Took this two inches of slice for himself, and gave me the whole bread.</span> <span id="s1816">That's right!</span> <span id="s1817">So who needs so much bread?</span> <span id="s1818">So there was... there was a little German fellow there, a little German boy.</span> <span id="s1819">So I didn't have a knife.</span> <span id="s1820">So I broke my half and I gave him the other half.</span> <span id="s1821">And at that time, I stop hating them.</span> <span id="s1822">(Crying) Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Beno.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: What do you think the effect of...of all this has been on you?</span> <span id="s1826">A: On me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A:.</span> <span id="s1829">I don't know what effect it has.</span> <span id="s1830">I..</span> <span id="s1831">.</span> <span id="s1832">I don't dwell on the past.</span> <span id="s1833">Matter of fact, so in all honesty I'm doing this just to perpetuate; my children should remember it.</span> <span id="s1834">I personally, I don't want to remember too much.</span> <span id="s1835">I just can't dwell on it; because if I dwell, I have to hate.</span> <span id="s1836">And I have no time for that.</span> <span id="s1837">I absolutely have no time for hating.</span> <span id="s1838">I mean, it's... my father used to say hating is...takes an effort.</span> <span id="s1839">And I don't want to take this effort.</span> <span id="s1840">I'm a firm believer now also, it's start to pay back.</span> <span id="s1841">And I'm paying back through charity.</span> <span id="s1842">Not only as much financial charity; I mean, it's something I cannot afford.</span> <span id="s1843">I'm involved with the Lubavitcher movement, I'm involved with the Holocaust Museum, I'm involved with the UJA; but I've become a volunteer.</span> <span id="s1844">I'm a volunteer for an old age home.</span> <span id="s1845">And I became their feeder.</span> <span id="s1846">And I go to most sickly people who nobody wants to help anymore.</span> <span id="s1847">Because when I took the job... I'm also a volunteer in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1848">And when I took the job in the old-age homes, "Most geriatrics," the lady said to me, "in the hospital, 99 percent go home.</span> <span id="s1849">Here, nobody.</span> <span id="s1850">Nobody goes home."</span> <span id="s1851">And they're pillars of the society.</span> <span id="s1852">We have people there which are are vegetables.</span> <span id="s1853">Vegetables.</span> <span id="s1854">We have a friend of the lady who used to provide the soaps...soaps for--not only soaps--Imogene Coca and Sid Caesar program she writes.</span> <span id="s1855">We have a editor lady there, was editor of the Palm Beach Post.</span> <span id="s1856">I mean, we have a young, a fairly young, man in the early 50s, which is a sculptor--quite a renowned sculptor.</span> <span id="s1857">I mean, it's people, it's...it's...it's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1858">People who were active.</span> <span id="s1859">People who were brains.</span> <span id="s1860">People who used them.</span> <span id="s1861">People who did.</span> <span id="s1862">And the bunch laying there.</span> <span id="s1863">There [is] Shirley...in the fetal position.</span> <span id="s1864">I mean, it's nothing.</span> <span id="s1865">There's a tremendous gorgeous garden named after her.</span> <span id="s1866">And it's amazing.</span> <span id="s1867">So anyways... My only problem is... I have a problem with this also.</span> <span id="s1868">I see my mother in them.</span> <span id="s1869">I don't know why I see her.</span> <span id="s1870">It...(crying) So sometime I don't know if I do it through compassion, or do it because I want to cleanse myself.</span> <span id="s1871">But anyways, it's...it's gratifying.</span> <span id="s1872">I find it extremely gratifying.</span> <span id="s1873">And I can't wait to go there.</span> <span id="s1874">I can't wait to go there.</span> <span id="s1875">And everybody says, "How can you do it?</span> <span id="s1876">You have to be strong.</span> <span id="s1877">You have to be something."</span> <span id="s1878">(Softly) You don't have to be at all.</span> <span id="s1879">You don't have to be at all.</span> <span id="s1880">(Crying - pause) It's enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1883">Oh.</span> <span id="s1884">(Deep sigh - pause) Can I mention my children?</span> <span id="s1885">Q: Yes, please.</span> <span id="s1886">Bonnie, let's turn the tape back on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1888">Let me tell you something.</span> <span id="s1889">There's better stories.</span> <span id="s1890">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1891">We're on.</span> <span id="s1892">Tell us about your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: Let me tell you about my wife.</span> <span id="s1894">It's a fabulous girl.</span> <span id="s1895">She is a physiotherapist.</span> <span id="s1896">I..</span> <span id="s1897">.</span> <span id="s1898">when I worked in this S. Klein Department Store, I met a fellow who was a buyer for lingerie.</span> <span id="s1899">His name was Carl Boxer.</span> <span id="s1900">And I don't know why it possessed me.</span> <span id="s1901">He showed me a wallet of his.</span> <span id="s1902">And I don't know why men like to look through wallets.</span> <span id="s1903">He showed me a wallet, and he showed me a picture of a girl sitting on a chair.</span> <span id="s1904">And I said, "Who is this girl?"</span> <span id="s1905">He says, "This is a neighbor of mine who lives in the same building where I live in Brooklyn."</span> <span id="s1906">I said, "Carl, this the girl I gonna marry."</span> <span id="s1907">He says, "Beno, you are nuts!"</span> <span id="s1908">I said, "Carl, this is the girl I gonna marry."</span> <span id="s1909">He said, "Never in a million years.</span> <span id="s1910">She wouldn't even go out with you."</span> <span id="s1911">So anyways, on the circumstances by then I hurt my back.</span> <span id="s1912">I was in a cast...in a cast from top to bottom.</span> <span id="s1913">And uh Passover, he invited me for Passover meal.</span> <span id="s1914">In that time, I lived in Newark, New Jersey and he lived in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1915">And he invited this girl to come to dinner.</span> <span id="s1916">And to make a long story short, this is the girl I married.</span> <span id="s1917">The girl he said I'm not gonna ever marry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">And after this we had three children.</span> <span id="s1919">The first name was Debbie, my daughter Debbie--who plays mommy now in New Jersey; my son, David--who is going to become a daddy in December--lives here in Alexandria; and my youngest one, Donna.</span> <span id="s1920">She's going with a nice fellow.</span> <span id="s1921">I've never met him, by the way.</span> <span id="s1922">I'm going to meet him next week.</span> <span id="s1923">A fellow from Israel; and I think she's in love with him.</span> <span id="s1924">Which is lovely.</span> <span id="s1925">So actually, we have something to look forward to.</span> <span id="s1926">And we have two fabulous grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1927">Fabulous.</span> <span id="s1928">Our granddaughter is Stacy.</span> <span id="s1929">As matter of fact, she is going to camp this Sunday.</span> <span id="s1930">And Michael.</span> <span id="s1931">So life is fairly good.</span> <span id="s1932">Not only fairly good; life is pretty good.</span> <span id="s1933">Something to live forward, but to live for.</span> <span id="s1934">That's it!</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Wonderful.</span> <span id="s1936">I'm glad you told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1938">.</span> <span id="s1939">So nobody's left out.</span> <span id="s1940">OK.</span> <span id="s1941">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1942">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p></body></html>
