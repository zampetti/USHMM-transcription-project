1995.</span> <span id="s4">I’m Nina Ellis, speaking with Louise Birch, in West Park, New York.</span> <span id="s5">Tell me please, when and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Answer: June 21st, 1921, Cleveland, Ohio.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s8">And tell me something about your family and your background.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Mother and father, father was a newspaper reporter in Cleveland, transferred to New York City and became sports editor of the New York World Telegram.</span> <span id="s10">I have a brother.</span> <span id="s11">My mother and father divorced and saw very little of him.</span> <span id="s12">And -- but my mother, I think was loyal to him all the time.</span> <span id="s13">The one thing that I remember about him, when I wanted to become a nurse, he said to my mother, “There’s not going to be any damn maids in our family.”</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: That’s what he thought of nursing?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s16">Well, in those days -- you’re thinking -- talking 1939 -- is when I graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s17">So my mother said I could go to college and become a teacher.</span> <span id="s18">Well, I didn’t want to become a teacher, I wanted to become a nurse.</span> <span id="s19">So I stayed home for a whole year and did absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s20">And she finally said to me, “Go, go,” you know.</span> <span id="s21">“I’ll pay for it,” because in those days you had to pay for a nursing education.</span> <span id="s22">And it was Dad’s responsibility.</span> <span id="s23">So, anyhow, make a long story short, I became a nurse and he never congratulated me or anything, until I got in the service.</span> <span id="s24">And he wrote me a letter that he wanted to come down and do an article on the nurses, the army nurses.</span> <span id="s25">And by the time I got the letter, we were all -- already overseas, living in tents.</span> <span id="s26">In fact it was [indecipherable] who helped me compose a letter back to my father saying, “You wouldn’t want to do a story on us.</span> <span id="s27">We don't look like nurses, we don’t act like nurses.</span> <span id="s28">We’re,” you know, “we’re living in tents and,” you know, “walking in mud and not the sterile atmosphere that you think, the white, crisp nurses.”</span> <span id="s29">So he dropped the subject.</span> <span id="s30">He never said boo to me a -- the rest of my life -- or his life.</span> <span id="s31">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Where did you get the idea that you wanted to be a nurse and why was it such a strong motivation?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well, actually, it goes back to -- I was five and a half years old, had a real bad operation and I al-almost died, evidently.</span> <span id="s34">It was rare in that time -- and I won’t go into it, because, well -- but anyhow, two holes in my belly here.</span> <span id="s35">And I can alway -- and I had specials around the clock and I can always remember, you know, begging my -- my nurses to, “Oh, I’d give you a drink if you were thirsty,” you know, and -- cause I couldn’t have any water, anything to drink and stuff.</span> <span id="s36">And that must have been what was instilled in me.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: You remembered that?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Cause I had no idea what nursing was like when I went into training.</span> <span id="s39">In fact, my mother, when she finally said go, she said, “I give you a couple of months and you’ll be back.”</span> <span id="s40">And I said, “No, I won’t, I’ll stick it out.”</span> <span id="s41">And I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Well, where did you get the idea that you wanted to go in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, that -- that’s almost another s -- chapter in my life.</span> <span id="s44">I had my boyfriend through high school was -- had gone in the service before he was drafted, so -- and he and -- volunteered for the airborne.</span> <span id="s45">He was in the 82nd Airborne Division.</span> <span id="s46">And in training we weren’t allowed to be married.</span> <span id="s47">And we had been really romantic and he knew he was going overseas and so he got leave and I sneaked out and we got married.</span> <span id="s48">Well, his -- his family knew about it and my family knew about it.</span> <span id="s49">It was a real simple ceremony and we just had a weekend pass.</span> <span id="s50">And that was the last I saw of him.</span> <span id="s51">He went o -- he was in the invasion of Sicily and he was mi -- th-that’s a thorn in my side, he was considered an MIA for a year.</span> <span id="s52">Then he -- they you’re dead.</span> <span id="s53">Not like the MIA’s today that they’re still -- you know, I know that they have to look for these people, but they didn’t look for the boys in the World War Two.</span> <span id="s54">And there were many of them that they never found.</span> <span id="s55">And unless there’s blue eyed blondes running around Sicily, then I don’t know where he is.</span> <span id="s56">And -- so I went trying to find some trace of him.</span> <span id="s57">I’d written to his chaplain and I’d written to a lieutenant that used to censor our letters and never got any response.</span> <span id="s58">Went to the Red Cross, never got any response.</span> <span id="s59">So, I finally found -- when I was in the service, and I was stationed down Atlantic City in what they called England General Hospital -- it was one of the big hotels in Atlantic City at the time, they made a hospital.</span> <span id="s60">And I found a -- a fellow that was in his company.</span> <span id="s61">And so he invited me over to his apartment with his wife and we got talking and he knew that my -- my Hughie had jumped, and he -- cause I wondered, you know, did he even make it over there?</span> <span id="s62">And he said, “Yeah,” he said, “but that was a” -- I guess that whole operation was a faux pas, you know.</span> <span id="s63">They went off of target and whatever.</span> <span id="s64">So anyhow, at least I knew that he did his duty, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Hugh Sheridan.</span> <span id="s67">And that’s why they call me Sherry.</span> <span id="s68">My maiden name was Williams.</span> <span id="s69">So at least I found that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: When did you find that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Well, actually it was a year that they -- well no, it wasn’t a year, because they had listed him as missing in action and his pap -- picture was in the paper and a l -- his -- his family had given this little blurb that -- you know, he’d just gotten married, etcetera.</span> <span id="s72">And I knew my directress of nurses would see this paper, cause it was a local paper.</span> <span id="s73">By this time I’m out of school, but I felt so bad, cause I had lied to her, you know, to get this little pass that I had.</span> <span id="s74">So I went back to her and, you know, in a teary eyed, nice, you know, “Miss Copeland, I want to talk to you and --” so I started to say something, she said, “I know.”</span> <span id="s75">She said, “I know you got married.”</span> <span id="s76">And I looked at her and -- but she didn’t know, you know, that he had been missing.</span> <span id="s77">So she was sorry about that.</span> <span id="s78">But it was okay and I guess she probably felt good that I came back to confess my crime or so.</span> <span id="s79">But -- you see, we were Catholic and -- and the banns had to be announced in the church and they were announced in his church, where -- where she went.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Oh, so she knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: And she picked up the n -- the names and she must have even known who was writing to me, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s82">Cause they knew everything.</span> <span id="s83">So that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: So he was lost in --</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Sicily.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: June ‘44?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Actually, July.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: July.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: July ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: And I got out of school.</span> <span id="s92">I finished school probably September ‘43.</span> <span id="s93">And by the time you took state boards and, you know, to get your RN, cause you couldn’t join the service until you got your state boards and had physical, papers, it was ‘44.</span> <span id="s94">It was early ‘44 that I went in the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: And was stationed down Atlantic City for awhile.</span> <span id="s97">And then got my orders to go to Camp Polk where the 131st was being started.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s99">The full name of your unit was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: 131st evacuation hospital, semi-mobile.</span> <span id="s101">In other words, you could pick up half of that hospital and move it on, while the other half was still operating, although we never did that, but it was equipped to do that.</span> <span id="s102">You could even take down half of the operating room, which was a huge, big tent.</span> <span id="s103">Look -- it was several tents put together.</span> <span id="s104">Looked like a big circus tent, almost.</span> <span id="s105">And you could take down half of that and move it on and move half of the wards on.</span> <span id="s106">And we had two teams, you know, nurses and doctors and stuff.</span> <span id="s107">But we never did that.</span> <span id="s108">We -- we all -- when we set up -- set up as a whole and moved the whole unit as a whole, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: So it -- it’s -- it was like what -- what we might know today as a -- a MASH unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: A mobile hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yeah, mo-mobile army surgical hospital.</span> <span id="s113">And I imagine today that that’s what they call it.</span> <span id="s114">I don’t think they call it evacuation hospitals any more.</span> <span id="s115">The patients that we had stayed maybe -- maybe two nights at the most and then they were either taken by ambulance or air evac-ed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: So this was 1944 they were forming this unit at Fort --</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Polk.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Where was that, what state?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: No, I’m wrong.</span> <span id="s120">Fort Jackson.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Fort Jackson.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Fort Jackson, South Carolina.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s124">1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s126">Fort Polk is where we got just -- and broke up, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: And you stayed in South Carolina until when, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Well, it -- we headed up north in December, early December and by this time we knew that we were heading someplace.</span> <span id="s129">We had gotten a leave to go home and it was a short leave, probably 10 days and then we would up at -- and I don’t remember whether it was Camp Kilmer, someplace in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s130">And we did a lot of training, as far as marching with packs on our backs and --</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: What el -- what other kind of training?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Well, well I think we did that down in Fort Jackson, we dug fli -- trenches.</span> <span id="s133">We put up tents and we hiked and I was -- I think I told you about the gas chamber that we went through.</span> <span id="s134">And then we --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Tell me about that again, on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Well, it was this -- almost about the -- the length of a barrack, maybe shorter, but there was nothing in it but tear gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Underground, or it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No, no up -- up above.</span> <span id="s139">It was all sealed, full of tear gas and there was a sergeant or some GI sitting at the end with a pad of paper and a pencil and a desk and you went into the far end and walked through this whole chamber of gas, with a gas mask on.</span> <span id="s140">You always had to have your gas mask on and you had to put it on properly, too.</span> <span id="s141">Cause if it wasn’t properly fit then you got the gas.</span> <span id="s142">When you reached this officer -- enlisted man, whatever he was, took off your gas mask and told him your name, rank and your serial number.</span> <span id="s143">And if you got nervous and flubbed -- cause he must have had it right down there what your s-serial number was, if you missed a number, he’d say, “Repeat that.”</span> <span id="s144">You know, and -- but it was one way to teach us all our serial number, because that was very important.</span> <span id="s145">And then you -- you got out into the fresh air and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Oh, where he was sitting -- he had a gas mask on?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Oh, he had it on too.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Oh, was a gas --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Oh yeah, he wa -- he was sitting in there with his mask on, but you would take yours off.</span> <span id="s150">And he was just delighting in every, you know, especially with a bunch of females you know and we were all screaming.</span> <span id="s151">And -- I imagine -- I know the men had to go through this too, probably even harder.</span> <span id="s152">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: And -- and you had to dig trenches and --</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: We -- we dug a slit tr -- well, what they call a slit trench, which would just hold a -- a body, you know, in case you got bombed, you could jump into it.</span> <span id="s155">And we put our pup tents up.</span> <span id="s156">And those were small tents, they were like two men tents.</span> <span id="s157">And as I remember, each one of us carried a half a tent at all times.</span> <span id="s158">So if you were ever caught someplace with no shelter, you could double up and -- and -- and put some s -- kind of a shelter up.</span> <span id="s159">All those things I think are in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, cause when we came back, stuff was going over the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s162">Well, you didn’t want to -- hey, you didn’t want to carry this home.</span> <span id="s163">Hopefully you wouldn’t need it again, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Did they teach you how to use a weapon?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Never?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No, never --</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Never had to use it?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s170">We were given all sorts of films on disease, body lice, sanitary conditions, and I don’t even think there was a film for us on weapons.</span> <span id="s171">And there were no weapons in our hospital, although I do have a picture of our dental assistant and he’s got a bandoleer of, you know, shells on him.</span> <span id="s172">I don’t know where he got it.</span> <span id="s173">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: And did they -- did you have special training in how to treat combat wounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Well, that was -- in the army you do everything, as they say, by the AR’s -- Army regulations.</span> <span id="s176">There was only one way to dress a wound and you did it that way.</span> <span id="s177">You might not like to do it that way, but the army wanted you to do it that way, so yes, we had -- had all these army regulations on how to treat this and that.</span> <span id="s178">And going over on the ship, I was assigned to -- to be an orthopedic surgical nurse.</span> <span id="s179">And I met the orthopedic surgeon and he gave me a whole list of what we would do for all these orthopedic -- amputations or whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s180">And you read them and okay, we’ll do what we have to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Were they substantially different from the way you had learned in nursing school?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: No, no, but -- no, not really, you know, the -- you -- you still had a surgical technique that you had to follow.</span> <span id="s183">But they had a particular way of doing things and the army is a stickler for that.</span> <span id="s184">Y-Y -- In the hospital you might have several different sizes of bandages, you know.</span> <span id="s185">In the army, you have one or two sizes.</span> <span id="s186">I do -- it may be different now, but i-in wartime it wasn’t anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: While we were in England, I saw returning casualties from the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s189">For bandages they used the latest issue of “Stars and Stripes”, which was the magazine.</span> <span id="s190">They had no bandages.</span> <span id="s191">And we’d get them in the operating room and we’d have to wet down this leg that was -- had all this paper -- newspaper stuck to it.</span> <span id="s192">Cause that’s the only thing they had.</span> <span id="s193">Cause that was a different situation.</span> <span id="s194">So you can’t say that they went by army regulations.</span> <span id="s195">You do what you have to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s197">Mm.</span> <span id="s198">Let’s pick up our chronology.</span> <span id="s199">You had to leave in December, you went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: We went home for a short leave and I can remember my mother gave me a Hagen Hague bottle of Scotch, pinch bottle and I hate Scotch.</span> <span id="s201">And so we got back to base --</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Why did she give you Scotch?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s204">She -- it wa -- evidently this was a very -- and is -- I don’t know, cause I’m not a Scotch -- it’s a very good brand of Scotch.</span> <span id="s205">And she said, “Take this back, you know, they might want to have a little party or something.”</span> <span id="s206">And when we got back to camp, the door came down and you could not make a phone call, you could not write a letter, you could not have any visitors.</span> <span id="s207">It was -- and I’m trying to think of the name they used.</span> <span id="s208">I want to say black out, but it wasn’t -- was the censo-censorship.</span> <span id="s209">So my mother never heard from me and she’s saying, “Oh, Louise got caught with that bottle of -- in her --” She said they put her on -- you know, put her in the brig or something, cause I got -- and I went in -- I can remember going in to the little commissary there and they had a fl -- a florist in there that you -- they could wire flowers out.</span> <span id="s210">I’ll fix -- I’ll get in touch with my mother.</span> <span id="s211">So I wired her a dozen red roses.</span> <span id="s212">Course she got them a month later, but I thought they would go right out, you know.</span> <span id="s213">But they were smart, you know, and just all I put on is, “I love you”, you know.</span> <span id="s214">And -- it didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And you -- and you shipped out</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: And we shipped out, yeah.</span> <span id="s217">We were -- we were like that for maybe three or four days I think, that you couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s218">And -- and the other girls must have told you the story about crossing the Hudson at night and this fog rising up and that’s a vision I’ll never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: I can’t remember exactly whether -- I know we had gone by train to this barge.</span> <span id="s221">Now it seemed to me the train was on the barge, but I could be wrong.</span> <span id="s222">But I remember crossing, it was dark, night and crossing the river and this fog coming up.</span> <span id="s223">And there was this big gray thing in front of us.</span> <span id="s224">It was huge, huge, several stories high.</span> <span id="s225">And you’re looking up at it and you could just make out, Queen E-l-i and then you don’t know what was in around -- and of course it was all painted gray.</span> <span id="s226">The Queen Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s227">And we were, “My God,” you know.</span> <span id="s228">And I -- I get goose pimples right now.</span> <span id="s229">This is it.</span> <span id="s230">And we all had steel helmets on and they chalked mark -- you’re all numbered.</span> <span id="s231">And we lined up and they had the -- the roster and you know, one, two, three, four.</span> <span id="s232">And then you got to the gangplank and they checked the one, two, three, four and you got up on top of the gangplank and one, two, three, four and they showed you which way to go.</span> <span id="s233">They had our quarters all -- the women were, of course all segregated, cause there were thousands -- thousands on that ship.</span> <span id="s234">All the doors on the stateroom were removed, there were no doors on the stateroom.</span> <span id="s235">They had guards either into the hall, so nobody could go -- nobody else could go and we only could eat twice a day, because there were so many on there to feed that I guess the ki-kitchen was going constantly.</span> <span id="s236">You -- you got your -- your seating thing, which was like 10 o’clock in the morning and maybe nine o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s237">That’s when you ate.</span> <span id="s238">Two meals.</span> <span id="s239">Cause they couldn’t feed everybody three meals.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Were you able to mingle with the men at all?</span> <span id="s241">Did you talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Oh we -- yeah, we -- well just -- just the officers.</span> <span id="s243">Course it was very segregated.</span> <span id="s244">The huge, huge, big lounge.</span> <span id="s245">You couldn’t find a place to sit, everyone was sitting on the floor.</span> <span id="s246">The few that got a chair were lucky you know, and they weren’t about to give it up.</span> <span id="s247">And the officers all mingled -- there were many air corps fellows going back to England.</span> <span id="s248">There were many other units.</span> <span id="s249">I found out after the war that one of my friends, who I knew as a little kid, was on that same ship.</span> <span id="s250">And he was in -- in fact, he was in the 120th evac hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Watch your microphone there.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: That liberated Buchenwald and I tried to tell -- tried to get him to talk to me, no.</span> <span id="s253">He’s busy right now, his wife had got cancer.</span> <span id="s254">But anyhow, yes and -- and while we were there, some of the nurses from another unit put on a little skit.</span> <span id="s255">That’s why I know it was the same boat that this friend of mine went on, because he was talking about the [indecipherable], I can still see the girls up there singing, “Don’t Fence Me In.”</span> <span id="s256">And they had big wings, suppose -- supposed to be Air Corps wings on it, you know.</span> <span id="s257">And of course the Air Corps guys went ape over that.</span> <span id="s258">And so we had a good time and --</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: So there was another unit of nurses?</span> <span id="s260">Yours wasn’t the only one?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Oh, this was in Buchenwald they went to .</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: A -- a unit replaced us when we left.</span> <span id="s264">The 58th field hospital replaced us.</span> <span id="s265">And I have no idea, you know, what happened then.</span> <span id="s266">That’s why I was disappointed -- well, maybe Mike would know, when he comes back with Bonnie because I’m sure his outfit stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: So you got to England right after Christmas?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Just before Christmas.</span> <span id="s269">Just before Christmas and we knew we were going to be away for Christmas, so all the nurses went into the PX and we all bought three gifts.</span> <span id="s270">Handkerchiefs or aftershave or a razor or something and wrapped it up for the enlisted men.</span> <span id="s271">And we had that -- I think we bought an ornament, too.</span> <span id="s272">It seems to me we -- but we carried those.</span> <span id="s273">So when we got to England and course holly grows wild over there, so we had a ball cutting it off and trying to make our quarters a little bit more cheerful.</span> <span id="s274">And Christmas night we took all these -- grab gifts you’d call them, but we thought it was something -- up to the enlisted men’s quarters and we all -- we’re great singing group, not that I have a voice.</span> <span id="s275">I’m losing what I have.</span> <span id="s276">But we sang all the time and I am sure the men got so sick of hearing us sing.</span> <span id="s277">And Ecky was one of the ringleaders, cause she ca -- has a voice.</span> <span id="s278">You know, all kinds of songs.</span> <span id="s279">And we sang Christmas carols for the -- the enlisted men and gave them a little present, so that made it a little nicer.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: You all -- seems like you saw it as your responsibility to care for the men as well as the injured.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Well -- well it was -- it was hard, this segregation thing, you know.</span> <span id="s282">And -- and I -- you know, the -- the men thought of -- of the nurses as -- for the en -- for the officers only.</span> <span id="s283">We weren’t supposed to fraternize with them.</span> <span id="s284">And how can you do that with somebody you’re working with?</span> <span id="s285">I mean yo-you -- you had a little law and order, let’s say, on the wards and stuff, but you still were friendly.</span> <span id="s286">Like one night at Christmas time, we had this house that we turned into a sick bay, so anybody in the outfit, whether they were officer or enlisted men was sick and needed care and stuff, were sent there.</span> <span id="s287">So, of course the nurses had to man it and one night we’re sitting there and one of the GIs, the enlisted man who was taking care of the fires -- each hou -- in England, each house -- room, has a little fireplace and God, if you don’t keep that going, you freeze to death.</span> <span id="s288">And he’d go around -- and so we’re sitting there and we’re talking about Christmas back home and we’re sad, you know.</span> <span id="s289">And this guy says to me, “Boy,” he says, “there no -- no place like Christmas in the Adirondacks.”</span> <span id="s290">Which is, you know, right up here.</span> <span id="s291">And I grew up in the Adirondacks, summertime.</span> <span id="s292">And I said, “Whereabouts in the Adirondacks?”</span> <span id="s293">He says, “Speculator.”</span> <span id="s294">And no one has ever heard of Speculator.</span> <span id="s295">Well, that’s where I grew up.</span> <span id="s296">I -- off the bench [indecipherable] and I jumped in his lap and I’m kissing him and going on.</span> <span id="s297">And the poor kid, he’s scared to death, you know, what did I do wrong, you know, I’m going to be court-martialed.</span> <span id="s298">But I was so -- someone has heard of Spec.</span> <span id="s299">And then he said to me, “You know, I recognized you, but I didn’t recognize your name.”</span> <span id="s300">And that’s because I had my married name.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: But that was, you know, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: You all were homesick, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, we just -- especially at Christmastime.</span> <span id="s305">And this boy happened to be Jewish too, so that really didn’t mean as much to him, but the fact that he was even near any area.</span> <span id="s306">You know, when you -- when you meet a soldier, “Where you from?”</span> <span id="s307">Everyone know wa -- where you from.</span> <span id="s308">Most -- the Amer -- majority of our enlisted men were from Oklahoma.</span> <span id="s309">A bunch of Okies.</span> <span id="s310">A few, like Mark, happened to be from New York, and we had a few from Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s311">Us girls -- most of us girls were from New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</span> <span id="s312">Our officers -- our doctors were mostly from Ohio, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s313">And you know, so there were little areas.</span> <span id="s314">So you were always looking for someone who knew your hometown so you would have something to talk about and would remind you of home.</span> <span id="s315">And I -- and -- and -- you know, the -- especially the -- the fighting soldiers, you know they were so glad to see somebody.</span> <span id="s316">First -- first you know, it was an American voice that they want, oh, were so glad to see and then the American woman and then, you know, where are you from?</span> <span id="s317">Where are you from?</span> <span id="s318">And if you were even two states away, you know, you were their sister.</span> <span id="s319">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: What was it like caring for the men who had been injured coming back from -- they -- they were in the Battle of the Bulge, some of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: At that point, see, it was right at Christma -- I was in the operating room, so I really didn’t care for them.</span> <span id="s322">I saw them and saw their wounds and that’s all I -- because they were in and out and -- and we had two tables going at the same time, in one room.</span> <span id="s323">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: These were people who were pretty badly injured?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Well yeah, they had all sorts of inj -- in -- in the room I was in, it was an orthopedic room, so it was either real brad -- bad fractures, some amputations, something like that.</span> <span id="s326">But there were other rooms that had chest wounds and you know, abdominal.</span> <span id="s327">So they were, in a way, worse off, because it’s a little easier to fix a bone than it is to fix a -- a shatter --</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Soft tissue, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: You know, lung and stuff.</span> <span id="s330">So I really -- in fact I had to relieve one day in the -- in the chest surgery room and I oh, get me out of here.</span> <span id="s331">You know, I was scared.</span> <span id="s332">I gi -- bega -- I never saw so much blood in my life and -- you know, and they work so fast, whereas orthopedic is, you know, you aw-aw.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: It’s slower?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yeah, it’s slower, because you know, most of the bleeding had already been under control because it hadn’t -- didn’t -- didn’t just happen.</span> <span id="s335">But, you know, they were repairing what they could and even -- even that they would probably have to have more surgery when they got back to the States, cause there were nerve damages done, which the -- I don’t think they would attempt to do there.</span> <span id="s336">But -- it’s an awful thing to say, but it was good to take care of our -- our soldiers.</span> <span id="s337">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: What do you mean by that?</span> <span id="s339">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Well, that’s what we were there for.</span> <span id="s341">And -- and when I was stationed in Atlantic City, these soldiers were -- were all injured ones, but they were up and about on crutches and in wheelchairs and you know, slings and whatnot.</span> <span id="s342">So they were sick, yes, but they weren’t sick that way.</span> <span id="s343">Had a couple of real bad head injuries that upset me because they couldn’t talk and -- but they weren’t fresh wounds and -- and in England was the first time I saw a fresh wound.</span> <span id="s344">And then in France we sat up -- set up the hospital in Fran-France, but we didn’t have any patients.</span> <span id="s345">It was like a dry run, cause that’s the first time we had set up the tents.</span> <span id="s346">We had to make sure all of our equipment worked.</span> <span id="s347">Trying out generators and dis -- water distillers and autoclaves and -- and our -- all of our instruments were shipped over covered with some sort of a grease or Vaseline or something.</span> <span id="s348">We had to clean all that off -- it was to protect it, you know, from the salt water, I guess, whatever.</span> <span id="s349">And we cleaned the instruments and even made little -- some of the girls made soap -- hand soap, little -- little compartments for some of the more delicate instruments, the -- you know, to protect them.</span> <span id="s350">And then we went on to Germany, that was the first time we had -- had fresh patients.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: In April?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: April, yeah.</span> <span id="s353">April, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: April 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: ‘45, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: And these were coming off the battlefield?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s358">Or one -- our -- our very first load of patients was a -- a truck accident, the truck had tipped over and a whole bunch were injured in that.</span> <span id="s359">In fact, we even had some German POWs that had gotten injured and we treated those.</span> <span id="s360">But then there were -- the war was starting to wane down, so the one -- that furious amount of accidents where a lot of mine -- you know, people walking into personnel mines and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s361">I remember -- and I can’t remember wh-what happened to wa -- one night in the operating room, was this kid with this head wound and we had just set up the distilled water and it was -- the doctor yelled at me to get a pitcher of water and pour it out -- you know, to debride it, to get the dirt out.</span> <span id="s362">And I said, “No, the water’s too hot.”</span> <span id="s363">And he says, “Pour it.”</span> <span id="s364">I said, “It’s too hot.”</span> <span id="s365">He says, “Pour it, God damn it, pour it.”</span> <span id="s366">And when I did I could see the kids toes jumping and oh, I -- I felt terrible.</span> <span id="s367">And he came later and --</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: His toes moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s370">Because the -- of the nerve reflex</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Nerve --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: -- you know.</span> <span id="s373">And I felt terrible, I felt so bad.</span> <span id="s374">And he came to me later and apologized, he says, “I shouldn’t have yelled at you.”</span> <span id="s375">And I said, “Well, I shouldn’t have questioned you.”</span> <span id="s376">And he said, “He couldn’t have felt that.”</span> <span id="s377">He said, “The damage that was in his brain,” he said, “but I had to” -- you know.</span> <span id="s378">So that was one incident I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: What -- was it a generally tense situation?</span> <span id="s380">I mean I don’t know about what the normal state of an operating room is, but how is it different in that -- in a -- in a -- in a -- you know, behind the lines?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Yeah, well I think any operating room situation, even if you watch MASH, is tense while they’re doing the operation.</span> <span id="s382">Once it’s over, and it’s -- I know on civilian -- cause I worked in civilian hospitals in the operating room -- once it’s over, the laughter starts and they ask how your golf game is or they’ll start, hey did you hear this joke, you know.</span> <span id="s383">It’s very blasé.</span> <span id="s384">And I think there, too.</span> <span id="s385">Although they did things a lot faster.</span> <span id="s386">They had to move, keep moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Because there was always another --</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: There’s another one waiting, yeah.</span> <span id="s389">We always had what we call a pre-op tent that came out this way and then the big operating room tent was this way and the pre-ops were in there on the stretchers and --</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: -- waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: So it was a constant emergency surgery?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yeah -- next, yeah -- next.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Constant.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Some of it wasn’t considered emergency, but it had -- it wasn’t life or death -- some of them weren’t life or death, but they still needed attention and you took the first ones first, that’s triage.</span> <span id="s398">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Who would do those assessments, the triage assessments, a doctor in that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Ah, well yeah, and -- and -- and the nurse -- like Woody, she was head of the OR that I worked in.</span> <span id="s401">I don’t know, cause I was in the operating room.</span> <span id="s402">Actually, I don’t remember those in the -- I know we had a sergeant who was in charge of the ward itself and he was an older man, so whether he was -- you know, some -- the corpsman, God bless them, was a lot better than some of the nurses.</span> <span id="s403">They were great, really great.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: How many -- on a typical day, how many surgeries would you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Oh, that would be hard to tell because we moved so much.</span> <span id="s406">We moved an awful lot.</span> <span id="s407">He just couldn’t keep up with -- the third army was moving through.</span> <span id="s408">And we weren’t that busy.</span> <span id="s409">I can -- wards were never full, whether they shipped them back out faster -- like I said, the war was waning down and they could get them moved out further -- they wanted to get them to general hospitals as soon as they could.</span> <span id="s410">And then back home.</span> <span id="s411">So they -- we were never out straight, I wouldn’t say.</span> <span id="s412">In England yes.</span> <span id="s413">England was different.</span> <span id="s414">England was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: What do you mean by out straight?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Working around the clock --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s419">One right after the other and at night time, you might be called out at night.</span> <span id="s420">But, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: That would happen?</span> <span id="s422">At night --</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s424">Oh, yeah, yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: -- you were on call, virtually every day, all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s427">Yeah, there was always this two team units or one -- somebody was always there to work the hospital, if some of us got to go to a -- a so-called party, you know, as long as there was enough left to cover the hospital, that was okay.</span> <span id="s428">You know, you could get leave to go.</span> <span id="s429">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: So half of you were always on and half of you were always off?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Oh, actually -- yes, I suppose you’d call it that.</span> <span id="s432">I was going to say we were always all on unless there was something doing, which wasn’t that often.</span> <span id="s433">It sounds like we were just one big party, but it certainly wasn’t.</span> <span id="s434">And -- and we made -- made our own parties a lot of times.</span> <span id="s435">Just for something to do, something different.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: I think that’s probably why we got along so well together, because you could always think of something else to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Well, if you had to, you know, you -- y-you sit in the tent and you might write letters or read books and somebody would come in and make a lot of noise and you’d say, “Oh well, quiet down.”</span> <span id="s440">And, you know, they realize, “Well, maybe I should go out for a walk,” and then you’d go out for a walk.</span> <span id="s441">And you couldn’t walk far, cause you weren’t allowed to go too far.</span> <span id="s442">So, I don’t know, it’s -- it’s funny, thinking back of -- we didn’t take it lightly, but we didn’t let it get underneath, you know, let us get down.</span> <span id="s443">We -- we had a job to do, we were there to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Let me check this.</span> <span id="s445">While you were in Germany, in April, was your general attitude -- what was your general attitude?</span> <span id="s446">Were you feeling, “I’m glad to be here.</span> <span id="s447">I feel good doing this.”</span> <span id="s448">Or was it, “This is terrible, I want to go home.”</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Well, I always wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s450">I know that when I was in Germany, I hated the Germans with a passion.</span> <span id="s451">Just hated them with a passion.</span> <span id="s452">And I -- I couldn’t even be civil to them when I would look at them.</span> <span id="s453">I’ve changed since, believe me.</span> <span id="s454">Cause I’ve been back and found the [indecipherable] people.</span> <span id="s455">But it was -- we were almost like cattle being led.</span> <span id="s456">You’re -- you’re in the service, you’re told when to get up and go to bed and when to eat and you didn’t question what you were eating, you ate it.</span> <span id="s457">You went to work and you did your job.</span> <span id="s458">And why am I here?</span> <span id="s459">Because I joined.</span> <span id="s460">I wasn’t drafted, I joined.</span> <span id="s461">This is what I want to do.</span> <span id="s462">I never thought of coming home as a -- it seemed to me that everybody in that era joined the service.</span> <span id="s463">So, it was the thing to do.</span> <span id="s464">You had to do it for your country.</span> <span id="s465">And we weren’t doing it maybe we weren’t doing it for the country per se, we were doing it for our men, our fellow men.</span> <span id="s466">Fellow Americans.</span> <span id="s467">And that’s what we wanted to do, that’s why we were all there, to help them over, cause they’re the ones that did the dirty work.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: And we’d tried to make it a little nicer, a little softer or healthier.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Did you think about your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s472">Yes, I did, yeah.</span> <span id="s473">Wondered, you know?</span> <span id="s474">He used to have a -- on his dogtags he had a little vial with my hair in it and he had said to me the last I saw him, he said, “Don’t ever believe I’m dead unless you get this back.”</span> <span id="s475">And course, I’ve never gotten it back.</span> <span id="s476">But there were -- I’ve heard so many stories since, how -- must have been an awful job for these -- I don’t know what they call them, they had a name -- that buried the dead.</span> <span id="s477">And this especially, in the Battle of Normandy, I heard this from one of the GIs, the -- the -- the -- the invasion of Normandy was so horrendous, that they had a truck of left arms and a truck of right arms and a truck of left legs and when they went to bury a body, if it was missing a left leg, they went to that truck.</span> <span id="s478">So, you wonder.</span> <span id="s479">And even when I was in high school, my chemistry teacher in high school was a doctor, a female doctor and she was a doctor in World War One.</span> <span id="s480">And she had all these slides to show us.</span> <span id="s481">They were slides of heart tissue and lung tissue and all sorts of tissues that she had taken out of World War One dead soldiers.</span> <span id="s482">And she told us then -- and here we are, that’s way back in the young -- late -- early 30’s, that they stuffed them with straw and sent them home to be buried.</span> <span id="s483">So you wonder, you know, what came home.</span> <span id="s484">Maybe he’s better over there, not knowing, you know.</span> <span id="s485">Blown to bits or something, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s486">But that stuck and I -- I -- I can always remem -- I can remember we had these seats in -- in hi -- in -- in -- in our chemistry lab that were two to a desk, and I w -- I -- listening like this and all of a sudden I hear bump and the girl next to me fainted right out on -- of her seat.</span> <span id="s487">But I don’t know if they could do that now.</span> <span id="s488">Maybe they do, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s490">So you were caring for e -- wounded soldiers and grieving at the same time, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I couldn’t have been grieving.</span> <span id="s492">As -- now this is a -- a year later, for one thing.</span> <span id="s493">I was busy doing my work.</span> <span id="s494">I thought of him, I car -- I still have the same picture I carried with him -- with his wings, and the last letter I wrote him, or he wrote me, excuse me, which was a V-mail letter, but they never photographed it.</span> <span id="s495">And I am curious to know why it was never photographed, because they came all photographed, I don’t know if you’re familiar with the -- well, V -- V mail, you would write on this certain paper, you could only have one sheet and they would photograph and put them into microfilm.</span> <span id="s496">And then they sent that microfilm.</span> <span id="s497">They’d get thousands and thousands of letters on this little spool of microfilm.</span> <span id="s498">And that saved hundreds of cubic feet in a cargo ship, sending all these letters back and forth.</span> <span id="s499">This letter, dated July, it looks like seven, but he made it an eight and he was missing on the 10th.</span> <span id="s500">And it says, “I’m going to be busy for awhi -- this’ll probably be the last letter you get from me, cause I’m going to by busy, but you’ll hear about it soon enough.”</span> <span id="s501">And that -- why would they sent that handwritten, you know, piece, the original piece.</span> <span id="s502">So I still have that and his picture, which I carried all overseas with me and kept even when I remarried and my husband knew it was in my drawer and it stayed there and it’s still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s504">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s505">Let me turn the tape over, while we have a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: This is the end of side one with Louise Birch.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: This is side two with Louise Birch.</span> <span id="s510">July 15th, 1995, in West Park, New York.</span> <span id="s511">W-We stopped before, we were talking about being in Germany in April, 1945.</span> <span id="s512">You must have gotten word there about the death of President Roosevelt?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Do you remember anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Well, being a staunch Republican, I said, “That’s too bad.”</span> <span id="s516">Which is terrible.</span> <span id="s517">But everyone was stunned and you know, what’s going to happen now?</span> <span id="s518">That, I think was the first concern about everybody, what’s going to happen now.</span> <span id="s519">Because he certainly, you know, did give us good leadership.</span> <span id="s520">But then we heard about this guy named Truman and went on with our work.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: And shortly thereafter?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: It was VE Day.</span> <span id="s523">And I think I told you about stealing the denatured alcohol out of the operating room and --</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: No, you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Oh, didn’t I?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: No, you -- I think you need to.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: We had what we call solution basins, they were little porcelain basins that we’d soak instruments in in alcohol and stuff and we swiped -- we had this denatured alcohol -- would kill you, you know, kill you.</span> <span id="s528">Put that in and we had powdered grape juice, it’d turn it all purple.</span> <span id="s529">Whoosh, whoosh it around, whoosh it around.</span> <span id="s530">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s533">And -- and -- our whole, Ecky was the only one that was sober that night and she had these what we call number 10 cans.</span> <span id="s534">You know, peanut butter and jelly came in them.</span> <span id="s535">She had one by each one of our bunks.</span> <span id="s536">Cause we would just roll out of bed and go naa, you know -- couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s537">It’s a wonder we didn’t die.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: So you had a big party.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Well, not really, you know.</span> <span id="s540">We just -- just among ourselves, saying oh, you know, whoopee do.</span> <span id="s541">Cause at that time we were right next to the 34th evacuation hospital.</span> <span id="s542">They had brought us in and we were supposed to help them out or you know, relieve them of some of their duties.</span> <span id="s543">They didn’t like us and we didn’t like them.</span> <span id="s544">And I think it was just a -- an ego trip, you know?</span> <span id="s545">Maybe the nurses were afraid that we’d infringe on their officers or whatever, but we could care less, you know.</span> <span id="s546">We -- we were our own li -- we were very cliquey as you can notice and we were our own little establishment and so we did what we had to do and they did what they had to do, until our men up and left us.</span> <span id="s547">And then we had to stay with the 34th, because they --</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Well, what happened there?</span> <span id="s549">Your --</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Well, that was right after VE Day, maybe two days after, three days after, I’m not sure on what date.</span> <span id="s551">We were used to hearing our tents being pulled down, cause the hospital was always moving.</span> <span id="s552">And one morning, there’s the tents coming down.</span> <span id="s553">And they came and told us we had to move out of our tents, but we weren’t going with them.</span> <span id="s554">And they had one big tent.</span> <span id="s555">So all of us 40 nurses were in this one big tent.</span> <span id="s556">We had to stay behind and we j -- we just felt so abandoned, because we’d been a family for so long.</span> <span id="s557">How could you do this, you know?</span> <span id="s558">“We’re going on to Austria and you’re staying here with the 34th.”</span> <span id="s559">And oh, there were tears, because we had some romances going on and you know, “We don’t know.</span> <span id="s560">We don’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s561">You stay here, they’ll feed you, you work with them and that’s it.”</span> <span id="s562">And some of the girls were angry and some were sad and some were indignant because, “How could they do this to us, you know, we’re part of this unit and they’re leaving us.”</span> <span id="s563">But off they went.</span> <span id="s564">And we didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s565">And so we made hay, you know, we played around and make -- did what we had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: You worked with the other unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: We worked with the other unit.</span> <span id="s568">Not too much.</span> <span id="s569">They -- they were -- they were getting rid of -- their patients were being pushed out back to the general hospitals too.</span> <span id="s570">And I can’t remember, except for just horsing around, like we found that old cart and we used to run around the place pulling this cart and --</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Horse cart?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Well, it was -- I don’t know wh -- maybe it was, but it was like a pushcart, but a big pushcart.</span> <span id="s573">We’d put two of the girls in it and two would pull it, you know and it was stupid, you know, but it was silly.</span> <span id="s574">And I can remember sunbathing, we -- i-it was -- it was getting, you know, it was May then and it was -- it was getting warm and the -- the earth -- I -- I can still smell the earth.</span> <span id="s575">The earth was very sour.</span> <span id="s576">We were set up in what might have been a pasture or something and you don’t realize, America here is a new country and our earth is still new.</span> <span id="s577">But that’s centuries old over there and it stunk.</span> <span id="s578">The earth was sour like -- like it was moldy, but it had an o -- so when the sun hit it, ooo.</span> <span id="s579">But anyhow, one morning, down the dirt road comes our trucks, trumbling around and yea, tooting the horn, you know.</span> <span id="s580">“Pack your bags, girls, we’re going.”</span> <span id="s581">And you didn’t see a happier bunch, you know.</span> <span id="s582">And in the trucks we went.</span> <span id="s583">One truck’s for our bedrolls and two trucks for the nurses.</span> <span id="s584">And off we went, singing all the way.</span> <span id="s585">And the tarp was down off of the trucks because it was nice weather.</span> <span id="s586">And we didn’t even ask them, just went and sang and drove through the roads and the countryside was so beautiful, the trollian houses with the flower boxes and all the flowers were starting to bloom.</span> <span id="s587">And then the -- we crossed the -- into Austria and you could see these -- these rolling Alps in the background, some still had snow on it.</span> <span id="s588">And it was just ideal.</span> <span id="s589">We were in heaven, really in heaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: The war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Yeah, the war was over and this was beautiful and serene and happy and what more could you ask for?</span> <span id="s592">And there’s the Danube and we crossed the Danube at Linz and I remember going across the bridge at Linz and the Danube and someone mentioned, “This is the city Hitler was born in.</span> <span id="s593">Linz, Austria, he was born here.”</span> <span id="s594">“So?</span> <span id="s595">He ain’t around any more, we don’t care.”</span> <span id="s596">And we drove out, just through a corner of Linz itself and off we went.</span> <span id="s597">All alongside the river we were driving.</span> <span id="s598">Just beautiful.</span> <span id="s599">Singing away, having a ball.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: How long did you travel?</span> <span id="s601">Just one day?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Oh yeah, not even a whole day.</span> <span id="s603">Wasn’t that long, I think we were not too far from the Aus-Austrian border.</span> <span id="s604">And all of a sudden the singing stopped, one by one we stopped singing.</span> <span id="s605">“Something’s wrong.</span> <span id="s606">Something’s wrong, what’s wrong?</span> <span id="s607">I don’t know, what’s wrong?</span> <span id="s608">Something’s the matter with the air.”</span> <span id="s609">We didn’t even see the place and we could smell it.</span> <span id="s610">And the truck came down around the corner and there she was.</span> <span id="s611">This big, gray, granite wall, with guardhouses every so often and barbed wire [inaudible] and we just -- first your mouth would open and then your hand went over your mouth.</span> <span id="s612">And we drove up in front of these huge gates.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Watch your microphone, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: We drove up in front of these huge gates.</span> <span id="s615">And usually the enlisted men got right out of the trucks and opened the tailgate for us, so we could get down.</span> <span id="s616">This time they didn’t.</span> <span id="s617">The gates were shut.</span> <span id="s618">And we just sat there, all with our hands over our mouth, eyes as big as saucers.</span> <span id="s619">At that time we didn’t see any bodies.</span> <span id="s620">There were a few -- I like to call them stick figures.</span> <span id="s621">You know how you draw a stick figure?</span> <span id="s622">Their hips stuck out, their legs came down and this little ball on top for a head.</span> <span id="s623">A couple of them were walking around.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Outside of the gates?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: No, inside, cause we were inside the -- the wall came around and then the -- the -- the big gate was in here on the -- on the block house.</span> <span id="s626">And some had striped uniforms on, some had just a blanket on them.</span> <span id="s627">Stark naked.</span> <span id="s628">Some had the blanket wrapped around their heads so you wouldn’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s629">They were afraid of being recognized, that’s how -- and, you know, “What?</span> <span id="s630">What is this?”</span> <span id="s631">And the other girls may have told you the same thing, our colonel came out and the first words out of his mouth were, “There are no Americans here.”</span> <span id="s632">Which would -- cause you didn’t know what you were looking at.</span> <span id="s633">There was no identification on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: You were afraid that could have been an American POW camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: You didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Yeah, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s638">You couldn’t tell.</span> <span id="s639">Just a -- so then he started his little spiel about, “You girls were not sent over here to do this work, you girls were not trained to do this work.</span> <span id="s640">You girls were not -- are not equipped to do this work.</span> <span id="s641">And I will not order any one of you in this camp.”</span> <span id="s642">He was visibly upset and I personally think that he had grandiose plans of -- for himself, being in some nice hospital, doing some great deeds.</span> <span id="s643">I don’t know, that’s my personal opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: This was your commanding officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Commanding officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Colonel Dale Friend.</span> <span id="s648">Who has -- was quite a researcher at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston.</span> <span id="s649">But -- so after he gave his spiel, the GIs let down those tailgates and we jumped out, two oh one.</span> <span id="s650">Everyone of them.</span> <span id="s651">And I think he was shocked that we all responded in that way, cause he just stood there.</span> <span id="s652">“Now wait a minute,” he says.</span> <span id="s653">“There’s going to be rules and regulations.”</span> <span id="s654">Or words to that effect.</span> <span id="s655">“You can’t be here after dark, you can’t be here by yourself.</span> <span id="s656">At all times you’re with another person, even in the wards.</span> <span id="s657">You have to be completely covered.</span> <span id="s658">I don’t want them to even know you’re f -- a female.”</span> <span id="s659">Yeah, supposed to wear a -- the turbans and masks over our face.</span> <span id="s660">Our -- our dungarees that we had.</span> <span id="s661">Little puttees around our ankles and our boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: What are those, I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Puttees are actually left over from World War One.</span> <span id="s664">They’re a canvas, like a ski sock and they -- and they buckle across, so they keep your pants into your boots, because of course, typhus was such a rage there, anything get up your pants and you’ve had it.</span> <span id="s665">So -- although we’d all been inoculated.</span> <span id="s666">So, with that, you know, they -- they took us to our -- our nurses quarters, cause we didn’t go right into the camp itself then.</span> <span id="s667">And -- which was nice, it was the first time we had a nice hou -- we had three nice house -- I think there were three, yeah.</span> <span id="s668">Three nice houses up on top of a hill, overlooking the Danube.</span> <span id="s669">Couldn’t have been better.</span> <span id="s670">And these German girls all -- you know, I do -- I do -- can I do -- can I do, you know, and they couldn’t do -- like, one of the girls was saying today, you remember you put down -- you put down your -- your panties and they’d snatch them up and go wash them.</span> <span id="s671">You put them -- take them out to put them on, they’re gone, she’s out there washing them.</span> <span id="s672">They couldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: They were from the local --</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: From Linz?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s677">They couldn’t do enough for you.</span> <span id="s678">And I -- still having this hatred in me, I -- you know, who you trying to kid, you know?</span> <span id="s679">Which side were you on, you know?</span> <span id="s680">Now, you’re tone -- turncoat?</span> <span id="s681">I -- I didn’t trust anybody that was like that.</span> <span id="s682">I -- I really couldn’t.</span> <span id="s683">I figured, last week you were doing that for the Germans.</span> <span id="s684">But anyhow, th-they were victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: And what -- had they been working for the German officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s687">I don’t -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: I wouldn’t be surprised, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: And there again, it’s survival.</span> <span id="s692">A sense of survival.</span> <span id="s693">Just like the poor inmates in the camp.</span> <span id="s694">Why did this one live and thousands other die?</span> <span id="s695">They had a survival.</span> <span id="s696">And I’m sure a lot of them must have had a guilty complex going home.</span> <span id="s697">Especially if their whole family died.</span> <span id="s698">Why did he live?</span> <span id="s699">That’s -- you know, I would -- I would have no idea what that feeling is like, but I imagine there must be a lot that -- that have that feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: So you would -- you would have your quarters and then they would come and get you and you would go down to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yeah, yeah the trucks would always take -- we couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s702">We were in -- supposed to be walking outside the areas, because you didn’t know what was out there.</span> <span id="s703">The trucks would bring us down to the camp and we would work and eat and they would take us back to quarters and we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: And the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Was Camp Gusen, which was a satellite of Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s706">Mauthausen was up on the hill and they brought down -- well, Gusen enough -- had enough of it’s own patients, but some of the patients from Mauthausen, because there was no medical facilities up there.</span> <span id="s707">And our wards were set up, they must have told you, in former SS barracks.</span> <span id="s708">But we used the same -- I guess you’d call it the same three tiered bunks, for the inmates, except there was only one in each bunk instead of three or four.</span> <span id="s709">And they had beds of straw, because I, you know, I never questioned, when I was there, where’d all these blankets come from?</span> <span id="s710">Or where’d these pajamas come from?</span> <span id="s711">And evidently they must have flown them in and it wasn’t -- this Mike Wordell, who I’d wanted to come, he told me -- and I didn’t realize it at the time, there were two units that were sent in, which were called delousing units.</span> <span id="s712">That’s all they did.</span> <span id="s713">And they were behind the walls, delou -- cause these guys all -- pa -- inmates, patients, whatever you want to call them, had to be completely deloused before they were brought out to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: So that had been going on before you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yeah, yeah, before we arrived.</span> <span id="s716">And then -- and while we were there, because as we would have, say eight deaths a night, we’d have eight -- eight empty beds, they’d bring out -- but they were -- they were doing this behind the wall.</span> <span id="s717">Washing them down and delousing them and giving them either a blanket or pajamas, whatever was flown in.</span> <span id="s718">And I didn’t know about that, I didn’t even question, “Where is this all coming?”</span> <span id="s719">I should have said, “How come?”</span> <span id="s720">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: And what did you do then, you would come every day into the same ward?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: We’d come in -- into the same ward, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: And how many people were -- would be in there, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: I would say at least 100, but I am not sure.</span> <span id="s725">120 - 140, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s726">Rooms on both sides and they were big, big rooms.</span> <span id="s727">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: And a hallway in the middle?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Big hallway and open door here and an open door at the other end, so that you could -- the hallway itself was very dark, but you could see light at the end of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s730">And I -- I like to think of that, yes there is a light at the end of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s731">One of -- and I think I told you that we were not allowed to have any physical contact with the patients.</span> <span id="s732">We could not -- inmates, whatever you want to call them.</span> <span id="s733">We were not allowed to give them nursing care.</span> <span id="s734">They brought in either prisoners of war -- German prisoners of war or people from the community.</span> <span id="s735">Went out in trucks and rounded them up and they stayed there for the day, fed, washed and cleaned.</span> <span id="s736">These guys did what they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: So you didn’t touch them?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: We didn’t touch them.</span> <span id="s739">We weren’t allowed to touch them.</span> <span id="s740">The only thing we did was give them medication.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Every day.</span> <span id="s743">Those that needed.</span> <span id="s744">We learned the word diarrhea in three languages and I’m not sure that I can even say the -- the names today and I’m sure they would too, because one was Russian, one was Polish and one was, I guess French, because we had a very sweet Frenchman who spoke beautiful English.</span> <span id="s745">And whatever we were saying, he says, “Sister,” cause they call the nurses sister, “don’t say” -- and I think we were -- I forget the word we were saying, but -- excuse me, but we were saying shits.</span> <span id="s746">And he wanted -- he said, “It’s deeareeah.</span> <span id="s747">That’s not nice,” he said.</span> <span id="s748">Cause we’d stand at the -- at the door and yell out these three words and those who had diarrhea, would raise their little old hand up, you know and we’d go over and we’d give them their medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s750">And that’s how you cared for them, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: That’s -- that’s the only way.</span> <span id="s752">I don’t think we kept any records.</span> <span id="s753">Maybe number wise, I -- things like that I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s754">I know we didn’t keep records, cause we didn’t know their names.</span> <span id="s755">Towards the end of our stay there, things seemed to ease -- you know, maybe because we’d been there long enough to not be so tense, that we were able to talk to some of the patients through an interpreter.</span> <span id="s756">And I got a couple of names that I wrote to their -- one was a sister back in the States and one was some other kind of a relative.</span> <span id="s757">To tell them, you know, they’re begging, “T-Tell America I’m here,” you know.</span> <span id="s758">And at that time you couldn’t say exactly where they were, you know, just someplace in Austria was the term you had to use.</span> <span id="s759">A-And you couldn’t say exactly what their condition was.</span> <span id="s760">When I got back to the States and I must have given my address back at the States, I got a letter from one woman in Evanston, Illinois and she had gotten my letter and sent me a check for 50 dollars, to do something for her brother, it was her brother.</span> <span id="s761">And so by this time I’m back in the States, so I wrote back to her exactly where he was, exactly his condition and sent her back the 50 dollars.</span> <span id="s762">Hopefully he was still alive.</span> <span id="s763">And I said, “Contact your Red Cross.</span> <span id="s764">Now you know exactly where he was.</span> <span id="s765">Whether he’s still there now, I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s766">I never heard from the other one that I wrote from, but -- to -- so I -- you know, sometimes I think -- I wonder how he made out.</span> <span id="s767">Did he make it out of there, did he make it to America.</span> <span id="s768">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: So you -- you did - -you were, after awhile, able to have some communication with some of the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Some of the -- some of them.</span> <span id="s771">Not very many.</span> <span id="s772">Our -- our corpsman happened to be a great guy.</span> <span id="s773">He was -- I think he was Mexican and he spoke Spanish fluently and he could speak a few words of German or Polish, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s774">And he was able to -- well, this, you know and then you could do with hand signals, too, you know and there wasn’t much you could talk to them about.</span> <span id="s775">They were too weak for one thing.</span> <span id="s776">I don’t know if I told you the -- an-and Ecky knows I will tell you the story where we weren’t supposed to look like women and like I told you, we used to give out these medicines together and she’d give the pills and I’d be behind her with a bottle of whatever it was I had to pour out and give it to them.</span> <span id="s777">And I’m waiting for her, she’s bending over, giving this guy his pills.</span> <span id="s778">And out from the other bunk comes this little bony hand and pats her on the fanny.</span> <span id="s779">And I’m standing there -- not laughing out loud, but saying, “There’s hope for them after all.</span> <span id="s780">There’s still life in them,” you know, really -- which you -- and of course, she didn’t even feel it, it was so weak.</span> <span id="s781">And when she stood up and I’m -- and I says, “Who we kidding?</span> <span id="s782">They know who we are.”</span> <span id="s783">You know and she’s, “Why?”</span> <span id="s784">And I -- I get tears.</span> <span id="s785">I can still see him now, doing that.</span> <span id="s786">It was -- it was cute.</span> <span id="s787">It was pathetic that it was cute.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Did you know who these people were?</span> <span id="s789">Were they -- did -- I mean, som -- they were from different countries, were there -- there were some Jewish people, mostly Jewish people, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Oh, I think there were -- I -- I -- I would -- I couldn’t swear, but I would say I thought most of them were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: At the time, you did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s793">But we had Frenchmen.</span> <span id="s794">We had one Spanish guy who worked on the ward.</span> <span id="s795">He was another one I didn’t trust, cause he was a -- a -- a trustee for the Germans.</span> <span id="s796">And he was -- looked well preserved.</span> <span id="s797">And he had been in the Spanish revolution and had gotten caught somehow and you know, and the Germans helped them out.</span> <span id="s798">Roberto his name was.</span> <span id="s799">But he helped us out.</span> <span id="s800">But these people, no, we didn’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s801">Had no idea.</span> <span id="s802">There was even Russians there too, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: At the time, did you feel that what you were doing for them was helpful?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: It must have helped a little bit, but it was like swimming upstream.</span> <span id="s805">You made a little progress, but not much, you know.</span> <span id="s806">You nourished them, but you had to start out with, you know -- thin, thin soup, because you couldn’t give them food, per se.</span> <span id="s807">And just the thought that they were free, you know, must have been something.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: And I’m sure, you know, I see pictures of these survivors now for the ho -- in the Holocaust and God, they look great.</span> <span id="s810">So they -- you know, they -- life does -- you know, the body does improve.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Oh, you mean survivors today?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s813">That they interview on TV and you would say n -- look at them.</span> <span id="s814">You couldn’t have been in a concentration camp, but you know.</span> <span id="s815">You know yourself, if someone’s really sick and loses a lot of weight, gets better, they do come back, but -- the body is a wonderful machine.</span> <span id="s816">So -- it’s too bad it gets abused.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: How long were you at Gusen?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: I would s -- I think about five weeks we were there, because we left to go home, either -- it was either on my birthday or the day after.</span> <span id="s819">It was either June 21st or 22nd, I remember.</span> <span id="s820">My birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s822">And were you informed suddenly that you were going to leave and --</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: I think probably a week’s notice, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: And did you -- by the -- by the end of that period, did you feel as if some of the people that you were caring for had made progress, or -- was the situation better when you left than when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Well, the -- the attitude was better, you know.</span> <span id="s826">It wa -- it was a lot more relaxed, because we went in there with -- so tight and so tense and you were all literally afraid of them, because, you know, they were so riddled with disease and hey, you know, you’re protected.</span> <span id="s827">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Did any of the nurses get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Well, as far as we -- now, they’re talking about the DDT, which you heard about.</span> <span id="s830">The -- you know, several of our nurses have developed breast cancer.</span> <span id="s831">But, with the ratio of breast cancer today, I -- I can’t see blaming it on the DDT that we had --</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: You didn’t tell me this -- you were sprayed with DDT every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Every day, yeah.</span> <span id="s834">Down our pants, up our arms and in the back of our necks.</span> <span id="s835">She had an old flint gun, I don’t know if you know what a flint gun it.</span> <span id="s836">It’s a -- it’s a ca -- a canister on the end of a sh-sh-sh pump thing.</span> <span id="s837">And I think flit they used to use for flies or mosquitoes or something.</span> <span id="s838">You’d fill this canister with whatever and that was filled with DDT powder.</span> <span id="s839">And we’d stand in front of our chief nurse and pull our pants out.</span> <span id="s840">How degrading, when you think of it.</span> <span id="s841">But that’s how we had to go on .</span> <span id="s842">The first couple of days that we worked at the camp, we felt so bad, so dirty, so contaminated, that we would come back to our nurses quarters and literally strip, outside the door and just drop our drawers right there and these nice German girls would grab them and wash them for us, cause we didn’t want to go in the house with this aroma around us.</span> <span id="s843">You know, and -- and that odor clung to you -- your clothes after awhile, too.</span> <span id="s844">So -- and after awhile you didn’t notice it.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: What other kinds of things that you know of were going on at the camp, in addition to the care that you were giving?</span> <span id="s846">What else was happening there, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Well, I know they got musical instruments for some of the inmates that were musically inclined.</span> <span id="s848">I don’t know where they came from.</span> <span id="s849">I imagine they just walked into somebody’s house and took them.</span> <span id="s850">That’s what they usually did.</span> <span id="s851">This Jeannie Striker that I gave you her -- her papers, she worked with the women.</span> <span id="s852">Now, I never saw the women.</span> <span id="s853">I knew they were there, but I never saw them.</span> <span id="s854">Some of the men went in town and got bolts of material and brought it out to the women and she said they practically clawed at the material, they couldn’t wait to get a piece of it, to make themselves, you know, a top or a -- you know, a muumuu type dress or shorts or something, something to put on their bodies.</span> <span id="s855">And -- but that’s the only story I ever heard from her from the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Do you know if there were children around?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: I never saw a child, no.</span> <span id="s858">Thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: So there were survivors there who were well enough to play musical instruments?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Yeah, but, you know, there were all grades of degration or something.</span> <span id="s861">I don’t know what you want to call it.</span> <span id="s862">There were some that could not move at all and some that walked around.</span> <span id="s863">And yes, they could play a violin.</span> <span id="s864">Maybe not as well as they did in days gone by.</span> <span id="s865">And the spirit is always there, I guess, if you’re a musician.</span> <span id="s866">I’m not.</span> <span id="s867">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Was Gusen by that time, being called a DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Mm-mm, mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Never was?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Not as far as I know.</span> <span id="s872">It wasn’t at that time, anyhow.</span> <span id="s873">And we were the 131st evacuation hospital at Gusen.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s875">Were there people arriving there from other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: I know that happened in some other --</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Mm-mm.</span> <span id="s879">We had more than we could take care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Do you have any sense of how many?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Oh, someone at one time told me there were four -- we had 4000 pa -- we were a 400 bed hospital, originally, this little tent hospital -- and that we had 4000 patients.</span> <span id="s882">But there were, according to that confession, there were what, 60,00 inmates there?</span> <span id="s883">So that’s just a drop in the bucket.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Did you have a chance to walk around the camp at all, or -- did you go up to Mauthausen, the main camp, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: I never got up there and you had to have -- you had to know somebody to get up there, because that was off limits as far as I know.</span> <span id="s886">I did get in -- behind the camp there was this nice, rolling hill and I did get back there and inside that hill was a complete factory -- railroad tracks and everything.</span> <span id="s887">And I was told they were making Mezzerschmidts planes in there.</span> <span id="s888">In fact I brought home a piece of -- still have it -- piece of balsa wood that was painted like a -- a dark, dark olive green and you can just about see a swastika on it.</span> <span id="s889">And someone else told me it was a news -- news -- ammunition place and this Mike that I talked to on the phone, who didn’t make it here, that was our interpreter, he claims that they were making parts for the V2 bombs there.</span> <span id="s890">But it was a complete factory back there, all underground in a bi -- big cavern.</span> <span id="s891">And when I went back to Germany and Austria years later with my daughters and I -- we were in Strasbourg, that was as far as we were -- we were going to go.</span> <span id="s892">I said, “Hey, we have enough time to go to Linz.”</span> <span id="s893">And my daughter, at this time, she was doing all the driving.</span> <span id="s894">“Oh Ma, you’re crazy.”</span> <span id="s895">And I said, “No,” and I just, by my nose, crossed the bridge, turned right, follow the river.</span> <span id="s896">And she said, “Do you know where you’re going?”</span> <span id="s897">And I said, “No, but it’s in this direction.”</span> <span id="s898">Oh, and she was getting so upset with me.</span> <span id="s899">You know, it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack.</span> <span id="s900">And I said, “Slow down.”</span> <span id="s901">In the -- over on the horizon, I saw that same hill.</span> <span id="s902">I says, “We’re coming there, we -- I know we’re coming there.”</span> <span id="s903">And there it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: The camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: The camp.</span> <span id="s906">TV antennas out of what was our wards, lace curtains, flower boxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: People were living in those buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Oh, painted white and beautiful.</span> <span id="s909">I have pictures downstairs, I’ll have to show you.</span> <span id="s910">They had -- just before you got to the camp, there was a -- a memorial to the camp built.</span> <span id="s911">And it was like a -- a maze and you went ar -- and there were all pictures and sayings all around this cement wall right in the center, where the ovens -- but it was locked, you couldn’t get in.</span> <span id="s912">So I went -- there was a little, like I call it a 7-11 Store next door.</span> <span id="s913">By this time my daughter’s really mad at me.</span> <span id="s914">So I went next door and I -- you know, we wanted the key to get in there.</span> <span id="s915">Oh, hese wasa sloe shanol.</span> <span id="s916">He couldn’t speak English, I couldn’t speak German and he was very upset that I wanted to get in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: In where?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: In -- into this little maze, see, it was locked.</span> <span id="s919">There was a padlock on it.</span> <span id="s920">And I say, I want to get -- and he was upset, he was visibly upset.</span> <span id="s921">And I didn’t know what he was saying, he didn’t know what I was saying.</span> <span id="s922">So finally I’m going -- cause we all wore the Red Cross on our sleeve.</span> <span id="s923">“Boom, boom, cranksfester.”</span> <span id="s924">And that’s what I thought was nurse in -- in German.</span> <span id="s925">Boom, boom.</span> <span id="s926">All of a sudden he got the message and he -- his wife comes out with wine and cheese and they’re hugging me and kissing me and my daughter’s standing there like this.</span> <span id="s927">She was so mad.</span> <span id="s928">He come over and opened up the gate and oh, oh, oh -- couldn’t do enough for me.</span> <span id="s929">So, you know, I walked all the way around in -- inside with the ovens they had.</span> <span id="s930">I’ve got pictures downstairs in my album, I’ll have to show you.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: So, that was the crematorium there, is that what you mean by ovens?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Well it -- th-they had taken the ovens out of -- you know, where the crematorium was in behind that -- that’s another story that -- where I’m telling you the -- the barracks were made up like nice houses with TV antennas.</span> <span id="s933">And then there’s the big block house, which had the big gates in it and those -- it was all boarded over, the gates had been removed to someplace.</span> <span id="s934">Maybe -- maybe they were in the maze, I forget.</span> <span id="s935">But we drove up on top of the quarry, which is famous for those last steps and looked down into what was the big compound.</span> <span id="s936">Course all those barracks were blown up and burnt down.</span> <span id="s937">Guess what they were using it for?</span> <span id="s938">They made tombstones there.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: From the stone in the quarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: [inaudible] all these beautiful carved --</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Tell me about the quarry.</span> <span id="s944">What -- what do you know about that whole --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: I’m losing [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: You want to -- let me --</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: I just saw --</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: I understand there was a quarry at this Mauthausen - Gusen complex --</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: -- where people were forced to carry stones.</span> <span id="s951">Did you hear about that, did you see evidence of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Well we -- we have the picture that the -- our chaplain gave us of the steps, they call them the steps of death, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: What were they?</span> <span id="s954">They were --</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: They were just granite.</span> <span id="s956">Everything that Mauthausen and Gusen was built at were huge blocks of granite and it all came from that quarry.</span> <span id="s957">And they’re still using the quarry to make tombstones.</span> <span id="s958">But I drove down there once, I must have had a date with somebody that had a Jeep and it was weird, you know, these -- you -- like in a -- almost in the Grand Canyon, these walls and walls of rock, you know.</span> <span id="s959">And I saw the steps and that was all and I wanted to get out of there, cause it was eerie.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: And -- and the -- these were steps that went up to the quarry, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: No, th-they came out of the quarry and they -- they must have built these steps cause they were also of these big blacks of -- blocks of granite and then there’s a big wall to one side, in fact other side of the steps, that they must have built as they went up.</span> <span id="s962">And when they got to the very top, I don’t know what was up there, more for maybe trucks or something to take these blocks or quarries -- o-of granite someplace else.</span> <span id="s963">But it was eerie.</span> <span id="s964">And then to drive up there 20 years -- was it 20 le -- years later?</span> <span id="s965">Hm.</span> <span id="s966">Must have been more than that.</span> <span id="s967">But to look down and see all of these tombstones down there in that compound, I thought, “You son of a gun.”</span> <span id="s968">So somebody’s making a good business.</span> <span id="s969">So -- even the roadblocks, there was a roadblock between our quarters and Gusen, that of course had been discombobulated for us to go through, but that was built of big blocks of this quarry.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s971">We got to middle -- late July an -- when you left Gusen.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: June.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Jun -- July.</span> <span id="s974">I thought you said --</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Mi-Middle of June we left Gusen.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: We went back to France, by -- this time we went by train.</span> <span id="s980">The nurses and the officers were in first class cars and the men were in horse cattles.</span> <span id="s981">Again, segregation.</span> <span id="s982">And every so often the train would stop and they would say, nurses, we -- we’re not to look out to the side because the men were all having their relief break.</span> <span id="s983">And the -- the train would stop and start because the tracks were, you know, in repair or -- you know.</span> <span id="s984">It was -- it was a -- seemed to me a long ride to where we got.</span> <span id="s985">Then there were trucks that took us first to -- I f -- I think they took us first to what we call Camp 20 grand.</span> <span id="s986">They had all these little like reppo-deppo’s, which were replacement depots for different units and they were named after cigarettes.</span> <span id="s987">First we went to Camp 20 grand, then we went to Camp Lucky Strike, which was great.</span> <span id="s988">It was up on top of a hill, overlooking the -- the Seine in -- in France, except this was just a huge rockpile.</span> <span id="s989">There again, we had to live in tents again.</span> <span id="s990">They were pitched on these rocks and we had to wash our hair out of tin cans and we had a good mess hall, which was run by the German POWs.</span> <span id="s991">And they would be quite fresh to us, but sometimes they’d say, “No sugar today for your coffee.</span> <span id="s992">No sugar today.</span> <span id="s993">No sugar today for your coffee.”</span> <span id="s994">Well, I don’t take sugar in my coffee, it didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s995">The other girls -- at night they’d have sugar cookies they’d make for us.</span> <span id="s996">You know, they’d try to make up, you know, they -- they would do this on purpose to make something nice for us.</span> <span id="s997">So th-they were also trying to be nice.</span> <span id="s998">See, I’m still -- had this distrust of the people.</span> <span id="s999">And -- I didn’t -- I didn’t like anyone that got too familiar.</span> <span id="s1000">And we finally found out they had a ship, we were going home.</span> <span id="s1001">We had our footlockers all packed and away they went and they went down to the harbor and somebody’s packing the -- the -- and they -- course they were all stenciled with our names.</span> <span id="s1002">“Who’s this Mary?</span> <span id="s1003">Females?</span> <span id="s1004">No way.</span> <span id="s1005">Unload, unload,” and the poor GIs, just cause we were females, our men couldn’t go either.</span> <span id="s1006">So they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1008">Why?</span> <span id="s1009">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: There were no facilities on that ship for females and why they kept the men behind, because we couldn’t get on, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: What does that mean, no facilities for females?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Well, they would have to have a place that was closed off where the men couldn’t -- we couldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Mingle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: No men could communicate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: So they couldn’t segregate you, so you couldn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1017">You know?</span> <span id="s1018">So we couldn’t g -- so, cause we couldn’t go, our men couldn’t go, which I thought was so wrong.</span> <span id="s1019">And here these guys have been sitting, waiting to go home too, just as much as we had.</span> <span id="s1020">And then we finally got the General Bliss, which had an area that they could, you know, core our -- you know -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Cordon off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Cordon off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: That was a big ship, the General Bliss?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Ha -- It was big, but it wasn’t that -- it wasn’t as big as the Queen Elizabeth, that’s for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: And where did you leave from, what port?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: We left from Le Havre, in France and we wound up in Boston.</span> <span id="s1027">And it was great, you know, when the boats were out there and welcoming -- and bands were in the boats and from there we went to -- in fact, w-we -- I remember it was the fish pier in -- in Boston, which is still there and we got on trains that were right there at the fish pier and they took us down to Camp Miles Standish, on the Cape.</span> <span id="s1028">Not quite too far down on the Cape, but some part on the Cape.</span> <span id="s1029">It’s now a big campground, I guess.</span> <span id="s1030">And they were great.</span> <span id="s1031">They had -- you know, welcome home and we slept in -- like it was a huge ward, so we were all together, but there were sheets, the first time we’d had sheets in -- oh, months and months and months, we haven’t had a sheet.</span> <span id="s1032">And it was great.</span> <span id="s1033">I remember calling my mother, cause you could call whoever you want to call and they had the -- papers had a habit of printing what units were landing when and where and she had seen in the paper that the 131st was coming into New York Harbor at such and such a date.</span> <span id="s1034">Well, that must have been the first boat that they were loading our stuff on.</span> <span id="s1035">So she says, “Where are you?”</span> <span id="s1036">I said, “Up in Massachusetts someplace, Camp Miles Stand,” -- “You get right home here.”</span> <span id="s1037">I said, “Huh?</span> <span id="s1038">I can’t.</span> <span id="s1039">I’m still in the army, you know.”</span> <span id="s1040">“Well, you were supposed to arrive,” -- buppabuppa.</span> <span id="s1041">I said, “No, Mother.”</span> <span id="s1042">So we finally went to Camp Dix and got our leave papers.</span> <span id="s1043">We had 30 day leave and then we were booked to go to CBI, China-Burma-India area.</span> <span id="s1044">And we knew it and then we figured -- but while we were on leave, VJ was declared, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: You remember the dropping of the bomb?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Yes, I do, yes.</span> <span id="s1047">And I’m sorry to say, I was all for it and still am.</span> <span id="s1048">Not now, I wouldn’t want to drop today.</span> <span id="s1049">I mean what they’re making today is 10 times bigger than that.</span> <span id="s1050">But I just felt that it saved our men a lot.</span> <span id="s1051">And to me it was -- they’re the ones that started it.</span> <span id="s1052">Woody and I are going over to Hawaii for the VJ ceremonies in August, yeah, the end of August, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: So you knew right away then that you wouldn’t be going over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Well, we didn’t, but you know, we didn’t know whether we’d be made to go in the army of occupation or what, so we had to report back to Camp Polk.</span> <span id="s1055">Now Woody was in the service longer than I -- girls that had longer service, they had points and you got out by a certain point system.</span> <span id="s1056">If you were married -- not a widow, but if you were married, if you’d been in the service so long, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, you could be discharged.</span> <span id="s1057">And we had seven discharged from Camp Polk.</span> <span id="s1058">Another gal and I got orders to go to San Antone, Texas.</span> <span id="s1059">Fort Sam Houston, which is a huge hospital.</span> <span id="s1060">When I got down there, hadn’t worked on a ward, didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1061">Didn’t know how to do anything, actually.</span> <span id="s1062">Hadn’t worked -- how to make a bed, even.</span> <span id="s1063">And this young whippersnapper had just gotten in the army and I’m saying, “Well, how do you do this,” and, “how do you do that?”</span> <span id="s1064">And she -- she thinks, well, I must have just got in the army before she -- you know, after she did and so she’s giving me this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1065">She says, “Well where were you last month?”</span> <span id="s1066">I said, “I was over in Germany,” you know.</span> <span id="s1067">Or where were you when VE Day, that was -- I can remember her saying to me.</span> <span id="s1068">I said, “I was in Germany.”</span> <span id="s1069">“In Germany?</span> <span id="s1070">What were you doing there?”</span> <span id="s1071">So she thought I had just joined the army, acting so dumb, well how do you do this and how do you do that?</span> <span id="s1072">And so I met my present -- my ex-husband there.</span> <span id="s1073">He was in the Air Corps and we got married and life starts anew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1075">How long did you stay in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Well, I got out just before Christmas then, so -- so it was about 18 months total, I was in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: What a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1079">In fact, I was embarrassed because when I met my husband to be, he was very shy and didn’t say boo and I thought, “Oh, what a dud you are.”</span> <span id="s1080">You know, and so I’m telling him how I -- cause you got 300 dollars when you were mustered out.</span> <span id="s1081">In other words when you were discharged, they gave

all confiscated and never got back.</span> <span id="s1091">And I didn’t know about that.</span> <span id="s1092">I never heard about that.</span> <span id="s1093">And originally, as I said, I -- I disliked this man intensely because he was Japanese and he turned out to be the most lovable guy there, a doll and I intend to look him up when I go to Hawaii next month.</span> <span id="s1094">I --
