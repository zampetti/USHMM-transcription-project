there in the, like in, in the labor camp.</span> <span id="s233">And they are in change of this, was a Captain Hartman.</span> <span id="s234">Who was very friendly towards the Jews and he tolerated them, and he actually gave them the ability to survive as much as he could.</span> <span id="s235">So, it’s a long story, I have my document, I went to Warsaw, and back and forth.</span> <span

id="s240">Let’s say, that’s exactly – after a few months, you know what happened.</span> <span id="s241">But unfortunately, you see, I don’t like to mention it, but I don’t mind to tell it, that this was done by a Jew, not by nobody else.</span> <span id="s242">This was the head of the thi slabor camp, by the name of Teitlebaum, Tennenbaum.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">WH: Oh?</span></p> <p><span

have a question about that, that I would like you.</span> <span id="s255">Doesn’t I t happen sometimes, that in the survivor community in America, there are probably a few people who know to have acted this way during the war.</span> <span id="s256">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">WU: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">WH: What happens to such people in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">WU: You see, it’s unfortunately or fortunately, I don’t know how or what term to use, not many of them survive, you see.</span> <span id="s260">Because during the time of the ghetto, they thought to call it the (inaudible), that they Jews were involved.</span> <span id="s261">Now, some are very honest (inaudible) and they thought that it would enable them to survive and they will do this orderly function, they’ll see that (inaudible) should be clean, you know, inside the, the children should go to school, or the children should not be hurt on the street.</span> <span id="s262">They didn’t know what’s there for the future.</span> <span id="s263">But then things have changes, they are giving assignments, for quotas to bring so many people.</span> <span id="s264">Then they had to go and to find them, this is the organized for Judenrat, and to organize through the police or the Jewish policeman, and it became a very serious problem, see.</span> <span id="s265">But, at the end, when I talked about Luvov, at the end they were called all in, new machine time to put it briefly, So most of them, or 90 or 95% of them, were killed.</span> <span id="s266">By the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">WH: In Lovov.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">WU: So very few actually survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">WH: Well, I thought to myself, you know, that like in some cases, like Wells mentions in ?</span> <span id="s270">Winoska?</span> <span id="s271">Road he mentions how sometimes the Jewish militia, the (inaudible), were called in, and they were told, “You must give us 5 Jews” If you don’t, then we will take you own family.”</span> <span id="s272">What was a person to do under such circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">WU: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s274">They could do many things, you see.</span> <span id="s275">If you want to sacrifice his life is one thing, or else he could run away and not turn him in.</span> <span id="s276">He didn’t have to do it.</span> <span id="s277">You see - .</span></p> <p><span id="s278">WH: But you couldn’t run in the ghetto if you were already there.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">WU: Well, you could always could escape from the ghetto, you see, could not – unless you had a place where to hide, you see.</span> <span id="s280">But otherwise - .</span></p> <p><span id="s281">WH: You know, I m just thinking to myself.</span> <span id="s282">You know, American Jews like to pass judgments on people and say, “You should have done this, I would have done this” But I always thing that, you know, we learn that you shouldn’t judge another person until you are in their position.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">WU: Yeh, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">WH: Until you come to their place.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">WU: Well, that’s why, this here, we – with the saying here, you know Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">WH: (Responds in Hebrew).</span> <span

<span id="s294">Because I was an instructor on the technical high school.</span> <span id="s295">In order to get a license, to teach one or two – seminars in Warsaw, then I was in Warsaw and then I came back and then get a license and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s296">And then the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">WH: Aha.</span> <span id="s298">You had finished

id="s303">That was a (needs translation).</span> <span id="s304">A technical gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">WH: I see.</span> <span id="s306">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">WU: But then later on, I went here.</span> <span id="s308">You see, I was always dreamt to become an engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">WH: What kind of engineer?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">WU: A mechanical engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">WH: And when you came here to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">WU: And when I came here to America, I went to City College

<p><span id="s318">WH: Uh, uh (yes.)</span></p> <p><span id="s319">WU: To go to college.</span> <span id="s320">SO that’s how I started and I found out that City College at that time was free, but you have to be one year resident of New York, so the first year I went there.</span> <span id="s321">And, so, as a matter of fact, it’s, it’s very involved, because I end up without any, having any documents, you see.</span> <span id="s322">The only documents that I have, was this Edward Weber.</span> <span id="s323">I didn’t have my own name here.</span> <span id="s324">You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">WH: Uh, uh (yes).</span></p> <p><span id="s326">WU: But the only thing that I did have, was a certificate from the – the Polytechnic in Luvov, when the Russian camp was there, that I attended there, the first year, at the Polytechnic, then when they returned, when they were liberated, after I have a certificate where I even draw it up myself for the second year.</span> <span id="s327">In all this, what I went through, and so forth and so on, because I wasn’t sure if I was even capable of doing anything, so I ended up myself to the high school to learn English.</span> <span id="s328">Except to learn just English, (inaudible) to see what’s all the – involved here.</span> <span id="s329">I didn’t - .</span></p> <p><span id="s330">WH: You didn’t know any English when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">WU: Didn’t know English, no.</span> <span id="s332">So and then I felt the (inaudible) here, and (inaudible) go to the City College in the evening, you see.</span> <span id="s333">They had (inaudible) evening courses, I didn’t go in the daytime.</span> <span id="s334">I worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">WH: What were you working at?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">WU: This also, it’s a very inter- very unusual, it’s a , - it’s a very fortunate coincidence, that after I came over, I came over in May.</span> <span id="s337">Then June, July was vacation, you see, and the, - the HIAS, and the New American gave me names of two or three places to go to look for a job.</span> <span id="s338">So I went to one of them.</span> <span id="s339">It was (?</span> <span id="s340">closed to publication?)</span> <span id="s341">, and then I came to the second one, which is a machine company, which was loading machinery to produce envelopes.</span> <span id="s342">By the name of Ethel Schmidt.</span> <span id="s343">An old German machine company.</span> <span id="s344">They are there before the First World War, their name was Smidt.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">WH: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">WU: ‘dt.</span> <span id="s347">Smidt.</span> <span id="s348">BUT, it was not so popular during the First World War, so they changed it to “Smith”.</span> <span id="s349">After the Second World War, it was no so popular again to be German, so they changed it to “Smithe”.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">WH: Smyth?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">WU: Smithe.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">WH: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">WU: And they gave me a test, a technical test on blueprints, it’s a mechanical test, and they accepted me, without any questions, without any knowing the English, nothing.</span> <span id="s354">Just, ah, you interested in my knowledge in building their machines, and I worked there, too, for five years.</span> <span id="s355">This is my first, and the only position in the United States.</span> <span id="s356">So, I worked there for – on the building this machines from the ground floor.</span> <span id="s357">(Inaudible) and doing research and development and try to deal with the chief engineer, by the name of Novick.</span> <span id="s358">Then, as a result of it, I never dreamt to become a businessman.</span> <span id="s359">You see, I was more interested in the educational aspect, or in teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">WH: You would have been a teacher or a professor in Europe if the war hadn’t broken out.</span> <span id="s361">You became a businessman because of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">WU: If I would have access to higher education, but in Poland before the war, it is not an easy access to high education, at that time, several students (inaudible) was killed in Luvov, by the name of ?</span> <span id="s363">Salameir?</span> <span id="s364">if you know (inaudible).</span> <span id="s365">That the students are the Polytechnic in Luvov.</span> <span id="s366">The Jewish have to sit on the right side, and the other on the other.</span> <span id="s367">You see?</span> <span id="s368">And there was very great disturbances, so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s369">And they – the territory was a, ex-territorial, that police could not come in regardless what wouldn’t happen at exams of the Polytechnic, the University, unless the Director asked him to come in.</span> <span id="s370">So, several students were hurt, and even killed.</span> <span id="s371">One, a neighbor or ours.</span> <span id="s372">Anyways, so I enrolled myself at City College, and went in the daytime I worked, at this Ethel Smithe, and in the evening I went to college, and then even later, when I had already my business established, in 1951, 52, I still decided to see to complete it, and I worked until 1955.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">WH: Until 1955.</span> <span id="s374">.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">WU: Seven and a half years.</span> <span id="s376">Cuase I was I was anxious to –</span></p> <p><span id="s377">WH: So how far did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">WU: Accomplish, to (inaudible) completing mechanical engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">WH: And did you complete it?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">WU: Yeh.</span> <span id="s381">In 1955.</span> <span id="s382">so, (inaudible) to say that at night, and the daytime I went to business, and the evening I went to City College, and at night already, my first daughter was born, the one who is now in Israel.</span> <span id="s383">She was crying all night, and I had to take care of the baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">WH: You didn’t have much time, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">WU: That’s how I started it.</span> <span id="s386">That’s how I started the business.</span> <span id="s387">That’s how I built it up, so as a result that I was working with this Ethel Smithe Machine Company, I had a thorough knowledge about the machines to manufacture envelope.</span> <span id="s388">It turn out, this was the only one in the United Sates, with a patent on the equipment.</span> <span id="s389">It was like a monopoly.</span> <span id="s390">They even, they were even collecting the royalties on every envelope that was produces, one for every thousand envelope, one has to pay him a penny at that time.</span> <span id="s391">And the interesting part was, that they would not sell anybody equipment who is not a member of the Association, of the Manufacturer Envelope (inaudible) Association.</span> <span id="s392">(Inaudible) the Association, you had to be able to buy the equipment.</span> <span id="s393">So then it became a problem, about getting the equipment, you see.</span> <span id="s394">To get the equipment, to be able to finance this whole thing.</span> <span id="s395">So this is a story by itself.</span> <span id="s396">That mainly, I had a very close friend, because I was active in the Zionist movement, and there was a (needs translation – nasheri) in Poland, and you have to go to Israel and so forth and so on, but then things have changed, the other way around, and a friend of mine, (inaudible) he became a friend, he went to Cuba.</span> <span id="s397">Because it was not so easy to get a certificate before the war to Palestine, as you know.</span> <span id="s398">And I was in corresponding with him, and then when he found out that I’m alive, he came and visit me here, and he asked me to come over there.</span> <span id="s399">(Inaudible) he and his brother –in-law were in photographic business.</span> <span id="s400">A very big, several stores there.</span> <span id="s401">And he is one, actually, who told me, “Look, you better forget about your education.</span> <span id="s402">It you want to accomplish something, you go into business” Because he was already 47, 48 years, about 8, 10 years in Cuba.</span> <span id="s403">So then he invited me to come to Cuba, and I got a deal with him and his brother-in-law, that they’ll back me up financially, we’ll be partners, they put up x amount of money, and I should put in a certain amount of money, and then go into business, in the same manufacturing the envelopes.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">WH: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">WU: This was ’49,’49, ’50.</span> <span id="s406">But this was a matter, first they felt that I should go into photographer with them, they’ll open a store in Miami.</span> <span id="s407">And I stayed there over the Christmas vacation, and tried to learn their business, photography, so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s408">But then I was not too enthused about it.</span> <span id="s409">So they said, “Why don’t you try and go with what you know best.”</span> <span id="s410">And that I end up in the manufacturing of envelopes.</span> <span id="s411">And this, so of course I could not get the equipment.</span> <span id="s412">But I was very friendly with the Chief Engineer, and it is Ethel Smithe, there were only two Jews besides me on the whole – so the Chief Engineer was a Jew, and another old guy (inaudible) there a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">WH: Novack was - .</span></p> <p><span id="s414">WU: Novack.</span> <span id="s415">And then somebody else was there a Jew, a machinist, and I was the only one, the third one, (inaudible) accepted.</span> <span id="s416">He (inaudible) very well, and (inaudible) very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s417">Through the group, (inaudible) their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">WH: When did you set up your own business?</span> <span id="s419">What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">WU: This was a (inaudible) you couldn’t get - .</span></p> <p><span id="s421">WH: You couldn’t set it up, they had a monopoly on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">WU: They had a monopoly.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">WH: So how did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">WU: Yeh, so, so I found out from this Chief Engineer (inaudible) was very helpful to me.</span> <span id="s425">And he told me “Look, if you’re prepared to manufacture the envelopes at night, and go out the daytime to sell them, you go in, otherwise don’t start” To get the equipment, I thought now that there’s another small company who produces plunger machines.</span> <span id="s426">You have to know the terms, which I use for the - in the industries.</span> <span id="s427">They were wide rangers, wide range windows, it plunged away obsolete the machines which were already from the 19th century, or (inaudible) 20th.</span> <span id="s428">Very obsolete equipment, see, and they stopped producing them.</span> <span id="s429">“Why don’t you go out and contact them to see if they would manufacture for them.”</span> <span id="s430">So that’s what I did, you see.</span> <span id="s431">I went to Springfield, contracting there to make those plunger equipment.</span> <span id="s432">Three machines, took much longer what I anticipated, so that I had no time to go out myself there, for the – spend bout a week or ten days to finish up the first machine.</span> <span id="s433">He brought out the first machine, I –I rented a place on Mott Street, 232 Mott Street.</span> <span id="s434">And registered the name, put in an announcement, I was already in business.</span> <span id="s435">So it’s lucky that I was already in business as a legitimate manufacturer of envelopes, regardless how or what (inaudible) I’m making, then they were willing to sell me their equipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">WH: Smithe?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">WU: Smithe.</span> <span id="s438">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">WH: And so, you bought their equipment?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">WU: bought those three pieces of equipment you see, and started off with the business there, in ’52.</span> <span id="s441">It was a very small area, it was only 1600 square feet, the whole set – the whole setup was (inaudible) and then at most, and two years later, at Queens.</span> <span id="s442">24th Street.</span> <span id="s443">And there, we start to buy the Smithe Equipment.</span> <span id="s444">A plunger, I sell for $50 which I paid $15,000 and I disposed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">WH: They were now obsolete?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">WU: They were obsolete, you see, But just to start with, I had no alternative.</span> <span id="s447">I could not get the equipment.</span> <span id="s448">See, on the later one, the Justice Department was after them, because people start to complain.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">WH: Oh, you mean after Smithe?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">WU: After Smithe.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">WH: Because of the monopoly (inaudible).</span> <span id="s452">They just went after them on their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">WU: Some may have complained to the Justice Department, so they were after them, and they, they discontinued the royalty.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">WH: Uh, uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">WU: I still pay the royalty to them.</span> <span id="s456">(Inaudible) handle with who manufacture.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">WH: You still pay the royalty?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">WU: Not now, but at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">WH: I know, but at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">WU: At that time, so then after the Justice Department is after them, then they discontinue.</span> <span id="s461">(Inaudible) I think was not to sell the equipment.</span> <span id="s462">But being sold the equipment I say, they’re the only one.</span> <span id="s463">So they didn’t care about selling the equipment.</span> <span id="s464">They told them, “Look, you have to put in a deposit, 50%, 25%.</span> <span id="s465">The machine was already about two years.</span> <span id="s466">Three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">WH: Okay.</span> <span id="s468">Now, eventually, the business grew into what it is now.</span> <span id="s469">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">WU: Yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">WH: It kept growing, you kept investing, you kept building, and of course in the beginning, you even had to take chances.</span> <span id="s472">I mean, you had to borrow money from the bank, you didn’t know for sure if you would have the business to pay it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">WH: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">WH: How much business do you do today?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">WU: Well, let me see.</span> <span id="s476">The business is, the business really grew from that time, that we are now, we are probably, one or maybe the only privately owned company.</span> <span id="s477">The largest in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">WH: You are the largest in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">WU: Privately owned.</span> <span id="s480">You see, we have - .</span></p> <p><span id="s481">WH: What public?</span></p> <p><span

that we also manufacture business forms.</span> <span id="s485">You know, those – business from the print-out that you receive various reports.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">WH: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">WU: (WU shows WH forms) We manufacture now, we bought a company two years ago and we manufacture those too.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">WH: I see.</span></p> <p><span
