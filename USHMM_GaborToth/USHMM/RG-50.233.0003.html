dramatic or tragic episode with my father.</span> <span id="s10">I’d like to tell you about this and that will take a little bit of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s16">Q: Your name was Helen ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Helen -- my name is really Hava, Havula (13) but -- Havula Rosenbloom -- but after the war, it was a difficult name so we changed it to Helen.</span> <span id="s18">That was after the war.</span> <span id="s19">My name’s Helen Rosenbloom.</span> <span id="s20">I come from a family of -- we were five children.</span> <span id="s21">I was the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I was born in 1927, December 16, 1927.</span> <span id="s24">I was the oldest and the others were small children when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s25">My parents and the whole family lived in Bedzin.</span> <span id="s26">My father was a traveling salesman.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What did he sell?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: He was like traveling to the neighboring little towns where were lived, the surrounding little towns.</span> <span id="s29">He was selling everything that they needed.</span> <span id="s30">He was a very enterprising kind of person.</span> <span id="s31">I never remember lacking anything.</span> <span id="s32">There was always food in the house and we lived pretty, pretty nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Did you own your own house?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: No, we lived like -- we had two rooms.</span> <span id="s35">It was pretty comfortable and my mother was home.</span> <span id="s36">She was taking care of the children and the house and my father was, as I said, a traveling salesman and he was doing pretty well.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: He sold mostly like household ware?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Like -- whatever they needed.</span> <span id="s39">Like if they needed a material for a dress, or for a coat; or if they needed shoes.</span> <span id="s40">Whatever they needed, he used to travel and bring them whatever they needed.</span> <span id="s41">I was going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Go to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yeah, I was in sixth grade when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Were you in Polish public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yeah, it was really a Jewish, it was just Jewish children, Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s46">It was a girls’ Jewish school which was a public school; it wasn’t a private school.</span> <span id="s47">But Jewish children, when I was going to school, the Jewish children, the girls went to Jewish public school and the boys; my brothers, one of my brothers was already school-age, was in a public school for boys, but Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s48">Jewish children went separately to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: There’s a fairly large Jewish population there.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yeah, Bedzin had a --.</span> <span id="s51">I don’t know how true it is but they said it was 32,000 Jews in the town.</span> <span id="s52">Is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: I have about 22,000 in 1931.</span> <span id="s54">So in another nine years or so, it’s possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: It’s possible, yeah.</span> <span id="s56">Every summer when school ended in June, we used to go to a resort place where my father comes from.</span> <span id="s57">He comes from Olkusz which is like 25 kilometers from Bedzin.</span> <span id="s58">We used to go every summer, we went and spent the summers in Olkusz.</span> <span id="s59">It was like very good times, very good memories I have from those summers.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: You would stay with your grandparents there?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: No, we didn’t have grandparents but my father had distant family that lived there.</span> <span id="s62">We used to rent like a farmer’s house and spent like two months, July and August.</span> <span id="s63">In 1939, that was in the summer, in September when the war broke out and we were ready to come home, the beginning of September, my father was a young man at the time yet.</span> <span id="s64">He was born in 1906, he was like 37 years old.</span> <span id="s65">He was mobilized.</span> <span id="s66">He got some notice to come and register because the Polish had -- the Germans had declared war on Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: So the Polish army ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: The Polish had to come and register and be ready for the war.</span> <span id="s69">So my father was also because he used to -- as a young man, he was a soldier.</span> <span id="s70">He was in the medical corps so these people, they were like the first ones to be called in.</span> <span id="s71">He went and he registered and we went home by ourselves.</span> <span id="s72">I remember my mother and children, we came home and my father was already --.</span> <span id="s73">They were fighting on the Oberslassen (ph) on the Upper Silesia (?)</span> <span id="s74">they were fighting with the Germans.</span> <span id="s75">The Germans were pushing them toward the East and he was ---.</span> <span id="s76">The Russians in one of the towns on the eastern front; his company was surrounded by the Russian army which was coming in from the other side.</span> <span id="s77">He was caught and he remained with the Russians, on the Russian side.</span> <span id="s78">For a while, he was contemplating to come back or not to Bedzin.</span> <span id="s79">He didn’t want to come back because the Germans were already there.</span> <span id="s80">He decided not to come back but he wanted my mother with the children to go there.</span> <span id="s81">But she didn’t want to go; she didn’t want to give everything up and go.</span> <span id="s82">So, she didn’t go and that was the biggest mistake.</span> <span id="s83">But since she didn’t go, he stayed in this place in Vloff, Lemberg.</span> <span id="s84">He stayed there, the Russians, this was Poland before the second World War but the Russians had occupied it and he stayed there.</span> <span id="s85">He didn’t want to go into deep Russia thinking that one day he’s going to come back to us.</span> <span id="s86">Sure enough, 1941, when the Germans and the Russians started, when they broke their agreement… Just for a while there, they had this agreement not to fight.</span> <span id="s87">But then they broke this agreement and they did attack; the Germans did attack.</span> <span id="s88">My father was in that town where the Germans came in, in Vloff and they -- all the Jews in that area when the Germans came in, they murdered them.</span> <span id="s89">They took them out and they dug their own graves and they machine-gunned them.</span> <span id="s90">But my father somehow, got away.</span> <span id="s91">He was telling us because he did come home -- he was telling us that when they took them out, they were hiding in basements from the Germans, from the Ukrainians mostly, were surrounding these houses where they knew the Jews live and they took them out.</span> <span id="s92">One of the Ukrainians recognized him because he used to work -- my father was like a supervisor in a factory there in Lemberg and he recognized him and he said to his friends, he says, he’s a good guy, let him go.</span> <span id="s93">So he did let him go and that’s how he, at that time, he started to smuggle back to Bedzin from there, from that part back to Bedzin.</span> <span id="s94">Quite a few people at that time did come back.</span> <span id="s95">They saved themselves from the massacres and they did come back.</span> <span id="s96">The Germans found out that these people ran away and they came back to the east.</span> <span id="s97">We were called the Third Reich -- they came into the Third Reich and they started looking for them.</span> <span id="s98">They also were looking and my father was scared.</span> <span id="s99">He didn’t have any identification because everybody had to have identification.</span> <span id="s100">He didn’t have any and he had to voluntarily join a group that went to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s101">Didn’t give his name or anything.</span> <span id="s102">Somehow, we had somebody who helped us that he shouldn’t because if they would have arrested him they might have sent him to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s103">But this way he went to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s104">That was 1942, that was May 1942 he went to camp, a labor camp.</span> <span id="s105">We were chased out at that time from our home.</span> <span id="s106">We were put in a ghetto, in the Bedzin Ghetto and it was only a matter of time that we were going to be sent away also.</span> <span id="s107">But somehow they gave out cards for the young people, the young, able people, they gave out yellow cards and for the mothers and children and old, they gave the green cards.</span> <span id="s108">In 1943, in May just a year later, after my father was sent away, I was -- police came and I was taken out and sent away to a labor camp myself.</span> <span id="s109">Three months later, in August, my mother and the children were sent to Auschwitz, to the extermination camps.</span> <span id="s110">Tapes aren’t working?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: No, it’s running.</span> <span id="s112">What was the name of the labor camp you were sent to?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: The labor camp was called -- it was in the area of Hirshburg.</span> <span id="s114">It was the immediate area where the camp was, was called Seletog Rees (word missing), that means big mountains, Rees (word missing).</span> <span id="s115">We worked, I worked in a textile factory.</span> <span id="s116">We were 300 women and there were barracks.</span> <span id="s117">Every room was occupied by 16 girls.</span> <span id="s118">Every morning we used to go, five o’clock, used to go to work and we used to come back, five, six o’clock in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: The factory was within the complex?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Not too much, not too much.</span> <span id="s121">In the morning, we marched out; we were watched and marched out to work and in the evening we came back.</span> <span id="s122">The gates were opened and we were let in.</span> <span id="s123">We were surrounded, the barracks were surrounded with wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: What did you do in the textile factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: I worked at the machines.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: At the looms?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Looms, yeah.</span> <span id="s128">I used to operate three machines myself.</span> <span id="s129">Other girls, some of the girls worked in the spinnery where they used to make the cotton but I worked in the textile factory.</span> <span id="s130">That was 1943 to -- from 1943, 1944, a year later --.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Late 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No, I was until 1945 but 1944, on the outside of our camp, on the outside of the wires, they started putting up barracks.</span> <span id="s133">We didn’t know what the barracks for.</span> <span id="s134">We thought they bringing in more women but it was October, 1944 and they started -- brought in men, Jewish men.</span> <span id="s135">They came -- we found out they were coming from the places where the camps were, where the Russians were advancing.</span> <span id="s136">Like the Polish, the closer to the Polish borders, Germany was closer, the Germans were coming, like Breslau.</span> <span id="s137">So they were pushing these people into Germany.</span> <span id="s138">We were a little, we were Lidershasen.</span> <span id="s139">Our area was closer to Lidershasen.</span> <span id="s140">Closer to Germany, it wasn’t in Germany but it was closer to Germany and these men were brought into this barrack, to these barracks.</span> <span id="s141">One evening, when I came home from work and they were bringing them in by the droves, every day, thousands and thousands were being brought in.</span> <span id="s142">They were -- they looked so haggard and thin and muddy and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Were they brought in by trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No, walking, walking; just walking.</span> <span id="s145">But it didn’t faze me, it didn’t faze me because I was occupied with myself and everybody was just going to work and coming from work.</span> <span id="s146">We realized what situation we find ourselves so we didn’t really worry too much what was going on.</span> <span id="s147">But one evening I came home and one of my friends was telling me.</span> <span id="s148">She says, Helen what would you do if your father came, was one of the transferred?</span> <span id="s149">I knew my father was in camp.</span> <span id="s150">He was sent away in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: You didn’t know which camp though?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: I didn’t know, no.</span> <span id="s153">So when she was telling me this, I says why are you telling me this?</span> <span id="s154">She says, well, I hope you are not going to get too excited but I think somebody asked for you.</span> <span id="s155">I think its your father because he came.</span> <span id="s156">He didn’t know where I was.</span> <span id="s157">But he knew he had a daughter who was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s158">At that time I was already 17, 1944, so he took a chance and he asked.</span> <span id="s159">He ways, by the wires, they were standing by the wires and talking with the women.</span> <span id="s160">He says, could a Helen Rosenbloom be here.</span> <span id="s161">Oh, yeah, there is such a girl!</span> <span id="s162">So when I came home and they told me this, I got very hysterical.</span> <span id="s163">I said Oh God, this is the happiest day of my life.</span> <span id="s164">I met my father, my father.</span> <span id="s165">Nobody, I was the only one and I was just in heaven.</span> <span id="s166">I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s167">I didn’t realize that this is not such a good thing for me; not such a happy thing.</span> <span id="s168">At the time, I was kind of rejoicing.</span> <span id="s169">I went in; I wanted to see him, hadn’t seen him in two years and then he was in Russia and I didn’t have a chance to see him.</span> <span id="s170">I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s171">So I ran into this woman, this German woman that was overseeing us.</span> <span id="s172">We were not in the concentration camp yet, we were just a labor camp.</span> <span id="s173">I ran into her and I don’t know where I got the courage because she was a very stern person.</span> <span id="s174">She was a big woman; I was a little thing.</span> <span id="s175">I ran into her and I started crying and I said, could you please do for me, my father’s here, my father came.</span> <span id="s176">Could I see him, could I please see him, just for five minutes.</span> <span id="s177">She listened to me, I don’t know what made her like that.</span> <span id="s178">She really listened to me.</span> <span id="s179">She says, you know, I’m going to do something.</span> <span id="s180">I’m going to see that you see your father.</span> <span id="s181">She went into the other side; she did go in and she spoke to this oversharfuhrer; he was a killer.</span> <span id="s182">Tell you later why I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: She was just a ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: She was just a woman, a German woman, a very prominent kind of a woman, she must have been.</span> <span id="s185">She was very respected but she was a real German woman that took care of Jewish.</span> <span id="s186">They trusted her that she’ll be enough, good or bad enough to lead a camp.</span> <span id="s187">She went in there and I did meet my father.</span> <span id="s188">They brought him in.</span> <span id="s189">Everybody, all the girls, were 300.</span> <span id="s190">All the girls were standing there in the big corridor in the barrack.</span> <span id="s191">They brought him in and he was very thin.</span> <span id="s192">He was like this.</span> <span id="s193">He had a little head, a shaven head and muddy, full of mud.</span> <span id="s194">When I embraced him, I could see the mud just on him.</span> <span id="s195">My uncle, it was an uncle that came with him, my mother’s oldest brother.</span> <span id="s196">Just he happened to meet him in that camp when they brought them -- when they brought all these people there, he happened to meet him there.</span> <span id="s197">He brought him in so I met the uncle and my father.</span> <span id="s198">We saw each other for a few minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: They came onto your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: He came in -- they brought him in.</span> <span id="s201">They brought him in and we met and I was very happy; he was very happy.</span> <span id="s202">He asked me, where’s mamma, where are the children?</span> <span id="s203">I said, look, just the two of us now.</span> <span id="s204">I told him the truth.</span> <span id="s205">My uncle asked me, where are my children, where?</span> <span id="s206">I said, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s207">Anyway, so I said to myself, what can I do for him.</span> <span id="s208">I’d like to save him because this was a place that they brought these people in to die.</span> <span id="s209">They used to take them out, this was October, November, December; it was cold.</span> <span id="s210">It was so cold, they weren’t dressed.</span> <span id="s211">They take them out in the morning for work and brought them back when it was dark.</span> <span id="s212">You know in the winter, it gets dark early.</span> <span id="s213">They used to keep them standing after a day’s work, used to make them stand there and look for the -- if they find something on them.</span> <span id="s214">So if they found on somebody a potato or a piece of bread that they brought back -- that they got somehow from somebody; they used to beat them.</span> <span id="s215">They used to make them fall down and get up, fall down and get up and I used to see that.</span> <span id="s216">I was crying day and night.</span> <span id="s217">Then they used to bring back a lot of dead people from that work whatever they did outside.</span> <span id="s218">I used to worry.</span> <span id="s219">Every night, was for a few months, this was going on.</span> <span id="s220">Until from October, 1944 to 1945, January, beginning of January, I used to give him everything that I could throw over the wires, bread --.</span> <span id="s221">The bread that I got in the morning, I used to get two tiny pieces of bread; at night I used to get the potato; so whenever the soup, I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s222">But whatever I got that was solid, that I packed, I used to throw over the wire.</span> <span id="s223">I didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s224">This is for a few months I didn’t eat anything.</span> <span id="s225">I used to go to work.</span> <span id="s226">The little food that we got, we got very little, I used to give to him.</span> <span id="s227">At first, he didn’t realize, but then he asked me, from where do you have it?</span> <span id="s228">From where do you --?</span> <span id="s229">I said, don’t worry, don’t worry, I have, I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: You were able to talk with him through the fence?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s232">We used to stand, we used to talk.</span> <span id="s233">Somehow and he used to tell me, don’t worry, he says, you’ll see, we’ll survive and we’ll be together.</span> <span id="s234">We’ll take care of each other and a soon as we get liberated, he used to tell me, because he was big politician -- used to come home and bring me the news.</span> <span id="s235">Oh, I heard this and I heard that, soon the war will be over.</span> <span id="s236">I heard it from this one and from that one.</span> <span id="s237">We’ll soon be liberated.</span> <span id="s238">As soon as we get liberated, I’ll send you to Aukvotks.</span> <span id="s239">Did you hear of the city Aukvotks?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: It’s a resort, by Warsaw.</span> <span id="s242">The people, the rich people, used to go to -- for the summer.</span> <span id="s243">People also that used to have TB; lung --.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Was a spa of some kind, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yeah, spa.</span> <span id="s246">It was a very elegant resort place.</span> <span id="s247">He says as soon as we get liberated, I’ll send you to Aukvotks.</span> <span id="s248">I never forgot this.</span> <span id="s249">Anyway, this was going on from October to January, beginning of January.</span> <span id="s250">I felt myself getting weaker and weaker but I was -- I’m little but I’m a strong person.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: You pretty much just eating the soup that you got?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: That’s all I used to eat a whole day.</span> <span id="s253">At night, we used to get a soup, a very thin, like a spinach soup, and potatoes, like two potatoes.</span> <span id="s254">The potatoes, right away, I didn’t even feel like eating them because I knew they’re not mine.</span> <span id="s255">I used to throw them with the bread from the morning.</span> <span id="s256">I used to go away in the morning not eating anything and that was going on for months.</span> <span id="s257">I felt myself getting weaker and weaker.</span> <span id="s258">I just wanted him to live.</span> <span id="s259">In January, I don’t remember exactly but I know it was the beginning of January, we were awakened and we had to dress fast and they said we are leaving the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Up to that point, you still had been working in the factory, in textile?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Factory, continuously working in the factory.</span> <span id="s262">We were told to dress and that we are being evacuated from the camp.</span> <span id="s263">I looked out and there was nobody there on the other side no more.</span> <span id="s264">They took them out also.</span> <span id="s265">It seems that they were also advancing towards us, the Allies or the Russian army, whoever it was, was advancing in our direction.</span> <span id="s266">We were sent out.</span> <span id="s267">They already had begun, the ( words missing), didn’t see him no more.</span> <span id="s268">They -- we went on that march, walking, it was snowing and cold, was blowing --.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Did they give you any idea where you were heading?</span> <span id="s270">Did you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: No, nothing, nobody says, nobody told us anything.</span> <span id="s272">Just told to go.</span> <span id="s273">We were going and going and at a certain place, we were put on trains.</span> <span id="s274">Those cattle trains and before we passed, I know it was before Czechoslovakia, we were shot at.</span> <span id="s275">Planes were coming down, later on we found it must have been -- we were told, it was either American or English that were shooting.</span> <span id="s276">Because on the same trains they were also bringing ammunition.</span> <span id="s277">They were covered up, the ammunition and we were in these cattle trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: How long had you marched before you got on the trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: We marched day and night, a long, long time.</span> <span id="s280">We put on those trains and were shot at.</span> <span id="s281">A lot of the women that I was with was shot and killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Through the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Through those little openings, was little openings in the trains that you had, those cattle trains.</span> <span id="s284">It was rrrrroo flying back.</span> <span id="s285">This girlfriend of mine, in the winter when it was cold, in camp, in Tr(rest of word missing) we used to sleep together when it was cold.</span> <span id="s286">This girl was slow kind of person.</span> <span id="s287">Whatever she did, she did very slow, always.</span> <span id="s288">That was her nature.</span> <span id="s289">When we heard the shooting, everybody like fell to the ground.</span> <span id="s290">The first thing we did was put on our shoes because we were sitting on the trains without our shoes to be a little bit more comfortable.</span> <span id="s291">The first thing we just put our feet in the shoes and we laid down.</span> <span id="s292">But she decided she was going to, she had these shoes with laces, she was going to lace up her shoes.</span> <span id="s293">It just tore her feet to pieces.</span> <span id="s294">She lived until we brought her into Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s295">We came into Mauthausen and she died there, in Mauthausen, this girl.</span> <span id="s296">But there were other women that were shot or were killed.</span> <span id="s297">There were some Hungarian girls.</span> <span id="s298">Anyway we were brought into Mauthausen and Mauthausen stays on the mountain.</span> <span id="s299">Walking up to the camp, we saw blood on both sides just trickling down, both sides of the road going up to the mountain.</span> <span id="s300">We knew that we’re going to a very nice place.</span> <span id="s301">We came up, we saw a lot of people was shot out there.</span> <span id="s302">We stood in Mauthausen, we were in Mauthausen from – must have been like March, beginning of March to April.</span> <span id="s303">Also we were put into one big room, was like a barn.</span> <span id="s304">Thousands of people packed in, just had enough place just to sit down, just like this.</span> <span id="s305">In the morning, we used to go out just in the air and then they chased us back in.</span> <span id="s306">Then we were taken out from Mauthausen after a few – I would say about a few weeks we were there, three or four weeks, we were there and we were taken out from Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s307">We were lined up and as we were lined up we met up -- we didn’t realize that it was so many people there.</span> <span id="s308">There were a lot of Jewish men we met that were also lined up to go out from Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s309">.</span> <span id="s310">By the gate going out from there, they had baskets with breads; by the gate standing.</span> <span id="s311">I’ll never forget that scene.</span> <span id="s312">The men, they threw themselves, they were standing SS men, young German guys were standing at the gate by those baskets.</span> <span id="s313">They were supposed to go out.</span> <span id="s314">There was pushing, there was pushing.</span> <span id="s315">The men, they threw themselves at those baskets and they were standing there and beating them with the guns they were holding.</span> <span id="s316">It was such a massacre, was such a killing going on there.</span> <span id="s317">Everybody was beaten up but mostly the men.</span> <span id="s318">These men were so many years in the camps.</span> <span id="s319">They came from starvation and they saw bread so they threw themselves at those baskets.</span> <span id="s320">They were -- a lot of them just got hit in the head.</span> <span id="s321">They just ran away and some of them were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: What was the bread there for?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: They wanted – they – some people grabbed the bread.</span> <span id="s324">Some did but others didn’t.</span> <span id="s325">Others got hit.</span> <span id="s326">Some did and some didn’t.</span> <span id="s327">Some were lucky and they got the bread and they got because there was such a pushing with thousands of people going through that gate.</span> <span id="s328">Anyway we went through the gate.</span> <span id="s329">I don’t remember going for that bread and none of the women that I was with; mostly men.</span> <span id="s330">We went through the gate.</span> <span id="s331">This was in Austria, 1945.</span> <span id="s332">This was April.</span> <span id="s333">Again we started walking and we walked and it was raining day and night; it was pouring.</span> <span id="s334">We walked without food, like every second or third day they gave us a piece of bread and some water.</span> <span id="s335">At night we slept on the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Under nothing, just --?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Under nothing, it was jut wet.</span> <span id="s338">We were just laying there in the fields and we were so tired, we just slept.</span> <span id="s339">At one point I noticed a young German soldier taking a young Jewish guy in one of the fields that we were supposed to have been resting, where we rested for the night.</span> <span id="s340">He took a young guy, a young German soldier.</span> <span id="s341">There was a pond on that field.</span> <span id="s342">He took that guy and he put his head in the water and other Germans came and they looked on what he did until the guy was dead.</span> <span id="s343">He just dunked his head in the water, dunked him in the water until he was dead.</span> <span id="s344">This was 1945 already, the Germans knew they were losing the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: You saw this man being --?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: I saw this.</span> <span id="s347">I never forget.</span> <span id="s348">I saw that young guy, a beautiful – he didn’t look like he was ready to die.</span> <span id="s349">After walking for days and days, I don’t remember how many days but for days we were walking and walking.</span> <span id="s350">And Austria is a small country.</span> <span id="s351">I don’t know why we did that walking but while we marched; while we marched like in the daytime; we had to march like in fives; behind us there were thousands of people going.</span> <span id="s352">The end, there were German young guys on motorcycles riding and whoever fell back, if you were weak, you couldn’t walk, you were wobbly; there was shooting, shooting.</span> <span id="s353">All the way you heard shooting like; it was like you were used already to it.</span> <span id="s354">On both sides of the road in Austria, on both sides were just piles and piles of death, dead people.</span> <span id="s355">This was going on until we were brought into Gunskilkin.</span> <span id="s356">The woods -- there were woods.</span> <span id="s357">They brought us into the woods and there were barracks prepared.</span> <span id="s358">I heard later on that they started with 7,000, there were 7,000 that came in.</span> <span id="s359">We were there in Gunskilkin for 10 days.</span> <span id="s360">Very little food, no water, no food, no toilet.</span> <span id="s361">In the barracks, were no floors, was mud.</span> <span id="s362">You went in, you were lucky to find a little space to sit down.</span> <span id="s363">But when I came in, when I came in to Gunskilkin, I felt like this is the end.</span> <span id="s364">I am going -- this is my last stop.</span> <span id="s365">There was a stump, a tree stump because to put up these barracks, they had to chop down the trees.</span> <span id="s366">There was a tree stump and I sat down on that tree stump and I felt myself like expiring.This girl, a Hungarian girl came over to me.</span> <span id="s367">These Hungarian girls came to us in 1944 when they were brought to different places from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s368">We received a transport also of Hungarian girls in 1944.</span> <span id="s369">We had to teach them the work in the textile factory.</span> <span id="s370">This girl with her sister was put to my machines and I had to teach them the work.</span> <span id="s371">The others maybe weren’t so kind to them.</span> <span id="s372">They didn’t speak Yiddish, they didn’t speak Polish.</span> <span id="s373">You couldn’t communicate with them.</span> <span id="s374">It was very hard to communicate with them.</span> <span id="s375">They were different than we were.</span> <span id="s376">You see the Polish people -- we were used to suffering, so many years, since 1939.</span> <span id="s377">They just recently -- so they were a little different than we were.</span> <span id="s378">They were -- and some of our people, some of the women that I was with, treated them not so nice.</span> <span id="s379">But I felt sorry for these two.</span> <span id="s380">One was a very pretty girl.</span> <span id="s381">She was so pretty; she had dark hair and blue eyes.</span> <span id="s382">She was so attractive, she was so gorgeous and she had a younger sister, also a very pretty girl.</span> <span id="s383">The sister must have been maybe 13 years old but she was nicely developed so she went through Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s384">They stood on my machines and I taught them and I was kind to her and she looked forward to stay with me.</span> <span id="s385">I used to somehow communicate with her.</span> <span id="s386">She came over to me in Gunskilkin and she says to me --.</span> <span id="s387">She saw me sitting there.</span> <span id="s388">She says, come on.</span> <span id="s389">She says come with me.</span> <span id="s390">She took me away from the people that I was with, my Polish friends, Polish Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s391">She took me with her.</span> <span id="s392">She says come with me.</span> <span id="s393">I went with her and we found three places.</span> <span id="s394">She was very smart.</span> <span id="s395">She used to go out and bring somehow a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s396">They used to bring in some rations.</span> <span id="s397">But there was such a pushing that not everybody could do that.</span> <span id="s398">If you were weak, if you were sick, you couldn’t do that anymore.</span> <span id="s399">But she, she used to go out and bring in for her sister, she brought for me.</span> <span id="s400">I hardly could go out.</span> <span id="s401">When I used to go out, it was only when I went to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s402">I already had dysentery and I had to go very often.</span> <span id="s403">They had these outhouses.</span> <span id="s404">There was a big walk.</span> <span id="s405">Until I got there, the mud was so -- was impossible to walk.</span> <span id="s406">People used to stick their feet in and that’s where they fell and that’s where they died.</span> <span id="s407">We used to walk over dead people.</span> <span id="s408">By the toilets, by the outhouses, there were stacks and stacks of dead people, stacks of them, just there.</span> <span id="s409">I used to go there.</span> <span id="s410">I used to just look away and just go in and come back.</span> <span id="s411">I felt myself sick and her sister was very sick also.</span> <span id="s412">She was okay, the sister was sick.</span> <span id="s413">That was for ten days, laying in that mud and not washing.</span> <span id="s414">Every time I touched myself, I used to take off lice that were so big like my hand.</span> <span id="s415">I used to put my hand under my arms -- everybody was crawling away.</span> <span id="s416">Unbelievable lice, I have never seen in my life.</span> <span id="s417">I was there in camp and this was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s418">Friday May the 5th we heard some commotion and it started -- we were free but most people –</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: The commotion --?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Most people were sick, everyone.</span> <span id="s421">There were some that still could walk but most were very ill.</span> <span id="s422">That was Friday.</span> <span id="s423">Next day, Saturday, I decided I’m going to join my friends, my previous friends from camp that I know from home.</span> <span id="s424">I joined them and see what they do.</span> <span id="s425">So I went there and they decided that they’re going to go out.</span> <span id="s426">We were all sick, we were all holding on to each other and we walked out from the camp, everybody.</span> <span id="s427">That was Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s428">As we walked out, we saw Americans on tanks.</span> <span id="s429">They were throwing candies and gum and everything, they were throwing.</span> <span id="s430">They saw what was happening.</span> <span id="s431">The roads were full of these people that were walking out from the camps.</span> <span id="s432">They were throwing their rations, cans with all kinds of food.</span> <span id="s433">But then after a day, they decided to give us, these people give us shelter.</span> <span id="s434">We got shelter in these houses that -- was like a camp, a soldiers’ camp.</span> <span id="s435">We got these -- a room.</span> <span id="s436">We were five girls.</span> <span id="s437">My friends, we got one room with beds, with these cots that the soldiers used to sleep on.</span> <span id="s438">It was very nice, it was clean and there were kitchens opened up.</span> <span id="s439">I don’t know if it was Red Cross or whatever.</span> <span id="s440">All over, kitchens opened up and they used to cook and they used to feed so food was no problem.</span> <span id="s441">But we were sick and I, especially, was very ill.</span> <span id="s442">But I wanted –</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Still with dysentery?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Dysentery, continuously dysentery, But I was very weak, very weak.</span> <span id="s445">But I wanted to live so much.</span> <span id="s446">The will to live was so tremendous that I can’t believe that today people want to live so badly.</span> <span id="s447">I was young, I guess, and that’s what made me strive for that.</span> <span id="s448">But I was pushing, I was getting up in the morning, dressing, but I could not help myself, very sick.</span> <span id="s449">I had a temperature; I didn’t realize.</span> <span id="s450">I was going out, I was walking, I was washing up.</span> <span id="s451">I was dressing, I was -- but I felt myself very sick.</span> <span id="s452">One day I woke up in the morning, very high fever.</span> <span id="s453">I realize that I had high fever and I was full of spots, was brown spots all over me.</span> <span id="s454">They called up emergency or whatever at that time was.</span> <span id="s455">I was taken to a hospital, I had typhoid, very bad.</span> <span id="s456">Typhoid and TB and dysentery and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Let’s pause for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">(End of Side A)</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: I wasn’t put – it was like a makeshift hospital.</span> <span id="s460">The doctors were German, the nurses were German.</span> <span id="s461">I was laying, I remember myself falling asleep, like dozing off and waking up, dozing off and waking up.</span> <span id="s462">I find myself on the floor, on a straw sack.</span> <span id="s463">For the longest, longest time, I wasn’t put into a bed?</span> <span id="s464">There were beds but they thought I’m dying because I looked like I was dying because I didn’t eat anything, I didn’t drink anything.</span> <span id="s465">I don’t remember getting an injection or a medicine, nothing.</span> <span id="s466">I was laying there and there were others that were laying -- was like a corridor.</span> <span id="s467">We were lined up and laying there and I wasn’t out into a bed.</span> <span id="s468">This was going on for a very long time.</span> <span id="s469">then after a while, I woke up and I did find myself in a bed, in a white -- white sheets.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Days later this was, or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: This was a very long time.</span> <span id="s472">This was May, June, July.</span> <span id="s473">This was three months later.</span> <span id="s474">This was August already.</span> <span id="s475">I found myself in bed, in a bed and a nurse standing over me.</span> <span id="s476">She was taking the temperature and she was smiling.</span> <span id="s477">She says, you know you’re going to be okay.</span> <span id="s478">She said in German to me that the fever fell.</span> <span id="s479">Your fever fell, she says, and you’re going to live.</span> <span id="s480">You’re going to be okay.</span> <span id="s481">But I was still -- I was laying in a bed and behind me was a window.</span> <span id="s482">The window was open, it was summer and I could hear voices downstairs, laughing and people walking.</span> <span id="s483">I was conscious because I was very weak.</span> <span id="s484">You know when you’re weak, you just want to sleep.</span> <span id="s485">When I heard the noise and I heard laughing and I heard talking and I said would I like to do that.</span> <span id="s486">To be able to walk and also laugh but I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s487">My feet didn’t want to get up.</span> <span id="s488">I couldn’t get up and I had to be -- she used to bring me in the pan, the bedpan a few times a day and this was going on for a long time.</span> <span id="s489">But one day -- I couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s490">I couldn’t eat but I had a friend.</span> <span id="s491">I met a man in that camp where we were brought in, in that soldiers’ camp, when we were brought in, after Gunskilkin, I met a Polish man that was in Mauthausen as a political prisoner.</span> <span id="s492">He was a Christian.</span> <span id="s493">He was much older than me but he liked me.</span> <span id="s494">I don’t know -- at the time I didn’t realize of his intentions but I needed a friend.</span> <span id="s495">He was good to me and when I started getting better and my friends found out that I’m alive because this was a long --.</span> <span id="s496">They didn’t know what had happened to me; they couldn’t find me.</span> <span id="s497">They didn’t know what had happened, they thought I’m dead.</span> <span id="s498">But they did find out that I’m alive and they started to come and visit me.</span> <span id="s499">They told him that I’m alive, that I’m okay.</span> <span id="s500">He came to visit me and since I couldn’t eat and I looked very bad, he says to me, what would you like to eat, what would you like?</span> <span id="s501">There must be something that you would like to eat.</span> <span id="s502">I told him, I remember how my mother used to cook rhubarb.</span> <span id="s503">I had this taste or rhubarb, a lot of sugar, sour and sweet.</span> <span id="s504">I would like to have rhubarb.</span> <span id="s505">Well, tomorrow we’re going to have rhubarb so he brought me rhubarb.</span> <span id="s506">I started eating the rhubarb and he brought me sandwiches with salami and butter and cheese.</span> <span id="s507">I used to sit and I had to eat it up while he sat there, I had to eat it up.</span> <span id="s508">But one thing he says to me.</span> <span id="s509">He says, you eat it up.</span> <span id="s510">If I see you sharing this with your friends, I’m going to kill you.</span> <span id="s511">He did that.</span> <span id="s512">I ate, I started eating.</span> <span id="s513">Then my friends started bringing me different things.</span> <span id="s514">But I still couldn’t go down, I couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s515">But I made up my mind one day, I am going to go down to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s516">I’m going to walk because that window did it.</span> <span id="s517">That window I had behind me.</span> <span id="s518">That sun, those beautiful days gave me such an incentive to live and to want to be normal, so I said I am going to go down and I am going to walk.</span> <span id="s519">I’m going to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s520">To go to the bathroom you have to pass a corridor and I started -- I went down with my head was going like this.</span> <span id="s521">My feet were like rubber but I was holding on by the wall.</span> <span id="s522">Took me an hour until I got to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s523">All the doctors, I’ll never forget that scene; all the doctors and the nurses were standing there like they -- they were looking like they saw a ghost.</span> <span id="s524">That’s how I must have looked.</span> <span id="s525">When they saw how I looked, very bad.</span> <span id="s526">But after that time, I walked down.</span> <span id="s527">I went, I did it on my own and I went back and I did it again and again.</span> <span id="s528">A few days I went and I joined my friends, these five girls that I was with before, before I went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s529">I was weak for months, very weak.</span> <span id="s530">I was laying most of the time but they were very good to me.</span> <span id="s531">They shared everything they had with me and they --.</span> <span id="s532">I recuperated, not fully but I did get back a little bit where I could function.</span> <span id="s533">Then I met my husband.</span> <span id="s534">We left that place.</span> <span id="s535">That place was called Hirschegg, by the way, the camp of the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s536">The area was called Hirschegg.</span> <span id="s537">We left Hirschegg and we went into Lintz.</span> <span id="s538">We married 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: In Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: I never met my father again.</span> <span id="s541">I was looking for him.</span> <span id="s542">I was going from camp to camp because they had these places, these displaced persons camps.</span> <span id="s543">People that were coming from all over.</span> <span id="s544">From there, they were going to Israel or to America, or Australia or whatever.</span> <span id="s545">A lot of them passed through Austria.</span> <span id="s546">I made sure that I pass every camp and I looked.</span> <span id="s547">I wrote letters and I left my name everywhere.</span> <span id="s548">It seems that he was killed on one of those, on that march that he disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: You don’t know for sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: I don’t know what happened, what could have happened to him.</span> <span id="s551">He was killed or died from starvation.</span> <span id="s552">But we married and the following year, 1947, our son was born in Lintz, in Austria.</span> <span id="s553">The following year, 1948, in December, we came to the United States where my husband had some family.</span> <span id="s554">We’ve been here since and I’m doing pretty -- I think I’m doing pretty well for somebody who’s supposed to be dead.</span> <span id="s555">But it seems that it was -- I was destined to live for all of them, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: I carry this, I do live for all of them.</span> <span id="s558">I try to live for all of them.</span> <span id="s559">I try to be as strong as possible.</span> <span id="s560">I’m trying to be helpful to my husband with my strength.</span> <span id="s561">He gives me a lot of strength here.</span> <span id="s562">He is a strong person.</span> <span id="s563">We are two survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: I have a couple of questions.</span> <span id="s565">That moment in Gunskilkin, when you sat on the stump and felt like this was the end, that was a bad feeling that you were going to die, you felt?</span> <span id="s566">Not that this was the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: I felt -- no, no.</span> <span id="s568">That wasn’t the end, no, no.</span> <span id="s569">I heard nothing about the end of the war.</span> <span id="s570">I just -- we were fighting from day to day for the existence of our lives.</span> <span id="s571">A piece of bread made you go on another hour or another day, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Those barracks were horribly crowded.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: These barracks in Gunskilkin was, if ever somebody imagines hell, this was hell.</span> <span id="s574">Because it was -- what they did is they put up the walls, the barracks.</span> <span id="s575">They didn’t put up any planks, nothing on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: It had been raining?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: This was March, March April.</span> <span id="s578">It was raining -- it was like coming down day and night just like curse.</span> <span id="s579">On top of everything else, it was just pouring, raining and mud.</span> <span id="s580">You were laying in mud.</span> <span id="s581">There was enough space, there wasn’t space for everybody because I know of people -- I remember people standing.</span> <span id="s582">They didn’t have place to sit down.</span> <span id="s583">The bathrooms that we had to go to, those outhouses, with those stacks and stacks of dead people.</span> <span id="s584">In Gunskilkin, you have graves there of thousands of people, thousands.</span> <span id="s585">Young people, young guys, young --, everybody was young.</span> <span id="s586">Old people couldn’t survive, everybody was young.</span> <span id="s587">I remember seeing laying there people from Auschwitz with the stripes.</span> <span id="s588">They were laying there with the striped suits.</span> <span id="s589">These people had been there, had been years in camps.</span> <span id="s590">The last minute, this was just days before liberation, they died.</span> <span id="s591">They died of --.</span> <span id="s592">I was, I was, really this was, I don’t know how I survived.</span> <span id="s593">I was so sick and I was laying there.</span> <span id="s594">Nobody, I don’t remember anybody giving me a little water or a pill, an injection, nothing.</span> <span id="s595">When they brought me into that bed, when I found, when I opened up my eyes and I saw this nurse standing by me, it was like coming back from the dead.</span> <span id="s596">Then next to me was a bed with somebody that she recognized me, this girl.</span> <span id="s597">She says to me, you know this bed where you laying, my sister just died, that’s why you got the bed, she says to me.</span> <span id="s598">I think I’m very strong or there’s some higher-up that wanted me to live.</span> <span id="s599">But I wanted my father to live very badly, I wanted him to live so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: His name was David Leon.</span> <span id="s602">I wanted him to live.</span> <span id="s603">I said -- I used to pray to God every night, I said, take my life and let him live.</span> <span id="s604">When I saw what was going on there -- how they used to torture these people.</span> <span id="s605">All the days in the cold, not dressed and not fed.</span> <span id="s606">They used to bring them back into the camps at night and if they found a piece of bread or a potato, they used to torture them to death.</span> <span id="s607">There was my father amongst them.</span> <span id="s608">How can a child see that?</span> <span id="s609">I used to adore my father.</span> <span id="s610">My father was a very idealistic, a very wonderful person.</span> <span id="s611">He was the one that used to say that for us Jews, I remember as a little girl, he used to tell his children, he says, for us Jews, there is only one way for us to exist is to have our own country.</span> <span id="s612">People must have a country.</span> <span id="s613">That’s why I’m a Zionist.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: What do you remember about when the Germans first came into your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: When they came in, September, the first thing they did.</span> <span id="s616">We had the most beautiful shul in our city.</span> <span id="s617">If anybody -- I think most people remember that shul as like a -- like the temple in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s618">Inside was the work like Michelangelo.</span> <span id="s619">I remember being just twice, maybe twice or three times in the shul.</span> <span id="s620">It was work like Michelangelo’s work on the ceilings.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: It’s called the Great Synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Oh, was that a gorgeous synagogue, outside and inside.</span> <span id="s623">It was a dream.</span> <span id="s624">First thing is that they burned that synagogue.</span> <span id="s625">They threw, as the synagogue was burning, they threw pigs and cows into the fire.</span> <span id="s626">They used to shout.</span> <span id="s627">They used to take out people in the talasim.</span> <span id="s628">There was a lot of -- across from the shul was a mikvah.</span> <span id="s629">Not far from there, around in that area, lived a lot of Hasidim.</span> <span id="s630">They used to take them out and shot them and threw them in the -- when the shul was burning.</span> <span id="s631">This is the first thing they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Many homes were lost too, weren’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Around there, the whole area.</span> <span id="s634">We went back in 1979, Irving and I went back to Bedzin.</span> <span id="s635">We went to Poland, among other cities, we visited Bedzin.</span> <span id="s636">I couldn’t find the place where the shul was.</span> <span id="s637">I wanted -- not so much to see where we lived even, but I wanted to see what the shul --.</span> <span id="s638">I wanted to know if I recognized the place where the shul stood.</span> <span id="s639">All the houses around were burned, destroyed.</span> <span id="s640">There was a church not far from there.</span> <span id="s641">The church stood but in the middle where the shul stood is one little tree is growing.</span> <span id="s642">One tiny, little tree is growing.</span> <span id="s643">If I ever cried, that was the place.</span> <span id="s644">I cried, believe me, and I’m not a great -- but that’s where I cried because I remember that burning of that shul.</span> <span id="s645">This was such a beautiful edifice, it was the most magnificent thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Were you a religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: No, not so much.</span> <span id="s648">My mother used to light candles and we used to observe the holidays but my father didn’t go to shul too often.</span> <span id="s649">He went to shul only when a nice cantor came from some place, a big cantor.</span> <span id="s650">He loved to hear singing, cantorial.</span> <span id="s651">He, himself, liked to sing and I take that in my life to sing also</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Did you go to Hebrew school?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: No, but I had a teacher, a Hebrew teacher come in.</span> <span id="s654">We had, my brothers went to Cheder but I had a teacher come in, teaching me Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Let’s see.</span> <span id="s656">In some stuff I had read that in 1940 or ’41, a lot of refugees came into Bedzin.</span> <span id="s657">Do you remember anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: 1944.</span> <span id="s659">They came --.</span> <span id="s660">1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: 1940 to ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Yeah, they came in from Germany, a lot.</span> <span id="s663">Then they came in from the areas where the Germans took back from Russia.</span> <span id="s664">Where the Jews lived, the Owstuk and that whole eastern Poland area where the Jews did not escape into Russia.</span> <span id="s665">Where they remained, the ones that weren’t killed because most of them were killed right then and there.</span> <span id="s666">They self-dug pits, they were machine gunned.</span> <span id="s667">But the ones that escaped, a lot of them came back.</span> <span id="s668">That’s when my father came back.</span> <span id="s669">That was -41, they came back from the east.</span> <span id="s670">A lot of them came in, came to us because Bedzin was a Jewish town.</span> <span id="s671">They found shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: There were a couple of deportations of thousands to Auschwitz</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Every day, every day were deportations, every day.</span> <span id="s674">Every day they marched people to the trains.</span> <span id="s675">But I don’t know how we remained until 1943.</span> <span id="s676">I think my mother, my mother worked.</span> <span id="s677">She had some kind of a -- like a protection because she worked in a hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Did she work all the time, like when you were growing up also?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s680">But the Germans made everybody work.</span> <span id="s681">She worked in a hospital during the war.</span> <span id="s682">I and my brother next to me also had to work.</span> <span id="s683">We worked in a factory of leather pocketbooks, how do you call, cases, leather cases, we used to work.</span> <span id="s684">The two little ones --.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: This was from early on, when the Germans first came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Yeah, we had to work.</span> <span id="s687">The two little ones, I had like a three-year-old and a five-year-old little one, a sister five-year-old, three-year-old brother, they were left alone home.</span> <span id="s688">We had to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: So there were four children altogether?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Five.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Five children?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: The two brothers and I had to -- they were young but we had to go to work.</span> <span id="s693">That’s how we remained, we were working like we showed that we are productive so we worked and we stayed on.</span> <span id="s694">They knew that they’ll get us eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: What about the forming of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s696">That was like in early ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Forty-three, no, ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Forty-two.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Forty-two, end of ’42.</span> <span id="s700">Forty-three, maybe in the beginning they put everybody and I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s701">Maybe they put everybody there but little by day, they eliminate every day, every day transports went away.</span> <span id="s702">They eliminated -- most men, young men and young women were sent to labor camps.</span> <span id="s703">Families with children were, mothers with children, grandmothers, were going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s704">From our area, everybody went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s705">Because it was only like, I think 30 kilometers from Bedzin.</span> <span id="s706">Was the closest.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: What was your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Balcia</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: B-a-l?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: B-a-l-c-i-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Was your father born in Bedzin?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: No, he was born in Olkusz.</span> <span id="s713">That’s where we used to go, summer resort.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s715">How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: O-l-k-u-s-z.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Do you know the date of his birth, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: I know only 1906.</span> <span id="s719">My mother also, 1906.</span> <span id="s720">By the way, I didn’t tell you a very interesting story.</span> <span id="s721">Five years ago, I thought I’m all alone, I don’t have anybody, not a cousin, nobody.</span> <span id="s722">I had a family, my aunt, one of my mother’s sisters, went to Russia in 1939, ’40.</span> <span id="s723">What happened to her is -- she had four children, this aunt.</span> <span id="s724">She lived in Kartavitsa.</span> <span id="s725">Her husband was taken into the Polish army at the same time that my father was taken in.</span> <span id="s726">He, when the Germans were pushing the Polish soldiers back, he lived in Kartavitsa which is almost on the German border.</span> <span id="s727">I don’t know what happened; he got himself lost from his company or what.</span> <span id="s728">He started marching back to Kartavitsa with his shoes on -- with his uniform -- I don’t know, he got lost.</span> <span id="s729">He was going in that direction to Kartavitsa.</span> <span id="s730">A Polish officer saw him and he shot him, killed him.</span> <span id="s731">While he was laying there, he was dying, he was telling the peasants that came around, he says, my wife, I have here my address wallet.</span> <span id="s732">They did come and they told her.</span> <span id="s733">She buried him.</span> <span id="s734">She took the children and she went to Russia.</span> <span id="s735">It was right in the beginning, she went to Russia.</span> <span id="s736">I knew about that.</span> <span id="s737">I was a young kid, I was only 12 years old but I remember it.</span> <span id="s738">After the war, couldn’t find them -- thought they died.</span> <span id="s739">A lot of people died in Russia.</span> <span id="s740">But five years ago, I went to a wedding.</span> <span id="s741">I’m sitting there with a woman and we started talking and she asked me from where are you?</span> <span id="s742">I said I’m from Bedzin.</span> <span id="s743">I ask her.</span> <span id="s744">She says I’m from Kartavitsa.</span> <span id="s745">I says Kartavitsa, I had family in Kartavitsa.</span> <span id="s746">She says what was their names.</span> <span id="s747">I said their name happened to be Boshnitza.</span> <span id="s748">She says Boshnitza, I know Boshnitzas in Israel.</span> <span id="s749">She says, my sister lives in Haifa and she has a store and she has Boshnitzas coming right into the store.</span> <span id="s750">I know she deals with people Boshnitza.</span> <span id="s751">I says maybe it’s different people, maybe it’s not those Boshnitzas.</span> <span id="s752">She says to me, I’ll find out for you.</span> <span id="s753">That same evening, she called me back and she asked me the names.</span> <span id="s754">I remembered the names.</span> <span id="s755">Sure enough, it was these Boshnitzas, the children were still alive.</span> <span id="s756">There were two girls, and two men and two women.</span> <span id="s757">They were children at the time.</span> <span id="s758">They were younger than we were.</span> <span id="s759">I met these cousins but it was a very -- the meeting is just also -- beyond how we met.</span> <span id="s760">Because when I called him, he couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s761">He thought somebody’s playing a game with him.</span> <span id="s762">After all these years!</span> <span id="s763">I says look, my mother’s name, I gave my mother’s name, my father’s name, don’t be afraid.</span> <span id="s764">I think you are my cousin, I said.</span> <span id="s765">Sure enough, he started crying also.</span> <span id="s766">He says, you know I have so many people sometimes calling me and telling me that and then I’m disappointed.</span> <span id="s767">So anyway I met this uncle that I met with my father in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: He was at that time 92 years old but he recognized me.</span> <span id="s770">He was living with one of my cousins because he lost his whole family.</span> <span id="s771">But he remarried and his wife, already second wife had died.</span> <span id="s772">He was living, an old, old man, living with one of those cousins.</span> <span id="s773">He recognized me and he asked me.</span> <span id="s774">He says, he told me about my father, how he remembered my father was with him and how he met me.</span> <span id="s775">Ninety-two years old.</span> <span id="s776">He lived then and for a few years I had the pleasure of going --.</span> <span id="s777">He went into a home, a very fine home in Israel and we used to go visit him.</span> <span id="s778">His head -- his body was going but his head was so good.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Fid he know, did he know what happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: No, they lost ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: They were in camp together?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: They met in Seelotog in that camp, they met there.</span> <span id="s783">But then when they took them out, they lost each other.</span> <span id="s784">What happened that he survived and my father was a stronger man, was tall and he was stronger and he didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s785">This uncle was a little guy but he survived.</span> <span id="s786">So I have these cousins, I have these four cousins.</span> <span id="s787">But they are, one girl lost her -- both of her legs are dead, frozen in Russian and she is a cripple, one of them.</span> <span id="s788">She’s suffering but they’re doing okay.</span> <span id="s789">I keep in contact with them and they always call me and I call them.</span> <span id="s790">It gives me a good feeling.</span> <span id="s791">After all these years.</span> <span id="s792">This just happened, just five years ago and I was looking for them.</span> <span id="s793">I looked everywhere.</span> <span id="s794">This is my story.</span> <span id="s795">Life goes on as they say, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Yes, it does.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: I hope that this will never, never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s799">PAGE 1</span></p></body></html>
