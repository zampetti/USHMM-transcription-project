Leszno, and I lived there until the war broke out.</span> <span id="s38">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: I have two brothers and a cousin, whom I call my first brother, because his mother, who is my aunt, my mother’s sister, died of tuberculosis in 19 – beginning of 1942.</span> <span id="s41">But I was raised with him.</span> <span id="s42">He is, I think, almost a year older than I am, and we were brought up together by my mother and my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Was – were your brothers older than

id="s51">Tell me a little bit about your parents.</span> <span id="s52">Who was your father, what was his name?</span> <span id="s53">The same for your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: My father Jusef(ph) Henry Zurczak was a teacher.</span> <span id="s55">He became an administrator, a masters’ schoolteacher, and he was also a violinist.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: And my mother was a teacher majoring in mathematics and physics.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Quite unusual for a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Well, she had difficulties –</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Did she?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: – with math when she started at, I think, the teachers’ sem – seminary in Leszno.</span> <span id="s62">And she got help.</span> <span id="s63">[indecipherable] f – from another teacher, someone who wanted to help her, saw that she was bright, but she was rather not too well.</span> <span id="s64">And it helped that she became one of the best students when she graduated five years later, so – and she loved math, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: That’s an inspiring –</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: – that’s an inspiring story, yeah.</span> <span id="s68">And when you – so if your parents were both teachers, were they very active in the community of students, and – and school activities, and – and things like that?</span> <span id="s69">Were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Yes, they were.</span> <span id="s71">Besides, both of my parents were scoutmasters.</span> <span id="s72">Actually, my mother was a scoutmaster of the youngest group, and she had only boys.</span> <span id="s73">She didn’t have – like girls very much.</span> <span id="s74">But my fa – and my – my father became a – a scout when he returned to Poland in 1920 or ’22.</span> <span id="s75">I don’t remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Did your father fight in the first World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: No.</span> <span id="s78">Both of my parents were born outside of Poland.</span> <span id="s79">My father was born in Garnisonkirche, and then they moved to Dortmund, upper part of Germany, and my mother was born in Helma(ph) Wiesbaden –</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: So their –</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: – the northwest part of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Did you have German family, or German roots?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No, because during the partition of Poland, that part of Poland was part of Prussia.</span> <span id="s84">So they were taken – my grandparents were taken out of Poland to work, and my grandmother, my mother’s parents were taken to Wiesbaden because my grandfather was a forester and they needed someone to work there.</span> <span id="s85">And both he and my grand – my grandmother worked together.</span> <span id="s86">She took the administration under her hands, apparently that’s where my mother got these mathematical – i-it – influence.</span> <span id="s87">And my father took care of the – the forestry, the cutting and the taking care of and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: So they must have been bilingual.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: They must have spoken German as well as Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Except that my grandfather, my maternal grandfather came from a family that, before the first World War, and I think it was at the middle of 19th century, they met – my [indecipherable] through Turkey from Macedonia, and through the – through the Carpathian mountains, came to Silesia, Shlunsk, and then – and – but my mo – my grandmother was from Vierkapolska(ph), the up [indecipherable] Poland.</span> <span id="s94">So somehow they – the families arranged it.</span> <span id="s95">He was dark, tall, my grandmother was blue eyed with very light blonde hair, and also tall.</span> <span id="s96">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: And on your father’s side of the family, how did – how did they end up, it was Garnisonkirchen(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Garnisonkirche, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: My grandfather was a cobbler.</span> <span id="s101">He designed shoes and he was a very good cobbler because not only the Polish army, but later on the German army ordered the officers’ high boots to be –</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: From him?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: – from him.</span> <span id="s104">They brought the materials and two soldiers always watched the staircase, and sat there.</span> <span id="s105">He worked sometimes 12 - 20 hours, in order to finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And this was during the second World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: During the second World War, but during the first World War, he was in Garnisonkirche.</span> <span id="s108">He – I don’t know if he had interest, or he wanted to – not to abandon the – the – the Polish immigrants that were taken to – ba – by the Prussians to Germany.</span> <span id="s109">He received a permission to teach them religion.</span> <span id="s110">They gave him only the first part of the Bible, the Old Testament, written in old Polish.</span> <span id="s111">And for one hour on Sunday, he taught them the language, based on the Bible.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Isn’t that interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Ah, but also he worked in the underground, because he was working with the Polish workers, and they wanted to – they were fighting for their own rights, in order to receive proper payment, and to be properly treated.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: And this is in Garnisonkirche?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: And this is in Garnisonkirche, but somehow I think somebody –</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Informed on him?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: – informed on him, and he was told that the best part would be if he left – moved northwest, so he – they went to north Dortmund.</span> <span id="s118">And from there on he promised himself that he will not return to Poland until Poland had a government.</span> <span id="s119">The government was established in 1922, so I believe that it took them almost two years to travel back.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: It’s not such a long distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: So clearly these are stories you must have heard growing up, from either your parents or your grandparents.</span> <span id="s125">Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Oh yes, Jaja(ph) would always t-tell me – my father’s father was also named Jusef(ph), and he would – I loved stories.</span> <span id="s127">Apparently I was the only girl at that time.</span> <span id="s128">I had 11 cousins, including my brothers and my cousin and I was the only girl in that age.</span> <span id="s129">I had cousins, girls, but they were older, much older than I was, about 10 - 12 years old.</span> <span id="s130">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Well, that makes you quite special.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: But I played with them, and when they were quarreling, they always said, okay, we have to have a general.</span> <span id="s133">Who is going to be the general?</span> <span id="s134">They pointed at me because I was the only girl.</span> <span id="s135">Would I quarrel with anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s137">So, tell me a – a little bit about what happened to your family on September 1st, 1939, when Germany attacked Poland.</span> <span id="s138">You were a baby, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Yes, I was a baby, but my mother told me.</span> <span id="s140">My father was in the army.</span> <span id="s141">He was already out of Poland, he was actually in the – on the border, Poland – Poland and Germany, past river Oder, because we lived between Warta and Oder.</span> <span id="s142">And my mother told me that September 1st, 1931, we became one of the first Reich – the Third Reich of Germany, the Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: The [indecipherable] 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: – nine – yes, 1939, we became the Third Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So it was very quick, very quick.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes, because it was about 30 – 30 or 40 kilometers past Oder to the town of Kościan, that – it was not very far.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: They just walked in and marched to Poznań.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: And what happened to her and you and – what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: My mother – my father was in the army, called in August that he should come for to serve in the reserves, but then – well, he was a second lieutenant, being a teacher and a musician.</span> <span id="s151">So, he had the right to be called frontow(ph), right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: And Mother tried to move closer to her mother, who lived in Kościan, which was northwest of Poznań, and about 30 kilometers northwest of – of Leszno.</span> <span id="s154">And we were right – few kilometers south.</span> <span id="s155">But she told me that she moved from town to town, zigzagging back and forth until she reached Kościan, because it was – she was already pregnant with my brother Andrew.</span> <span id="s156">But she reached Kościan and lived with my mother and her ailing sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: That is with your grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yes, with my grandmother, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: And what happened with your father?</span> <span id="s160">A: My father was caught in an ambush in – in the forest behind – around Oder, and that part of the regiment was practically annihilated.</span> <span id="s161">He was shot, was wounded.</span> <span id="s162">Those that were caught, which were about 10 – he said about 10, maybe 15 people, but no more, cause some of them were very wounded, but were alive.</span> <span id="s163">They took them, but he passed out apparently, and after two days, the German patrol was walking with dogs, and they stopped where he was lying, and the dogs know if somebody is gone or alive.</span> <span id="s164">And when they searched him they saw my father’s army registration ca-card, a teacher’s card, and that he was born in Germany, so they took him for one of his – one of their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: So he wasn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: They took him to Germany, they took him to a German hospital, and he, after a month, he came, he was well enough to speak, and he was interrogated.</span> <span id="s167">And my father said, I am not a German, I am a Pole.</span> <span id="s168">I was taken – I was born in Germany because my parents were taken there.</span> <span id="s169">This was during the part o – Prussian partition.</span> <span id="s170">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: And so what happened to –</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: – then he was – when he came through, they – because my father, being an officer, he was taken to Murnau, which is Bavaria, to a [indecipherable] camp.</span> <span id="s173">That camp was a camp that was dedicated or – or protected by Himmel(ph).</span> <span id="s174">And it was a camp to show off how the Germans treat Polish officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: So it was sort of like a show camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s177">When there was no visitation, they would treat it like any other – well, somebody – a prisoner.</span> <span id="s178">And, I mean, they had to scrape food.</span> <span id="s179">My father liked to cook, and everybody knew this, so he sometimes actually – I said – he said, I talked at the wrong time and was sent back to the –</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: The kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: – kitchen, yes, the ki – the kitchen.</span> <span id="s182">And he said there, at least, I could s – I could scrape off the – the peeling – peeling the potatoes, I could as – I could scrape the – th-the peels and – and save it and then cook it behind the barrack, or underneath the bed, or – or so what – or whatever.</span> <span id="s183">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: So in other words, it was a show camp only sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s186">They had an orchestra, he played in a co – a symphony.</span> <span id="s187">There was a theater, there were – they had lectures, because there were quite – many professors.</span> <span id="s188">Polish officers and intelligentsia were sent there.</span> <span id="s189">So – and he stayed there til the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: When an American general was passing by, he opened – my father was right on guard at that time by the – by the gates.</span> <span id="s192">He opened, and he – that’s where my father learned some English, cause they wanted to show off that you could take English, you could take French, other – to improve yourself, to show off that you – that – that the Germans were treating them properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: And so that’s why he could practice his English</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s195">And when he said, open the door, my father said, that was the first command of a different voice asking.</span> <span id="s196">I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s197">But he said open the door, and he showed them what to do.</span> <span id="s198">So the other fellow who was with him, they opened the gates, and he went through, all around.</span> <span id="s199">And said, you, where is your family, do you have a family?</span> <span id="s200">And – and he said, my wife and children are in – in Nordhorn, in northern part – northeastern part of – of Germany, right next to the Holland border.</span> <span id="s201">So he said, I’m going to Munich, hop in.</span> <span id="s202">And one – as my father hopped into the sidecar of the motorcycle, he hurt his leg.</span> <span id="s203">By the time they got to Munich, my father was collapsing.</span> <span id="s204">He had a cut on his right leg, and he already had poison.</span> <span id="s205">So they kept him there.</span> <span id="s206">But my father had a letter from my mother, who could write to my dad in Murnau only three times a – every year – every quarter, she could.</span> <span id="s207">Every four months she could write a letter.</span> <span id="s208">And she wrote to him that we are in Nordhorn.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: So that’s in the northwestern part of Germany, if it’s close to the Dutch border –</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Border, na – yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: – northwestern part of Germany, right.</span> <span id="s213">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: And – and so he’s liberated by an American general.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: By an American general, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: And he left him there because the – because he – my dad needed –</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Medical attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: – med-medical attention, and this was sometimes in beginning of May, and we didn’t see him til a month and a half later, when he came to Lingen(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: So for all intents and purposes, your father was – survived the war, but he was out of the picture –</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: – as far as your life was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: You – did you remember anything of him in your first years, or is the first time you remember seeing him, is that month and a half later, when he shows up?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: I didn’t – I knew only my father from the photograph that was standing on – on the the table, on the side table at home.</span> <span id="s226">And in-in-in the place where my grandmother lived, and when I saw him, as an almost seven year old child, I looked and I said, that is not my father.</span> <span id="s227">My father was a handsome man, with a bushy hair.</span> <span id="s228">This is a sick man, this is – cause when I saw him in Lingen(ph) in 1945 in July, I saw a man bent over, grayish hair and – and his face was grayish, it – he looked like he just came out of a tomb.</span> <span id="s229">He could barely walk, he was so weak.</span> <span id="s230">So, it was at – that’s the first time I heard him, after all these – after six years of not seeing him.</span> <span id="s231">Cause I was a year old when he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: When he was gone, and I did not see him before.</span> <span id="s234">But we, my mother and I, we stayed in – in Kościan.</span> <span id="s235">It’s through June of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: So you were there for five – five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: And your – and your first brother was then born –</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: In 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s242">He was almost four years old when we were taken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s244">Was your – was your mother able to write to your father?</span> <span id="s245">Did she find out, did she know he was in this prisoner of war camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: She found out through his – through his parents, who lived in the same city.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: My – yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: – my – the Zurczak family lived Kościan.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: And – and my father – my grandfather was the – was the shoemaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Ah, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: But – but what happened is that my mother was notified by her father-in-law where Jusef(ph) is and that she can only write once every four months to him.</span> <span id="s255">And so they – so that they, many times – my mother taught me that she would put her letter with their letter, in order to make certain that it gets there.</span> <span id="s256">So my father sa – had some letters when he came in 1944, when he appeared, because he kept certain letters.</span> <span id="s257">But certain letters, I’ve noticed that it was only my dear, or my beloved, and everything was blacked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Only he would – and [indecipherable] I’m kissing you [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s260">That was all, because whatever he wrote in it, was apparently unacceptable.</span> <span id="s261">So somebo – all the letters were read through before they went to the – to the people, on both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Did he know that he had a son?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yes, yes, and he knew –</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: And so they let information through.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yes, yes, that info – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s267">And did you see much of your father’s parents, as in those first years?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Because we lived – he li – they lived behan – be – further from us, where the town square was, and a pond where beautiful white swans san – swam.</span> <span id="s271">And I enjoyed the swans.</span> <span id="s272">It was – I always ask my mother, please can I go to the market and buy – she says, but you’re only four years old.</span> <span id="s273">I said, Mama, I want to go and see Grandpa, but I want to also see the swans.</span> <span id="s274">And I would always have a few crumbs of my bread left for them so I could –</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Feed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: – and they would – yes, and feed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: But we – we visited them quite often, as was allowed.</span> <span id="s279">We could not visit them during air raids, or when the soldiers were marching, practicing something like that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Was the town full of German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s282">We lived right across in a house, only in one room on the third floor – well, I mean, I – European would be second floor.</span> <span id="s283">But across the – the palace, which once belonged to my father’s great-grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: And well, unfortunately, the SS cavalry occupied that.</span> <span id="s286">So – so we were very, very watched.</span> <span id="s287">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: You were watched because of that family connection?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: That I don’t know.</span> <span id="s290">We were watched because my fa – my father being in Murdenau(ph), an officer, and they did not like my mother, who did not look very Polish.</span> <span id="s291">My mother was dark skinned, with pitch black hair and dark eyes.</span> <span id="s292">Slim.</span> <span id="s293">And she was petite, and they always called her – she had a name, of the black crow, they called her.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: The back cr – the black crow.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: The black crow.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s298">And my mother, my brother and I were witnesses.</span> <span id="s299">Three times she was called.</span> <span id="s300">She rece – received a notice that she has to show up at the wall of the square where many executions took place, and th – the family, her family, that means my grandmother, my cousin and the two of us had to go and witness.</span> <span id="s301">And of course, most of the people were there too, witnessing who was being –</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: – executed.</span> <span id="s304">And they always left my mother til the end.</span> <span id="s305">My mother was al – and I remember her, she was always dressed in a black skirt, black shoes, black stockings, a white blouse, and she would walk in, and when they went to put the – close her eyes, put the band on her eyes, she says, I don’t need it.</span> <span id="s306">And then they would get ready, and the commander would come in and say, not today, black crow.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: So this was a mock execution of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s309">My – my mother was – when they, of course, was over, the commands were given, the SS left, the people were looking around, they said, oh, next time again.</span> <span id="s310">Next time again.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: And so you –</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: So three times, it was 1943, and 1944 was the last time.</span> <span id="s313">I think it was in – right after Easter, which was April.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And you’re a five year old child?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I was five and a half.</span> <span id="s316">I was waiting – September wa – in ’44 was going to be my sixth birthday.</span> <span id="s317">I mean, not – not September, Au-August 23rd was going to be my next birthday, when I would be six years old.</span> <span id="s318">But at the age of four, I knew how to read, how to count, and how to write.</span> <span id="s319">And when somebody says, how do you know what kind of a book is this, or what paper this is, I say, in Polish [speaks Polish] It had to rhyme, I don’t know why, because I – my mother always said, we’re going to Jaja(ph), or we’re going to Babcia for their birthday or their Imieniny, their name day.</span> <span id="s320">And Jola, you have to learn how to say another poem.</span> <span id="s321">So I had to learn this.</span> <span id="s322">And I said, why do you read to me?</span> <span id="s323">I know how to read.</span> <span id="s324">Babcia told me, this is this, this is that, and I – what does a child do when you cannot get out of the house because of the air raids?</span> <span id="s325">And even if we wanted to get out, we could only go up on our street, in front of the house.</span> <span id="s326">And watch out because when the alarm struck, everybody had to be inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: And there were lots of air raids?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Oh, rot – lots, lots.</span> <span id="s329">Especially – I remember those in ’43, and ’44, quite well.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Well, you know, one of my questions is, what is your earliest memory.</span> <span id="s331">But your – whatever your earliest memories would be, they are during wartime.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Because, if you’re a baby when the war starts –</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: So, are your earliest memories connected to the war, or are they some –</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yes, just – just to the war.</span> <span id="s339">I remember that the first memory that I have is when we were totally isolated from the bedroom of my cousins, from his mother, who was dying of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s340">And in that room was a wind – veranda window, glass, that you – you know, there were shades that you could close and open.</span> <span id="s341">Why we were there, don’t ask me, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s342">Nobody ever told me this.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Or maybe they told me, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s345">This was 1942, so I was barely four years old.</span> <span id="s346">And I was always afraid to go to that room, because there was – one wall was the glass, the opposite wall was composite of doors.</span> <span id="s347">And later on I found out that books were on one side, and a wardrobe was on the other side.</span> <span id="s348">But somebody took something out of it and left a black strip of a – I don’t know, maybe of a – a sash, or something, but it was looking at me.</span> <span id="s349">And when that black sash disappeared, I said she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: And were you right?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s352">Because I told my mother this.</span> <span id="s353">And on that night, or day, she died.</span> <span id="s354">But I think – I don’t remember to be a child.</span> <span id="s355">I always had to take care of one boy, and the other on the other hand.</span> <span id="s356">My p – my brother Andrew was on the right side, and Izbisznik(ph) was on the left said.</span> <span id="s357">He was older, but he missed his mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: And I think boys are more babies in the – when they’re younger, they, I’m not sure a little bit later.</span> <span id="s360">Not all, but some do.</span> <span id="s361">But most of them do.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: But he was alone.</span> <span id="s363">He was alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Yes, he was – he was very much alone, and – and if he didn’t get what he wanted, he – his father oh, by the way, his father was a prisoner of war, taken for labor.</span> <span id="s365">He was in Poland, then he was taken to Germany, and then I heard that he went outside, was he in Holland, or was he in denya – Denmark, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: But they were – people were talking.</span> <span id="s368">This – this I remember at many times Grandma says, oh, Franek(ph) is there again.</span> <span id="s369">Or he is moved again.</span> <span id="s370">But – but my cousin was very – he was very attached to his mother, and to grandmother.</span> <span id="s371">If he didn’t like something, he would lay on the floor and have a tantrum.</span> <span id="s372">Only my mother could tell him, Izbiszu(ph), get up.</span> <span id="s373">You’re not going to get anything to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: So, why – she was targeted – your mother was targeted by the authorities, the Nazi authorities because she was dark, or because she was an officer’s wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: No, they just didn’t like her, because my mother looked too –</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Mediterranean.</span> <span id="s378">Yes, too Jewish, yes.</span> <span id="s379">And lot of people that – remember I said my grandfather, her father was of a Macedonian heritage.</span> <span id="s380">So naturally he was dark, black hair and slightly slanted eyes.</span> <span id="s381">One of my brothers has that feature.</span> <span id="s382">So – and my mother would not step by.</span> <span id="s383">But the last time, when she was taken to the execution square, as we called it, something happened.</span> <span id="s384">And my mother told me she just – she had enough, because he offended her.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: The officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: The Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Th-The – he o – he off – offended her and she just – she’s, I couldn’t stand it any more, and I spit straight in his face.</span> <span id="s389">He took – that I remember, he took his big glove and slapped my mother and she fell on the ground.</span> <span id="s390">There were – it was rubble there, and I know that she had a wound someplace on the side of the head, because ther – the blouse was stained, and we were all crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: So he would really – he ordered all of you children to watch as if –</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: – your mother is going to be shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Mm-hm, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s395">My mother refused to sign aus – that she was a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Oh, she refused to sign that she was an ethnic German.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Volksdeutsche.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Vo-Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s400">She refused to do this.</span> <span id="s401">She said, I was an Ausländer in Germany, born there, but I am not German.</span> <span id="s402">So what were you doing in Herna(ph)?</span> <span id="s403">And she never wanted to sign anything else in the formula, that she would have the papers, that she – she was told, if you sign an Gott glauben, that means –</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: To believe in God.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: – believe in God – in God, not zhem(ph) cat(ph), that means Roman Catholic, you’ll be fine.</span> <span id="s406">They’ll leave you alone.</span> <span id="s407">My mother refused that.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: So, in other words, she could si – if she would refuse – if she would accept to sign that she believes in God, but she’s not a Roman Catholic –</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: – that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: And if she would sign that she is a –</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Volksdeutsche.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yes, that she’s a Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s414">No.</span> <span id="s415">My mother said no, I’d rather die.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: And the German officer, do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: No, I don’t – not remember.</span> <span id="s420">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: How did – how did she feed you during those years, cause your father’s gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: My mother was given a choice.</span> <span id="s423">She could not teach, all the schools were closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: She could either work by regulating the riverbanks.</span> <span id="s426">That was very hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Physical work.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Physical work.</span> <span id="s429">Or work in a ammunition factory, which was organized by the Germans int – in the tobacco factory.</span> <span id="s430">Course Poznań was known for its production of tobacco.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: So it –</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: So she was –</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: – the tobacco factory had been reorganized into a munitions factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Right.</span> <span id="s435">So she worked in the ammunition.</span> <span id="s436">She took – she preferred to take that, because she would not be able to – she was too weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Too little.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Too little, and I mean, to dig, shovel all that glop outside, and no.</span> <span id="s439">So she was paid certain amount of money for that.</span> <span id="s440">She – we knew that, you know, you can purchase for 10 pfennigs, you can buy a day old, two day old loaf of bread, which was much better, more nutrition – more nutritional than – than a fresh bread, because it tasted fine, you know, much better than the old bread.</span> <span id="s441">But it was gone very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: And many times I was the one that would go.</span> <span id="s444">And I remember, I was maybe four and a half or so, and I would go.</span> <span id="s445">It was not far away, a street away from the place where we lived.</span> <span id="s446">There was a bakery, and everybody knew me, because I always had a nice bow in my hair up here, cause that’s – I said, I am going out.</span> <span id="s447">Grandma always put her best dress when she goes to church and when she goes shopping, so I have to be dressed properly, too.</span> <span id="s448">So I went there, and the ladies liked me.</span> <span id="s449">And that’s the only place – if there was no German person, or a young person who was maybe –</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: From the – right.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: – from the other side, we could speak Polish.</span> <span id="s452">Otherwise it was all in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: So in –</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: I didn’t realize that I was speaking two different languages.</span> <span id="s457">It came to me only later.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: So in public life, in – in Kościan –</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Kościan.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Kościan.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Kościan.</span> <span id="s462">In German it’s called Kosten.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Kosten.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Kościan.</span> <span id="s466">So in public life there, you could not speak Polish, you had to speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: When you’re out on the streets, when you’re –</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: – you know, in public.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: I didn’t realize that.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: I didn’t realize that.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Besides, there was always somebody walking on the street, a gendarme of this kind or of that kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Did Kościan have a large German population before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: There were quite many Germans, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Were there Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: That I don’t know.</span> <span id="s480">There were Jews, because my father – my grandfather said that his tailor, he would make shoes for him, he would make –</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Clothes for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: – clothes for him, yes, and for his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: So they would exchange their services.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: So they – they were – they were ex-exchange.</span> <span id="s485">If they left – there must have been, because there were certain – certain shops and my mother went to school with girls who were Jewish, to the teachers’ seminary, where she was at le – when she lived in Kościan, she would take a train from Kościan to Leszno, and she said, we never saw any difference, we were all Poles.</span> <span id="s486">Because you were born in Poland, so you were – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: By the time you were walking the streets as a little girl, do you – I mean, let me rephrase that.</span> <span id="s488">By the time you were old enough to go out and to this bakery –</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: – were there any Jews left in this village?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: That I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s494">Because Kościan actually was a town.</span> <span id="s495">It was an old town, it had one of known churches called Fara(ph), which was because there was a higher – and my grandmother was kept once.</span> <span id="s496">She went to church on Sunday, we did not see her for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: They were looking for someone who was carrying information papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Und – from the underground.</span> <span id="s501">And you know how women – my grandmother liked to go to church on Sunday.</span> <span id="s502">Wa – I never knew why, she only told me when she came to the United States in 1960, when my mother brought her to live here with us.</span> <span id="s503">She said, I always wore my – my original garb.</span> <span id="s504">Long skirt, with three underskirts, and I always had a shawl on my shoulders.</span> <span id="s505">And only – there were only a few pews in the front, and the rest was just benches, or people stood, or people sat on – on – well, on stones, or on little stools, or something like this.</span> <span id="s506">And my mother was not surprised that Grandma didn’t come after the evening prayers.</span> <span id="s507">But she didn’t come in after 10 o’clock.</span> <span id="s508">And then somebody knocked on the doors, and that I remember, because that must have been about 40 – end of ’44, or 40 f – or – or – no, not – yes, end of ’44 or beginning of ’45.</span> <span id="s509">And said, Manya, Babcia nie przyjdzie.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: What’s that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Grandma will not come.</span> <span id="s512">Where is she?</span> <span id="s513">The Fara(ph) is closed.</span> <span id="s514">And only afterwards, when Grandpa – Grandma came to America in 1960, I asked her, I said, could you tell me what happened?</span> <span id="s515">You were always so avoiding – you were trying to avoid the – the issue.</span> <span id="s516">When I ask, what were you doing?</span> <span id="s517">Why wouldn’t this woman come in?</span> <span id="s518">Because she escaped.</span> <span id="s519">How?</span> <span id="s520">Well, you know, she knows this gendarme or that gendarme and she knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s521">She felt bad that your mother will worry about her, there are three children here and she has to go to work.</span> <span id="s522">And we stayed together with my – I went to pick up the milk in the milk can from the gentleman that was delivering milk on the corner.</span> <span id="s523">I would pick that up, and I would go to the bakery with the 20 pfennigs or 10 pfennigs, whatever my mother left me, and feed th-the – the boys, and – and – and then we would stay inside, we would not go out.</span> <span id="s524">She says, you are to not leave the house.</span> <span id="s525">Do not open any doors, any windows.</span> <span id="s526">Stay in.</span> <span id="s527">And then grandmother came in.</span> <span id="s528">Apparently there was somebody.</span> <span id="s529">She told me.</span> <span id="s530">She says, he hid under our skirts.</span> <span id="s531">I was always praying that he would – whatever, the policeman didn’t stop me, didn’t tell me to get up.</span> <span id="s532">And he says, my legs were going like this, because what would I do?</span> <span id="s533">He was under my skirt at that moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: So, if I –</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: – understood the si – the story is, is that people were in church.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Your grandmother was there as – you know, she had ties to the resistance, and this was part of the activity is that she was helping to hide somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: And one of the ladies in the church with her was allowed to leave it because she was friendly with the guards.</span> <span id="s541">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: The girl.</span> <span id="s543">One of her – th-that she – my – my grandma-mother told me.</span> <span id="s544">She says, we just lined up, all of us.</span> <span id="s545">And why I don’t know, that all of the older women from the rosary society would sit down on that li – in that line.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: And, all of a sudden, she says, I realized that the eyes were moving like this, between them.</span> <span id="s548">While somebody was searching in front, or on the other side, they were going.</span> <span id="s549">And she says, and we knew – and then I felt something under my feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: And it was person.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: It ma – it was a person.</span> <span id="s552">And he was carrying some information –</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Underground – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: – underground paper,

doors, and let people out.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: But they kept them there for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And in the meantime, during those three days, this young girl was allowed to leave because she knew one of the guards.</span> <span id="s562">And she went to your mother’s home and said she’s not coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: – and she went to the other people to – especially –</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: To let them know.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: – to let them know that yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Okay, okay, now I understand.</span> <span id="s569">Now I understand.</span> <span id="s570">What a fearful childhood.</span> <span id="s571">What a f – you know, just –</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: I didn’t think of a f – of being – I was scared only because I did not like to stay when it was very dark, because we could not keep the lights on – besides, lights went off around nine or 10 o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s574">So it was rationed.</span> <span id="s575">Electricity was rationed.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s577">Everything –</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: A curfew –</span></p> <p><span

id="s581">I mean, two o’clock in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Because they had to work.</span> <span id="s584">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Did you feel – what was your feeling within the house?</span> <span id="s586">Did you feel safe within the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s588">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s591">Grandma would have – read to us books.</span> <span id="s592">I did not see Polish books.</span> <span id="s593">She had Grimms’ stories, Anderson’s stories, children’s stories, all written in German, and she would read to us.</span> <span id="s594">Actually she was reading German, and talk – saying – reading it in Polish to us so we would understand.</span> <span id="s595">So my – my two brothers would understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s596">They said, why these funny names?</span> <span id="s597">But you know, it was – but – but I loved stories, I loved when she read, and then she would of course tell us.</span> <span id="s598">And when my mother would go to my father’s parents, we would – she would not always take us with her.</span> <span id="s599">We would sit, and we would say the rosary, or we would sing, and she liked to sing.</span> <span id="s600">So, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Did you have any other friends, or was it a really closed world.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: It was a closed world.</span> <span id="s603">I only remembered my – I remember my – one of my cousins, my father’s second older sister, Stanisłava, she had two daughters, and I really – Mearka(ph) and what was the other one?</span> <span id="s604">I correspond with her.</span> <span id="s605">It’ll come back to me.</span> <span id="s606">And she cr – Mearka(ph) was my friend, and the – and she had an older sister.</span> <span id="s607">She was already 16 or so.</span> <span id="s608">But they lived – they didn’t live in that town, they lived someplace else.</span> <span id="s609">So she was the only person that I saw.</span> <span id="s610">She didn’t come to our house, we always see – saw her in my grandparents’ house.</span> <span id="s611">But the only time I saw other children would – when we went to my grandmother’s – maternal grandmother – to Rattzot(ph), which was 70 kilometers away from Kościan, and this was going through a large forest.</span> <span id="s612">It was cobblestones, those were huge stones, the old – and when I – that – I always loved to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Must have been pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Oh, not only this, it’s the smell of the forest, the – the vegetation.</span> <span id="s615">I-I could pick up the bluebells and – and during summertime pick up the blueberries and – and raspberries, because, you know, it was – this was an original forest, and I could pick up all the – all – oh, anything that I wanted, you know, of di – of – of vegetation.</span> <span id="s616">It – it was – I loved to do this.</span> <span id="s617">Of course, we were very tired by time we hit the village, but it was fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: And you – you were free from all of those constraints.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: And that – that was the only place where I did not hear air raids, cause they were hitting star – tow – towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: So tell me, when your father is liberated in southern Germany, in Bavaria, by the American general, he even knows that you and your mother and maybe your brothers too, are near the Dutch border.</span> <span id="s623">What happened that you get from Kościan on the eastern side of Germany, to near the Dutch border on the western side of Germany, how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Because on June sixth of 1944, at two o’clock in the morning, the Gestapo came and told my mother, you have one hour.</span> <span id="s625">Take only necessary things, and we will – and we will take you to the train depot in Kościan.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: And so that meant your mother, or all of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: All of us.</span> <span id="s628">He didn’t say – he said all of us.</span> <span id="s629">And then we waited there, and waited.</span> <span id="s630">And in the morning, six o’clock, they told my grandmother that, you are not her family.</span> <span id="s631">What is your name?</span> <span id="s632">And my grandmother said, Meeshak(ph).</span> <span id="s633">And your daughter – my daughter is Zurczak.</span> <span id="s634">You can take Ratychuk(ph), your grandson, the younger grandson, and you can go home.</span> <span id="s635">She went home, she cooked a bottle of pea soup, and brought it in a can, and this was our only meal that we had until we reached outside of Poznań, where were put into a transit camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: So – so it was you and your brother and your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: And – and my mother, right, right.</span> <span id="s638">And my mother was interrogated there for three days, who she was, why doesn’t she want to speak German.</span> <span id="s639">She says, I don’t speak German.</span> <span id="s640">But you were born in Germany, you had to learn German when you were in the seminary.</span> <span id="s641">She says, but I don’t speak German.</span> <span id="s642">She spoke – she actually spoke very poorly.</span> <span id="s643">She was very surprised that – as much as I could retain.</span> <span id="s644">And then after I became well, so I could – when I spoke, she opened her eyes, she says, Jola(ph), you speak German?</span> <span id="s645">Where did you learn this?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Where did you learn it?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: I said, I spoke it all the time, Grandma was reading in German.</span> <span id="s648">We had – you had to speak in German outside.</span> <span id="s649">Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: So Grandma –</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: – my grandparents spoke German.</span> <span id="s652">What do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: So your grandmother read to you from the Grimms’ fairy tales in both languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: In Polish and in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: She ti – yes, she wou – she would read it and translate it.</span> <span id="s657">Actually, when I finally got hold of – when I was already eight years old, and I knew the grammar of German – but speaking is one thing –</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: – but knowing the grammar.</span> <span id="s660">And I said, I remember this, I remember this, I remem – oh.</span> <span id="s661">So she wasn’t reading in Polish, she was reading in German.</span> <span id="s662">But she knew it so –</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Well.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: – well, that she could retell the story in the oth – in our language.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s666">All right, so the Gestapo was interrogating your mother and keeping her for three days, and is angry with her because she refuses to a have any connection to anything German.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s668">That was in the transit camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: In Poznań.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Ou-Outside of Poznań, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: We were there til October 10th.</span> <span id="s673">We lived in barracks, like you would see barracks in Auschwitz, or wherever German camps were.</span> <span id="s674">And since she was an educated person, they must have known that she knows some German.</span> <span id="s675">But she had – in Poznań my parents had a friend who was of German extraction.</span> <span id="s676">He was born in Poznań, but his parents came to Poland, or one of them did –</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Volksdeutsche.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: No, they were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: They were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: They were Germans, but they became Polish citizens, because you could become a Polish citizen after you – well, that was the – you know, the – the second [indecipherable] that gave them the right.</span> <span id="s681">But his father was taken to a camp.</span> <span id="s682">He was – they never saw him when he was taken.</span> <span id="s683">He had a – like a cleaning outfit, but a large so – practically whole – all of Poznań knew who – who he was.</span> <span id="s684">And – but the son was a teacher, they had a daughter who was taken in as a – how – how do you say, as a – so they wouldn’t feel the persecution being Germans, she had to work in Berlin.</span> <span id="s685">A hostage, okay, like a hostage.</span> <span id="s686">She was allowed to come and visit her parents during certain holidays, and that was it.</span> <span id="s687">And she – her name was Dora and she would always come and visit my mother, or my mother would go – take the train and go to Poznań.</span> <span id="s688">And visit her.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: This is before she di – before she’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Before – be – be – be – before we were taken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s692">And when you say cleaning business, is that like a dry cleaning business?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Yes, yes, dry cleaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s695">Okay.</span> <span id="s696">And so, how does his life – how does – how does he intersect with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Because he was not well enough to be in the army, in the German army, because they were taken.</span> <span id="s698">He knew several languages.</span> <span id="s699">He knew French, he knew Polish, he knew German and maybe he knew English, that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s700">But he was a translator.</span> <span id="s701">And when my mother would be – would be called in t – for interrogation, he somehow, as she was passing by, he would tell her, ask for an interpreter.</span> <span id="s702">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s703">Because my mother told me this.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Because I would always ask her, I said, Mother, I can’t take it any more.</span> <span id="s706">I don’t know, he is – my brother is sick, he is hungry.</span> <span id="s707">Di – we had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s708">Now, what – what do I do?</span> <span id="s709">Don’t worry, Vouyek(ph), Janek(ph), Uncle John will come, and bring something.</span> <span id="s710">Because people from the outside could bring something, leave it at the –</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Gate.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: – gate, and – my mother sometimes received it, sometimes she didn’t get it, what he brought in.</span> <span id="s713">It was food, but one time I remember, and this is stuck in my mind, the Germans had a lot of dogs.</span> <span id="s714">And you know the gates, or – or the – it was barricaded, but it was iron barricade.</span> <span id="s715">The dogs would –</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Crawl underneath.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: – crawl underneath and make – and Uncle John called once.</span> <span id="s718">I saw him walking around, and my mother said, go with Anjay(ph), and take a walk.</span> <span id="s719">Because we had to walk, you know, in order for – for hygienic reasons.</span> <span id="s720">And she said, when he tells you to stop, and not look, turn around, and then he will disappear, you see what is there.</span> <span id="s721">Once he rolled in an orange.</span> <span id="s722">Who could get an orange?</span> <span id="s723">He must have gotten it from somebody, okay?</span> <span id="s724">And I don’t know what I did.</span> <span id="s725">My brother was playing ball, and the ball came to the – to the railing.</span> <span id="s726">And I think right there, I put my skir – that I remember, I put my skirt on top, and just did oh, Andrew, here is the ball.</span> <span id="s727">Meanwhile, while I was giving him the ball, the other hand took the orange, and I put it underneath, into my panties.</span> <span id="s728">And I came back, and of course, I walking like this.</span> <span id="s729">And an – and he said [speaks Polish] my stomach is hurting me.</span> <span id="s730">And my mother said, what are we going to do now?</span> <span id="s731">I said, can’t we eat this?</span> <span id="s732">But she said, you’re going to get all sick.</span> <span id="s733">But we ate it anyway, at night when everybody was sleeping, or so-called sleeping.</span> <span id="s734">Because you know, we – we slept, there were one, two, three –</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Communal.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: – yes.</span> <span id="s737">Four beds in a line, and you never knew who was what, bunkers, or something like that.</span> <span id="s738">But we stayed there four months.</span> <span id="s739">When the Red Army started – entered Auschwitz, all the German camps began to close.</span> <span id="s740">That – you can verify this –</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: – in – i-in – in – i-in books, or in – in reports.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: They started closing.</span> <span id="s745">When the opened Auschwitz, that was it.</span> <span id="s746">That’s why on the 10th of October, instead of standing every day from eight o’clock til one o’clock in the center of the – of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: A-Appellplatz?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: We had to stay there and wait, and if your number was called, that means you would go to your barrack, and somebody would be there, give you whatever.</span> <span id="s751">You had to go, take off your clothes.</span> <span id="s752">They would take you to a – as my mother called it, the washing machine.</span> <span id="s753">To a barrack where they were – we would – could take a shower.</span> <span id="s754">But my mother never allowed us to go alone.</span> <span id="s755">We were there only twice.</span> <span id="s756">Once when we came in and four months later.</span> <span id="s757">And on that day, in the morning, we were told to take our belongings and give all of ours clothing to be put through some kind of a disinfection, and we’re going to go to the barrack where everybody – can you imagine?</span> <span id="s758">All – all right, this was good thing.</span> <span id="s759">It was not very cold, but my brother was shaking, and he says, oh, woda, woda.</span> <span id="s760">He wanted waters, he wanted so badly to get a shower, or – or a tub or something.</span> <span id="s761">And my mother said no, we are going to stand in the longest corner, in the darkest corner of the barrack where the – the water is coming out.</span> <span id="s762">And you are not going to look at water.</span> <span id="s763">You are going to face your – she held our faces to her belly, and she would turn around when the water was coming out, because the water nas – was not only water.</span> <span id="s764">There was chlorine coming out, because it smelled awful.</span> <span id="s765">You cou – people were –</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Choking.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: – choking.</span> <span id="s768">And then it was hot water – I mean, there were people – I mean, this was decimation of people.</span> <span id="s769">We got out, thanks to our mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: So some didn’t make it out of there?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: I – I – my mother said, I don’t think that half, at least half didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s772">Because the older people were left, and were put away into incinerators, because they had incinerators there.</span> <span id="s773">Because when I went, 35 laters to Auschwitz in ’79, my husband wanted to see Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s774">I went there, and I walked in, and when I saw behind glass, piles of hair, shoes, teeth, I just felt sick.</span> <span id="s775">And I walked out, and I started to cry.</span> <span id="s776">And I said never, never, it’s – everything came back.</span> <span id="s777">I was six years old again.</span> <span id="s778">And I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Even though you weren’t in Auschwitz, even though this was in Poznań where this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s781">It – it was in a transit camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: But this came back, because we had the same things.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: And the pieces of that hard, squared bread, which was something wa – that was more than sawdust.</span> <span id="s786">But, you know, th-this – this I – I will never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: You were such a child –</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: And for many, many years, I would not touch dark bread, square dartch – dark bread.</span> <span id="s789">I could not take it.</span> <span id="s790">I would rather turn around instead of, you know, explain or make a face.</span> <span id="s791">No, no, it’s not good for me, and I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s792">Now I have to eat, because that’s part of my diet, but – and I got over it.</span> <span id="s793">But I will never go back to Auschwitz, never.</span> <span id="s794">Cause I don’t think I could face it.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: I can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s796">I can’t imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: I wa – I went to the holocaust museum last Saturday to see Karski exhibit, and I saw certain pictures and I just turned around and I said no, I – I cannot face it.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: You mean the one in Skokie?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: We were there several times.</span> <span id="s802">I went through the entire permanent exhibition of Auschwitz, Birkenau and – and Majdanek and others, pic – the pictures and – and artifacts that they had from those things.</span> <span id="s803">And I said no, I will not go there again.</span> <span id="s804">Not to that section.</span> <span id="s805">Bec –</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: What happened after – I’m sorry –</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: You wanted to say something?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: What happened after you left the room with your mother and the chlorophyll and the water, and everything like that.</span> <span id="s811">What did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: We were shoved – we were shoved through a corridor where there were racks, hot racks, where our clothes that we could – if it were ours, or not, you had to take whatever was there, and my mother knew which –</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Sizes?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: – this will – yes, this was fit you, this would fit Jandrek(ph), and you know, and so forth on.</span> <span id="s815">And we would put that clothes on, and we were – our bags were waiting already.</span> <span id="s816">I mean, what kind of bags.</span> <span id="s817">We had – I had the little valise like this, and another pair of shoes, which was outgrown already, because it was coming, you know, it was fall.</span> <span id="s818">And they put us on a train, on the last 100 wagon train from Poznań going –</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: West.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: – west.</span> <span id="s821">And when we came to the border of Nordhorn in Germany, there was a stop – or, no, it was not Germany – yes, we were in Germany, because Nordhorn was Germany, and then it crossed to Holland.</span> <span id="s822">And we got – th-the entire train stopped, my mother told me, and I remember this – this barking at – and she says, take – help Jandrusz(ph), because he’s ill, so that he doesn’t wet his pants.</span> <span id="s823">Okay, we took, and she said, play dead dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: [speaks Polish] And I know what that means, that means – there were many bushes on – there was a signal, and my mother told me, I apparently had scarlet fever at that time, so I had very high temperature.</span> <span id="s826">Because I don’t remember what happened, how I got, but eight days later I woke up in a beautiful white child bed in a hospital.</span> <span id="s827">And I looked around, and there was my brother laying in another bed, still in fever.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: So the last memory – memory you have is la – re – at this train station –</span></p>

id="s836">Play dead dog.</span> <span id="s837">And I don’t know where she went.</span> <span id="s838">I – I cannot see her.</span> <span id="s839">I only remember that my – not privilege, but my – I had to take care –</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Your duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: My duty was to my brother, to take care of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Izbisznik(ph) was not with me, so I – I was always looking, where’s the other one?</span> <span id="s844">Because I was so used to it that there were two –</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: – two with me.</span> <span id="s847">But no – and he was so weak, that he just fell, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s848">And only after two weeks, when I came really through, my mother told me that thank – I don’t know why I did this, but we are in a evangelical hospital, run by the evangelical nuns.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: In other words, the Lutherans.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Yes, but they were called – they were – this was a Swiss order.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Evangelische?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Evangelische, yes, Lutheran, uh-huh, Evangelische schwester.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: They had navy blue garbs, white coifs with rows, and they all had beautiful, long hair.</span> <span id="s855">Some of them were very princely.</span> <span id="s856">There were baronesses, there was a – countesses, very wealthy women who did not want to marry this one or that one, would go to such an order.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: But they were this – they ran a hospital, because the hospital was right like on a peninsula.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s860">Well, how did you get from the bushes near the train station, to that hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: My mother told me, when I came through –</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: – and – and I will –</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Woke up.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Woke up, but when I could talk with her, she told me – I said, Mother, why am I – I never had a bed like this.</span> <span id="s866">Where – where are we?</span> <span id="s867">And she told me that in the evening a farmer was coming with hay and some turnips and – and potatoes.</span> <span id="s868">And she found her German language and ask him – he – she said, he spoke Plattdeutsch.</span> <span id="s869">He spoke, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Low German.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: – low – low German, but he understood what she wanted.</span> <span id="s872">And she pointed to the two children laying there, and he told her he’s going to take her – us, to the hospital.</span> <span id="s873">And he took us there, my mother said it was two or three kilometers from that place, there was the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: My question is also, why did – how did the guards not see you?</span> <span id="s875">Where did the rest of the people go?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Timing.</span> <span id="s877">They had to – it had to be anybody who was sick, they would throw them out anyway, on one side or the other side of the train.</span> <span id="s878">On the same train was my mother – grandmo – godmother, with her two sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Who in Russolt(ph) had a hor – she was – she had many Arabian horses.</span> <span id="s881">She was training them –</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: She had a horse farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Yes, she had a horse farm.</span> <span id="s884">And she was taken, her husband was taken, he was – he disappeared, I think he just was taken to a concentration camp, period.</span> <span id="s885">And they were very – they were quite wealthy, because they had a big estate, and all that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: To have a horse farm, you have to be –</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Yes, and they – and they ha – and she and those two boys were on that train from some – probably from Poznań because that train was coming from Poznań stood from the ci – center of the city.</span> <span id="s888">Stopped there what – where the camp was, the transit camp, and we didn’t know this until later on, when m-my mother found out, because she wrote – right under, or before, or when they hit the border, there was a – a mine exploded, and many of the carts were turned over, people were killed.</span> <span id="s889">One of the boys died.</span> <span id="s890">Now, I don’t know if the older boys died – died, or the younger one, cause I never found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: So this was by the Dutch border.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Yes, by the Dutch border, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s894">And then the rest of the people, who were still prisoners, were taken someplace, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Were taken someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Yes, they were taken to labor camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: And you – and your mother kind of got you off of the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: And – i-in a moment when nobody was looking?</span> <span id="s901">Is this –</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Everybody.</span> <span id="s903">Everybody was coming out, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Everybody was supposed to come out.</span> <span id="s906">This was yo-your – your last chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Your last stop, or your last chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Well, our last chance before we go to the freedom.</span> <span id="s909">This is what we – my mother said later on, when we were talking about it.</span> <span id="s910">Sure, because the Germans were taking us out of the bombardment – bombardments and –</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Into labor camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s913">Yes, either to work on farms, or in factories, or wherever.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: An-And she knew your – your – you two were sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Yes, because she worked in the sanitary barrack –</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: – where they used – where – where they were disposing ointments, aspirin, and – and so forth on.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Medications of some kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: So it was a split moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: It was a split second sort of –</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: – how can we hide from this crowd of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Okay, now I get it.</span> <span id="s927">So you – now you wake up in the ca – in the hospital, and it’s a nice bed, and it’s warm and it – and did that mean freedom, real freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: I don’t – I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s929">I didn’t know where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Well, after she told you these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Well, she told me this many days later, because apparently, she said, I was so – I had such a fever that I was incommunicative for the eight days.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: That I just lay there and she said they were putting me in – in cold tubs or something to, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Cool you down.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: – to cool – to cool me down.</span> <span id="s936">And then they found out – I found out that I wanted to talk to my mother and I could not because I was stuck, I had – they didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s937">Apparently it was lockjaw.</span> <span id="s938">And then, after lockjaw, I got another measles, germ – the German measles, so I was locked up for another six months in a dark room.</span> <span id="s939">I could understand everything, but I could not communicate.</span> <span id="s940">I could show, I could write, but I could not speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: And the doctor, who was – he was a Dutchman, Dr. Becker, who helped my mother – my mother worked in that hospital in a – a sewing room where they were repairing the bedsheets and sewing other necessary things and cleaning and ironing and so forth on.</span> <span id="s943">But she did not live in the hospital.</span> <span id="s944">She lived in a place that I found out only after Christmas, she lived under the stable.</span> <span id="s945">I said, what is under the stable?</span> <span id="s946">They had – the nuns had built a refuge for people who were running away, for soldiers, officers, people – Belgians, Yugoslavs, you name it.</span> <span id="s947">And there were over 200 beds underneath the stable built.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Nobody knew, and nobody discovered, even though, besides the nuns, the Evangelische schwester, there were 30 brown schwester.</span> <span id="s950">Those were Hitlerjugend nurses.</span> <span id="s951">Not in white and blue stripes, but white and brown stripes.</span> <span id="s952">That’s why they were called the brown schwesters.</span> <span id="s953">And when the nuns ate, my brother and I, we ate with them, because one of the nuns, Sister Marta, decided that we were her nieces, and that we were in the hospital.</span> <span id="s954">My brother didn’t speak German, he didn’t even want to speak, period.</span> <span id="s955">He only talked to me – to my ear, when he wanted.</span> <span id="s956">But they took us, when we finished eating, they – the nuns left, and then the other sisters, the brown schwesters, the nurses came, and they sat in a different part of the – of the – what the ta – their tables was in a different –</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: In the dining room.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: – room in the dining room, right.</span> <span id="s959">And they had different dishes, because this was all provided by the –</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Hitlerjugend organization, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s962">We stayed there til Palm Sunday.</span> <span id="s963">On Palm Sunday, I couldn’t stand it, it was so loud.</span> <span id="s964">All the bells all of a sudden started to ring.</span> <span id="s965">I said, Mama, what is going on?</span> <span id="s966">The Canadian Mountain Police regiment came first.</span> <span id="s967">The Canadian – the Canadians came in and – because Holland was already free.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: They marched, and all the bells in Nordhorn started to ring and then in – then the next and the next.</span> <span id="s970">And when my mother found this out, she went to Dr. Becker and she said, this is the end.</span> <span id="s971">She said, it’s not signed yet, but the war is over, because I received it from Munich, from the Americans, that the end – it’s the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: On that Palm Sunday?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Yes, on that Palm Sunday.</span> <span id="s974">We were – I think we were the first ones to know about it, because it came from Holland.</span> <span id="s975">They just came across the bridge and went – came into Nordhorn, and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: It’s in the – I – I’d have to look back on the calendar to find out when Palm Sunday was that year, whether it was early April, or later April, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: You know, that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s978">My mother s – my mother said, I think it was in the middle of ’45 of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Yes, ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: So another three or four weeks and then it’s done.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s983">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: And she found out a month – I think it took us another month, my mother found out that the General Machuk(ph) Cross, who was with the British Army, the – the division – artillery division was coming through from Belgium through Holland and into Germany and then crossing over.</span> <span id="s986">They – they stopped and – in Lingen, which was, I think, not far away from Nordhorn, and there a – a – a camp that was a concentration camp for Russians, Yugoslavs, Ukrainians, Serbs and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Slavs.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: All kinds of Slavs, because he was not only decimate only the Jews, but all the Slavs too –</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: – because they were – somehow they were together in – into – in this war.</span> <span id="s991">And my mother found out that there’s an organization from United Refugee association or organization, UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Oh yeah, UNRRA, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: UNRRA.</span> <span id="s994">That they were trying to organize that camp for the other people that were on the German soil.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: So refugees, for – for refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Yes, the refugees, yes.</span> <span id="s997">The deported people, right, DPs, as we were called.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Yeah, DP, displaced persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1000">We were really – well, we were displaced, but we were not displaced, we were – we were just transported.</span> <span id="s1001">As an Australian 35 years later in America told me, he says, don’t you ever call yourself a DP.</span> <span id="s1002">You are a delayed pilgrim.</span> <span id="s1003">When somebody called oh, you must be – not long ago somebody had some kind of an interview of people, and somebody says, oh, she’s a newcomer.</span> <span id="s1004">I said oh yes, thir – 65 years ago I came to this country.</span> <span id="s1005">I’m only a delayed pilgrim.</span> <span id="s1006">He said, and what is that?</span> <span id="s1007">He took off the – the macro – microphone.</span> <span id="s1008">I said, a delayed pilgrim means the pilgrim who came later than the first pilgrims.</span> <span id="s1009">Like 500 years ago, 400 years ago later.</span> <span id="s1010">But it was, you know, that was something –</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: And then we stayed in the camp.</span> <span id="s1013">My mother [indecipherable] the do – the doctor found a transport for us that we were taken to the camp.</span> <span id="s1014">It was awful.</span> <span id="s1015">It was awful.</span> <span id="s1016">Dead bodies, children slaughtered.</span> <span id="s1017">I mean, it was awful.</span> <span id="s1018">I couldn’t – I just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1019">I just took my brother and I sat under a tree and I said – and I just started crying, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1020">I said, I don’t want to be here, I want to go back to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1021">But of course, you know the army came in, cleared, and there were people who knew how to organize things, who had the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: So that meant the – these were the last prisoners who didn’t make it, who were killed in that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: And they even had children in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1026">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1027">And children found – went in barracks and places where it’s unspeakable to – to say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: And you, as a seven year old sees all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Yes, that – that – you know, I – that’s why, when somebody’s tell me, how was your childhood, I never had a childhood.</span> <span id="s1030">And I don’t think I’m the only one.</span> <span id="s1031">There were many children who never had a childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Did that have effects later on in life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1034">My uncle always called me – he said, you know, you are a martyr.</span> <span id="s1035">I said, why?</span> <span id="s1036">You’re always – you’re always looking for something to do, you’re always helping somebody, you always want to do this.</span> <span id="s1037">Everything has to be cleaned, every – because I had the – oh, I couldn’t stand dirt, or anything that was crawling and moving, because I saw it under my skin, the bedbugs and – and the lice, and everything else.</span> <span id="s1038">It was awful.</span> <span id="s1039">Of course my hair was completely shaven when I was in the hospital because it was falling off anyway.</span> <span id="s1040">And – but somehow, you know, we survived, because my mother signed a paper in December of 1944 in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1041">Dr. Beck – Becker asked her and told her that because this was a non-Nazi hospital, they had to accept all wounded majors, captains, generals, etcetera, etcetera, the higher officers of Germans were there.</span> <span id="s1042">And they were the first ones to receive – that hospital was the first one to receive penicillin.</span> <span id="s1043">And he said, and in order for her to speak, the only thing that I know that could help her is ultraviolet ray infiltration.</span> <span id="s1044">So they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: For you to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: To – to – yes, to loosen up, to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: The lockjaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yes, the lockjaw.</span> <span id="s1049">And it worked apparently, because it took three – three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: So what was the paper that she signed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: She had to sign agreeing, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Agreeing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: That she permits us to get penicillin, and get the ultraviolet rays.</span> <span id="s1054">Because it was unknown if it’s going to cure –</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: – or not.</span> <span id="s1057">My mother said, it’s a 50-50 chance.</span> <span id="s1058">He says yes.</span> <span id="s1059">You don’t know, and we don’t know, but can we try?</span> <span id="s1060">And in the hospital we had a stamp here, and they eradicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Yes, yes, we were stamped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Did you have a number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: I – we – that – I remember one zero something, and six four, and I don’t know whatever.</span> <span id="s1065">It was a longer number, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1066">I – I just – when, many times I would get up and say, why this number comes back to me?</span> <span id="s1067">And my mother said, because it was a number that was given to you.</span> <span id="s1068">And because I had to remember it when I went to the – to the platz at eight o’clock in the morning, and waited there with my brother.</span> <span id="s1069">It was rain or shine, we had to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: So this was daily?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Daily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: So while you were in the transit camp outside Poznań –</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: – there was this – this system, this order –</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Not order in the sense of things are in order, but this rule that the appell, the – the – the calling and the confirming of the numbers of prisoners – which is usually what it is, but I don’t know whether they counted you or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: That I don’t know, but there were people who were taken out of the camp, put on a train to – outside to work someplace, to factories, to farms, for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: During this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: During this time, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: During this eight – six or – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Because – because when we would come back, we would see, oh this bunk is free, this one is all the things are taken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: And it’s being disinfected, so that means something – something has – I asked my mother once, and she said, because those people left already.</span> <span id="s1084">And those that didn’t make it were put aside, and – toward the incineration, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1085">Tha-That was the only way to tak – to get rid of the bodies.</span> <span id="s1086">But you know, I don’t like to go back through – I do not think – that’s why I was very hesitant to – to – because it – I know I’m not going to sleep tonight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: I’m so sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: But that’s – you know, somebody asked me once also, when I was in – in Washington, and I said, why shou – why do you want this information?</span> <span id="s1089">Why do you want to interrogate me?</span> <span id="s1090">This is not interrogation, we want to see what happened.</span> <span id="s1091">Because you – your papers – you do – you don’t have certain papers, you don’t have this.</span> <span id="s1092">I said, because I don’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1093">If you want to, why don’t you write to Germany?</span> <span id="s1094">Or find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Did your daughter ever ask you about this stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: I think she knows certain things because I said, ask Grandma.</span> <span id="s1097">That means, ask my mother.</span> <span id="s1098">I said, my mother will tell you certain things.</span> <span id="s1099">But my mother was very – she w – she was not scrupulous, but she only said – only told her certain things and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1100">In general, that’s it, because she says, I don’t want her sh – because my daughter is very sensitive.</span> <span id="s1101">She knows that, you know, his mother lived to be 103, despite the fact that she – it was meant for her to live that long.</span> <span id="s1102">But they were very, very close, as a – as a family.</span> <span id="s1103">The only time that he was away, and not living with her, was the two years that he was in the United States Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: That is your husband and his mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1106">She lived here, with us.</span> <span id="s1107">I actually married both of them, as I always said.</span> <span id="s1108">Yes.</span> <span id="s1109">And you know, it was – it was different.</span> <span id="s1110">She, in her later life dwelled on it.</span> <span id="s1111">It was part of her [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1112">She wrote certain poems, are very, very strong, very beautiful, very formative.</span> <span id="s1113">And I told him, I said, you know, I found certain papers, going through some of the things.</span> <span id="s1114">He still doesn’t want to go and see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: But, I said, you know, they’re very good poems.</span> <span id="s1117">And he said well, you would know.</span> <span id="s1118">Of course, I – I am not – I am not a literary major, but I – I was a – I recited poetry, not only of Polish, but of – in – in – in Italian, and in – in English, and – and I love poetry.</span> <span id="s1119">And you know, certain poems, when I had to translate from French into English and then write about it, what it really meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: I would always get the best results on my – on – on my grading papers.</span> <span id="s1122">And sometimes says, how do you know this?</span> <span id="s1123">I said, well, I happened to go through certain things, which I can read between the lines.</span> <span id="s1124">And she says yes, exactly, here it is.</span> <span id="s1125">This is what the poet says.</span> <span id="s1126">So, you know, it was something – I can feel when she was not indulging herself into the poem, but what was going on, the essence was – is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1128">Of what your – your mother-in-law was writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Yes, yes, and I think – he said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1130">I think I’m going to look into it and we’re going to ask someone who does these things, edits, and to find out if – if it wouldn’t be worthwhile to publish it, you know.</span> <span id="s1131">Because I think it would be – this is something that she left behind her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: It’s a legacy.</span> <span id="s1133">Its’ a legacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Yes, it is.</span> <span id="s1135">It is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: I just can’t be – I – I’m still amazed.</span> <span id="s1137">In all of the things that you are describing, they’re known, but they’re not known.</span> <span id="s1138">They’re known because we know the history –</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: – but we don’t know the individual’s history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: And I just keep going in – over in my mind, a five year old girl, a six year old girl, a seven year old girl.</span> <span id="s1143">It’s still a baby.</span> <span id="s1144">In my mind that’s still a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: I was not –</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: I remember my own daughter, and she was – she is still my baby, but – but you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1147">It is a child who was still so innocent, and all that you were exposed to during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: I don’t know when I was a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: I’ve noticed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1151">I always think I was a grown-up.</span> <span id="s1152">They used to call me stara(ph) marinka(ph).</span> <span id="s1153">That means –</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: And what does that mean?</span> <span id="s1155">The old one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: No, young but old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Yeah, a young girl –</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: – maybe an old soul, as they say in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1161">Because, you know, it’s something I – and really I cannot say that I played, or that I would love to do this.</span> <span id="s1162">Yes, the only time that I could say that I played was with the lead soldiers during – you know, it used to be even – the whole world had it.</span> <span id="s1163">And when my two cousins, and all the four cousins would get together, or all of us 11 got there on the floor, and we would [indecipherable] I said, look, there’s the enemy.</span> <span id="s1164">Who’s the general?</span> <span id="s1165">On which side?</span> <span id="s1166">So they started quarreling; this one, this one, this one.</span> <span id="s1167">And then finally Izbisznik(ph), my cousin would say, let her be the genel – the general, she’s a girl.</span> <span id="s1168">She has nobody to quarrel with.</span> <span id="s1169">So, you know, it’s – yes, that – that I think will stay with me, that – and my – and my uncle, you know, says [indecipherable] he said always, you are such a masochist.</span> <span id="s1170">I said, why?</span> <span id="s1171">He said, because if – you always – your hand always have to be busy, you’re doing this, you have to have this on, you have to go this.</span> <span id="s1172">You – you put your – you’re going shopping, but no, there’s a lady across, you have to go and take her over to the street.</span> <span id="s1173">Why?</span> <span id="s1174">I said, Uncle, because that’s what a Girl Scout does, doesn’t it?</span> <span id="s1175">Besides, there were people who helped us when we were unable to do it ourselves, because that’s what Mother said.</span> <span id="s1176">Sometimes people would take us by the hands and – or carry us even, because we were so weak.</span> <span id="s1177">But, you know – and I do realize, a war is a war.</span> <span id="s1178">A lot of things happen.</span> <span id="s1179">But I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: This is more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: – but I don’t want to – I – I really don’t want to go through it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: No, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Please.</span> <span id="s1184">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Your life – tell us a little bit about your life after your father comes back, and how does it become normal [indecipherable] yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1187">When my father came back and a different – bo – being both teachers, they needed, they were organizing schools.</span> <span id="s1188">My mother was a good organizer, and the man whom I called uncle, who became our adopted uncle, he became the director of – of this camp, and then it – we find out there was 15,000 people in it.</span> <span id="s1189">But he knew how to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Organize.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: – organize it, yes.</span> <span id="s1192">He was in AK so, you know, and he was fighting in Warsaw and all that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: AK means Armia Kryova.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Yeah, Armia ka – Armia Kryova, yes.</span> <span id="s1195">So, you know, it was – it was something that people had, the energy, wanted to build, wanted to form something, wanted to – to get rid of this dust that was on – upon us.</span> <span id="s1196">That we wanted to live like normal people.</span> <span id="s1197">The first thing that was cleaned was one barrack that the mass of thanksgiving was going to be said.</span> <span id="s1198">A chaplain came in, whom we befriended – my mother loved to write – to – to play Bridge, so every Saturday or Friday night, they would play Bridge, because it – this was something that would take them away.</span> <span id="s1199">It was – it was something different.</span> <span id="s1200">It was more intellectual than – than anything.</span> <span id="s1201">And – and the teachers were needed, so my father, when he became better and better, he said look, somebody has to take care of this.</span> <span id="s1202">So they said, you know, you used to be a te – a director of school here in this school, in this region and that region.</span> <span id="s1203">Why don’t you take this?</span> <span id="s1204">You can’t be doing too much of carrying, organizing, but you can organize school.</span> <span id="s1205">You can organize the classes.</span> <span id="s1206">You can ev-evaluate th-the students who are there.</span> <span id="s1207">The first grade.</span> <span id="s1208">I never went to first grade, because I was [speaks Polish]</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: You were [indecipherable] okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: So why should I go to first grade, second grade, because I would be bored.</span> <span id="s1211">I would be telling a 20 year old what is a,b,c, the alphabet, because she didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1212">She came from a eastern side of Poland, someplace from behind Bug.</span> <span id="s1213">She heard that people went to school, but she had to work on the field.</span> <span id="s1214">And – but now she was 20 years old, and she wants to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: It’s over, the war is over, I want to do something.</span> <span id="s1217">I want to be a human being.</span> <span id="s1218">So my father said, oh no, you stay home, and you teach your younger brother, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1219">And you read –</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: And how long – yeah, how long did you stay in this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: In Lingen(ph) – in li – in Linden(ph), we stayed until ’46, and then another camp was being organized, we went to Ferzen(ph).</span> <span id="s1222">Ferzen(ph) was a concentration camp for the Yugoslav.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: And then it was changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: And it was changed, because we were – we were actually under the British occupation of – of that segment of Germany.</span> <span id="s1225">The –</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: The British zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: – th-the British zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1232">All the way up to Wiesbaden, that was also a part of it.</span> <span id="s1233">Americans took everything below of – o-of – be – bevow – below – not Leipzig, the other one.</span> <span id="s1234">Lubeka(ph).</span> <span id="s1235">Lubeck(ph).</span> <span id="s1236">[indecipherable] that was, and when the French gave up their occupation, the Americans took that zo – all of that part was – was under American occupation.</span> <span id="s1237">And we were i – on the northwestern part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: So you stayed there til ’47?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: We stayed til – i-in Ferzen(ph), and then we went six weeks here, three weeks there, and we were moved where he was needed to organize a school, and shipped to another place.</span> <span id="s1240">The longest we stayed, in Braunschweig, which was almost in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: And closer to the Russian border.</span> <span id="s1243">We were in Hildesheim, which was the last –</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: You mean the East German border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: The East German border –</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: German border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: – yes.</span> <span id="s1248">We were in hel – in Hildesheim, which was right across the street were the – were the Russians.</span> <span id="s1249">This was the close they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Okay, so you were really close to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: We – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: – where the border was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: And then from there, we moved to – to Braunschweig, and we stayed in Braunschweig there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: And you never di – and you – there was a decision you don’t go back to your hometown, you don’t go back to ko – Kościan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: My f – grandfather – my father’s father wrote him a letter.</span> <span id="s1256">He could not write what he wanted, but he said, there is a big body of water, and another world is waiting for you.</span> <span id="s1257">He had his answer.</span> <span id="s1258">He was packed in 1944, when we lived in Mappen(ph) rosa(ph), coming from – from Nordhorn, and he wanted to go back and rebuild Poland.</span> <span id="s1259">And my mother said, I am not going.</span> <span id="s1260">And he got the answer.</span> <span id="s1261">He was ready to leave, and I think that changed his mind.</span> <span id="s1262">He said, Jusef(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: His own father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1265">God bless, and that’s – that’s all he wrote.</span> <span id="s1266">Nothing was erased.</span> <span id="s1267">Later on when we were already in Braunschweig, we received letters with –</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: That were censored.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: That were censored, yes.</span> <span id="s1270">And we knew.</span> <span id="s1271">But we stayed in Braunschweig, and in Braunschweig in ’48, at the NWCW.</span> <span id="s1272">En-sa-voot-sa(ph).</span> <span id="s1273">Ens – yes, NCWC, the National Catholic Welfare Conference was organized in America, and they were trying to receive people who would sponsor, as sponsors for the people that were displayed in – in Germany, and in other countries was – as I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: And that’s how you got to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: But – but – and my parents signed three papers.</span> <span id="s1276">One to England, one to Australia, Argentina, Brazil and America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: And yugo – yes, five papers.</span> <span id="s1279">And you had to go to the first one that received you.</span> <span id="s1280">The first one came to America.</span> <span id="s1281">And then came, I think Australia.</span> <span id="s1282">And my mother said, I don’t want to see kangaroos, and I don’t – I don’t think I want to live there.</span> <span id="s1283">And my father said, well, okay, so we were – we’re stuck with this.</span> <span id="s1284">As – as an officer, he should have gone – he could have gone to England.</span> <span id="s1285">But there were three children, because my youngest brother was born in ’46, in Mappen(ph).</span> <span id="s1286">So we could not move, we could not go, because England had its own problems, and they would take single people, and the most people with one f – one child, yes.</span> <span id="s1287">Married people yes, but with one child only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: And so it was the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: It was the United States, and we left in 1949.</span> <span id="s1290">We traveled actually from August til September, because when we – everything was written, everything was cleared, my youngest brother decided to – not to take a nap.</span> <span id="s1291">But when my bag was covered, he didn’t see me, he saw only my bag was turned af – from him.</span> <span id="s1292">He loved pears, and he grabbed a pear from the table and ate it and got such a stomachache that he was convulsing.</span> <span id="s1293">They took him to the hospital, he was there for a week.</span> <span id="s1294">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: You didn’t leave yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: – all our papers were delayed, we cannot go, we were going to take a train and go to Bremerhaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Yeah, Bremerhaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: And – and – and – and take there.</span> <span id="s1299">So, we went in September, we were moved there, to another camp, and they said, okay, no bed works.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: No pears.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Wa – watch your kid.</span> <span id="s1302">No – no fruit of any kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: No pancakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: He wer – oh, he loved pears and Naptha-Fels soap.</span> <span id="s1305">When he grabbed that, he just put in his mouth and just – and he just ate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Soap?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: He needed – he needed phosphate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1309">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Or, he would go outside, and wherever he saw pieces of – of walls, you know, from the barracks, he would take and put in his fingers, it had calcium and something else in th – in – in the composition of – of the walls.</span> <span id="s1311">[indecipherable] it was a strange child.</span> <span id="s1312">But the pear really did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: It delayed us by two and a half mon-months, and we left actually on – again, on the 10th of October, from Bremen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: In 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: In 1949, on General Black, which was an army sh-ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: And sailed into New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Sailed – we a – no, we had to detour and go to Ellis Island, my mother, I and the youngest one.</span> <span id="s1321">My father and Andrew went to New York, then they took us back on the ship, 24 hours later from Ellis Island and brought us to New York harbor.</span> <span id="s1322">That’s where I got my green card.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: And how did you end up here in Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: We had a sponsor in Wisconsin, who happened to be a Jehovah Witness.</span> <span id="s1325">He found out that my father was well-educated, knew several languages, and that – cause they wanted somebody to run their community.</span> <span id="s1326">They needed a bishop, and they would make him a bishop.</span> <span id="s1327">And my father says, never!</span> <span id="s1328">And it was cat – well, you know, through NW – NCWC.</span> <span id="s1329">They found out, they said this man – that family cannot, they are Roman Catholic.</span> <span id="s1330">So, when we changed trains from New York at Union Station and got on the – the Hiawatha train, we landed in – in Lisbon, and there was nobody to pick us up.</span> <span id="s1331">And half an hour later came a – a priest, and spoke to us in English, sort of sounding Polish, and said, I will have to take you.</span> <span id="s1332">My mother lives here, not far away, and we’re going – we have to talk.</span> <span id="s1333">We had to find another sponsor.</span> <span id="s1334">There’s a woman who will take you.</span> <span id="s1335">She has one goat and two rabbits, and – and – and three or four chickens, and she has a small garden, and she would lo – she would love to take you in.</span> <span id="s1336">Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s1337">My mother cried.</span> <span id="s1338">Of course it was impossible.</span> <span id="s1339">She was lately demented, but she was a very good woman.</span> <span id="s1340">And the priest himself realized that this was not the place.</span> <span id="s1341">So he called the chancellery office in that area, and we landed in New Lisbon, not far from Mauston, Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s1342">And a farmer, a Mr. Barlette(ph), who was a Belgian, married to an Irish woman, they had a big farm.</span> <span id="s1343">A very wealthy man, cause he had 500 cattles and all that stuff and – and oh, acres and acres of – of fields.</span> <span id="s1344">And we were there for six weeks, but my father had to work from four o’clock in the morning til eight o’clock at midnight – at night, and many milking and doing all farm work.</span> <span id="s1345">I mean, you know, he was not – physically he was not ready to do this, to work like this.</span> <span id="s1346">He wanted any work, he never complained.</span> <span id="s1347">I had to say he never – but my mother work – worked as a housekeeper.</span> <span id="s1348">She cleaned the whole house, all the windows.</span> <span id="s1349">I was just turned 11 years old.</span> <span id="s1350">I was ironing 30 shirts a week, because there were people working, and doing things.</span> <span id="s1351">In the morning we got up at six o’clock and at 6:30 we had – we walked three miles to New Lisbon, cat – caught a bus that took us to Mauston, to a Catholic school, which was run by German nuns.</span> <span id="s1352">And at least I could confer – converse freely with somebody.</span> <span id="s1353">I knew some English, because I – we were taught English by the British soldiers.</span> <span id="s1354">They were – one time we had a English major, and then we had a Scottish sergeant.</span> <span id="s1355">And he ri – loved the Polish language because it was such a beautiful R.</span> <span id="s1356">We could roll our Rs, as he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: As they can too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: And they can too.</span> <span id="s1359">O-Only th-they can too.</span> <span id="s1360">So, you know, it was – but I knew German very well, and English was in my ears.</span> <span id="s1361">I could hear it, but it was difficult for me to – to express myself, because the German would –</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Come in, and well, it – it worked itself out.</span> <span id="s1364">The Father Evans who took care of us, he said, you know, I received a call from the Chicago chancellery, and there’s a Franciscan priest, who apparently knows you.</span> <span id="s1365">And yes, because he was in Auschwitz, and then he was in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1366">And he came out, and he lived with us and – in li – Lingen(ph).</span> <span id="s1367">And I think then the order asked him to – to come to America.</span> <span id="s1368">And he stayed here, because he had TB.</span> <span

id="s1387">Yes, 1957 at the scouting celebration of – of Christmas and I happened to be playing the role of Blessed Virgin, because I had hair long down to hear.</span> <span id="s1388">So – and I

endurance.</span> <span id="s1399">And education, and following the right way.</span> <span id="s1400">Always be noble.</span> <span id="s1401">Even if one makes a mistake, it is not a sin to say, I done this and then apologize.</span> <span id="s1402">Otherwise, if you don’t have the nobility to do this, the noble heart, then you’re not a full person.</span> <span id="s1403">And if – and have a strong belief in what you want to do, and follow it.</span> <span id="s1404">Follow your calling.</span> <span id="s1405">But first, learn.</span> <span id="s1406">Get a good education, just like we

with her.</span> <span id="s1412">They didn’t even want to celebrate Wigilia, which is the Christmas eve.</span> <span id="s1413">And she says, what?</span> <span id="s1414">I am going to buy the Christmas tree, I am going to dress it, and I am going to set the Wigilia for you.</span> <span id="s1415">I will go and stand in line and buy fish.</span> <span id="s1416">And this was only what,
