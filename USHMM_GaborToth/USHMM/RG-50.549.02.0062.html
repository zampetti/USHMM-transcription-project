neighborhood a little bit, and how long you’ve lived here, and I’ll just test your --</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Okay, I moved in here originally, in January, about two or three, of 1981.</span> <span id="s14">And I’ve been living here in the same apartment, since.</span> <span id="s15">I bought a apartment here before it was built, I bought it off a plan, and that’s where we spent all these years now since, which it means over 20 years hence.</span> <span id="s16">Is coming through good?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: I’m just going to listen to it.</span> <span id="s20">Okay, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</span> <span id="s21">This is an interview with Mr. Harold Zissman, conducted by Arwin Donohue, on February 28th, 2000.</span> <span id="s22">And this is a follow up interview, it’s a post -- focusing on post-Holocaust era -- it’s a follow up interview to an interview that we conducted with Harold Zissman, in 1995.</span> <span id="s23">That was a Holocaust era interview, conducted on videotape.</span> <span id="s24">And we’re going to start by reviewing some -- some things that -- that took place immediately following the war, and then move on to what happened in the United States, which will be our focus today.</span> <span id="s25">So, one of the first things that I wanted to know was when you -- in the last interview, that Randy Goldman conducted with you, it wasn’t very clear to me what liberation meant, and whether there was a moment when you were actually liberated, when you were recognizing, okay, I’m not responsible for being platoon commander any more, and I’m -- I’m a -- now I have to decide what comes next.</span> <span id="s26">Can you describe that a little more?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s28">That was a very hard thing at the time, turning the clock back to the era.</span> <span id="s29">The forest sort of served as -- as a safety, away from the people who wanted my life, sort of -- without a gu -- good reason.</span> <span id="s30">Therefore, my separation from the forest was a very hard one to do.</span> <span id="s31">The commanding officer that particular time, when asked by two of my for -- comrades who were in my platoon, ask me why am I not going out to join them, and see where I can enlist myself to do a jo -- to work, well he told them, “Where do you think Harold is going to go?</span> <span id="s32">Is he going to enlist himself to be in the police?</span> <span id="s33">No, I don’t think I want him to be there, I want him to be in a more important job.”</span> <span id="s34">Whereupon, not so long after that, I’m getting an assignment to go to -- and take some people that they immediately drafted, between the ages of 18 through 45, to join the Red Army’s armed forces.</span> <span id="s35">And be for the fact that the railroad tracks between Grodno and Marstee, were not ready, because we, the partisans, the yesterday’s destroyers of that, to s -- to not let the Germans be able to carry on their war, now had a problem of going back to see that they’ve all repaired, so the Red Army could be able to bring in their supplies, as well as manpower.</span> <span id="s36">So, they were drafted and I could -- well, was ordered to organize a -- another squad because I could -- I did not have enough to make a platoon, because everybody was trying to get organized, and they [indecipherable] me to do it.</span> <span id="s37">So I must have gone about maybe 10 or 12 guys, and with that I started, and I reported to duty.</span> <span id="s38">And with bayonets open, we were marching them like they were prisoners, much rather than they were the people who are willing to serve, and go to fight the war, to liberate the rest of them, be the end of Germany.</span> <span id="s39">It made a bad impression on me, but an order is an order, I had to do it.</span> <span id="s40">So, freedom at that particular time to me, I did not even get taste of the freedom yet.</span> <span id="s41">I can only explain myself that those same people that I have to guard -- I had to guard at the time to take them, still had in them that anti-Semitism, although I didn’t do anything against those people.</span> <span id="s42">They couldn’t accuse me personally, but a pluralistic way of hate, because I was a Jew, didna -- still was imbedded in them, and I felt the non-safety there.</span> <span id="s43">It took us al -- it took us almost until we put them on the train, and we go -- and we were able to move, was almost a week before the train could start operating.</span> <span id="s44">And as soon we reached the old border between the U.S. -- between the Soviet Union, and Poland, the KGB -- the army KGB took over command, and I was getting papers to be released with my squad that I had over there, and to go back to our -- well, I was told while living, where the officers are going to be, the local officers.</span> <span id="s45">However, I was told by my commanding officers, if I should return, and they will not be there any more.</span> <span id="s46">The staff -- the general staff will be in Minsk, which was the capital of Belarus, and I am to report to any of those places, after my assignment will be done.</span> <span id="s47">Whereupon --</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: So we got some of that -- that -- we got the information about how you went to Minsk --</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: -- in the first interview.</span> <span id="s51">I just wanted to clarify a little bit that -- how you knew, okay, I’m not beholden to the partisan group any more.</span> <span id="s52">Now I have to just make my decision about what comes next, and -- and I was trying to get a sense of what you were thinking you -- you would do next, before you got in -- involved with the KGB.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Well, that’s what it was at that particular time, our returning back to Minsk was used, since I had papers to be housed, and to be fed.</span> <span id="s54">So it was sort of used like vacationing.</span> <span id="s55">After all, now we are free birds on ourselves.</span> <span id="s56">From my whole squad, I only remained three of -- two of the former guys, which they were Belarus, and I was their command por -- before I was their platoon commander, and now they were with me.</span> <span id="s57">They were sort of more like friends that we knew during the war, and during the partisans, when I would come in their settlement, they parents knew me, and as a matter of fact, I felt relief to be in their company, because relieve means secure.</span> <span id="s58">I was secure that no foul things could happen towards me in that particular time.</span> <span id="s59">So, we all went to that particular time, I received my medals, well I -- well I already said, being on the train, and all of a sudden, I found myself that I’m going to work for the KGB, which this was the farthest thing of my mind that I ever expected to happen.</span> <span id="s60">But I am the -- took soldiering before, when I escaped the ghetto, and I figured I’m continuing the same way.</span> <span id="s61">Besides that, I know the consequences, what it would have been had I refused, and I would not want to become a KGB working person.</span> <span id="s62">However, when I came to Boronivitch, which that was sort of the re-region to where I was going to work, in that office there, and I passed all the tests they wanted me to know, I told them that I wanted to go now for a little bit vacation with the two guys that they enlisted themselves in the militia, and not in the KGB, because their education was below mine, and therefore they wouldn’t pass to go into the KGB.</span> <span id="s63">And I wanted to go back to their settlement.</span> <span id="s64">Besides, I wanted, by any chance of all, maybe there was someone of my family, who by -- by any kind of way, survived, and if anything, probably that would be the place to meet them.</span> <span id="s65">On the other hand, I was separated from the partisans, the Jewish partisans, who were natives of Darechen -- of that -- of that city where the ghetto was that I escaped to the forest.</span> <span id="s66">I had my desire to go ahead to meet them, because we were separated, since I joined the other part, which it was in arvens, which I mean the paratroopers, with the General kus -- with General Kustenko.</span> <span id="s67">So I was separated from all my past, sort of, in -- in spirit, as well as physically, and I was anxious to go there.</span> <span id="s68">So when I put it out that I want to go for two weeks, I was granted, and meaning granted at that particular time, you had to have a permit, otherwise, without a permit, you could have been arrested easily, and who knows where to -- you could wind up.</span> <span id="s69">So -- and I came to the house of -- Volodya was the guy’s name, and his cousin, and I was greeted like I would have been his brother, no l -- no less.</span> <span id="s70">His mother and sister were there with open arms, and we kissed each other, and hugged each other, that we survived, and came not injured.</span> <span id="s71">And his mother gave him to change of her clothing, she gave me.</span> <span id="s72">And the next thing, we went that evening cut -- in the fi -- in the settlement there.</span> <span id="s73">A guy was playing on the harmonica, we were dancing, the boys and the girls, and to me, while we started to drink, is the usual way it would have been at the time, and it was -- i-it was not regular vodka, it was homemade brew, sort of, to speak.</span> <span id="s74">And I don’t know, no matter what I drank, somehow or other, I didn’t get drunk.</span> <span id="s75">My mind was so busy think -- to think, where do I go from here?</span> <span id="s76">And it’s not any other way that I could explain this, I just did not have a resoluting, I want to go and do this, I want to go look to do this.</span> <span id="s77">In a way, I felt sorry for myself immediately.</span> <span id="s78">Look, here [indecipherable] he had a place to come, he had a mother, he had a sister, he had cousins, he had -- what about me?</span> <span id="s79">I did not have anyone in -- or anywhere’s to turn, to say to myself, I’m happy.</span> <span id="s80">We met, we are good.</span> <span id="s81">But everything was sort of like it would not have been real.</span> <span id="s82">It just like a fantasy that you dream about, or stuff like this here.</span> <span id="s83">So I, again, was very mixed.</span> <span id="s84">I worked with him a whole week on the farm.</span> <span id="s85">It was potatoes they do, because at the time of year.</span> <span id="s86">It’s September when we are talking about, and at that particular time, farmers pick the potatoes there, and so on, because the other grain was already picked.</span> <span id="s87">And really, the need for help was in -- in a very bad way, because his mother an-and -- and his sister could not attend to it.</span> <span id="s88">So in a way, I was a handy helper, hel -- helping hand there.</span> <span id="s89">And to me at that particular time, a certain fantasy got into my mind again, why would I want to continue as a Jew?</span> <span id="s90">And immediately I saw a -- a different horizon, sort of, in a way of speak.</span> <span id="s91">Look at it.</span> <span id="s92">We both for the war, he was against Nazism, he escaped to the partisans because he did not want to be drafted to go to Germany, to work with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s93">But look what had happened to the two of us.</span> <span id="s94">I had no one to come to, he comes back home.</span> <span id="s95">And he going and working, and coming at night, between meeting up with the boys and the girls.</span> <span id="s96">Like I say, a certain fantasy, I -- I call it the fantasy, because real, I was not looking for that.</span> <span id="s97">So I must call it a fantasy got into my mind, and that’s what I thought, who knows?</span> <span id="s98">Maybe I’m going to get lost right now to these new world, and forget about the world that I lived in.</span> <span id="s99">And come Friday, the whole thing came to a change, whereupon Volodya says to me, “Harold, aren’t you going to go to Darechen?”</span> <span id="s100">Darechen meaning the city nearby -- not so nearby, but from where the ghetto was.</span> <span id="s101">And he knew these partisans, these same guys from Darechen fought together.</span> <span id="s102">Where he says to me, “Aren’t you going to see your Jews, over there?”</span> <span id="s103">He all of a sudden out of nowhere came out, while we were discussing -- I was discussing to myself, what happens Sunday now?</span> <span id="s104">Their church was still on over there, it was not destroyed, and what if he asks me -- I go with him on the farm, and work with him together.</span> <span id="s105">I associate in the same groups of people.</span> <span id="s106">What will it be, how will I feel if I’m asked to go to the church with him together?</span> <span id="s107">And I did not know at the moment, so when he start talking about, and using that word, you Jews, instead of using the word, aren’t you going go see our friends, the partisans, over in Darechen?</span> <span id="s108">You know what I mean, or maybe naming someone?</span> <span id="s109">But he said you Jews.</span> <span id="s110">So I felt a separation going on, and I -- all of a sudden I awakened like from a dream, and says, “Wait a minute now, I cannot hide myself.”</span> <span id="s111">Oh, I cannot run away, because each sort of day is something that it isn’t totally open.</span> <span id="s112">And I immediately said to him, “Of course I want to see, but you know how we worked every day long hours, and hard work, how was I to disrupt you and me from that work, and ask you about going to Darechen?</span> <span id="s113">But since you don’t plan on working perhaps tomorrow,” because Saturday -- I did not observe S-Saturday, so anything like that at that time, because under the Soviets, religion was another part of life that you did not practice.</span> <span id="s114">So I said to him, “If time permits you, I will be very happy that you give it to me, and I will also ask you to please let me go to the cemetery.”</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Before we go on, let me just footnote here that -- that you told this story in the first interview, and -- and I’m -- I’m glad you’re telling it again, because you’re giving some more details that are -- that are interesting, and that are helping to -- to clarify what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: But -- but we should just probably move on from --</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: -- from that area, rather than going into telling the whole story.</span> <span id="s120">I just wonder if you have any more.</span> <span id="s121">I know you -- you went -- well, for one thing, I wondered if you -- you told in the first video how you had -- how you had left, and Volodya.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Volodya, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: And did you ever see him again after that?</span> <span id="s124">A: I -- I did since we wound up work -- after all, after the two weeks were up, we were back in Boronivitch, he to the militia.</span> <span id="s125">We went on the same train, at the same time.</span> <span id="s126">But from Darechen, I did not return back to his farmland.</span> <span id="s127">I only told him, I says, when -- we’ll meet at it -- because I had to go to Zelbo, which is -- was the name, to take the train and to go to Boronivitch.</span> <span id="s128">So we said we’ll meet approximately the same time.</span> <span id="s129">It so happened that we did meet on the station, and we went with the same train to Boronivitch, while he went to the militia.</span> <span id="s130">His cousin didn’t go -- di -- wa -- didn’t take the job there, so he remained separately.</span> <span id="s131">He, as a matter of fact, volunteered coming back to the army, you know?</span> <span id="s132">And we met back in Boronivitch, but it was not any longer in Boronivitch that we met as quickly, or as frequently as we wanted.</span> <span id="s133">And another thing I want to point out here, be for what he asked me, pertaining, as a I pointed out to the question, you Jews.</span> <span id="s134">I did not want to carry that as a stick, sort of to punish him with that, or asking him why did he say it, because in my mind, I saw the natural thing of it.</span> <span id="s135">You know, other words, it’s I and you, and he sort of was not ready to hear from me, or to see from me, that hey Volodya, what do you mean you, or this, that and the other, we are just one, and I’m working the same way.</span> <span id="s136">So I did not take up any time.</span> <span id="s137">So whenever I would meet up with him, we meet -- we would meet again like yesterday’s friends, and not any criticism whatsoever, because I took it in my heart a justifiable way, the way he said it.</span> <span id="s138">He didn’t prepare himself to make a speech.</span> <span id="s139">He just said about the way he felt.</span> <span id="s140">So therefore, I never criticized it, or take -- took it [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s141">So yes they would meet.</span> <span id="s142">Now, I don’t know whether I told you that I got married, after which -- in January, I don’t know in the previous tape did I mention about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Yes, you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I believe I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: That on January five we got married --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: -- and the way I took in my hands, because I still was a reckless type of a person, even organized, and working the KGB.</span> <span id="s149">But certain instincts from the partisans, that you have to make decisions, still were left in me, and it was a hard time for me to get rid of it, that I’m constantly under the saluting, and under the command, and -- and th-there is a program that I have to do.</span> <span id="s150">So the same thing happen when I get married -- when I wanted to go and get married.</span> <span id="s151">Three times I applied, and they didn’t let me give, so I decided, hey, nobody’s going to hold me back, and -- and later, when I come back they arrest me, but the colonel comes, and releases me within -- and wants to put my commanding officer there in -- in my place in jail, because he says, “He was legitimately that he three times asked you, and you answer -- why didn’t you let him go?”</span> <span id="s152">He says to him, “I did not have anybody to replace his work, he was doing the work for three people.”</span> <span id="s153">So he says, “What did you do on those days that he was not here?</span> <span id="s154">When he was -- went away to get married?”</span> <span id="s155">“Well,” he says, “it was very hard, you know, but I mean to manage.”</span> <span id="s156">He says, “So you see, you could have managed, you could have said to him, you can only get three days, four days, two days, so therefore you are the guilty, and not Harold,” and he asked me at that particular time, as I -- my name at the time was Grigory Grisher, they -- everybody used to call me Harold, my name became in the USA.</span> <span id="s157">So -- and therefore, in my heart, all this here handling, was already a premonition of how I will escape, because I -- I appreciated the Soviet Union, that it gave me the opportunity to save my life, as well as so many more other Jews, that it could save their life and not be annihilated by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s158">But at the same time, I didn’t think that I owe them my life since I didn’t agree with the Communistic system.</span> <span id="s159">Communism was a very strange bedfellow in my mind.</span> <span id="s160">Even they tried to ingrain me through the school, and so on, but I -- I-I just didn’t -- didn’t go follow that.</span> <span id="s161">So that particular time, the animosity that I build up in myself, of the way the system works was already -- I was looking for that window, and especially, as I aforementioned before, when I went to register, and in the registration I find out that it -- being -- working with KGB I sort of -- not that I didn’t think it couldn’t happen, I didn’t believe that it would happen, because it was a -- an official thing, posted everywhere, that anybody who was living in Poland before 1939, and they wished to return back can do it.</span> <span id="s162">But all of a sudden, I was called in, and with a locked door, as anybody who wrote about authoritarian governments, or Communism the way, and the boss kept me from 10 in the morning til five o’clock, and questioning me about every little detail, which I sense that he wants to find something wrong in me, so he could go ahead.</span> <span id="s163">Although he did not have a good reason, if he wanted to jail me, he could.</span> <span id="s164">But somehow or other, he wanted to make a goo -- case for himself, and he couldn’t break me down.</span> <span id="s165">That not breaking down gave me a fever.</span> <span id="s166">I don’t know what I remembered saying that, about all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s168">No, we -- we do have this story on tape, and -- did you have something particular that you wanted -- wanted to say about that, because you -- we did get that story [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Well, if you have that story, so you know I escaped --</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: -- and I escaped to Bialystok, which it was the first stop to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I later found out that a -- KGB had sent two guys, which both of them are still alive, one in Israel, and one is in -- is -- is in the USA, that they were chasing after me to find me in Bialystok, and there, one day -- y-you know what I mean, from Bialystok I realized -- I met a friend of mine, and I wanted to go into city where -- in 1939, from where I sort of -- we -- we were chased out from there, because it became Third Reich, and finding in Bialystok a friend that we went to school with together, he forewarned me, he says, “Harold, please.</span> <span id="s174">You survived the war, why do you want to go back and get killed?”</span> <span id="s175">Because he mentioned me somebody who went into the city, and he did not hardly live a day before they killed him.</span> <span id="s176">And I must p-put in a note why that happened the way it happened.</span> <span id="s177">After all, somebody took away our homes, somebody took away our business.</span> <span id="s178">They did not want to have any witnesses to come back to claim it back.</span> <span id="s179">And the fact is wa -- I didn’t.</span> <span id="s180">I didn’t receive any money.</span> <span id="s181">All this time, while people got money from Germany, and I didn’t because I didn’t register til ma -- at the time, when 1952 was the deadline.</span> <span id="s182">So therefore, I understood the situation why.</span> <span id="s183">I did not want at that particular time, risk my life, and I listen to him, and realizing that -- since that it’s -- what is going on, I wanted to go deeper.</span> <span id="s184">And the reason I wanted to go deeper, I wanted to go a little bit more close, I came there for to Lódz, which it was a big industrial city before the war.</span> <span id="s185">And it was not totally destroyed during the war, it was some left over there, because that was the trend sort of -- some people, I met some more people over there that I knew from before, and we found out that’s the place to go.</span> <span id="s186">While being in Lódz, I meet up the Major Shpark, which it was his name, and he was the one also, who were after me to look in Minsk, because I was distrusted.</span> <span id="s187">To straighten up for the record was, that at that particular time when I made my papers, the new papers, I no longer was Zucherman, but my new name was Zissman, as I held to present.</span> <span id="s188">So, in other words, I had to change my name in order to get the documents from the Polish commission to transfer me.</span> <span id="s189">But under the name of Zissman, there was no record for them to go and listen, or ask, so therefore that’s what it helped me.</span> <span id="s190">I don’t believe I told it in the first recording, in that particular --</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: You did mention that too.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: And I wondered if you had ever thought of changing your name back from Zissman after you arrived in the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: I -- I was telling -- to tell you the truth, it was a grave mistake at that particular time, because I was so in -- I became to the United States, already had a child, and it’s sort of, what is it, we’re going to mix up a whole thing, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s195">So to me it wasn’t that far of my name, what -- what good is that going to me?</span> <span id="s196">And I remained with that name, however, at any time I tell my story, I -- or I file applications, or so, I still refer to that my birth name was Zucherman, and -- and my regular name was Zissman, the adopted name was Zissman.</span> <span id="s197">And it’s -- it became a joke to me.</span> <span id="s198">Z-Zissman from German means sweet, and Zucherman means from sugar.</span> <span id="s199">So in other words I always joke the sugar became sweeter, that’s why I used the name Zissman, and that was not too far fetched, you know what I mean, to do it.</span> <span id="s200">So I left it the way it is.</span> <span id="s201">So, after, in Lódz, meeting that Shpark, within a couple of days, I was in touched with a for -- with the former fighters of the partisan, and this ma -- people who already had formed the Zionistic party again, and the option was -- as they -- as it was called, the runners.</span> <span id="s202">They were there, tha -- from Hebrew Bricha.</span> <span id="s203">Anybody who ran away right now, and looked for an identity of where to go, and the -- the -- this -- the whole thing led us, the goal was to reach Israel, one way or the other, because we sort of -- no matter how I looked at it, Europe was an insecure place, because any country, other than Poland, I found had the same story, Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s204">It was only a matter of the percentages.</span> <span id="s205">And unfortunately, out of the six million, three million were killed in -- in Poland, because they corroborated much more than the people in other countries did, and -- and that was the results of it.</span> <span id="s206">So basically my zeal at that particular time was, end goal, to reach Israel, and I enlisted myself with the illegal party -- not ill -- it’s not the party, it was the part -- the Zionistic party, that they were doing, that helped to help those -- those who ran away, the runaways, sort of, to bring them in this year.</span> <span id="s207">And they accepted me, and immediately they made me the head of 10 more guys [indecipherable] and when we came from there, we -- from Lódz, we were sent to Kraków.</span> <span id="s208">And from Kraków, which is not too far from Czechoslovakia, we came to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s209">In Czechoslovakia, the Red Cross, which I met for the first time -- otherwise, during the war, I did not even know that the Red Cross existed, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s210">I knew that -- that it existed, but meaning not to speak derogatorily about it, there was no such thing wherever the ghettos was, anything to see the sign of a Red Cross, as they should be the -- the -- the people to help the Jews in any kind of way.</span> <span id="s211">But, so for the first time in Czechoslovakia, I have seen a Red Cross, and they had a kitchen open for many runaways, because people were changing from -- either that they were working in Germany, or they were enslaved for the -- in Germany, whatever it is that everybody was returning home.</span> <span id="s212">So the traffic back and forth from cu -- in countries existed, and the Red Cross, at that particular time, was available to give us a little helping hand.</span> <span id="s213">And they made us ID’s, and the destination of that particular time, was to go to Hungary, Budapest, from there.</span> <span id="s214">And we were on the train, and I don’t know what I mentioned that on the train we ran into some drunken Soviet soldiers, you know what I mean, and that we had -- since we -- I had more partisans with me, so we had to do what we had to do.</span> <span id="s215">And to save our women that we -- were with us, or the whole operation, that we were on an illegal way, and we just -- when we were going near a river, we just shoved them down on -- over the -- into the river.</span> <span id="s216">I don’t know what it was, the outcome of it, but we were [indecipherable] then the train stopped at Budapest, our minds, of the five of us that were there, were really thinking, who knows whether we may not hear a little call, because in Hungary still, the Soviets were occ -- on the occupation at that particular time.</span> <span id="s217">But, since it was quiet, we went to the community at that time, Communitaes rilita, and there sort of was an encampment for us where to sleep.</span> <span id="s218">And for the first time, we organized.</span> <span id="s219">The following mor -- day, that a demonstration that we are going to go to the consulate, which it was over there, British consulate, already in existence, and we made a protest march, declaring that Israel is supposed to become a state, so therefore it could house all it’s refugees, as we were to so many years, driven out historically from Israel, and is a time of our return to -- back to our homeland, from our ancestors.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: How many people were involved in that march?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: I give or take, not coming, because on the train, the whole group consisted of -- were over a hundred, but people of runaways that were already there in -- in Budapest at the time, ready to go to Bucharest, because the route at that particular time, called for us to go to Bucharest, Romania.</span> <span id="s222">And being that they were ca -- boarding near the ocean, from there we would illegally send them on ships, to go illegally to Palestine, as it was called, not Israel, but Palestine at the time, as it -- as it’s -- historically the name of the area was called Palestine.</span> <span id="s223">So -- but they changed on us in the middle.</span> <span id="s224">So to tell you approximately, the demonstration had at least about 200 people, at the event, in rows, orderly.</span> <span id="s225">Israeli flags were gi -- made to us, and we had inscriptions at that time of saying that -- that Israel should become a state.</span> <span id="s226">So it became to me, a new era of life, that all of a sudden, while I was not going where I’m going, I had some -- I had a goal in my life, I had some -- of re-establishing myself.</span> <span id="s227">And I felt very good about it, you know?</span> <span id="s228">And it was -- the marl thing was good, it -- my wife accompanied me, she did not sort of resist all of this, I think.</span> <span id="s229">She was in the same mind and mood, as to what I was doing.</span> <span id="s230">So, i-it sort of -- now I’m not by myself any more, I’m the -- we are two, and sort of it made a little bit my life easier, because I no longer was that one person like a stone in the desert.</span> <span id="s231">I use that word because that’s my feelings of the way it used to be.</span> <span id="s232">So now we -- we were a team.</span> <span id="s233">Just for the sake of it, I don’t know whether I told it in the other, we met our rabbi, who married us in her hometown, and he was apart over there to, where we were sleeping on bunk beds, and we were on the top, he was at the bottom, the bunk bed broke, and I almost -- he got injured from a nail from that, but not badly.</span> <span id="s234">But it was like I said, that little fun that we had to [indecipherable] accidents that had happened.</span> <span id="s235">And by that day --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: It was in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: In Budapest, yeah.</span> <span id="s238">When we were in Budapest, let me describe it to you.</span> <span id="s239">Over the Buda, there was not a single bridge, only pantoon bridges were left from the army, that [indecipherable] to cross over.</span> <span id="s240">They started already on -- working on restoring bridges, but that’s how it was.</span> <span id="s241">It was fresh after the war, and one could see the difference what it was in Poland, the way it -- it looked like -- there we saw shops, all of a sudden, you can go in and shop.</span> <span id="s242">So what I didn’t see in Boronivitch, or I didn’t see back in Poland, even -- you know what I mean, the whole thing was in markets, outdoor markets, it was in Lódz, or in Bialystok in the same way.</span> <span id="s243">Here, I saw an organized thing like this here, that wa -- sure it was destroyed the Buda, you know, but the civilian housing was not damaged as badly to say.</span> <span id="s244">And in -- say there were apartments, and people were shoppers, there was market.</span> <span id="s245">All of a sudden, we were given at that particular time, salamis and everything to take with us, after they changed us route not to go to Bucharest, but to go to Gratz.</span> <span id="s246">And the fun part was in Gratz was different orders.</span> <span id="s247">We were going -- our documents make -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: -- and the -- th-the most -- most likely was to cross over to the English zone, but the Soviets still were there.</span> <span id="s249">So we told the supplies, the food supplies that were given to us to take to that hotel, we coming to that hotel, we turn it into the kitchen, and then we had to worry about food for ourselves to eat.</span> <span id="s250">Something else happened in that hotel, which I do not know what I said to the other -- on the other tape, but I -- let’s forget what I said on the other tape, I want to tell it now, because that was very important.</span> <span id="s251">We came in there, and that was the English zone.</span> <span id="s252">We were -- we were told that if we ever go through to the English zone, we must be very polite and quiet.</span> <span id="s253">And as we were going to the hotel, our orders were we only go in groups of two and three, and nobody is to speak at all, if possible.</span> <span id="s254">If you do speak, manage to speak German.</span> <span id="s255">If you do not speak German, you must speak another language, sort of, because we would be going there as we are Austrian Jews.</span> <span id="s256">Therefore, Austrian Jews returning back from concentration camp, therefore it would have been no questions asbay cause at the time, the police there, when it was, shied away from all of these things, sort of as to wash themselves of all the atrocities against the Jews they did.</span> <span id="s257">Anyways, we came to a hotel, and for the first time, I met there in the hotel, a representative from the American Joint Committee, which they were there to help the refugees.</span> <span id="s258">I also met a party faithful over there, and I brem -- I remember he -- Pinhaus was his name, he was with red hair.</span> <span id="s259">So, between the two of them, that was the command.</span> <span id="s260">In other words, the Zionist side, the American aide side, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Excuse me, are you talking about the Joint Distribution Committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Committee, yeah, that they were, that particular time, already there in that hotel.</span> <span id="s263">We go into that hotel, we were housed where we should go, and before long I meet up over there a guy who was a guide, and he was with us in the forest, the partisans.</span> <span id="s264">In a way it was a ray of sunshine, you know?</span> <span id="s265">Lusek, I speak to him -- and I hear that he’s guiding -- I ask him first, I was -- wanted to go, ready with my group, I still kept the group, sort of like the 10, that we work together, as I said, to begin.</span> <span id="s266">I was their leader, or commander, if you want to call it.</span> <span id="s267">He says, “Harold, you and Sonia, you got to wait a little while.</span> <span id="s268">They’ll tell you when your turn comes.”</span> <span id="s269">And before long, since we made ourselves known that we are former partisans, fighters over there, we get an order that we are going to go, and we were told we are going to go to come to the river Moore, which it was a fast river, but a narrow one, and we are to cross that river, and on the other side of that river, we will immediately -- immediately enter to the English zone.</span> <span id="s270">Myself, being a platoon commander before, and the other guys being partisans, when we hear assignment like this here, we did not ask any questions whatsoever.</span> <span id="s271">We were given tickets to take the train, and we were to go from Gratz to Klagenford.</span> <span id="s272">And in Klagenford we were given the directions to go to the river, and there -- but we were told, don’t go like you’re marching, go like normal, two people again together.</span> <span id="s273">But when you come to the river, immediately I find out that in my group there were a few guys who could swim, and a few guys who couldn’t swim at all.</span> <span id="s274">And we were with women and men together.</span> <span id="s275">I decided that once we come there, to form a chain.</span> <span id="s276">I’ll lead the group first, I was a swimmer, and my wife was next, which she was not a swimmer, and that’s how I made the chain to be.</span> <span id="s277">So, by the time we stretch across, even with a little bit of paddling with our hands, we’ll be able to reach almost the other side.</span> <span id="s278">So swimming was not to be very far.</span> <span id="s279">All of a sudden, a galloping horse is heard, and a commanding officer, was in Soviet gear, comes over, he a -- makes [indecipherable] to stop, and of all people, he asks us question what we are trying to do, we are telling him we’re trying to swim in the river.</span> <span id="s280">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s281">But of course we did not have any bathing suit on, or anything like that, we are now civilian, and we didn’t have any problems what -- that’ll get wet [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s282">And of all the things, he arrests me.</span> <span id="s283">He arrests me, now of all things in the world, I’m an escapee from the Soviet Union, and from the KGB, and now, I finally, at the mement -- the moment of re-liberation, I should fall back?</span> <span id="s284">But I had no alternative, he immediately he had two more on horses with him, and -- and he’s already got a little squad, sort of, and I have none to say.</span> <span id="s285">Anyway, the rest of the group, with my wife together, go back, and they decided to get in contact, now again with the hotel in there, and telling them of what had transpired, and they just -- and they told that they’re sending out immediately, somebody who is going to handle the case, and take it over.</span> <span id="s286">Sure enough, within the nec -- by the next day, I immediately am taken to the jail, and in the jail, all the questions and answers that they gave me, was that I wanted to go to Klagenford, and my aim was to go further away in Italy, and I -- whichever I mentioned the name, they says, “Well, you don’t have to worry about it, we’ll send you there.”</span> <span id="s287">But being -- working for the KGB, and knowing them from the time that I know before the war, when we were -- were in their zone, I knew that when the Soviets tell you you gonna go to one place, you may wind up in Siberia until you get there.</span> <span id="s288">So I did not have my trust in that system, and I was really scared, but what could I do?</span> <span id="s289">I was -- no way for me to break out, I did not have in -- any money, or anypla -- anything at all.</span> <span id="s290">So I figured I got to wait for time, and see what is going to be.</span> <span id="s291">By the next day, it looks like somebody came from there, a courier, and it looks like they had money, and they knew how to bribe Soviet officials at that particular time, and they paid up, [indecipherable] for my freedom, and they let me out.</span> <span id="s292">When we came back to the hotel, I organized my 10 guys, immediately I posted to each door exceeding that hotel, I says, “Everybody stay, as the guy told me that nobody’s going to go out.</span> <span id="s293">Whoever is going to come in, you’ll know.</span> <span id="s294">Because we are not going to let -- be mistreated.</span> <span id="s295">We, because we were former fighters, are not going to be let into another situation like that.</span> <span id="s296">Josef Lusek is the name of the guy.</span> <span id="s297">The way he takes the other, we are going, and they’re going to take us tonight, not tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s298">I came in with an ultimatum to the office, and I told them, I says, “I have guards in all the exits from my guys, nobody’s going to go out.”</span> <span id="s299">I says, “You dealing with former partisans.</span> <span id="s300">And remember, our ch -- our duty did not finish as yet, we are not in Israel as yet, and that’s what we’re aiming to be.</span> <span id="s301">I’m not going to let you guys play with our lifes any longer.</span> <span id="s302">Nobody is going out of the hotel tonight.”</span> <span id="s303">And I spoke -- meanwhile, Lusek comes over, he tried to calm me down, and he says, “Harold, I know your wife from days past, before I knew you.</span> <span id="s304">I’ll take you,” -- my wife, I says, “Never mind to all of these here things, “My group goes with you, and you are going to be responsible for all of us.</span> <span id="s305">If anything foul plays [indecipherable] remember, we are not going to remain silent.</span> <span id="s306">You know us from the forest.”</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Let me ask you something here.</span> <span id="s308">Were the other people in the hotel that Lusek was taking across --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: -- were they involved with the Bricha also, or was this just --</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: They were involved just like we refugees, who looking to go forward to Israel.</span> <span id="s312">However, there were people with money, people who went smuggling while I was working with idealism, and they were mi -- Black Marketeering, and they already got so many -- made money, and about it, and ma -- and you know, it was payola, immediately went into existence at that particular time.</span> <span id="s313">And I found it out quickly, and this is where I made a point, I banged the table in the -- in the office, and I told him, “No, it’s not going to go on like that.</span> <span id="s314">I speak for my group.</span> <span id="s315">I’m their leader, and that’s what is gonna be.</span> <span id="s316">And tonight, if any plans you have about leaving any group, I don’t care who the others are, we are going,” and Lusek, he was -- I called him into -- be in presence, so I says, “You know.</span> <span id="s317">You the leader, and you the guide, but command, I will have.</span> <span id="s318">I and my wife will be -- ride next to you and your wife.”</span> <span id="s319">She was there, too.</span> <span id="s320">And remember, there will be no foul play.</span> <span id="s321">So he told us, “We’ll have to enter a barn.</span> <span id="s322">In that barn in the mountains over there, is where the Soviets [indecipherable] are there, we have to bribe him, we have to pay him -- pay him off, and therefore they’ll let the group go through.”</span> <span id="s323">And he warned us, “They will -- they probably may body search you, and if they find anything of value, they might take it away, they may liquidate it.</span> <span id="s324">Don’t make a resistance, because otherwise you’ll spoil the whole operation.”</span> <span id="s325">I really did not have much, but at the same time, a ring f -- we had from my father and mother, we had a watch, and so on.</span> <span id="s326">So my wife, what she did, she had some yarn, you know what I mean, for knitting a sweater, so on.</span> <span id="s327">So she took some of the valuables, made a ball out of it, you know what I mean, wrapped it inside, so in a way we figured that what so.</span> <span id="s328">Then we came to that barn, like you said, anyways -- I rushed a little bit too fast.</span> <span id="s329">They accepted my -- what I dema -- my demands, and my group was going with that -- the whole group together must have been about another 20 people, so we were a big column, and when we came to that barn, like I said, which he explained that to us, we started -- they started to body search us, you know what I mean, and so on.</span> <span id="s330">So happened that to my group, nobody had any valuables, really, to worry about.</span> <span id="s331">We did not try to acquired it in that time that we were involved with.</span> <span id="s332">But, there were some people who had to pay off, you know, give this, and we became knowledgeable before watid.</span> <span id="s333">Now, we already on the other side of the barn, and we’re ane on the English zone, physically.</span> <span id="s334">We walked for --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: I want to remind you that we do have all of this on the other tape, so we don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: You still have that?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Yeah, we have --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Okay, so not --</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: -- we have all of th -- we have everything up until when you left for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: But -- but I just had a few, focused questions, so we don’t want to go over everything again.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Ask me any questions, and I’ll answer them.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: One thing was -- well, I did have another question about your march in Budapest, you had mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Did anything come -- become of that?</span> <span id="s346">You had -- you had a couple hundred people marching.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Well, the only thing was it was so new a thing that it never existed before.</span> <span id="s348">Later on I found out that these type of marches existed also in Romania, and perhaps in other sources.</span> <span id="s349">But it was totally new to us, and it was totally new in Budapest for something like that to happen.</span> <span id="s350">Absolutely we must say that later on, you know, I’ve told -- we are talking right now about 1945, you know it -- Israel didn’t become a state til 1948, but you know that in the intervening years, of these three years, a lot of demonstrations of that type begin to happen, be in Europe, be in is -- be in isra -- not Israel, but Palestine, or in the United States of this same way, until the resolution finally came to pass, that Israel was granted statehood.</span> <span id="s351">So I mean, it was -- perhaps it -- I di -- cannot claim that it was -- we were the beginners of that, but be -- because later I found out that similar things went on.</span> <span id="s352">So I don’t want to go ahead to take a first eenadida, but it was a first in Budapest, where it should happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Did you -- you were obviously preparing to go to is -- Palestine.</span> <span id="s354">Did you have very strong feelings at the time, about going to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Absolutely, as in my former tape, I said I was -- since childhood, and in the school I graduated, Yaven in Poland, Zionism was imbedded in me.</span> <span id="s356">I -- I had to hide it through Hitlerite times, and I had to hide it in the time of the Soviet’s occupation, which it was -- I know they called it liberation, but let’s -- let -- let it be for history to judge, whether it was occupational, or it was liberation.</span> <span id="s357">But inside, that spark lit up, at that particular time in Lódz.</span> <span id="s358">No sooner I met up in -- you know, in found that former shamring, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s359">Which it was that it was shameratsyer, that it was a youth organization belonging to the Zionist organization, and that spark kept through me, it was the new thing, just like it was the thing for getting out of the ghetto, and become a resister, and fight the Nazis, this is how it was, the new fighting that it became in me, and I assume in the rest of the guys that are war with me, because when people resorted themselves to go on train -- to a -- rooftops, and on the steps to go with -- wi-with -- with [indecipherable] on their shoulders, and speeds of the trains maybe 70 - 80 miles an hour, maybe 60, t-times 50, doesn’t matter the speed.</span> <span id="s360">But it was dangerous, it was a dangerous mission to do.</span> <span id="s361">But it was a goal in our hearts imbedded, that we must go to see for freedom and liberty for ourselves, someplace where we could be safe from annihilation, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: So, what I didn’t understand from the in -- the video then, was how -- how you a -- came to agree to go to the United States, rather than to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: I’ll tell you that, because it was deception in the party.</span> <span id="s364">While I was working in Italy, sending illegals away, and one day I came telling them that my wife became pregnant.</span> <span id="s365">When I told them about the news, they say -- and I want to go with my group, illegals, they says, “No, Harold, you stay here on the point, you’re doing very good, and we are expecting to get legal passage.</span> <span id="s366">We will send you the first thing -- you know what I mean, for legal passage.”</span> <span id="s367">I succumbed to that, because to me it sound very real, the words that they were telling me, an-and I was -- what we were doing in the kibbutzim is preparing them for Israel, and so on.</span> <span id="s368">However, the day came, and the free passage, as we called them, certificates at that particular time became -- and I come to Rome, to find out what’s going on, I hear that as they were passing out certificates to some people, but all of a sudden, I came and I asked my man in charge, “What happened to me, and my wife?”</span> <span id="s369">He says, “Well, there wasn’t enough this time, but we expect pretty soon to have more.”</span> <span id="s370">And at that particular time, you know, it was already -- of course, she was not -- she probably must have been -- give or take at that particular time, maybe in her fifth month, you know, because I’m -- I’m not counting at this time the times.</span> <span id="s371">I came the second time to Rome, when the next batch of certificates came, and all of a sudden, people begin to laugh at me.</span> <span id="s372">They s-say, “Oh, Harold, you don’t want to go to Israel any more, you trying to go to America.”</span> <span id="s373">You deceived the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s374">And I felt really, in my heart, that somebody put me down too low, it was too much.</span> <span id="s375">So then I said to my commanding officer, “I’ll tell you, I’m resigning my post.</span> <span id="s376">I am going to register to go for Israel -- for United States, instead of going to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s377">At that particular time, they start pleading with me, “Okay, if you want to go to Palestine, fine, but we still want you to go on a no -- a kibbutz near Rome.”</span> <span id="s378">Where -- that story is printed in one of the books that -- for my -- one of my men, who was in my platoon, his name was Kigernovitch, Moshe Kigernovitch, and he described part of that stor -- that story.</span> <span id="s379">He pleaded with me at that time to write the [indecipherable] personal thing that I wrote in my manuscript, but I was not ready and I couldn’t try it.</span> <span id="s380">At that particular time I was not ready to sit down and write my life’s story.</span> <span id="s381">That’s why I refused, but h -- I have -- he recorded it with my picture, and him, and acknowledging that I was the comoon -- platoon commander, or commandeers ruddid, way they say it in -- in Russian.</span> <span id="s382">And it’s in his book.</span> <span id="s383">Unfortunately the book is only written in Yiddish, and it never been translated, because he is writing not just about the forest where we were, he is writing about a lot of other forests, the partisans, Jewish partisans existed, because he wanted for historical sake, to acknowledge that Jews did fight in the partisans, and Jews participated in resistance, okay?</span> <span id="s384">So, at that particular time, as we are right now which you asking me the question, I had Zionism in me, but it was dormant for these years, because I had to, but as soon -- the sooner -- it got ignited very easily, they -- somebody did not have to sort of hit me, and to say, “Hey Harold, what are you doing?”</span> <span id="s385">I was right there, and I was willing to risk, in those days, my life.</span> <span id="s386">So therefore, when he put me down, I says, “No, I’m not going to sway things to send others to go illegally,” which it was a lot of hardship with going through illegally.</span> <span id="s387">“And I am going to s -- go to America.</span> <span id="s388">So therefore, I’m resigning, and that’s all.”</span> <span id="s389">I therefore enlisted myself at that time to come to Florence, Italy, which I joi -- I -- I lived -- what you sa -- everything is told, until I came to Italy, until the United States.</span> <span id="s390">So, you probably know the story, the way we were taken out of the camp there, and we were put it into DP camps in Italy, and then I, instead of being in a camp, was then out of the camp, and I worked with the illegal elleah, which it was kibbutzim, and I was the leader there, and train them, and descend them.</span> <span id="s391">And like I say, at that time, when I said that, they say, “Harold, you can go the next time with next group we are sid -- we are shipping, and you can go with them.”</span> <span id="s392">I says, “Are you for real, or you just trying to?”</span> <span id="s393">I says, “My wife entered already the sixth month.”</span> <span id="s394">I says, “In the sixth month of pregnancy you ask me to -- I should go ahead to gamble with the lives of two, my wife and the baby?”</span> <span id="s395">I says, “No, I cannot do that.</span> <span id="s396">Therefore, I refuse, and” -- and that’s how I wound up in Florence, Italy, and I came in there, and started to write to my family.</span> <span id="s397">My mother had a sister here, and three brothers, and I wrote to them, and we started a whole new thing about it, because until now, all the letters that I sent to America, never send them a -- an address, but [indecipherable] address.</span> <span id="s398">I used to drive my aunt crazy.</span> <span id="s399">She heard from me, and she did not know where she can correspond with me.</span> <span id="s400">But at that particular time, when we came to Florence, we in -- stop -- we established writing through the army post, unival, and -- because the regular post was still not operating too much.</span> <span id="s401">And -- and this is where my decision was reached that I’m going to go to the -- to the USA.</span> <span id="s402">Being in the USA, my Zionism again did not change, I still remained a Zionist, and as soon we landed, I hardly made a living, but I immediately joined -- we had at that particular time, the new citizen club.</span> <span id="s403">It was an organization and a club.</span> <span id="s404">And we used to meet -- have meetings, sometimes to raise money for our cause of existence, people would have dances, or raffle tickets or so on, the usual way.</span> <span id="s405">And again, it imbued in me anew, I’m a Zionist, even -- and someday -- I didn’t at that particular time talk about going to Israel, when you already have a child in the United States, and f -- we came in ’48, March 14.</span> <span id="s406">22 months old then my daughter was.</span> <span id="s407">And the next year, 1949, in September, my son is born.</span> <span id="s408">So I was -- looks like too busy with having children instead of talking about operational way to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: So it -- your family being in the United States, was that the crucial thing that made you come to the United States, rather than going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: No, it was not the crucial, it was the helping point.</span> <span id="s411">You must remember the importance.</span> <span id="s412">I did not have money, I did not have means.</span> <span id="s413">We were living -- after I entered in Florence, we were living under the help from the UNRRA, the United Nations Relief Organizations, that they -- but we formed the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s414">So, in other words, I want to explain it, as I said a little before.</span> <span id="s415">My Zionism was still there.</span> <span id="s416">Again, we form a kibbutz, even in that, while we’re waiting to go to America.</span> <span id="s417">I still have pictures to prove that, with the name of the kibbutz, and in Florence, and I was -- I have the pictures to prove I was speaking about Zionism, and how we must do.</span> <span id="s418">Although I was going to America, but the support for Israel, I never -- it stopped being a -- a dire participant belonging, even though today, and all through the years since 1953, I’m a member of the B’nai Brith.</span> <span id="s419">But I’m still a Jew who belongs to the Zionist causes and so on.</span> <span id="s420">And it’s not just belonging in person, but with my pocket also, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s421">The Israeli bonds that I’m buying, or to charitable events that you know, where you -- you give charity to these here.</span> <span id="s422">So, all of these here, because I changed to bad leadership, at that particular time, so my route did change, but inside of me, my heart did not change a little bit, and I remained of the same way.</span> <span id="s423">So now, when I came to Chicago, and I must make it -- I went to high school -- I went to one of the best high schools at the time that it was, it was in Austin High.</span> <span id="s424">And not to tell you the story, as a fact, it’s not a story, within three semesters I made American high school.</span> <span id="s425">At the same time, looks like the principal says to me, how come I’m not going to go to college now, because I was working at night.</span> <span id="s426">And I want you to understand, I made a point there.</span> <span id="s427">At six o’clock in the morning, I used to get up, take a streetcar to go to work -- of course, I did not have a car, as yet.</span> <span id="s428">And from s -- from the store I used to go to school, which it was a streetcar, as we called it at that time, going all the way to school.</span> <span id="s429">Do my homework at that time, going there.</span> <span id="s430">School would start at about eight o’clock, to 10 at night, two hours, and it was regular school.</span> <span id="s431">Of course, it was grownups, so you had a lot of homework to be given, and certain thing would be done at school, such as reading, or on the blackboard to the big [indecipherable] like the -- the kids [indecipherable] today.</span> <span id="s432">And I would come home, the earliest was 11 o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s433">My wife and kids were asleep, so my dinner, sort of like I said, was grabbing a bite in the store.</span> <span id="s434">I was working at that time in a grocery store for a brother of my mother’s, my uncle.</span> <span id="s435">And that’s what it was, my routine.</span> <span id="s436">So between six in the morning, til the 11, or 11:30 at times, that was working, and then working with my head, and working so hard, but I established -- so like I said to the principal, I says, “I -- by all means, I’d love to go further myself in college,” which I never did, unfortunately, but my kids did, so I’m happy that I did -- was a good father to my children.</span> <span id="s437">And I didn’t complain or anything like that, and I had wa -- it was a challenging thing that I could achieved, to know how to read, and to know how to write, and you know, and that’s what -- and in the meanwhile, this -- we are talking about 1949, where my son is born.</span> <span id="s438">By 1953, I mastered all that I had in me, to sit down and write my manuscript, which of course, I to -- it took me a year, and -- and a nervous breakdown afterwards, because when I speak about these things, even now, I am not here with you in the good USA, I’m there, where it was.</span> <span id="s439">I’m there time, the way it was.</span> <span id="s440">And thanks God that I can control my emotions today better than I could in those years past, because it was too fresh an issue, and my thing was record, and to tell for posterity.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Before we go on with that, I wanted to ask you more about your -- I have a couple of questions about Italy.</span> <span id="s442">You mentioned you were involved in the camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: -- administration in Modena, and you also mentioned you were involved in organizing the kibbutz, with -- are those two separate things, or the same things?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Separate things.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Can you tell me something about the camp administration?</span> <span id="s447">What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: I was in the administration, there was no specific titles.</span> <span id="s449">We were in Modena, which -- it was a camp from the former military academy, where we got in one day only from Mauthausen, Austria, they got in trucks, and unloaded human cargo, just like it was regular cargo of something else, because they did not look like humans.</span> <span id="s450">And in that big crowd, of all these people, of 5,000, from one truck that they unload them, and we are staying there on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s451">That was -- and please let me correct it for the recod -- it was still in Bolognia, we afterwards came to Modena.</span> <span id="s452">We’re standing on the outside, we have nothing more than blankets or anything like that.</span> <span id="s453">When my wife points at me, she says, “Harold, look, this man is my uncle’s brother.”</span> <span id="s454">I said, “Careful, how -- are you sure?”</span> <span id="s455">The man was swollen, you know what I mean, and so on.</span> <span id="s456">We -- we come near, and she says to him, “Isn’t your name,” she says, “you know, Laserovitchasun?”</span> <span id="s457">And he looks, a-and sort of somebody says something to me, he was not talk himself.</span> <span id="s458">He says, “Don’t you have a brother Misha Mandel, he’s my uncle?”</span> <span id="s459">You know, and we got from there.</span> <span id="s460">We kept company with him throughout, because from there we were ordered to go to Modena, and we were housed in the military academy, that’s’ where they made a camp.</span> <span id="s461">People were sleeping on the floors, laying.</span> <span id="s462">It was just like sardines.</span> <span id="s463">But somehow or other, there was no protests.</span> <span id="s464">The biggest protest what we had, that we had a camp right next door to us, housing former Nazis, in there -- which it was some SS with them, and so on.</span> <span id="s465">And every day it used to start a rumbling, with stones, bottles, or anything like that to these Nazis.</span> <span id="s466">The MP would come -- the American MP would come to quelch it.</span> <span id="s467">And we told him, “If you want it to be quiet, either you move us to another place, or you move them away, because we will not remain,” -- to us, it was a lie that we didn’t care if somebody will be arrested, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s468">But to look at a Nazi face on, that was something that we could not let our minds to say, “Oh, it was yesterday, it was a war.”</span> <span id="s469">Because we knew the first thing, if these guys would have been on the -- this side of the fence, not the other, they would be more than happy to kill the -- us again, you know what I mean, because it was imbued in their lives.</span> <span id="s470">It was not that they seeked revenge because of some, there was no because.</span> <span id="s471">That’s what it was, the training that they got.</span> <span id="s472">Finally, within a few days, the camp was moved, with the SS, and we remained in that camp.</span> <span id="s473">Now, that camp was a mixture of youth, middle aged people, pregnant, sick and the biggest thing being in the administration, what we were seeking for help.</span> <span id="s474">The army, of course, provided us at that particular time, I must say, with blankets, and so on, because they couldn’t rebuild it -- the -- the military academy, but they gave us help.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Which -- which army?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: The US army.</span> <span id="s477">The US army was stationed in Florence, in -- not in -- not Florence, I mean in -- in Modena at that particular time.</span> <span id="s478">There was also the -- part of the British army, which it was attached to them, which the Israeli part was a part of them, too, and they were the ones, as I mentioned, brought us into Italy from Austria, and it was also over there, a part of the Polish -- a -- a Polish -- a part of the Polish army, which it was along with the Britain.</span> <span id="s479">So we had at least one thing, since we didn’t speak Italian at that particular time.</span> <span id="s480">But we could speak Hebrew to these here, we could speak Polish to the other soldiers, and they all were, in a way, I must confess, they were all trying to help us one way or the other, but when we [indecipherable] on it for anything and everything, looks like the patience va -- to say be patient was not the right answer.</span> <span id="s481">And I, being in the administration, had the opportunity to see a person from the jewi -- Joint Distribution Committee, but she was in an English -- a British uniform.</span> <span id="s482">How that came about, or what -- that she was not with the American army, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s483">I cannot go into details.</span> <span id="s484">And she came to the -- to our place where we would meet, and she asked us the question, what could we help you?</span> <span id="s485">And I asked her at that time, I said, “Where should I start?”</span> <span id="s486">So therefore, I’ll start and tell you.</span> <span id="s487">We have here young people, at the ages of about 14 - 15 - 16.</span> <span id="s488">You got to remember, these people were taken to the camps, as -- as kids.</span> <span id="s489">Now they are teenagers.</span> <span id="s490">Through the -- through the -- if anybody was 10 years of age, you got to imagine he is now -- I says -- we -- we -- we encountered venereal disease in there means, because it was open prostitution in Italy, you know, on the street.</span> <span id="s491">But these kids did not know, you know what I mean, any better, they were not brought -- I says, “So therefore, I’ll make my biggest request to you, let’s take the kids out of the camp.”</span> <span id="s492">And before long, which again I have pictures to prove you -- that point, if at any time you interested, but since we are doing it just for -- on a tape like that, but if you would be interested, I will be more than happy to supply with copies of the pictures, where, at this particular time, the Palestine brigade, or the Jewish brigade, as it was called, which it was attached to the British fifth army, came in to help, not the Joint Distribution Committee, and with their trucks, which you will see on the pictures, I’ll -- I’ll show them to you afterwards, which with their trucks, we took the kids, and we shi-shipped them out to a separate camp to make a camp, where they could be tended to the needs those youngsters were needing, and they were the first ones to be shipped even illegally to Israel, by means that we were not even aware of how, but they shipped them out, and they gave them the treatment that needed.</span> <span id="s493">The next thing was we send -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Harold Zissman.</span> <span id="s495">Okay, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: All the others, the grownups, who remained on the waiting list, or what it may become later, some of them were integrated through the parties, because I must confess, the party system immediate -- immediately began . . . immediately the parties began, even it was camp life, and there was the Revisionist party, the a -- the Ashumer party, in other words meaning Jharbortinsky’s party to the right, and it was to the middle, and to the left.</span> <span id="s497">And it could be visible to those of us who were working in the administration, and to those of us who were organized, that it was immediately my people, your people, and so on.</span> <span id="s498">But it’s one thing I must confess.</span> <span id="s499">The harmony for the good of the cause existed.</span> <span id="s500">It was not an open bipartisan, it not -- b-but it was bipartisan.</span> <span id="s501">Everybody understood the need of the time, and so on.</span> <span id="s502">From there, it started to group out, from the big camp there.</span> <span id="s503">The kibbutzim, it started at that time.</span> <span id="s504">I at that particular time joined a seminar which -- it was near Milano, and there were instructions to be taught to us.</span> <span id="s505">Professor -- there was a professor over there, I gotta thi -- I gotta think of his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Fir -- Garfinkel?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Garfinkel.</span> <span id="s508">Oh, you know already [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: You -- you did --</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: You know my story about it.</span> <span id="s511">I’m glad that you’re aware about my story.</span> <span id="s512">Yeah, Professor Garfinkel, he was a light to us, explaining and teaching us, and a lot of these things went into our head very well.</span> <span id="s513">Even though, at that particular time, I did not think of anything else but Ashumer, meaning the party to the left, as I started in the youth organization.</span> <span id="s514">I couldn’t help it, I was with them, and I could sense in that seminar, that that seminar was orchestrated by my party, or so -- and I mean -- in other words, the party to the left.</span> <span id="s515">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: I have a question about -- y-you talked in the other interview about recruiting -- about being involved with recruiting the young people to go to Israel, with these groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Well [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: So you did -- you talked about it some, and I wanted to know -- this is kind of a -- a question that -- that you might have something to say about and you might not, but I’ve heard some talk about -- about there being discrimination in Israel against camp survivors, and that there was some looking down on camp survivors in particular because of what they had been through.</span> <span id="s519">Did you witness any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Well, I can tell you that much.</span> <span id="s521">Being in that -- s -- you can call that a camp, in the military academy’s building that we were, that was a camp.</span> <span id="s522">To see what Hitler did to our people is -- I’ll describe it in plain.</span> <span id="s523">There wasn’t a night passing by without in the middle of the night that it would start almost like a regular riot.</span> <span id="s524">Kapo, you heard an outcry kapo, meaning, a kapo is the German name for the leader of a group.</span> <span id="s525">And these leaders were the ones who were smiten -- smiting the Jews, and punishing the Jews.</span> <span id="s526">The Hitlerites always got a double pleasure, to see when a Jew hits another Jew, you know?</span> <span id="s527">And in the meanwhile, those people who recognize it, we had to call in the MP’s, and it was a terrible, terrible situation to keep.</span> <span id="s528">That’s why we realized we gotta break the camp away from it, but the entire camp feeling, which you ask me, I did not know this.</span> <span id="s529">And to say that in Israel it was a feeling against them, no.</span> <span id="s530">If it was a feeling against them, it was among people -- in other words, between camp leaderships and so on.</span> <span id="s531">What per -- say to generalize that, I couldn’t -- I wouldn’t agree on that part at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: It was -- I -- I had heard something about how maybe there was some discrimination be -- be -- on the part of -- of some of the people who were interested in building the state of Israel because they were looking for people who were strong, and who would fight, and there was some discrimination because it was assumed that people who were in camps didn’t resist enough.</span> <span id="s533">And I was wondering whether you saw any of that kind of discrimination.</span> <span id="s534">So you didn’t see any -- you’re saying you didn’t see anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: I -- I didn’t see it, but it’s -- remains a situation of division for always and forever, basically.</span> <span id="s536">There is more told what it went on in the camps.</span> <span id="s537">All the horror stories are more knowledgeable, be in film, be in script, and so on.</span> <span id="s538">The resistance story is still a novice, in my book.</span> <span id="s539">I read quite a few books, but the real stories, and the more the merrier, because it needs to be told more no-now.</span> <span id="s540">Israel, per se, did not have anything but open arms that they extended to us at that particular time.</span> <span id="s541">And we must confess, those people who were in the camps, those people who were in the partisans, they were the front lines, who immediately joined from those illegal ships, when the war broke out in Israel, be that it was not fully recognizable, but in 1948, when Israel got status as a state of Israel, at that particular time, you saw yesterday’s camp inmates, yesterday’s people who came from hiding, or they were fighting in the partisans.</span> <span id="s542">As I me -- forementioned before, there was a bipartisan way, and it was no discrimination going on here.</span> <span id="s543">Yes, there was a discrimination at the time that it happened in Israel, bipartisan, with that ship that it blew up in ammunition, and so on.</span> <span id="s544">And I’m sure you’ve heard about it, but that is not my time, or my story here to talk about it, that is already recorded.</span> <span id="s545">But Esterburg say, you resisted, or didn’t resisted, was sort of a question mark in a school level, or otherwise, and that goes on til this day.</span> <span id="s546">When I come to Israel, I was there only about a year and a half ago, and the same thing so many years afterwards, when I wa -- came into the kibbutz what the partisans have over there, and I could find a lot of the -- m-my name is in there, and a matter of fact, I’m sending them, I didn’t finish, a -- a biography in short -- my biography in short, it will be about 10 pages, so they could record it, but I couldn’t s -- s -- find any animosity, or any criticism.</span> <span id="s547">It’s just minds that have -- want to know, to fill in the void about how we resisted.</span> <span id="s548">Not -- and the other thing, that it was resistance.</span> <span id="s549">And I still must tell you, I know year after year, when I go to the awareness days, when I come here, I was there last month, and I’m going to go again this year in March again.</span> <span id="s550">When I talk to these here high school kids, be -- yo-you find -- last time in -- it was the biggest, curious thing happened to me is I had a Israeli -- the parents were Israeli, the kid was born in Israel, but he was over here with -- because they moved here.</span> <span id="s551">He knew nothing about the Holocaust whatsoever.</span> <span id="s552">To him was just a novice thing that he just heard it, and especially my telling him that I was in the partisans.</span> <span id="s553">I had 10 students around my table, and I think it was the most active table in many tables around, not that the other ones didn’t.</span> <span id="s554">But somehow or other, it was a curious thing to those who understand.</span> <span id="s555">And after all, I’m dealing with kids let’s say 15 - 16 years of age, and they know what it is, resistant to -- in the word, to understand.</span> <span id="s556">But they had a general view, story is not known.</span> <span id="s557">But as soon you open up your mind, the question always comes up, why weren’t there more?</span> <span id="s558">Not that I wanted more.</span> <span id="s559">There was in every country of Europe, let’s for the fact, be Martial Tito in Yugoslavia, be the French Resistance in -- in France.</span> <span id="s560">No matter which country you want to name, where resistance existed, there were Jews in there.</span> <span id="s561">Were they in the percentages that it should have been, no.</span> <span id="s562">However, the public lacks the understanding.</span> <span id="s563">First of all, the physical make-up of those people in the ghettos, if they were longer, were not to be able to became fighters and resisters.</span> <span id="s564">But the Warsaw ghetto proved it, that they did resist, and they did hold for two weeks, much more than the armies in Poland held the Germans from entering Poland.</span> <span id="s565">So, there was resistance in other ghettos besides Warsaw, too.</span> <span id="s566">But to resist in the way that we joined the resistance of the partisans, of the Soviet partisans, or wherever, in the other countries.</span> <span id="s567">That is an understanding that we lacked the organization, we lacked the willingness of the people involved in it to say come and join us.</span> <span id="s568">Because it took me a hard time, almost three weeks to find them, and after I found them, my group of four, we had a hard time explaining to the commander that we could not.</span> <span id="s569">How do we obtain weapons?</span> <span id="s570">Yes, we went on the ambush with them, and that’s how they got weapons, and that’s when it -- and the -- and the majority were good fighters, among the top fighters.</span> <span id="s571">And I’m talking about the Jewish fighters, not that I’m trying to glamorize the situation, but tell the facts for posterity’s sake, that people should know about it.</span> <span id="s572">Because we were a fighter who had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s573">The other fighters had a lot to lose.</span> <span id="s574">They had families, they didn’t want to go to work in Germany.</span> <span id="s575">So the Belarus, for instance, or those leftover soldiers who didn’t want to wind up in POW camps, they were -- they had a lot to lose, because they had families and everything.</span> <span id="s576">But any Jew who came onto the partisans, or to the resistance, remember, his last -- whatever he had he -- blood in him, or whatever he had power to resist, he resisted, because it was the last fight.</span> <span id="s577">Every day was the last fight of his life that he’d been fighting.</span> <span id="s578">So it’s understanding that they -- we could be among the ones to be talked about a lot.</span> <span id="s579">And unfortunately, so far, it isn’t talked enough.</span> <span id="s580">You see how hard I told you I have to go ahead to have my manuscript published.</span> <span id="s581">There is no takers.</span> <span id="s582">Looks like if I was to wrote a novel, which a lot of times people told me -- and maybe they’ll encourage me to do, but how in a novel -- where, in a novel it’s fantasy?</span> <span id="s583">You don’t necessarily hear the true story about it, but looks like people in a -- buying a novel is easier to sell, or easier, in other words, to sell it to the -- to the people responsible for publishing, as well as the public perhaps reading it.</span> <span id="s584">Looks like people do not want to read a lot the horror stories what it went on.</span> <span id="s585">And again, it was directly against just a minority, the Jews, for not giving the reason why.</span> <span id="s586">So I suppose maybe that has a reason, but for the sake of history, and for the future generation, this story must be told, be inscript -- be -- what we are doing right now, and just tell our stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: You mentioned your family in the United States, and you also mentioned that in the first interview, that the aunt who was here in the US, that you were corresponding with -- with, was a favorite of yours.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: How did you know her?</span> <span id="s590">How di -- had she -- when did she come to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: She came in 1929, at the same time when we -- we moved over to another city from where I was born.</span> <span id="s592">And we moved -- the name of that city was Australenka, and I still with my mother, went to the train to say good-bye to her.</span> <span id="s593">And she was favorite with me when I was a child, up to then.</span> <span id="s594">You know, I was only seven years of age in 1929.</span> <span id="s595">But the point was, to ever she was go out, leave for picnics, whatever it is, I was -- I -- like she took me like -- she loved me -- not at -- like she loved me, she loved me so much that she always was -- the other part about it, from the other nieces and nephew what they had, they were not there, in Poland they were all -- in America, her brothers were already before that in America.</span> <span id="s596">And so she came to America that time.</span> <span id="s597">My mother would keep at that time, sort of a promise that I -- we should be in contact.</span> <span id="s598">So while my mother was write, she would go ahead to ask me to write the address to her.</span> <span id="s599">So therefore, in my mind, it just imbued that I remembered -- I could not even pronounce good in English in those years, the address.</span> <span id="s600">But at that address, where she was living in Chicago was so memorized by me, and my few words that I used to write so we can keep contact.</span> <span id="s601">So yes, she remembered me as the child when she left Poland.</span> <span id="s602">And when I first got in touch with her, it was the whole story of our lives, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s603">They had to make papers three times, to bring us in, like I was telling you.</span> <span id="s604">So what was the reason?</span> <span id="s605">At first she thought that I’m still single, because I couldn’t write in the letters through that army that I’m telling her that I already am married.</span> <span id="s606">So they made out immediately papers for me to come.</span> <span id="s607">No sooner we got more in touch, they found out that I’m married.</span> <span id="s608">So, at that time they made the second papers.</span> <span id="s609">The third papers they made th -- because our baby -- our daughter was already born, so that was the reason I had to make three times the papers.</span> <span id="s610">So -- some -- some of the data, I mean, was misconstrued, but that is -- that is a minor situation, we are not going to go into that, that was -- so our love re-establish our -- itself, immediately.</span> <span id="s611">However, the other three brothers that they were here, they were much -- they were much -- they were in America probably before I was born.</span> <span id="s612">So I therefore couldn’t go ahead to remember them, but the first, in Chicago, for instance, we had the -- one of the -- there was originally four, but one of them was already dead.</span> <span id="s613">So in Chicago we -- I had two uncles, and my aunt.</span> <span id="s614">In Los Angeles I had a third brother, he was the oldest, which again, none of them, besides my aunt, remembered me as a child in Poland.</span> <span id="s615">And after all they -- I started working later for my uncle, and that was my mother’s brother, he was in the grocery business.</span> <span id="s616">And, as I forementioned with going to school, that was the store I was working for, for him.</span> <span id="s617">So I know how much further in the story that I told, I do -- over there.</span> <span id="s618">I joined again immediately an organization, we called them the new citizens.</span> <span id="s619">So, in Chicago, we dwe -- used to have meetings, and like I aforementioned, and make money f-for existence, and above all, to help Israel, be that it was already -- when the bonds came in existence to be -- the bond drives.</span> <span id="s620">Be otherwise -- ambulances to send to Israel, or any of these -- it was basically -- all what we did was raising money, and funds through all means, be that it was a dance, be that it was a dinner, be it was membership, but it all was -- the idea about it Israel.</span> <span id="s621">And all of us were a bunch together, but again, the story prevailed with me, there were not that many fighters, there was all concentration inmates.</span> <span id="s622">And we did not have any misunderstanding because and how and what.</span> <span id="s623">And sooner or later we found out, you know what I mean, the way it was.</span> <span id="s624">I remember when Israel’s sen -- fifth anniversary came, and we had a guy from the embassy coming to speak to us, and I was on the committee, I always belonged someplace, and I always didn’t just remain not to belong, or be on the committee or whatever it is, because I cared for it so much.</span> <span id="s625">So that man was a former army colonel, I believe, or so, and he was in the embassy attached.</span> <span id="s626">So he comes in, and he says to me, he says, “Explain me a little bit about your group.”</span> <span id="s627">Because he was going to have the speech, and he wanted -- he didn’t have the time before to ask the questions.</span> <span id="s628">So I tried to tell him we were 95 percent of former survivors of the concentration camps, or resistance like I am.</span> <span id="s629">A few that were -- not even five people that are -- were f -- in the resistance.</span> <span id="s630">Hiding maybe, yes, but not in the resistance.</span> <span id="s631">So -- and I tried to tell him it’s a make-up of various participation.</span> <span id="s632">He says, “Why don’t we belong to a party,” you see, in other words, the party image or curse, maybe I should say, because it’s a curse.</span> <span id="s633">If we wouldn’t be so divided, we would have been a stronger nation through the years.</span> <span id="s634">Why don’t you belong to one party?</span> <span id="s635">I says, “What would that help Israel better?</span> <span id="s636">We raise money, we do all we can to help Israel.</span> <span id="s637">And that party, I wish you’d stop being so party minded in Israel, I believe it’d be an easier life.”</span> <span id="s638">In contrary, he didn’t like my comments, of course, because he said, “Why do you want to be orphans?”</span> <span id="s639">In other words, belonging to a party meant not being an orphan in his mind, and in his view.</span> <span id="s640">And he came speaking to us, which he was not aware enough what had went on during the Holocaust, because my critic to the time and the era was as -- in my writings, I -- I must mention it to you, there isn’t a year that I don’t write to the newspaper, at least in a folder about an inch thick, and I have all of them of -- of home.</span> <span id="s641">And I’m a critic of some of these here things.</span> <span id="s642">I will always try to defend Israeli causes, and Jewish causes, of -- of the -- of course, you know what I mean, like I said, I didn’t want to give up Judaism in spite of Hitler, and I believe that whenever I think about it, I’m -- I’m more for than I was before ba -- myself, even if I’m not in Israel.</span> <span id="s643">But I visited Israel a number of occasions.</span> <span id="s644">I received a medal like holmor of the partisans who were there, when we came to Israel in 1983, then we had a gathering of all the fighters.</span> <span id="s645">And I have over here at har -- at home -- it’s too bad that we cannot take another picture.</span> <span id="s646">I was honored as a partisan over here, too, in -- in -- in Fort Lauderdale, a number of years ago.</span> <span id="s647">So, I been a constant participant in all of Jewish causes, no matter what it is.</span> <span id="s648">I will always belong somewheres, and I will always speak my mind whenever I can, and whenever I’ve reached out.</span> <span id="s649">So like I say, it was born at that particular time, even when I came to the United States, and we formed the organization.</span> <span id="s650">I was in the starter, but it already was in existence.</span> <span id="s651">We called it the New Citizen’s Club, as I aforementioned.</span> <span id="s652">We used to have once a month a meeting, and so on and so far.</span> <span id="s653">So, then it came out the story, which I don’t know whether I mentioned inforn, where the Nazis wanted to march in Skokie.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: That’s -- that’s a little farther in the future, so let’s stay back a little bit.</span> <span id="s655">I wanted to ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Okay, so I’ll wait for your questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: I wanted to ask about the -- your journey to the United States, and about what you expected to find when you arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Well, my journey in the united -- to the United States, was basically at the time, that I had family, and I thought that they would be of help for me to get organized, and settled.</span> <span id="s659">And I believe it’s a little personal about it, and I do not want to be -- feel that it’s a personal way.</span> <span id="s660">I didn’t get the help I expected to help, although the family each other -- helped each other when they came, so with me, when they spend the money, and other money came from my wife’s family that she had in New York.</span> <span id="s661">I believed that when I wanted to get established to go in business, which I did, I came to ’48, and in 1953 in January, I went to business to open up a grocery store.</span> <span id="s662">And I must thank the Almighty, who let my wife’s father -- my father-in-law survive, and he was with us in the forest, too.</span> <span id="s663">And if he wouldn’t lend me that time the money, I would not be in business, you know?</span> <span id="s664">So while I came to the family for help, I didn’t get the help I wanted to get.</span> <span id="s665">Not that I need -- I wanted the help to give out -- even to loan me the money, I wasn’t -- because you must remember, I had no collateral.</span> <span id="s666">I had no -- no way in the world to establish credit, and I wanted to go in business.</span> <span id="s667">One of my uncles, may he rest in peace, says, “Since you got off the boat, you wanted to go in business.”</span> <span id="s668">I said, “I thought it’s a capitalistic system in the United States, that to go to business is okay.”</span> <span id="s669">But like I say, I do not wish at this time in my recording to leave the animosity about that, but I seek to come here because of them.</span> <span id="s670">The turnout was that I would have been helped with the Joint Distribution Committee much more if I would not have been there.</span> <span id="s671">The mere fact of going to school, if I would have been getting help from the Joint Distribution Committee, I probably would have been able to maintain to go to college.</span> <span id="s672">This way I did not have any insurance, and my son was supposed to be born, beforehand to have some money, because I did not have insurance for the pregnancy insurance, I had to acquire another job.</span> <span id="s673">While I was working at my uncle’s store, fi -- six days a week, I had to get a job to work in a tavern, which it was -- he was in partnership with -- with his other part of the family.</span> <span id="s674">So I used to work there Thursday night, or rather, some weeks Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday night, because all those days I worked in a store.</span> <span id="s675">And Sunday I used to come, after closing the store 12 o’clock, I used to go home, rest up, get something to eat.</span> <span id="s676">At fi -- at six o’clock I would be back to work to work til 12.</span> <span id="s677">And this is how I accumulated the extra money that I needed for my son to be born in that hospital.</span> <span id="s678">I wanted here to give a plug to a person who really -- talking about the family.</span> <span id="s679">My family went to their gynecologist at that particular time, and asked him to take charge of my wife.</span> <span id="s680">And then they asked them, “Why do you ask me to give them a break?</span> <span id="s681">You’re the family, I’m -- I’m a doctor.</span> <span id="s682">I took care of all of you.”</span> <span id="s683">And he was very feeling low, in other words, for them asking, however -- may he rest in peace, he’s no longer around, he said he’ll do the work free of charge.</span> <span id="s684">And he was a renowned gynecologist in Chicago, on Michigan Avenue, which the price was pretty high.</span> <span id="s685">But as a gesture of his own, he went and did -- because my wife had to have Caesarian section, she had a letter with it -- with her from the fir -- from my daughter was born, she had by Caesarian section, she couldn’t have it any other way.</span> <span id="s686">So he gave -- he only told us, you cannot go through the clinic, you must go through the regular channels, because through the clinic they may not have me doing the surgery, and I wanted him to do the surgery at that particular time.</span> <span id="s687">And when I -- after my son was born, when I came to the office with my wife for a visit, I brought a -- a -- a bunch of roses, at that time he yelled at me.</span> <span id="s688">“I thought you can’t afford it, and that’s why I helped you.</span> <span id="s689">Why did you have to spend the money on the flowers?”</span> <span id="s690">So he was really a righteous type of a person, which I always remember, and I -- and Blumenfeld, I-I think was his name, and -- it is name.</span> <span id="s691">And he was not Jewish, he was a Gentile.</span> <span id="s692">So in other words, I like always, for posterity’s sake, to remember that there were always some people in cl -- even if they were not Jews, they were Gentiles, but they were generous.</span> <span id="s693">That’s why we have in Israel, the Righteous Gentile’s walk.</span> <span id="s694">And whenever I’m in Yad Vashem, I go through that, to read names and so on.</span> <span id="s695">At a time when I was honored here, there was a Righteous Gentile, was honored to the same time, a woman who saved seven Jews.</span> <span id="s696">Of course, instead of the whole eyes of the audience would go to my case, as being a platoon commander on the partisans, she was deservedly so, which I understand, after all, she saved seven Jews, being a Gentile, and she got, sort of the place, much more than me.</span> <span id="s697">And so like I say, so many things that happened through that era, afterwards, even though to some people, it’s a novice story, because they didn’t hear enough of the resistance.</span> <span id="s698">But whenever it gets ex-exposed, I can tell -- say that much with a full mouth, that people understand it, and they’re eager to hear about it more and more.</span> <span id="s699">So I can only hope and pray someday that my manuscript should be published, and people should be able to read it in a more detailed way, the way all of that horror went through, and how victory came, that I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: I wanted to find out about your journey to the United States.</span> <span id="s701">It was by ship, I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: By ship, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: And do you remember anything about the journey, the name of the ship, your arrival --</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Yes, yes, I’ll tell you the whole thing.</span> <span id="s705">You want me on?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Okay, it was a little problem since usually, when we applied to come, and we had the visa already to go to the United States, the Joint, at that particular time wanted to intervene to help some of the people, and I thought I’ll go through them, too, while their -- my relatives needed help in one way or the other.</span> <span id="s708">Anyways, they wanted to give me passage, and where did they find the passage?</span> <span id="s709">On a Soviet ship.</span> <span id="s710">And I refused take him -- to go with a Soviet ship, because basically, as I aforementioned, I didn’t trust the Soviets, even they should have been on a journey taking me to y -- to the United States.</span> <span id="s711">So I refused to go passage.</span> <span id="s712">And you know, visas have a certain expiration times, I couldn’t play around with much.</span> <span id="s713">The passage available until my expiration of the visa was so -- was very little choices to be made, besides that Russian ship.</span> <span id="s714">So I was told by them that the only way for me to go would be best to meet the visa time that I have to go by air, to fly to the United States.</span> <span id="s715">And I did not -- I was not at that particular time ready with flying.</span> <span id="s716">Therefore, we had to -- I had -- I had to -- I could get passage on the Vulcania, which it was going to meet the date.</span> <span id="s717">However, the Vulcania had only opening on second class, as you know, they have always grades of classes.</span> <span id="s718">It was normally with third class, but they had second class only open passage for us to go, everything else was booked up.</span> <span id="s719">So I had to go to the family, both time [indecipherable] my wife family, and my family to -- about the passage.</span> <span id="s720">And sure enough, they wired the money, so we could get the passage to go on that ship, on the Vulcania.</span> <span id="s721">The Vulcania was a luxury vessel, there is no question about it, and especially riding on second class was another thing that I did not know how to take it, because with all the misery of life that we went through -- in Italy it was better, but it still was not like living in apartment and a -- enjoying, you know what I mean they -- everything a human beings are ma -- ine -- are desire -- not only that they want to, but they’re entitled to have.</span> <span id="s722">So this was coming in like to a new world on that ship.</span> <span id="s723">My -- be -- when we started to sail from Naples, until they hit the Gibraltar, it was good sailing, because we were told, you know, the first thing you get on the ship, you get sick and all of that, and we went out even that night, and then [indecipherable] near the Gibraltar, I went outside the deck and even bought some -- some liqueur, you know what I mean, because for a dollar you could buy a nice bottle of liqueur to bring it to the United States, I figured for gifts or so on.</span> <span id="s724">And no sooner the next morning when we started sailing, my wife took sick.</span> <span id="s725">She couldn’t take this.</span> <span id="s726">When we had to cross the storm, to -- they -- when it was crossing, at that particular time, I almost was sick.</span> <span id="s727">But my daughter, being 22 months old, like I say, a little child, they usually can withstand it and they don’t get sick.</span> <span id="s728">And each time, she would speak -- my daughter -- Yiddish at the time, or Italian, because kids learn fast languages.</span> <span id="s729">And each time she would say, “The boat, the boat is,” you know what I mean, turning?</span> <span id="s730">Because from the storm, you used be thrown away, and be the time.</span> <span id="s731">And I had to -- not was -- I could do to my wife, because she was confined and the nurse was giving her injections, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s732">And my little girl just kept me busy, because we going with the stairs, up and down.</span> <span id="s733">A child is a child.</span> <span id="s734">She didn’t care it’s a storm.</span> <span id="s735">And each time I had to keep her that sh -- because when the ship -- that she shouldn’t get hit or hurt.</span> <span id="s736">And it was -- we were delayed because of that storm, whole day that we came in later.</span> <span id="s737">We were supposed to come in -- in on a Friday, we came in on Saturday, which it was late, and we didn’t disembark on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s738">Only when we saw harbor, that’s when my wife came to, and she was back to herself, so she at least -- otherwise she -- you know, she wasn’t sick, per se, with any special sicknesses, but she was seasick.</span> <span id="s739">So once we looking at the lights, and see the harbor, it sort of was, now we looking at the new world, we are about to come and start our new life that we promised ourselves to be.</span> <span id="s740">So it -- we didn’t mind it once she got well, and we had a big group of people coming to wit -- to meet us at the border -- at -- I mean there, at the -- to see us from the boat, it was a lot of her family, that she had more than mine.</span> <span id="s741">There were cousins, like one cousin was my father’s cousin, which I knew the family quite well, and they were also.</span> <span id="s742">And then from there we were taken to a house, oh she’s already deceased by now, which it was a first cousin of my wife.</span> <span id="s743">And they had a little child at home, too.</span> <span id="s744">And after a few days, that cousin of my father, Louie was his name, he came, took us to his place, because he had a home, and there was more room in his home for us to be taken.</span> <span id="s745">And of course, I must say at that time, charity began with the family right there.</span> <span id="s746">That morning, you know, he took me shopping, his wife took my wife shopping, bought us clothing, you know what I mean, because we came -- we made -- I made tailor made suits over there from the money my parents -- my relatives used to send me packages, and with the packages used to be chocolate, and it used to be cigarettes.</span> <span id="s747">So they helped me of all kinds of troubles.</span> <span id="s748">When my wife had to have the Caesarian section there, which I’d rather leave a whole part of the story, but I’ll only inject over here, the cigarettes, and the chocolates -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: -- and I would go to the marketplace and buy a chicken, and chicken soup was the good remedy that we always know about.</span> <span id="s750">So I would cook, even.</span> <span id="s751">But all of that was because of the cigarettes, and the nuns would be very friendly.</span> <span id="s752">They gave me a cot that I could sleep at night.</span> <span id="s753">Because after surgery, for 24 hours, they were primitive in those -- ’48, in Italy -- I mean, my daughter was born in ’46.</span> <span id="s754">When I came in ’48 to the United States, and my son had to be born in ’49, I was like a fantasy.</span> <span id="s755">It -- to what it take, a whole month for her to get well, within two -- three days, she was on her feet.</span> <span id="s756">And that’s how much advanced the American medical system was versus what it was in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Were there any other -- was it just you and your wife, and your daughter that came together on the ship, or did you come with anyone else you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: No, we came with other friends that we met on the boat, but they -- their lives -- survival was in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s759">They escaped to the Soviet Union when four -- 1941 when the Germans attacked, again.</span> <span id="s760">So they were living in -- in Iasia.</span> <span id="s761">And, I mean, they were suffering, but it was normal war suffering, shortages of this, ashu -- but the threat of life did not exist with them.</span> <span id="s762">We met them, and as a matter of fact, they remained friends with -- he is gone already, by now, but with his wife, even up to this day that we made friends then, and we still remain friendly, and we had sort of a club together, and the organization together, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: They ended up in Chicago as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s765">They came to Chicago like we did, so we had a lot in common for starters, you see?</span> <span id="s766">They also came to family in Chicago.</span> <span id="s767">We went to high school to-together in Austin High.</span> <span id="s768">They were living in Austin, though, while I was living in Chicago, which it made a difference, that’s why my traveling was more.</span> <span id="s769">But we graduate school at the same time, and he s -- he still has a brother alive that they -- we’ve bi -- was -- with school -- in school with me at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: What were their names, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Sofferstein is their name.</span> <span id="s772">Th-The both -- two brothers, and I -- and the other --they both were married, you know what I mean, and have children, and we got to know them then, and we still, like I say, maintain to be f -- to be friendly together.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: What were your first impressions of the United States?</span> <span id="s774">When you arrived in New York, what were -- what did you -- what were your impressions of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: To say the least, I would say, I really saw a world that I haven’t witnessed before.</span> <span id="s776">Not because of the atrocities, but it was so much difference in living, to know that you have a toilet in the same apartment, which -- who would dream about it otherwise than in a hotel.</span> <span id="s777">In Poland, you know, before the war, to see something like that, running water, where in 1939, when the war broke out, we still had to ment -- to bring our water in in a bucket, from going to -- you know, to a well, or whatever it is outside.</span> <span id="s778">So it was just like an oasis in the desert would be the easiest description for me to make the comparison, or the analogy at the time, that it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: How were your spirits at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: My spirits were very uplifted.</span> <span id="s781">I really felt at that time that I survived.</span> <span id="s782">Until then, we did not talk each other, oh we survived, or this, that, and the other.</span> <span id="s783">And because people were asking, but it’s a cute story that it happened in New York with whole family, with my wife’s -- it was an aunt, her mother’s sister, that we were invited for dinner there.</span> <span id="s784">And of course, everybody was eager to hear how we survived, and what had went on.</span> <span id="s785">I kept talking and telling the people til about three in the morning, and afterwards I was angered.</span> <span id="s786">I was angered because the questions, after I told them all, two guys says over there, “So how did you survive?”</span> <span id="s787">And it’s sort of to say, “I just told you how we survived.</span> <span id="s788">We escaped.”</span> <span id="s789">But it was so unbelievable to them to listen.</span> <span id="s790">It was so remote that, in other words, that they had to ask me that question, so how did we survive.</span> <span id="s791">So, like I say, I was anger, but I tried to be understanding.</span> <span id="s792">I says, after all, if somebody would have told me about a story like that, by me not being there, how would I react?</span> <span id="s793">I would not know how to react about a case like that either.</span> <span id="s794">I usually make the analogy, if people tell you about Vietnam, or they tell you about the My Lai massacre, or anything like that, it’s hard to make a judgement for someone who hasn’t been there.</span> <span id="s795">But if you talk to a soldier who has been there, and he tells you that, I take it for granted that he told me the story, because I know how my story when I tell people who haven’t witness, or been around, it’s very hard to make them see, or believe, above all, believe the story that a b -- story was exactly the way it happened.</span> <span id="s796">And this is why it’s a commonology about it, that when you talk to survivors, do not take for granted that the next guy you talk with, had had the same past as the first one you talk, or the third one that you may talk.</span> <span id="s797">And it was proven in the documentation sent over, they took interviews from so many survivors, that hardly could have been two or three stories that you could make, oh it’s the same thing.</span> <span id="s798">The only same thing was the German, the Nazis, the beating, you know, perhaps, and so on.</span> <span id="s799">But the way it came all about was totally difference and -- and by now a lot of people are aware, more than they were let’s say 1948, when we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s800">But it was a total, total strange story.</span> <span id="s801">Some of them told us that [indecipherable] in the papers, they didn’t know anything about it, which later on, when I began to find other findings, I was a tremendous critic about it, because there is no way in the world that a ship, the Saint Louis, who came and wanted to dock in Florida, right here, that it could have happened.</span> <span id="s802">I believe for -- in posterity, a hundred years, 200 years from today, when the kids’ll read it in history, it will not come to them.</span> <span id="s803">They will say, something is not told accurately that it could have been that a ship with a hundred people.</span> <span id="s804">We know more from history now that Hitler tried to prove it, that the Jews are not want -- and here America let them plu -- prove it.</span> <span id="s805">That’s why, when we talk about books that have been published, “The Secret War Against the Jews,” for instance, by John Loftus, for one, or others, people know more about it today.</span> <span id="s806">But at the time, in the era, and it -- when that happened, the event, it’s hard for me, even a survivor, to understand how that could have happened without demonstrations.</span> <span id="s807">How it could have happened without better judgement than the American people and the American government had made not to let in that ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: But people were asking you about your experiences, and were interested?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Yes, people are very interested after they ask.</span> <span id="s810">But some people are afraid to ask because they feel like they are hurting us, the survivors, by revealing the past, what had happened.</span> <span id="s811">For instance, I want to inject one more time, even if I do it to the other tape.</span> <span id="s812">Til this day, we never sat down with our kids, or grandchildren, and tell them.</span> <span id="s813">I gave them my manuscript to read.</span> <span id="s814">In fact, they didn’t read it.</span> <span id="s815">Not why they didn’t read it.</span> <span id="s816">I believe they can put themselves together to face us, and say, “Look what our parents, or grandparents went through.”</span> <span id="s817">I’m understanding to the fact.</span> <span id="s818">So, when we sit down about a certain thing, or when I write to the papers, and they read it -- I have one of my granddaughters that w -- just got married a-about a few weeks ago.</span> <span id="s819">And I was writing poems, and I have one poem, Dermarterology, when I wrote Dermarterology, and I asked in it the question, sort of why did the world have to have a Holocaust?</span> <span id="s820">Did-Didn’t the 10 command-mandments that we gave to the world, didn’t all the other things, with so many Nobel prize winning, and everything, satisfy the world for the good we brought to them?</span> <span id="s821">Why did it have to have the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s822">And she was always eager to read if a -- an article, and I wanted basically to let her read, much better than tell my daughter.</span> <span id="s823">I don’t know why I felt that way, but that what it was.</span> <span id="s824">And she said to me more than once about my poems -- because my poems are interjected how I escaped to the forests, some of my poe -- I ask in one of my poe -- poems, I ask to God, “Why don’t you grant me some wings, so I could fly from tree to tree, until I will come to freedom?”</span> <span id="s825">I mean, the whole poem deals with it.</span> <span id="s826">And the other one that I have, I -- a dream, like I dreamed that I will be able to escape from all the -- the -- the bad things that it’s going on in the ghetto, and so on.</span> <span id="s827">So I’m saying in me, it’s imbedded, the whole life.</span> <span id="s828">And my granddaughter said to me at the time, me -- as a ch -- she must have been a child, probably, that I [indecipherable] about it, must have been eight or nine years of age.</span> <span id="s829">And she said, “Papa, how come all your poems, or your writing is so sad?”</span> <span id="s830">I says, “Marissa, I lived a sad life.</span> <span id="s831">I cannot go out to put in -- in it happy occasions.</span> <span id="s832">So when I write about that I,” you know, like I told her the other poem, when I described in it I wish God would give me those wings so I could fly, and then I come to the end.</span> <span id="s833">“Oh God, you didn’t grant me the wings, and I will be sitting and cry for always and forever,” you know what I mean, about it.</span> <span id="s834">I don’t say I will die.</span> <span id="s835">That I don’t bring out.</span> <span id="s836">Somehow or other, in all my punishment, I did not use wordings of dying or thinking -- I always was thinking of life.</span> <span id="s837">And maybe that was what I needed to survive, is the positive part, to fight if it’s necessary, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s838">So, all in all to say I was involved with all of these here things, on every occasion daneech, even though, at the time when I raised little children -- I took, in 1953, as I -- I don’t know, I believe I forementioned it, the audacity to go to write a manuscript in English.</span> <span id="s839">I felt so goo -- sure, I knew how to write, but I did not know literally how to write, but to me, I didn’t care what’s it’s missing, you know, because I always left it to that literary agent, which I paid for, and didn’t do nothing for me, and who knows whether he’s still alive, or to the other one.</span> <span id="s840">But I wanted the story.</span> <span id="s841">I would not -- if I would have be locked in in a room today, like we are right now, and say, “Harold, tell me the story, it wa -- in your manuscript,” I probably would not be able to tell it in the way it happened.</span> <span id="s842">I probably would not be able to tell -- remember all the names, dates for sure not, you know what I’m saying.</span> <span id="s843">Well, but, for these things, there is such thing as documents, you can always add in things.</span> <span id="s844">So that’s what it was, my part.</span> <span id="s845">I only wanted to put up as good of my memory as I remembered what I went through.</span> <span id="s846">It was a party before they broke out in Poland, which I mention over there.</span> <span id="s847">So it’s no use me revealing.</span> <span id="s848">I live with all of this here history.</span> <span id="s849">When I speak to people, for instance, I must say it over here, which I couldn’t say it there, I’m bilingual in eight languages, and I speak them fluently.</span> <span id="s850">And when I speak to people, and I’ll start turning from Spanish into Hebrew, or into Russian, or into Polish, and that’s in me -- in business it helped me a lot, especially in Chicago.</span> <span id="s851">There’s a lot of bilingual usage that you could -- being here in Florida, the same thing, we get people from all ur -- of Europe, and when I can turn around in a minute -- but I must confess here, I reserve myself in not speaking a language which it happened a few times.</span> <span id="s852">When I started to speak German to a German fellow, and all of a sudden he removed his shirt, and he wants to try on a shirt.</span> <span id="s853">I was working in Galleria Mall at that particular time, for the -- name of the store was The Forum.</span> <span id="s854">And I took a look [indecipherable], here I saw underneath his arm -- the SS used to have this here, that was their code, where it was r -- put over there, underneath there -- or the Gestapo, who knows where he could have bi -- when I saw that, I -- I turned colors, I c -- I was -- I was -- asked that I want to go to the washroom, just to go away from the man, if not to lose myself.</span> <span id="s855">So when I -- like we were in Israel a year and a half ago, and we [indecipherable] over there, in that hotel, they were maybe 40 percent of Germans, young, of the ages of my kids, and with their children, I did not feel restricted of myself to speak German to these people.</span> <span id="s856">And -- but all in all, I -- I meet people because I am so involved with it, so to one I can speak Polish, while in -- two seconds later, I’ll switch over to Russian, or from Russian to Spanish, or to Hebrew, and people always have -- how could I remember all of that at one time?</span> <span id="s857">And this is -- was my own idea, I don’t know how good my memory will serve as I age, you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s858">So, it was always importance to me to bring out in me.</span> <span id="s859">I believe someday some student will probably want to make this here a lesson, and to talk about to other children, which is of importance.</span> <span id="s860">And I hope that they always get -- that they always can remember when you have a bad times, don’t look for the half empty glass, look for the half full glass.</span> <span id="s861">Hope should never be lost.</span> <span id="s862">We’ll die anyways, we all know that.</span> <span id="s863">We cannot preserve that.</span> <span id="s864">But hoping to die, you will die sooner.</span> <span id="s865">Hoping to live, you will live longer.</span> <span id="s866">And it’s not just a phraseology of words, it’s a thing that it’s -- really works.</span> <span id="s867">And you talk to prisoners of war -- we did -- we talked to a man like Mr. McCain, who was in prison with the Vietnamese, or you talk anybody who was in prison, and they survived.</span> <span id="s868">They will tell you in the same words that I am saying, they couldn’t overcome their ordeal, be in Iran, be in Vietnam, be in Korea, be ever -- anyplace that a prisoner of war was taken, if hope would not be lost.</span> <span id="s869">Because when hope is lost, that’s what it happens, it’s lost, life is lost.</span> <span id="s870">So, my message is always of importance.</span> <span id="s871">When I talk about the better deal, not to forget to have that listener hear that hope to live.</span> <span id="s872">So when I speak to young kids, high school kids and student -- or students, or even in colleges which I spoke, I always do not give answer.</span> <span id="s873">The hardest thing was for me when I spoke to kids in school of years back -- which I have some on tape also, and they ask me how many Germans did I kill?</span> <span id="s874">And how do you go ahead to answer a child in school when he ask me a raw question like that?</span> <span id="s875">And it’s a hard way to answer.</span> <span id="s876">I must therefore, instead of giving him an answer to say, “Oh, I killed probably 20, or 30, or 50,” which it would mean I would go ahead to look at a personal thing, remember the questioner, remember that he is the child of 14 and 15, and I do not want to give him that answer, that life -- answer is the weapon, and killing is the answer.</span> <span id="s877">So I always must bring it to him the idea, that yes, killing is not right, but defending oneself is the right that he must never forget, no matter who it is, when your life is threatened, you also have the law of rights for you to go ahead and defend your life.</span> <span id="s878">So when I tell that to the kids, they get a bi -- they get a different understanding about weapons, and about killing.</span> <span id="s879">And this is usually, when I spoke to kids today, it would not matter where.</span> <span id="s880">I spoke seven years in a row that I used to be here in Fort Lauderdale, and I used to make the Day of Remembrance -- Remembrance Days, in city hall.</span> <span id="s881">And I remember the first mayor that time, that adopted for me to do it was Mayor Kaminski.</span> <span id="s882">And the biggest question always used to be, why did I want to chose that I want to speak in city hall?</span> <span id="s883">And after I explained it to him, they saw my way is right.</span> <span id="s884">I say, you must remember that all our sufferings, it started in buildings like that.</span> <span id="s885">Whether laws were changed, or the laws were taken away.</span> <span id="s886">I want to be proud of the idea that I survived, and we have seen a time where we can come back to these buildings, and salute the freedom we have in America, and the freedom that it should be of democracy throughout the world, that yes, there is a -- a repayment day to be proud of, that we changed the evil days, and this is what it was, my message in the same way when I came to speak in front of the justice depart -- justices in Springfield, Illinois, when the Nazis wanted to march, so if you’re ever interested, go ahead, get the movie, “Skokie,” and you’ll see Danny Kaye play Harold Zissman in it.</span> <span id="s887">And this is what I said, and I was the last speaker, not expected maybe, to speak at all, and when we get it first at the house, with the congressmen, and it was, at that place, it was the military commander the -- from the Jewish war veterans of the state of Illinois.</span> <span id="s888">It was the commander of the war veterans -- the Jewish war veterans of Chicago, it was a few congressmen, and everybody was sort of questioning, what subject are you going to talk about, what subject is the other one going to talk about?</span> <span id="s889">Because we did not want to use the time, in other words, that shu -- two people who should be talking it in the same way.</span> <span id="s890">When it came to me, I says, “I?</span> <span id="s891">I had no title.”</span> <span id="s892">Just as it is in the movie, the true words that he picked up.</span> <span id="s893">Who knows, maybe I may not even be called to say anything, but today a surprise.</span> <span id="s894">Even I was the last person called, when they called my name, I came over, and I says, at the time, which the language is still fresh with me, “Ladies and gentlemen of the justices, and justice’s guests, who are here today, I want you all to rise for one moment of silence, today is D-Day.”</span> <span id="s895">With the loudest voice I could get out.</span> <span id="s896">They all rose, and I tuc -- checked my watch.</span> <span id="s897">And I says, “Now, you may be seated.”</span> <span id="s898">Cameramen started running from all side to me, I became the hero, I became the one.</span> <span id="s899">And a guy from a small town in Illinois comes over to me, he says, “Mr. Zissman, I’d like an interview.”</span> <span id="s900">I said, “I’ll be more than happy to give you an interview, but not today, not now.”</span> <span id="s901">I says, “Rabbi Montrose and me are going right now back to Skokie, because my niece, and the rest of the class of the Hebrew school is going to be graduating today.</span> <span id="s902">However, here is my card,” I was an [indecipherable] salesman at that particular time.</span> <span id="s903">I says, “You can call me to my house, I will give time to you, and I’ll make the time for your convenience.</span> <span id="s904">Come and see me and I’ll give you all the interview.”</span> <span id="s905">The fact remains that he did have a beautiful [indecipherable] in some place, like almost to say my archives there.</span> <span id="s906">And the man, you know, he was not Jewish, he was Gentile, but I moved him, and that’s why he wanted to hear me.</span> <span id="s907">All the other speakers, while they were talking about the march, I didn’t talk just about a march [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s908">I just come with a -- that -- the minute of silence, I says, “So many years ago, our boys and girls went to Europe to fight Nazism, so that menace should never be seen nor heard.”</span> <span id="s909">The judiciary committee at that particular time wanted to pass on a law that freedom of speech yes, but to go on the paraphernalia, with the swastikas and everything like that, the way the Nazis, especially the SS, and Gestapo were dressed, that is not necessary to do, because whatever we tried at that time, on the jer -- Phil Donohue show, which I forced my way through, and I repeat something, probably you heard of it.</span> <span id="s910">Talked to Goldberger, I wanted to make the separation between freedom of speech, and attack on people’s life.</span> <span id="s911">And that’s basically what the march was all about.</span> <span id="s912">They did not -- if they want to speak, they didn’t have to come to Skokie, they can speak anyway.</span> <span id="s913">But they wanted to come to Skokie for the reason that survivors of the Holocaust were living by such multitudes there, and throw the venom that we don’t deserve to be alive.</span> <span id="s914">Now, this is a different than free speech, this is a threat to life, and I believe the First Amendment never was intended to make a threat of life.</span> <span id="s915">We used to say that hi -- il -- you know, saying fire in a crowded theater is against the law.</span> <span id="s916">Okay, but this is another saying.</span> <span id="s917">Now, a threat of a life of a person cannot be tolerated, be -- who it may be, be against Jews, be against Asians, be against Blacks or anybody else.</span> <span id="s918">It has no place in a society, of the 20 -- of the millenium that we entering right now to exist.</span> <span id="s919">And this has always been my fight about it.</span> <span id="s920">And that’s why I -- I -- we tirelessly, no matter I work hard, I still -- I just stopped working for a little while right now, because my granddaughter’s marriage, but I may go back to work [indecipherable], I’ll see how my health will permit me.</span> <span id="s921">But it never took away from me the time to sit down behind the typewriter and write an article to the paper.</span> <span id="s922">A lot of times I’m not published, and they try, perhaps to discourage me, but no one, as long I will live, and my mind will be silent -- will be in good shape, and it’ll be sane, will anybody give me any problems that I will not be able to speak my mind up against someone.</span> <span id="s923">Sure, I wrote an article against Haider now in Austria, it was not published, but I spoke up.</span> <span id="s924">Maybe these words may change the editor, okay?</span> <span id="s925">So be whatever situations that has -- i-it happens in the United States, of all the years that I’ve been here.</span> <span id="s926">I always was vocal, and I will remain vocal for as long as I live, to bring the story out.</span> <span id="s927">It’s not just to tell about the Holocaust, it’s to tell to prevent another Holocaust every to occur, and it doesn’t have to be a Holocaust against the Jews, the Holocaust against anybody else.</span> <span id="s928">The Holocaust only happened because too many minds were silent.</span> <span id="s929">What it happens right now with Haider, in Austria, which openly -- and we will see, with those people who think mine -- that he has no place in government.</span> <span id="s930">For as long -- because he says I’m sorry I said that, it still lives in him.</span> <span id="s931">For as long people have in their minds against certain people, which I said it in my article there -- he was against the immigration with comes in.</span> <span id="s932">Who made them be immigrants if it wouldn’t be for the Nazis at their time, where Austria was a part.</span> <span id="s933">So we must, and understand always, these situations.</span> <span id="s934">There’s so many lies came out in print because they knew somebody.</span> <span id="s935">I’ll never forget, I had a fight, and I lost it.</span> <span id="s936">I lost the fight.</span> <span id="s937">About thr -- about three years ago, that time when my other daughter was married [indecipherable] -- my granddaughter, the first one, and it was in West Palm Beach.</span> <span id="s938">And in West Palm Beach, we have a lot of these haters in there, be that they’re neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan, you name it.</span> <span id="s939">Be from the church, or whatever.</span> <span id="s940">They are there, they find they are th -- and an article was there, written by a man who is a novelist writer, he is not a historian, and he came saying that the Auschwitz [indecipherable] about Germany has got to stop.</span> <span id="s941">So he tries to bring out, why not look at the good things?</span> <span id="s942">And the man came and brought out that in Berlin, that the Berliners were hidden 10,000 Jewish families.</span> <span id="s943">Now, when I saw that -- I was reading the paper [indecipherable] that morning, and I was all shaken up.</span> <span id="s944">10,000 is a multitude.</span> <span id="s945">If he was to say at least a hundred, maybe it would have been cor -- not questionable, but it would have been believable.</span> <span id="s946">But that multitude, 10,000?</span> <span id="s947">And I wrote a -- an article to the paper, and asking them.</span> <span id="s948">I says, “Don’t you think that Yad Vashem in Israel would have any knowledge about that, so they would go ahead to,” -- they did for single people who saved a Jewish family, planted a tree in his name and everything.</span> <span id="s949">I said, “The Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., don’t you think they would have had a record of something like that?”</span> <span id="s950">But it falls on deaf minds.</span> <span id="s951">I called before that, because I think maybe I didn’t hear it, but I know, I am pretty much in tune to all of these here things that are happening, but my article of rebuttal, never appeared.</span> <span id="s952">And this is why we must have more people be outspoken, be in script, be vocal.</span> <span id="s953">And we must not remain just to ourselves, “Oh, you can’t do anything about it.”</span> <span id="s954">That’s the negative attitude, which I said.</span> <span id="s955">We must look at it positive.</span> <span id="s956">When it’s a time to speak out, we must speak out.</span> <span id="s957">Otherwise, democracy will never be a democracy, but that’s the whole idea of democracy, that everybody is entitled to their opinion.</span> <span id="s958">So while we guard honor to exist, we must guard of these reactionary forces, that they never should take hold again, to whatever they have in mind.</span> <span id="s959">And you know -- we know whatever they have in mind, one against the other, and that’s what they come, and become -- you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s960">To settle -- they kill both of them, and that’s all there is to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Let me ask you, y-you’re obviously -- do you want to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Harold Zissman.</span> <span id="s964">I wanted to st-stay with the time of your arrival in the United States a little bit more, and get some more details about what happened.</span> <span id="s965">And -- and also, if you could comment on -- y -- obviously you were ver -- you’re very aware of the American judicial system, and -- and the importance of the laws, and how they affect people, and your involvement at Skokie speaks to that, too.</span> <span id="s966">So maybe you could talk about how you became a US citizen, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Okay, that’s -- will be good.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: -- and what that meant to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: When I came to United States in 1948, I believe the first thing on my mind was in the positive, how do I become a citizen of the United States.</span> <span id="s970">I filed my first papers, as we call them, as soon time permitted to be done for it, and -- and at -- when I was called was almost five years later to become a citizen, and I proudly am happy that I was granted the -- first of all, that I was granted life again, because I consider that’s -- I was rebor -- reborn, I, my wife, and my daughter, coming to the United States.</span> <span id="s971">We -- some people of ours, the survivors want to come, that we were reborn, at freedom time when -- when the hostilities ended.</span> <span id="s972">But to me, I don’t want to call it that it was still life.</span> <span id="s973">To me, the impression that I made, the first class, in the ship that I thub -- the same thing, even though our apartment, the first apartment was in a basement, and we were there with a child, and a few months later, my brother-in-law came.</span> <span id="s974">So even though there was a lot of things to be dissatisfied about, but my satisfaction, like I forementioned, be going to school, be all of the other things, belonging again to an organization.</span> <span id="s975">So I can see that my life had started -- I was reborn in 1948 with my wife, and I hope the man above, or the person above, that God remembers that not to account my years before, and that would been a great favor that I can ask.</span> <span id="s976">The United States as a government, I had a lot of dissatisfaction in my mind with the Roosevelt era, and at times it was hard on me to go ahead to throw it away.</span> <span id="s977">I know being a history student, and being involved with the things in Italy, I knew n -- quite well about a person from Switzerland who came that he was working, and telling over here, he -- the ordeal of the Jews, what it was on.</span> <span id="s978">And it was at a time in ’42, when Hitler already had made the dimension of the le -- Final Solution, or Judenrein, but the Final Solution, that was image.</span> <span id="s979">I know well enough the story where the partisans in Poland, who sent all their messages to England, and it went in a safe world.</span> <span id="s980">So like I say, it was a rebirth for me, coming to see freedom.</span> <span id="s981">And I suppose when a person is frees, that’s how your questions become open, because in other words, when I was under the Soviet Union, I couldn’t ask some of the questions that it came up to me in the United States.</span> <span id="s982">I couldn’t ask why would the British at that particular time, keep hidden that story that -- that it was told, that the final solution, by Goebbels when he allows -- that they’ll rid themselves of the Jews of all Europe, why would that have to be in a safe sill?</span> <span id="s983">Perhaps the Jewish community in Britain would have maybe react to it, I understand, and that’s why they kept it from them.</span> <span id="s984">But in America, under the Roosevelt administration, knowing full well at that time that a delegate came, and telling all of that, and since the United States, at that particular time, under the Roosevelt presidency did not see fit to give any help whatsoever, to stop the menace of destruction that it went on in Auschwitz, and so on, by ohm -- what that means.</span> <span id="s985">I know full well at that -- this -- this story of the rabbi from Cleveland, who went at that particular time to intervene to the president, and what came out of it.</span> <span id="s986">He came out with that message, don’t rock the boat.</span> <span id="s987">All of these here parts of hate, and what had happened to all of us became renewed follen -- during freedom.</span> <span id="s988">But above all, I wanted to become one of the Americans, in spite of all of this.</span> <span id="s989">In a way, I thought maybe, speaking as an American citizen, it would help my grief to speak out a little bit better.</span> <span id="s990">And therefore, things got, in 1953, I was -- became a proud citizen, and quiet I did not remain.</span> <span id="s991">I was vocal, and whatever I could write -- even I didn’t care that my writing was not as good as that American who perhaps was born, and had more schooling in English than I did.</span> <span id="s992">I was proud about the other thing, that I could speak more languages than the average American.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Will you list the languages that you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s995">First of all, I must say, as I said it in the aforementioned tape, I graduated in Poland, a school by the name Yavna, which is a Zionist Hebrew school, and it’s a trilingual school.</span> <span id="s996">We were taught over there Yiddish, Hebrew, and English.</span> <span id="s997">So immediately, I started with three schools.</span> <span id="s998">I usually say to people when they ask me, how does it happen that you speak eight la-languages, I say invention -- I say, if a person’s in trouble, he says, he must invent something.</span> <span id="s999">So, the American proverb goes with it, and that’s what it was invention, for me.</span> <span id="s1000">With three languages, when we crossed the border on the Russian side, I had to learn Russian.</span> <span id="s1001">Afterwards, after the war, when we came into Italy, I did not know Italian, so I learned Italian.</span> <span id="s1002">While being under the German yoke, it was not a question learning German because I loved that language, it was a question that when a German spoke to you, and you didn’t understand what he was saying, the beating was worse.</span> <span id="s1003">However, even if you did do what he wanted, you still got a beating.</span> <span id="s1004">But you had to -- so again, it was necessity, was for me to learn another language.</span> <span id="s1005">So no matter how much I learned German, but I could at least speak, and converse with someone in German.</span> <span id="s1006">So we have three, and two is five, and the sixth one, came to Italy again.</span> <span id="s1007">You come to a country, is strange, beautiful people, I wish it would have been this type of -- side of the ocean, I don’t ever leave them.</span> <span id="s1008">They didn’t care to say Jew.</span> <span id="s1009">To them it was polacko.</span> <span id="s1010">Seeing as I was coming from Poland, I’m Polish.</span> <span id="s1011">And when you said to them the word Jew, or Hebraio, they did not even know what the meaning of it, especially in a country like that, where Mussolini, and fa -- fash -- if -- if you call Fascism Fascism, started it way before Hitler.</span> <span id="s1012">But the people were not drilled on the hatred.</span> <span id="s1013">If anybody hated a Jew, perhaps he hated somebody else, too, because he was a hater.</span> <span id="s1014">But I didn’t feel it.</span> <span id="s1015">The hospitality of these people, what they had to us, is beyond reproach.</span> <span id="s1016">You ask an Italian person, you show him with an address here and there, he wouldn’t tell you it’s there, or down the street, next block.</span> <span id="s1017">He’d take you there.</span> <span id="s1018">This, to us, at that particular time, case is need, but I still tried to learn Italian.</span> <span id="s1019">So, you have -- you have six languages by then.</span> <span id="s1020">When I started making my papers, I did not want to come to America, not be able to turn my tongue.</span> <span id="s1021">So, as dearly as I was living on charity sort of, but going to a private teacher -- to a tutor, I and another friend of mine, we went away to take up English.</span> <span id="s1022">So, as you see, one after the other, one after the other was means of necessity.</span> <span id="s1023">When I had my store, after the riots that I went into, instead of the grocery business, to the men’s business, even the riots, I must make my point, I was totally destroyed, and 20 years of labor went on with smoke.</span> <span id="s1024">But I went on with life, and I restructured it, I went into the men’s clothing.</span> <span id="s1025">A tailor recom -- is being recommended to me by a neighbor businessman, a barber, and he’s a good tailor, I tested him, he knew what to do.</span> <span id="s1026">But I cannot speak Spanish.</span> <span id="s1027">My wife goes out, and buys me a dictionary, I get another little book, and all of a sudden, within a few months -- so there you make the total of all of it, and they come to eight all together.</span> <span id="s1028">And I’m very proud about it, that I can speak to people with other languages.</span> <span id="s1029">It never happened to me that if I meet someone, and he’s got a hard time in the li -- speaking English, but I can, through their dialect recognize the -- one of the languages, and I’m right there -- we already friends, within two minutes, because the person can talk to me, or ask me qu -- the -- so it becames a friendship.</span> <span id="s1030">So -- but writing, like I say, I only write in English.</span> <span id="s1031">I did not write to write in any other language, not that I couldn’t write in Hebrew, or anything like that, I write, but it’s still today -- in today’s world, that’s the language of the world.</span> <span id="s1032">When you know English, you can go anyplace in the world and be heard of or -- or know about.</span> <span id="s1033">So that was the reason that my languages was not a merit -- matter of scholastically, they were a matter of necessity.</span> <span id="s1034">And this is exactly why I adopted all of these here things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Just a little footnote, the first -- the first three languages -- I just wanted to mention, I think there -- there was a slight mistake.</span> <span id="s1036">When you mentioned the first three language, it was Yiddish, Hebrew, and Polish, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Right, three.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Okay, you had -- you had mentioned English, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Russian is four, and German is five, Italian is six, Spanish is seven, and English is eight, you know.</span> <span id="s1040">So there you go, you -- my -- my figures are accurately [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: And I -- when you became a citizen, or when you started to -- to settle into the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: ’53, I went in business, and became a citizen at the same time.</span> <span id="s1043">In 1953, I became a citizen, and in January of 1953, I went in the grocery business.</span> <span id="s1044">Thanks God, as I forementioned, to my father-in-law, that he helped me with the money, otherwise I’d never be able to get started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Did you come immediately from New York to Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1047">Yeah, I was in New York only when I -- when I came about -- it’s immediately -- I spent about three weeks in New York.</span> <span id="s1048">And therefore, we came in March, in April we were here already -- to sh -- in Chicago, I mean.</span> <span id="s1049">So that’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: And when did you father-in-law come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: He came in 1950.</span> <span id="s1052">He was in Germany, while we weren’t -- we were, like I told you already, there were -- we were -- we didn’t touch Germany.</span> <span id="s1053">My brother-in-law came at the end of 1948, and -- no wait, my father-in-law came probably in 1949, not 1950, please forgive me, 1949 he came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1055">Someone else who we interviewed, who was involved in the resistance said that -- that while they were raising their children in the Chicago area, that -- that sometimes they -- they -- they knew s -- there were some American Jews in the neighborhood who wouldn’t let their children play with the children of Holocaust survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Very true, very true.</span> <span id="s1057">I’ll tell you mine -- my story now.</span> <span id="s1058">And this is a documented si-situation.</span> <span id="s1059">In 1948 -- ’48 became -- in 1953, I started a business on my own, and between 1948 and ’53, I worked for my uncle, which I said, my mother’s brother -- brothers.</span> <span id="s1060">Be for what it’s worth, that in about 1955, I already had saved enough money for a down payment of a three flat building that I went in Skokie, and I bought it.</span> <span id="s1061">One day my uncle comes to visit with me.</span> <span id="s1062">Next door to us, in the other, was only a two flat, not a three flat.</span> <span id="s1063">Over there, they had a boy of my son’s age, which you usually feel good about it, the two children of the same ages, they had some -- so their son used to come to our house sometimes, my son would go to their house, and the two boys used to be playing together.</span> <span id="s1064">And I did not want to inject that [indecipherable] that kid was an adopted, but for the sake of it, l-let it be, it would not mean any difference.</span> <span id="s1065">One day when my uncle wants to come to visit with us, to see -- in other words, our new apartment, first of all, and the building what we bought, because I no longer -- I -- my -- my employment for him stopped in 1953, in December.</span> <span id="s1066">So he comes in and while we were waiting, next door to us, the guy, who used to be called as a nickname Red.</span> <span id="s1067">“Hey Red, how you doing?”</span> <span id="s1068">My uncle says to him, “Oh,” he says, “I came here to visit my nephew, you know the nephew I brought from Europe.”</span> <span id="s1069">He gave the moniker right away.</span> <span id="s1070">And so on, so how you doing, he talks to him because he knew him that he used to be in the clothing business, so on.</span> <span id="s1071">Not telling you a story, but a fact of life, my son’s relationship with his son had stopped within a few days, and it never woke up again.</span> <span id="s1072">I did not want to aggravate a situation like that towards my child, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s1073">After all, my son was born in 1949, so here we’re talking about 1954, so you know, he was a little boy of, you know, five years old, he understands wa -- so, he’s a very -- a child cannot understand this here.</span> <span id="s1074">So be it.</span> <span id="s1075">So in school he met with more kids than that, when he started school, which at five, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1076">He didn’t [indecipherable] yet.</span> <span id="s1077">So we didn’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s1078">It hurted us, what happened.</span> <span id="s1079">So, the only disruption it could have been, that this way he didn’t know what we Holocaust survivors, you know?</span> <span id="s1080">Because first of all, we were working too hard, and my wife used to take the kids to s -- to the store to bring them, because at that particular time I tried to save as much as I could on help, you know?</span> <span id="s1081">And besides, I borrowed money.</span> <span id="s1082">I borrowed money from my father-in-law, borrowed money from my brother-in-law, and I had to repay them, so the only way to repay them when you buy a small store, is to see that a -- you don’t overdue on expenses, you know?</span> <span id="s1083">So that was the part, which at that time, that we did.</span> <span id="s1084">So we did not have, basically, enough association with the neighbors around, you know?</span> <span id="s1085">Was -- when we came, was late at night, when we went away was early in the morning.</span> <span id="s1086">The store used to be open from -- from about nine in the morning, til about six o’clock at night, so you know, it -- it would take, in those days, I will driv -- I started to drive a car 1949, just as my son was born.</span> <span id="s1087">I fought for everything.</span> <span id="s1088">I wanted to be, to me to become just a regular person, without a moniker, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1089">So to say a lot of times, I would get, through the years, from American people, not just that particular case that I forementioned, “Hey, I detect an accent on you, where you from?”</span> <span id="s1090">I says, “I’m from hell, but I made it back.”</span> <span id="s1091">And people would say -- one time a customer in the store said to me, “You mean from Hell, Indiana?”</span> <span id="s1092">I says, “No, I did not know that Indiana has a Hell.”</span> <span id="s1093">He says, “Oh yeah, there is a place named Hell, in Indiana.”</span> <span id="s1094">He says, “My hell comes much further than that.”</span> <span id="s1095">So, the cus -- the wife -- the customer says, “You mean, you come from Europe?”</span> <span id="s1096">I says, “Yes, the Holocaust is what I forementioned.”</span> <span id="s1097">So what I’m saying, I always tried to keep this away.</span> <span id="s1098">Even as of late, when I worked at Bloomingdale’s in Boca Raton, people would come into me, other ones would say, “Hey, I just heard you speak another language, you spoke Spanish.</span> <span id="s1099">Where are you coming from?”</span> <span id="s1100">And I would say the same thing, from hell.</span> <span id="s1101">“So what happened you acquired all these languages?”</span> <span id="s1102">I says, “Necessity.”</span> <span id="s1103">Just like the proverb says, is the mother of invention.</span> <span id="s1104">Necessity is the mother of invention.</span> <span id="s1105">That was with me the case.</span> <span id="s1106">But people always sort of have a habit that very few inst -- not all -- not all of them, not there, some people take it in a wrong kind of a way.</span> <span id="s1107">You know how to saying goes, if -- if you are ever bitten by a dog, keep a stick handy.</span> <span id="s1108">You know what I am saying?</span> <span id="s1109">Because not to be bitten again.</span> <span id="s1110">And this is -- in most cases, it’s a touchy way when you touch it.</span> <span id="s1111">You know, it’s like electricity, you get that shock.</span> <span id="s1112">You get an electric shock with the way some people -- oh I know -- I heard all about it.</span> <span id="s1113">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s1114">If you heard all about it, you wouldn’t have to ask me, obviously, but you do ask me, so it’s still misunderstood, the whole era, even we are talking about 55 years later.</span> <span id="s1115">And some people, if I has to vocalize on it, will say, if there are Jews, or non-Jews, wouldn’t matter with me.</span> <span id="s1116">The guilt of the citizens, who were complacent at the era, and who were not mixed up in the politics -- which American people are not mixed up in politics.</span> <span id="s1117">I don’t know, I could say thanks God, no, and I s -- could say the other way around, there’s always two sides to each story, because we see it by the record of ame -- percentages of American people who go to -- to vote.</span> <span id="s1118">I woke -- by the way, I worked for a polling place, and I go do it for quite a few years.</span> <span id="s1119">The percentages comparing Europe and the United States, who go to the polls to vote, is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1120">So that is the same thing what I say, American people basically, until election time don’t count -- don’t talk about the politics so much as people of other countries.</span> <span id="s1121">So like I say, there is perhaps a plus, and a minus in it.</span> <span id="s1122">Who knows how the outcome would have been different?</span> <span id="s1123">But the guilt is a guilt in existence.</span> <span id="s1124">Nobody -- when somebody just as recently started to mention for the millenium, talking about presidents.</span> <span id="s1125">And I don’t care what category they’re going to put in Roosevelt, he had made at that particular time, Social Security, and anything like that, yes, there were good things.</span> <span id="s1126">But we have a proverb in Hebrew that we say, “Wherever there is light, there is always a shadow.”</span> <span id="s1127">And we know it when we speak scholastically from school.</span> <span id="s1128">When you put in that little stick in the ground, at 12 o’clock the shadow is the smallest, but there is a shadow.</span> <span id="s1129">So you always must understand it, to be understanding to people.</span> <span id="s1130">There is always going to be that shadow, there’s always going to be some people who do not, or did not know well, or don’t understand the situation well, to opinionize certain ways.</span> <span id="s1131">However, I would not label it, if anybody comes to ask me with that question.</span> <span id="s1132">Do you think -- yes, there are.</span> <span id="s1133">But I always -- I always give the answer why, as I just said it.</span> <span id="s1134">Either those people are not aware, or they are guilty.</span> <span id="s1135">They are guilty of why the American government, and the American people did let it happen the way it happened.</span> <span id="s1136">And this is always going to be a matter -- how do you going to bring the time back, with those people back, to be judged there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Let me ask you something, did you talk -- when you first arrived, and you had -- and you were meeting with your family in the United States, and yo -- did you ask them these questions at all, or did you talk about these issues?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: I was vocal about it right there and then.</span> <span id="s1139">The majority people gave me an answer, we did not know.</span> <span id="s1140">And I used to madly answer them, that’s the story I heard with the German people, they say, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1141">But the stench of the concentration camp was in their backyard, and those people came saying they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1142">I says, so please, I used to chastise tremendously, especially Jewish people, and in my family same way.</span> <span id="s1143">Please don’t tell me you didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1144">It was publicized everywhere, and you did know.</span> <span id="s1145">The point was, you were too busy with yourself, because I had gotten answers like these here.</span> <span id="s1146">My wife used to work in a bakery here, as a clerk, and a lot of times, people would say the same thing.</span> <span id="s1147">They ask her about accent the first thing, you know, the accent.</span> <span id="s1148">So, politely you would say, “Oh, we’ve -- Holocaust survivor.”</span> <span id="s1149">“Oh, we also had here, we had a depression in here.”</span> <span id="s1150">So, when a person can go ahead to metaphorize the depression with the Holocaust, I believe that’s a very low tone, and low way of doing it.</span> <span id="s1151">I wrote, for instance, to the paper, they published it, but they fixed my clock, they put in just a few sentences.</span> <span id="s1152">That editorialist writer tried to take Mozambique, and all the other places, and compare it with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1153">I, a few times wrote it, and the last time I don -- I don’t get tired of writing, and I asked, how dare?</span> <span id="s1154">I says, “The Jews did not ask for territory.</span> <span id="s1155">The Jews did not ask for any recognition as far as government, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1156">But in Mozambique, or in the other place, those are people who are fighting political wars, and religious wars.</span> <span id="s1157">Where do you compare these with the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1158">The Holocaust had nothing of that nature.</span> <span id="s1159">The Holocaust was just done, provoked by a government, made up laws in Nuremberg, and for one reason, because you were born Jewish, therefore you deserved to die.</span> <span id="s1160">Or that’s -- give them the right to kill you, or all kinds of other reasons.”</span> <span id="s1161">Which, you say how ca -- how can people, in their sane mind, make that comparison, be that it’s Kosovo, be that it’s Mozambique.</span> <span id="s1162">Yes, it happens there, yes, there are atrocities there.</span> <span id="s1163">Yes, the Serbs wanted to get -- get rid of the Albanians.</span> <span id="s1164">Yes, the Catholics don’t appreciate the Moslems.</span> <span id="s1165">Yes, the Moslems maybe don’t like the Jews, or the others.</span> <span id="s1166">We know that there will be dissatisfaction.</span> <span id="s1167">But the usage of the word holocaust cannot, and should never be made over such a analogy to interpret it.</span> <span id="s1168">Because no matter which dictionary in the world, be Webster’s or anybody else, they mix in a word of sacrifice, burning.</span> <span id="s1169">Yes, we were the sacrifice for the hungry lions of Germany.</span> <span id="s1170">I said it in my manuscript.</span> <span id="s1171">Of course, the rewrite doesn’t bring out these kinds of sentences.</span> <span id="s1172">But that’s -- what -- I cannot stand that word, that -- that word holocaust, when you read from a dictionary, or certain dictionaries to say it’s a burning, it’s a sacrifice.</span> <span id="s1173">I cannot a-answer that.</span> <span id="s1174">The Holocaust was a definitely -- meaning by a government from their top level, to the man on the street, that he was ordered, if he didn’t want it -- to do it, that this is the way he was graded.</span> <span id="s1175">That was the difference between going to the front lines, or being in the concentration camps, and be a commander there, or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1176">What they got from everything, including the gold teeth that they tore out, or the watches and rings that took away, to send to their loved ones, or to accumulate all what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: So are you tel -- are you saying you have trouble with the word, the term holocaust, as it’s used?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: I have the trouble for always and forever, when anybody tried to analogize, or metaphorize the word holocaust to anything that is going on.</span> <span id="s1179">I give you an example.</span> <span id="s1180">Ghetto is another one that I have a problem with.</span> <span id="s1181">When Harlem is called a ghetto, I wish to the world that they would only be living in these type of ghettos, and believe me there would not have been a such thing.</span> <span id="s1182">When we define ghettos, we must always define the ghetto where are we talking about.</span> <span id="s1183">The ghetto of Rome?</span> <span id="s1184">The ghetto of Venice, which it was the first?</span> <span id="s1185">And because of grata, came into ghetto, because it was the steel bars that it was made around there, and it was near a foundry, but that name was fine.</span> <span id="s1186">So the first ghetto.</span> <span id="s1187">Or, do we talk of the ghetto of Rome, that the Jews were put there, and only for one reason, become Catholic, and you’re free.</span> <span id="s1188">Those little places are still left today.</span> <span id="s1189">Where it used to be the Jesuits used to come out to the Jews each time they let them out from the ghetto, they would say, “Why don’t you become a Christian, and you wouldn’t have to live in here?”</span> <span id="s1190">When they came back to return to let them into the ghetto, it was still the same [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1191">How can anybody make that analogy to that word ghetto to use when the Black people of America were living in their neighborhoods?</span> <span id="s1192">They were living in their neighborhoods because they felt good.</span> <span id="s1193">Jews were living in the Bronx, or in Skokie because -- not that anybody put them there, because they felt good.</span> <span id="s1194">But when a government puts you in a place, and they make barbed wire, or any kind of enclosure, and you have to have a permit to go in, and you have to have a permit going out, and you denied from all freedoms, you become an inhuman.</span> <span id="s1195">Are you going to compare this here with a [indecipherable] neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1196">No, I cannot tolerate that.</span> <span id="s1197">And I doubt it any survivor from the Holocaust could tolerate.</span> <span id="s1198">But we know a lot of writers take the law in their own hands, and the thing they emphasize, to say if it was an airplane who was lost, and so many, maybe a few hundred people got killed by that, they say it was a total holocaust.</span> <span id="s1199">I don’t know from where they have the audacity, or the shortage of words in their command, that they have to use that word holocaust, to make the issue be blown up more out of proportion.</span> <span id="s1200">We are talking about six million human.</span> <span id="s1201">Sure, somebody will tell me that 25 million is what the Nazis brought over.</span> <span id="s1202">So we’re talking about 19 -- yes, we must establish the old, famous word, that other people than Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s1203">But the Jews were meant to be killed.</span> <span id="s1204">So the other people maybe could have been killed by way, be that they were criminals, be that they were in the way of them, or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1205">But the Jewish people were definitely meant, and put by the laws, executed with armies to do that.</span> <span id="s1206">So how can you analogize something like this, or metaphorize that word for a situation like that, like that woman did to, say Mozambique?</span> <span id="s1207">So she fixed my clock.</span> <span id="s1208">She gave me about seven or eight lines, instead of like she had a big spread.</span> <span id="s1209">And that happens all the time.</span> <span id="s1210">Like I started to tell you that story about that -- with the 10,000 Jews that he claimed Berlin had saved.</span> <span id="s1211">It’s a lie.</span> <span id="s1212">But the press will pick up these lies fast, and don’t give you an edge, to let you respond in the proper way.</span> <span id="s1213">So, that’s democracy, I suppose.</span> <span id="s1214">So, I cannot say any other way.</span> <span id="s1215">In democracy everybody gets into these here [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1216">There will never be a perfect world, there isn’t a perfect family.</span> <span id="s1217">You don’t have a family, with the same mother and father, and they have three, four kids, and all kids are the same.</span> <span id="s1218">So my expectation, to have a world of such ideals, history proves that it never happened, and I don’t care to what denomination they belong, or to what religion they adopted.</span> <span id="s1219">We cannot do it.</span> <span id="s1220">In order to do that, we woulda have to create a new world from A, to start in an -- in an [indecipherable] here, that you cannot leave any other way, but everybody’s the same, and everybody feels the same.</span> <span id="s1221">But we know we will not achieve it, and history’s not going to change.</span> <span id="s1222">The least we can do is fight for the rights.</span> <span id="s1223">But again, I’ll repeat it.</span> <span id="s1224">To take any situation of -- a situation in history and metaphorize it for another situation, by that same name, is wrong.</span> <span id="s1225">Doesn’t have to be just Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1226">Could have been any other usage of the word, like I said the word ghetto.</span> <span id="s1227">Which ghetto are we talking about?</span> <span id="s1228">Nazi ghetto?</span> <span id="s1229">We’re talking about -- or the other ghettos?</span> <span id="s1230">There was always the casbah in Africa, when we see it in the film.</span> <span id="s1231">That was also a means of a ghetto.</span> <span id="s1232">But that was a separation of doing certain things.</span> <span id="s1233">A neighborhood is not a ghetto, and let’s -- let -- let’s understand each other.</span> <span id="s1234">When you have the freedom where -- to choose where you want to live, even in a restricted area, even, let’s assume the niggers, as they used to be called, which it’s a -- was, I think because of the Niger river, you know what I mean, it was interpret like that, even at that time, they still had the opportunity of living on this street, or on that street, they did not go to ask the government.</span> <span id="s1235">They moved on their own.</span> <span id="s1236">But the -- when we talk eras with Holocaust, when we talk about eras from the ghetto, that was restricted, you couldn’t, as I just aforementioned, with the priests, or the Jesuits who would stay there, and tell them, why don’t you join us?</span> <span id="s1237">So when you get the choice, how can it be so bad about it.</span> <span id="s1238">As -- in the ghetto, I used to have to discuss it with my father’s brother, who was a rabbi, and he was reminding the 14th century Spain, and he would say, with his words, can you imagine, because he was a religious person, he says, “God had conference with the Jews of Spain,” so he let them have a choice, and those who wanted to remain Jews, remained Jews.</span> <span id="s1239">Some were -- that it -- were caught, wound up with the -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: -- to come from work, and I have seen the killings what they did, of children, of so on, I used to be shaken up.</span> <span id="s1241">I used to be shaken up, and I used to come -- I says, children, they did not have time to sin.</span> <span id="s1242">Why were they murdered?</span> <span id="s1243">And that again comes to part of the analogy which I’m talking about, or metaphor to say, when killing children, are you going to compare this here to other situations?</span> <span id="s1244">No, there is no comparison to that.</span> <span id="s1245">That was a unique situation, and it must for history -- historical events, or history for the future, remain a unique event what it happened.</span> <span id="s1246">We see a lot of times of atrocities that it happened to people, but for as long governments were involved in these atrocities, it doesn’t become a singled out case, it becomes a part.</span> <span id="s1247">The Holocaust was involved from a government, with an army, and everything like this here to carry out.</span> <span id="s1248">Can you imagine, people were denied to go to the front lines, for as long there were good killers of Jews.</span> <span id="s1249">Now, can you have anything to compare a situation like that with?</span> <span id="s1250">You cannot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Okay, we’re talking about being in -- in Chicago in the -- in the early 1950’s, and you’re going to school, and -- and working to establish a business, and you have kids.</span> <span id="s1252">How aware were you, and how interested were you in -- in political situations that were going on in -- in those years, or in broader social and cultural issues, or were you more focused on just trying to build your own life, and your family, or were you kind of aware of some of the -- some of the things like the -- were you following the Korean war, and those issues, or -- or the -- the Civil Rights movement as it started up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: I was -- became a democrat, I believe right now, before I even was justified to go to walt, you know, but I was a democrat.</span> <span id="s1254">President Truman left a very big mark on me, his interpretation of political events.</span> <span id="s1255">I must say, til this day, although, in the interim of the years being in America as an American, and I didn’t miss an election that I didn’t vote, even -- even if it wasn’t a regular election, but it was just a matter of a party election, which it was, I always voted, because I feel, after what I’ve been through, where voting was denied for me, where citizenryship was denied from me, that this is a privilege thing that one could never give up, and I never did, and I never failed to vote.</span> <span id="s1256">And like I said, President Truman left a big -- that buck stops here, he left a lot of good things on me, and through the era, every once in awhile it happened, for instance, I voted for President Reagan over President Carter, because I was very mad at President Carter’s era that he was the president.</span> <span id="s1257">I personally [indecipherable] he did not deserve to be a president.</span> <span id="s1258">He made a good peanut farmer.</span> <span id="s1259">He will never go in through history as a good president.</span> <span id="s1260">We lost a lot of things that we still haven’t straightened out because of his misjudgment.</span> <span id="s1261">And I believe above all, when we are talking about the prisoners, just look what he did at that time, playing into the hands of Khomeini with Iran.</span> <span id="s1262">We never -- we never fixed that rupture since then.</span> <span id="s1263">But if he would have invoke at that time, our military might, which we had and we could, because when a country invades an embassy of the next country, that’s a declaration of war, even if it’s not officially said, the word, but that international law is an in -- is immediately, it’s a declaration of war.</span> <span id="s1264">So therefore, he was justified as president to do a much better job than he did.</span> <span id="s1265">And I believe the loss -- the horn of Africa at that time, and inflation that had gone up to 27 and half percent, sure the retired people loved him for that, because they didn’t -- some of them didn’t make as much money on their jobs as these inflationary dollars, they thought brought it to them, because elderly people, of course, don’t spend as much as young people.</span> <span id="s1266">So when they got 18 and 20 percent on their bank books, you know, or even the -- even 18 percent, that was big money for them, and you know what I mean, they want -- but look at, they would have only turned around to see that the 18 percent that they earned, they have to go out in the marketplace, and pay 22 percent for it, if they were to buy.</span> <span id="s1267">So in the long run, they lost four percent, not that they gained that much.</span> <span id="s1268">So I mean, there was a lot of good things, and therefore when it came Reagan to go for president, I did vote for him.</span> <span id="s1269">Not for so much that it was a vote for him, as it was a vote against President Carter.</span> <span id="s1270">I believe it’s -- certain elections, I’d probably cross the line, because I like one candidate, a cert -- over a certain party, better than the other one.</span> <span id="s1271">So, in generalizing, or -- or finalizing my statement, I would say, when you come to that little room, and you come behind that curtain to vote your opinion, a person should think about a little bit.</span> <span id="s1272">And I was always thinking about who I vote for.</span> <span id="s1273">And -- and I have been -- I am encouraging other people the same way.</span> <span id="s1274">So yes, I became immediately an American by going into politics, meaning supporting the political will.</span> <span id="s1275">I became a democrat, and I’ve been a registered democrat all the years since we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1276">And hopefully, unless I see the Republican party grown up, and understand that all of us are not millionaires, and all of us don’t have inheritance in the oil, and in the others, and we still have to go out to make a living, so if they want our labor force to turn around and become a labor force of Mexico, I don’t say they’re justified there.</span> <span id="s1277">But they live in Mexico, and if they can take it, with their livelihood that provided, fine.</span> <span id="s1278">But here in America, as Americans, we’re entitled to have a Social Security, we entitled to have our Medicare, and we also entitled to all the goods of life, that is given, like all others.</span> <span id="s1279">So therefore, when today we see that, for instance, the -- the -- the amount a person can earn, I don’t care that people say he’s a -- a youngster from school and goes to work for the minimum wage.</span> <span id="s1280">The minimum wage is understandable that no one can remain forever.</span> <span id="s1281">But at the same time, we must understand that sometimes in life there are people in between jobs, and when they go in, and they have to earn this measly few dollars, is not right.</span> <span id="s1282">Again, we cannot make that this industry belongs just to the kids, to school kids, or so on.</span> <span id="s1283">That would not be democratic either.</span> <span id="s1284">And this is why I cannot be a Republican as yet, because the democrats still, at least show me the belief of life that every American deserves to get, and I supported villa myself, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: In the er -- in the 1950’s, you -- you had come just recently out of a Communist system, and you were critical of it.</span> <span id="s1286">How did you feel about McCarthyism, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: I was terribly disgusted with that era, and all, because here, I saw repetition of yesteryears under the Communism, not under Hitler, where people were convicted -- in minds you can’t, but in open, to convict them before they even were proven guilty.</span> <span id="s1288">And we know the old saying in the USA, you’re not guilty until proven.</span> <span id="s1289">And the McCarthy era tried to change all of that around, and thanks God for sane heads, that it existed, that that man was removed, but the laws were not changed to favor him.</span> <span id="s1290">And I hope that lesson serves for always.</span> <span id="s1291">You prove first that a man is guilty, before you make him be guilty.</span> <span id="s1292">And this I believe is the law of humanity, this is the law -- a law without justice is not -- is not a good law.</span> <span id="s1293">And this is the j -- this is what it would be, a law without justice, you know what I mean, to let McCarthyism exist.</span> <span id="s1294">So they just -- you gotta obey the law.</span> <span id="s1295">Of course you’ll have to obey the law, but let us make the laws with justice, so therefore they wouldn’t -- the laws wouldn’t become law under this here circumstance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: You were raising -- I’m still thinking about that -- th-that same era, the decade of the 1950’s, when you’re getting settled in -- in the United States, and -- and I’m wondering did you -- did you and your wife talk a lot about -- about the Holocaust and what had happened, and did you talk with your children about it when they were young?</span> <span id="s1297">A: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s1298">I must confess again something.</span> <span id="s1299">We never sit down per se to discuss that era with our kids, because our pain is -- is tremendous, and we feel like that we are giving anguish and pain to our children, would not be a justified way.</span> <span id="s1300">As a matter of fact, in a Jewish way, it’s definitely against that you should not imply anguish on someone else, because that’s a sin to do.</span> <span id="s1301">So we never did.</span> <span id="s1302">But my daughter, for instance, she's a principal in a school, in a Jewish school for the English parts.</span> <span id="s1303">She’s got two Masters, and she’s now going for her Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1304">She learned on -- about the Holocaust scholastically.</span> <span id="s1305">She takes her schoolchildren to the museum, it used to b -- in Washington, D.C., at least twice a year, for all the years since.</span> <span id="s1306">She was also, while her husband was starting law in the George Washington University in -- in D.C., she was teaching at Bethesda, Maryland, and I had very good accolades about her teaching, from the principal at that time.</span> <span id="s1307">So I must say, she cared to know, and she found out about it.</span> <span id="s1308">She rehearsed a lot of times, Elie Wiesel’s poems and stories, and she is involved in things like that.</span> <span id="s1309">But on one -- one on one basis, if she would ask us sometimes, would be different, we discussed it, but otherwise, to say let me tell you how this and that happened, unless they ask, we do not make.</span> <span id="s1310">With our grandchildren, maybe sometimes, but also in the same way.</span> <span id="s1311">We would not ahead to get in on the subject.</span> <span id="s1312">Now, the other part I must tell you is, it’s a funny thing about the survivors of the Holocaust, we may come to a party, or we may come to a house as an invitation for dinner, and maybe it’s baseball season, and you talk about who’s going to be in the pennant, or who’s going to be in the World Series, or it could be football, and the same conversation at this time.</span> <span id="s1313">But we will not get in maybe 50 percent of the time consumed together, without invoking a part of the Holocaust, without invoking a part of that era.</span> <span id="s1314">Like, for instance, a lot of our friends are partisans, but it is -- that they be -- were in the forest, some hidden in the forest, but some of them are also former concentration camp inmates.</span> <span id="s1315">We do not make the differentiation.</span> <span id="s1316">But I noticed that be wherever we come, be to a wedding, or to come to the Days of Remembrance, that past era has never died in us, and we don’t want it to die.</span> <span id="s1317">I must tell you from the standpoint of doctor, I suffer high blood pressure to this day.</span> <span id="s1318">And I used to have a doctor who was a Holocaust survivor’s son, and whenever I would come to him to test me, and he would put on the blood pressure on me, so before that, he would go, had -- “So, Harold, did you write to the paper lately?”</span> <span id="s1319">Or this and that and the other.</span> <span id="s1320">He sort of would provoke me to the something about this here.</span> <span id="s1321">All of a sudden he takes my blood pressure, it’s maybe going to be 190 over 90.</span> <span id="s1322">“Harold, I want you to lie down, don’t talk to anybody, rest up, I’ll be back.”</span> <span id="s1323">Come back about 10 minutes later, now the blood pressure would go down.</span> <span id="s1324">And he’d go with me to -- says, “Look, as a doctor, I must tell you my part, it’s no good for you, because look how much working up you do yourself by talking on the issue.</span> <span id="s1325">However, I would not want you to forget.”</span> <span id="s1326">So, what I’m trying -- what I’m trying to bring out is, the majority of us do not want to forget.</span> <span id="s1327">We feel it’s a sin to forget what we been through, all the atrocities, watching ourselves, our loved ones being murdered, for no other reason but being born Jewish, which it’s a mark that the world should carry, the new mark of Cain, of the biblical days of Cain and Abel, we believe biblically that God made a sign on his forehead, and that sign we interpret was to be for people always to remember that he was a people killer.</span> <span id="s1328">I used to convert this here time through my being in America, before the Holocaust Museum was established, and while the Holocaust Museum was established, I’d be asking you to give me the time a little bit more, and I will dwell on it, to make it.</span> <span id="s1329">Because my analogy was also that the museums that they were built to -- literally to display all the past what had happened during the Holocaust, is a place of learning for the new people to see about it, that it must be there, because that’s the mark of Cain, that must be to remind those people and tell them, look what it happens at an era where people remain quiet.</span> <span id="s1330">Where people refused to disagree with bad laws.</span> <span id="s1331">Where people refused to disagree with bad leaders.</span> <span id="s1332">That’s the era, what you see it happened here.</span> <span id="s1333">So the museum era, I always make reminission to that -- to the mark of Cain, of the same story.</span> <span id="s1334">I had big fights, on paper.</span> <span id="s1335">Without being prepared to tell you, I cannot tell you the date, but approximately, the date goes back about the number of years, not too many years, where on the newspaper in New York, it was written -- and that was the era of the building of the Holocaust Museum, that there were a group of Jews who were against it, especially the religious part.</span> <span id="s1336">That rabbi, I don’t know should I mention his name, or not mention his name, I hear him at the same times, one Sunday on the radio, where he comes out because he was the one of the creators of Outreach program, which it means to bring Jewish kids back.</span> <span id="s1337">But I’ll -- I am not going to say anything other than the facts.</span> <span id="s1338">His name is Mr. Buchwalt, Ephraim Buchwalt, and he and me had for a year’s time, a correspondence, after the article that it appeared in the newspaper in New York, saying the Holocaust is killing the American Jews.</span> <span id="s1339">Which it was a tremendu -- a tremendous shameful headline to be seen for me, a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s1340">I have spoken to Miles Lehrman when he came here to this part, in our synagogue, pleading to help about building the -- the museum.</span> <span id="s1341">I believe every city in the world should have -- not as big, but a little part dedicated to the Holocaust, by way of museum.</span> <span id="s1342">That the people should know, and a -- serve as a reminder, every day, what complacency does to a people.</span> <span id="s1343">Not to reveal all the rest of the slogans what it is, but complacency’s what it causes.</span> <span id="s1344">Fascism, Hitlerism, Nazism, under any schism that you want, complacency happens to do all the bad things, be that it happens in our nearby countries, be that in Haiti for instance, or other countries, where the people are depressed, only because there is a mond of people over there, complacent to what their own has done.</span> <span id="s1345">So, I carried out a correspondence with this person, and I tried to explain it to him.</span> <span id="s1346">His article was saying that if this money -- he accused the museum being guilty, or be the building, for Jewish pi -- intermarriages, because after all, I gotta take the other side, a Catholic child, who is married out of his faith to a Jewish child, the other family feels just as broken as this one.</span> <span id="s1347">So I don’t want to be a one-sided with my analogy what I’m making over here, but so my answer to him about all the accusations over why this money should not be spent there, but should be spent on education, was as follows.</span> <span id="s1348">I said, those people who donated for the building of the museum, were anxious to see the museum built, for that reason, the mark of Cain.</span> <span id="s1349">However, if you guys feel like you need a campaign to raise -- to build more schools, then why don’t you do it?</span> <span id="s1350">Why do you use your neglect, what you didn’t do yourself, to try to deny a historical event that it must exist?</span> <span id="s1351">I fought with him, one rabbi, for a year.</span> <span id="s1352">I fought in Chicago with a head man who is the publisher of a paper called the Chicago Jewish news, where he came up again, which it was almost like he read an article, and it came at Yom HaShoah, Remembrance Day of the Holocaust, he came out athird of the articles, caught me at a time when I was in Chicago, and we were the B’nai Brith, and I was brought -- people know that I write to the papers, people know that I’m vocal, and at the same time, that I will take my time to write.</span> <span id="s1353">And I was sended the paper, “Harold, did you see that, he was inter -- to -- they interviewed from the Sun-Times, by this, that, and the other, read it.”</span> <span id="s1354">I start reading the first paragraph, I says, “Look, it’s a repetition what I had to do with Rabbi Buchwalt, in -- with New York, a few years ago.</span> <span id="s1355">This man probably got the lesson from him, and he mentions in a different form,” after all, thanks God, the American language is a very rich language with teasers, and so many words that you can use more -- more than one way, but the meaning remains still the same.</span> <span id="s1356">And I again had to learn -- give him a lesson.</span> <span id="s1357">Of course, I saw it Saturday night, and on Monday morning, Harold Zissman, with Sonia his wife, were right there, at the office of the printing of that paper, with askening the questions, how dare is he to write these kind of words, and so on.</span> <span id="s1358">Nobody’s asking you to -- to donate to that.</span> <span id="s1359">Nobody’s asking you to come and visit if you don’t want to.</span> <span id="s1360">So if you cannot help anything, don’t knock it at least.</span> <span id="s1361">And if you knock it, have reasons, justifiable, why your side is right.</span> <span id="s1362">And I had to enter with him with a dialog first, which of course the answer was he’s out of town, you can’t see him, Mr. Zissman.</span> <span id="s1363">I says, “Okay, I’ll leave my message to him.</span> <span id="s1364">I’m going to leave tomorrow for Chicago, and I’ll mail you an article which I hope you print, because I’ll assure you -- I -- I’m preparing you, if you looking for demonstrations, you’re going to have them.</span> <span id="s1365">Because I, as a survivor, who fought in the underground, will not live to see the day that Jews will write these kind of things against museums, and against [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1366">If they are bad -- th -- masters of their own destiny, how to raise money to build more schools or better schools, don’t blame on somebody else, who did their work diligently, it’s a -- must be done.”</span> <span id="s1367">Well, he printed my article in the paper, no question about it.</span> <span id="s1368">I had another dialog with him, and another, afterwards there.</span> <span id="s1369">What I’m trying to say to you, just like the Holocaust is not yet understood well, while we are still living, so is the building to prevent the future from happening definitely still.</span> <span id="s1370">A lot of people come -- you know what we had with this Holocaust in -- and I was -- I must tell you, although I know him in person, I wrote to him, I’m very happy that Miles Lehrman is dismissed.</span> <span id="s1371">And I hope he doesn’t go against me with any publications, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1372">That man did -- and I wrote to him publicly -- of course, Mr. Birnbaum, he came at that time, to respond to me, which I have it, the letter.</span> <span id="s1373">Now, another letters, I have a file with letters.</span> <span id="s1374">And let me explain myself, he did not respond with my question it was, that he had no business mingling in with the Polish government, because he is only the head of this museum, he is not a re -- he is not in Madeline’s Albright’s position, he’s not -- you know I mean, the Secretary of State, to speak to a foreign about the [indecipherable] in Auschwitz, and so on, which it was over there.</span> <span id="s1375">And the dealings what he started to do.</span> <span id="s1376">But, it turned up the museum almost to be a political issue, which definitely -- be the Arafat issue, with all of these here cases, we must not forget ourselves, as I say, it’s a mark of Abel, it’s a mark of learning, but we cannot let by all means, politicize either the memory, or the place like museums, for any personal use, or personal understanding.</span> <span id="s1377">Anybody wishes to come to see this museum is welcome.</span> <span id="s1378">But to make a dignitary issue, like to make this here because he is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1379">I don’t care if the pope would come, and he wants to see Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s1380">If he will be there, I assure you, he’s going to be greeted as a pope, yes, but no politicizing issues will ever grow out of that.</span> <span id="s1381">And the same thing goes for anybody else, whether they are Moslem, whether they are Catholic, or Buddhist, or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1382">Come and see, what it happened in an era, when people became silent to murder for no reason, and no cause, only because by being burn -- born on the wrong side of the street.</span> <span id="s1383">And this will be an outspoken thing for me to say when anybody du -- even while it’s a good thing the ma -- the m -- the museum exists.</span> <span id="s1384">It’s a bad thing of a Mr. Rioch, or any of the other people, over this person.</span> <span id="s1385">He’s not educated well enough to lead that part -- that he is.</span> <span id="s1386">But he was a good person politically, to raise money for the party, and so on.</span> <span id="s1387">And that’s what he got there.</span> <span id="s1388">I hope, since you’re a young lady, and involved in that, that we see for the future that no politics should ever come between the museum -- the Holocaust Museum, the memorial of these here six million, or if you want to speak for 25 million that were there, to ever let politics take over, and make this a showplace that people should come to politicize.</span> <span id="s1389">I, as long I can, will always write about it, to whoever the parties are, be it Miles Lehrman, be it Rabbi Weiss giving the accolades about it.</span> <span id="s1390">And I just wrote, it’s still not published in the Jewish journal, I wrote to ak -- of course, to give him a kudos for what he tirelessly continued with his campaign, because he exposed all these issues, with a lot of us didn’t know what it was going on.</span> <span id="s1391">Because you gotta have an access, you know what I mean, way to get into that.</span> <span id="s1392">But in a general term, I must tell you, I was always, and will always be vocal for the rights -- be -- whichever it -- way it is.</span> <span id="s1393">It could be my own brother if -- I wish he would be alive, if he would do something wrong, I would be vocal about it to say, “You’re wrong, my brother, you should not have done it, or you di -- shouldn’t have done it that way.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: How is it that you’re finding out all th -- did you just say that it was your rabbi who was giving you all the information about what’s going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: No, Rabbi Weiss writes -- and he is in Riverdale if you know, and he carries on -- he’s the head of an organization called Zampa, which it means a folks organization of the people.</span> <span id="s1396">And he often -- again, I like him, because he was outspoken, all the time.</span> <span id="s1397">I like him because he went to Auschwitz, although he was accused that he tried to beat the nuns, which it was a pure lie.</span> <span id="s1398">But you see, people like him, like myself, who are not afraid to expose your name, or to go to speak out what you really mean, but in the right way.</span> <span id="s1399">That’s the very important thing.</span> <span id="s1400">I could be right, but I must express it in the right, and the proper way, and the same way.</span> <span id="s1401">He didn’t try to knock anybody down, but he was speaking out for the right.</span> <span id="s1402">And the rights of those people murdered, laying there, have a right at least -- I don’t say it’s gotta be the Magen David, or anything, but they have -- or the eternal light, but have a right not to be converted now, y -- after death, posthumously.</span> <span id="s1403">There was some Jews who converted, okay, so that’s their business.</span> <span id="s1404">There are Jews who believe in Jesus, that’s their business.</span> <span id="s1405">But let’s not go ahead to make a political issue out of an era, as such.</span> <span id="s1406">We must remember that, and we must fight for it, to see not to let others do.</span> <span id="s1407">That’s -- that’s always my statement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Okay, Mr. Zissman is now going to read one of his poems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: This poem is headlined, “My Prayer in Plight of a Dream.</span> <span id="s1410">The distant forest, with the thick bush, swamp, and quicksand, birds chirping, humming to no end, under tall trees and trails.</span> <span id="s1411">Nature’s way to preserve and protect, as everyone’s land.</span> <span id="s1412">The woodpecker, with his loud noise, building his nest prevails.</span> <span id="s1413">The crow, with loud, crying flight, as if dangerous on the way, to signal the others about the plight in their midst.</span> <span id="s1414">The robin -- the robins, and b -- and hummingbirds, are all astound to what may, busy with their catch, to quench hunger, in view of the beast.</span> <span id="s1415">A kingdom of their own, all around.</span> <span id="s1416">How safe could it be for me?</span> <span id="s1417">The fenced ghetto must not be in the way.</span> <span id="s1418">I must escape now to the forest, with big trees, and bush, birds, beast, insects, danger.</span> <span id="s1419">Leave family and ghetto behind, a place to fight and hide.</span> <span id="s1420">Time is short, I must decide, the forest is the place to escape.</span> <span id="s1421">Dear God, grant me those wings of a bird, to fly and be safe, so I could fly from trunk to twig, from twig to branch.</span> <span id="s1422">To the forest, to join the fight, not hide, to escape the murder.</span> <span id="s1423">Oh God, grace me with those wings so I may survive, and be free.</span> <span id="s1424">Grant me life, to remain your servant, to reveal your grace always.</span> <span id="s1425">I must be a witness to tell how hell came down to earth, to destroy the people of the book.</span> <span id="s1426">Who’ll be your new children?</span> <span id="s1427">Must we all vanish?</span> <span id="s1428">We are your children, can’t you grant us life?</span> <span id="s1429">Why all that murder?</span> <span id="s1430">No prayer, no cry, no plea.</span> <span id="s1431">Must we all die?</span> <span id="s1432">Where are you people?</span> <span id="s1433">Are you going to remain silent to murder?</span> <span id="s1434">I shall fight to survive, tell our sorrow, ask where was man and God?”</span> <span id="s1435">See, I never speak just to God alone when I’m asking about people coming to tell me, didn’t that bother you to ask the question where was God?</span> <span id="s1436">And I, my answer has always been the unique answer to say.</span> <span id="s1437">I don’t know where God is, but I do know where man is, and I see man.</span> <span id="s1438">So my question was always be, where were man, and then I ask where was God.</span> <span id="s1439">Because man were visible, and seen.</span> <span id="s1440">So I cannot unleash my sorrow, and datday to God.</span> <span id="s1441">I still remain [indecipherable] to man, and his life.</span> <span id="s1442">To people, and not just to God.</span> <span id="s1443">So therefore, it could never be misunderstood by my way, the way I see all what had happened, all the sorrow stories to tell, and all the innocent people who were murdered just for being born Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: This is tape number four, of an interview with Harold Zissman.</span> <span id="s1446">When you moved to the Chicago area, did you move to Skokie right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: No, I -- at first, we were living like a mansion to you, in a basement apartment where we came.</span> <span id="s1448">Then, when my son was born, and my brother-in-law with us, in 1949, we could no longer live in that apartment, and I had to pay under the table, because apartments were not available, and it was illegal to charge any higher rent.</span> <span id="s1449">So that was the means by which way one could get an apartment, is to pay under the table.</span> <span id="s1450">It was sort of like a -- a guy gave that as a donation.</span> <span id="s1451">That’s what I was asked to say, and to write on my check, that that was a donation, upon this donor, to be given to his famous charity, whatever, he -- he dedicated it to.</span> <span id="s1452">We moved on Edison Street, which it was more known, as about 10 blocks away from Kapp’s park, that we were living there, and there we got on the third floor, a four room apartment, which it was huge by comparison of living in two f-- rooms in a b -- in two rooms in a basement apartment.</span> <span id="s1453">And no air conditioning, of course, for -- and we had two children.</span> <span id="s1454">My brother-in-law, at that particular time was no longer with us, because he was drafted to the army.</span> <span id="s1455">He came to the States late in ’48, and in ’49 with th -- with that outbroke -- break in Korea, he was drafted in the American army, and he, believe it or not, was sent back to Germany, in the same places where he wore a -- a -- as a camp inmate -- I’m meaning as a DP camp inmate, there he was serving with the amer -- with the US uniform, as a soldier.</span> <span id="s1456">Now, when he came back, and we were living still in these four rooms, all of a sudden the four rooms became too small for all of us.</span> <span id="s1457">So we had to go ahead and try to get another apartment, and times were terrible at that time to get another apartment.</span> <span id="s1458">Each time I looked an apartment with three bedrooms, they asked us the question, which it was an infamous item to be asked to Holocaust survivors, do you have any kids?</span> <span id="s1459">That was a painstaking answer.</span> <span id="s1460">I says, “Why would I want a six room ap-apartment if I wouldn’t have any kids?”</span> <span id="s1461">“Well, but we don’t want to rent to little kids that you have with it.”</span> <span id="s1462">And that I kept on and on til -- I was vigorous enough at that time to go ahead and de-decide to buy on my own.</span> <span id="s1463">I wasn’t ready for a home, so we bought a three flat building, at that particular time, which it was in West Roger’s Park in Chicago, one of the very upcoming, beautiful neighborhoods.</span> <span id="s1464">And we lived there til our ch -- til my daughter was of the age to go to high school.</span> <span id="s1465">And at that particular time the run was for Skokie.</span> <span id="s1466">And in Skokie the high schools were very good, and they were upgraded.</span> <span id="s1467">So my daughter decided that she’d rather go to the high school in Skokie, and my son and my daughter both graduated from Skokie High School.</span> <span id="s1468">And while in Skokie -- Niles East was the name of the schools.</span> <span id="s1469">And while in Skokie again, I -- I became organized in the Jewish community, and I maintained at that time, my membership with the B’nai Brith, and it was the B’nai Brith who really dealt me a bad card at the time, when this -- when the Nazis decided that they want to move in Skokie, and being the advice that we got from the B’nai Brith, was very counter to the belief aw -- for me as a survivor, and everybody else.</span> <span id="s1470">Their advice to us was, “Let them march and do their talking, draw your curtains and don’t mind anything at all.</span> <span id="s1471">And if they won’t get any -- any people to come listening to them, they probable decide not to come.”</span> <span id="s1472">Our advice was not to listen to these kind of ways, because basically they were not exercising Freedom of Speech.</span> <span id="s1473">They were exercising their hate for one thing, and the threat of our lives for the second.</span> <span id="s1474">Well, we just got freed from all those things, that we had to go through over again.</span> <span id="s1475">I already mentioned, I believe, in the former tape, didn’t I?</span> <span id="s1476">Did I mention about the [indecipherable] justice department, I already said it to you on that -- on the tape over here, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: You mentioned -- you mentioned the -- a little bit about Skokie, and you mentioned getting onto the Phil Donohue show, and you mentioned going to testify.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: But -- but tell me a little bit more about the background of it.</span> <span id="s1480">Were you -- were you involved with survivor’s groups in Skokie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: Okay, I’ll tell it now.</span> <span id="s1482">While I belonged, as I said, to the B’nai Brith, in Skokie was the first chapter we organized to commemorated the name of Janoush Korchuk.</span> <span id="s1483">Janoush Korchuk really was an assimilated Jew, but he was Jewish at heart, and at that particular time, he was living outside of the ghetto, but he moved into the ghetto, and he opened up orphanage houses, which I believe i-is -- he’s well documented, even through the United Nations, and when that Janoush Korchuk, who was a healer, a doctor of philosophy and everything, the way he composed those children , who were already orphaned, and he was with them.</span> <span id="s1484">The day came when they wanted to eliminate the children in the ghetto, and it was called upon him to surrender the children from his -- from his home, to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1485">He refused, he says, “Wherever my children go, I’m going to go with them.”</span> <span id="s1486">So which it means they wanted to grant him life, but he decided rather to face death in the same manner his children.</span> <span id="s1487">And his way was, “If I cannot survi -- if my children cannot survive, there was no use for me to survive.”</span> <span id="s1488">So that’s a story of importance for everyone to remember, and I believe in the realm of B’nai Brith, and Anti-Defamation League, we found the survivors who were living in Skokie, and who were members of B’nai Brith to open up another lodge, and that lodge was named under Janoush Korchuk, which at many times, on other occasions, I spoke, even on the Days of Remembrance, when I had the opportunity to be the spokesman, I mentioned Janoush Korchuk, and his brave actions, what he did by trying to save the kids, even in the bad days, as it were, to keep them at least human, until the end.</span> <span id="s1489">And he did not refuse a bit about it.</span> <span id="s1490">From there on, as I say, living in Skokie and -- and belonging now to this here B’nai Brith lodge, so when the era came about the Nazis wanting to march in Skokie, and threatening our lives, I became very vocal about it.</span> <span id="s1491">First of all, what I did, it was at city hall on that Monday, which it was a normal meeting, I talked to some guys and told them that we all should gather at the Skokie city hall, and tell them our grievances over why we do not agree to see that the Nazis come to Skokie.</span> <span id="s1492">I was the first of the group to be called to speak, and I voiced my opinion against it, why we do not have to see and repeat our sufferings to accommodate another group in our society.</span> <span id="s1493">They could make their venture any time, anyways, I cannot stop them from speaking.</span> <span id="s1494">But why should we allow them to come in our homes, and disobey the law, to go ahead to spill their hate and venom on all of us, against our lives, since we already went through all of that, and became survivors.</span> <span id="s1495">Must we go through the agony again, just to satisfy a segment of people?</span> <span id="s1496">Why couldn’t they speak on television, radio, wherever they want to, but not come and threaten us in our homes, and playgrounds, wherever we live, and raise new children?</span> <span id="s1497">Words got around, and we got a big crowd at night for the meeting.</span> <span id="s1498">I was asked a question, from the city hall commissioners, and I was asked, what if we grant them the permit, that -- the meeting was basically to determine whether the city hall will grant a permit to the Nazis to come to Skokie.</span> <span id="s1499">And I was asked what will I do at the time, if the Nazis get the permit, and they come to Skokie.</span> <span id="s1500">And I politely answered the commissioner at that particular time, I says, “I cannot tell you now what I would do at time of anger.</span> <span id="s1501">You know, when a person gets angry, and an anger of that type, I don’t know, will I grab a stone, will I grab a bottle, whatever I will do to throw and disrupt probably, all of that.”</span> <span id="s1502">He says, “Well, you know, it’s against the law to do it.”</span> <span id="s1503">I says, “It’s -- in my ways of life, it’s against the law for me to re-live the agony one more time, Commissioner.</span> <span id="s1504">So I hope you, as the lawmaker and obeyer, can see that we survivors here, and for that matter, anybody we -- who is not a survivors, have to go through the agony of being threatened with their lives, by these group of mugs, and people, who call themselves the neo-Nazis.”</span> <span id="s1505">Well, needless to say that they did pass the law, the attorneys advised them that it must be -- go ahead and granting in the law, with the rights of the Second Amendment of Free Speech.</span> <span id="s1506">Well, now we had to get re-organized again, we opened up our office, and began to get ads in the paper.</span> <span id="s1507">Skokie became so public that we -- people from Africa, people from Australia, wherever [indecipherable] everybody was granting us the courage for we doing it, and gave us the moral support, and even offered financial support, whatever it may take.</span> <span id="s1508">We mastered to come out on the Phil Donohue show, at that particular time, in public.</span> <span id="s1509">And it was a -- from the Civil Liberties Union, a man, Goldberger, which he was Jewish, who was the one defending them.</span> <span id="s1510">My question to him was, does his heart allow him -- and his conscience, to go, to protect this bloody era of Jewish annihilation?</span> <span id="s1511">Of course, Phil Donohue didn’t let me get close.</span> <span id="s1512">He didn’t let me.</span> <span id="s1513">But I, with my persistency, did not s-succumb to him not letting, and out of place, I yelled long enough til he had to come with the microphone to me, to be heard.</span> <span id="s1514">My daughter, at that particular time, was living in Florida already, and she called me afterwards, “Oh, Daddy, I saw you -- I saw you on television.</span> <span id="s1515">You’re still fighting, looks like to me.”</span> <span id="s1516">That was her words to me.</span> <span id="s1517">I says, “Yes, my dear, my fight did not end, obviously.</span> <span id="s1518">I didn’t think that I’ll have to fight, but I must rise up again and fight again.</span> <span id="s1519">That menace has got to get done with.”</span> <span id="s1520">That was my answer to her.</span> <span id="s1521">Our fight, as I say went on; meeting -- meetings used to take place at times, evenings to last til one o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1522">And we had various plans of how to start.</span> <span id="s1523">There was even at one time a plan that we actually wanted to attack their base, what they had on the south side of Chicago.</span> <span id="s1524">But after big pleas by attorneys, who were in touch with us, from the establishment of Jewish organizations, and the B’nai Brith kept appealing the same thing, draw your curtains and don’t come.</span> <span id="s1525">That’s the best that they could offer for us, which by all means, I had to tell some B’nai Brith people, “Now I see why you did not act out against the situation when we were being murdered.”</span> <span id="s1526">I says, “Because that’s your only solution, draw your curtains, and don’t look.</span> <span id="s1527">And then the same thing goes, put something in your ears, and you don’t listen, or you don’t hear.</span> <span id="s1528">We cannot succumb to that menace,” I said.</span> <span id="s1529">And we organize groups all the time, and see what the plide could do.</span> <span id="s1530">The Jewish establishment in Chicago, with the lawyers who volunteered to our help, suggested that we are to see i -- i -- Springfield, Illinois, the state capital, and we must inaugurate another law, that since freedom of speech must be given to them -- we tried to fight, that yes they can come, even to Skokie and speak, but they cannot wear these Nazi uniforms.</span> <span id="s1531">We made an appearance there, and my appearance unwillingly, was very successful, because I really brought out the call of freedom, I really brought up today meet was exactly on D-Day, where all my compatriots, who were speakers, and former soldiers, and fighters and commanders, did not have the audacity to remember the day it was.</span> <span id="s1532">I, however, the pain was too fresh on me to forget D-Day, because D-Day meant a big time for us at that particular time to see that.</span> <span id="s1533">An-And things like that, you just don’t forget, or mete out of the calendar.</span> <span id="s1534">And I was, after all, became renown -- known.</span> <span id="s1535">We had a lot of gatherings going on, and at one time, we wanted to state our case, so in the JCC, we were divided in three speakers.</span> <span id="s1536">We had a speaker from the Holocaust survivors who was an inmate in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1537">I was the one who represented the partisans, and resistance, and there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Say names if you can remember names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: Well, Rosensweig was one of the speakers, which he was -- his wife was later president, who she was representing those Jews who were in -- in -- in Russia.</span> <span id="s1540">Our president’s -- I must say, our late president, at that time, which she was a woman, and she was very vocal about the issues, she was very much in-involved.</span> <span id="s1541">Her name is Erna Gense, and she was talking in regard, or rather, representing the inmates of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1542">I, Harold Zissman, was taking part, speaking about resistance in the partisans.</span> <span id="s1543">And we were very successful, the room was filled with people, and questions, while we only were thinking it’ll be an hour to two hours, it was after three hours that we had to call a halt to the meeting, and call it for continuance of every day.</span> <span id="s1544">Another thing we organized about, that was all to lightening the situation of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1545">I had, after that, one student that he was studying in medical school, but he was a Jewish boy, interested in Jewish history, that he asked me if he could come to my house, and I will give him on tape all my story, why and what, when -- no more than we discussed it.</span> <span id="s1546">He came to my house, and made a few tapes, and afterwards he says, “Harold, I don’t know how you survived, but I cannot listen to it.”</span> <span id="s1547">He says, “It was too much.”</span> <span id="s1548">I says, “That’s the part of perseverance, and that’s the part of endurance.</span> <span id="s1549">If you want to go on to live, you cannot surrender easily.</span> <span id="s1550">You must keep your fight to the bitter end, just like I described in some of my poems, as it was.”</span> <span id="s1551">Anyways, the other organization what we did, we decided on the Sabbath to send various groups to go to synagogues, bring out our situation on the pulpit, over why our dissatisfaction is with the Nazis do -- who want to march.</span> <span id="s1552">We are trappened, and all of us are trappened.</span> <span id="s1553">We know that we don’t want to have any -- any bad situation, maybe turning into riots, or whatever it is, where it could threaten the business community.</span> <span id="s1554">So therefore, for all things concerned, the best thing is, by which ever way we can derive, that it should be legal and official to stop that march from coming, because at that particular time, the Jewish Defense League, which it was very famous in New York, joined us, and they wanted to become a party with us, to join in the fight against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1555">So, when the joish -- the -- the Jewish League came to us, the joining, it was a more scare on the merchants in the area, because now they knew with the Jewish Defense League around, that definitely hostilities will ic -- incur in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1556">So, we ask what can we do about it?</span> <span id="s1557">Anyways, by that time, the law passed in -- in -- in Springfield, and it was passed, but it was afterwards challenged, that it was illegal that this, in itself, the uniform in itself was declared also part of speech, and we cannot stop it.</span> <span id="s1558">Well, be that it was right, be that it was wrong, maybe the legal heads that we had trying to help us were not the greatest, and the best, but it’s a known factor that American people, including the Jews, do not ever want to see a change in the Second Amendment of Free Speech.</span> <span id="s1559">I perhaps feel the same way, but it’s too hard for me to succumb to the idea that Free Speech, and threatening of life should be one and the same, and therefore granted immunity for that reason.</span> <span id="s1560">That’s why, until this day outspoken, that it was justified for us to stop them.</span> <span id="s1561">However, be for what it’s worth, that it did occur in Chicago later, that we were denied our law, and they came out to speak, but we started the same thing, as I said, we were throwing rocks, and eggs, and whatever you wanted, and the only thing it lasted for about three -- two minutes, or four, and they were -- had to be run out.</span> <span id="s1562">The fact remains that later on we found out that those neo-Nazis were involved in so many lawbreaking things that they did.</span> <span id="s1563">We found out the head of a Mr. Collins, that he was involved with -- with sexual things, involved -- and he was brought to court -- o -- justice, and he was jailed later.</span> <span id="s1564">Which it proves, no more, and no less like Hitler and his gang, they were all not law abiders, but law breakers, but we granted the freedom.</span> <span id="s1565">And of course, I was -- it was interpreted to us to tell this is the democracy in action, that a -- that we must be listening to everybody who wants to speak.</span> <span id="s1566">Yes, listening to whatever we want to speak.</span> <span id="s1567">But listening to someone who threatens my life, one day I hope, will be separated from Freedom of Speech, because it’s the same as yelling fire in a crowded movie house, which this is not Freedom of Speech.</span> <span id="s1568">And we continued our fight later, while I already aforementioned being in the -- speaking for the justice committee, and as I said, the law passed, and we again had a fight on our hands.</span> <span id="s1569">No matter what itch we tried -- we stopped it.</span> <span id="s1570">It was the fact to show what had happened.</span> <span id="s1571">We were stopping that we shouldn’t any more tal -- go to let them demonstrate, so the city hall, and it’s legal people advised, and devised an issue [indecipherable] prohibited, those people living in the neighborhood mind you, were prohibited to go out in that area where the Nazis, if it comes to pass that they will come to speak, so it means we were taken the laws of freedom away from us, that we could not go walk in that perimeter, while they, under the protection of the law, will be guided to let them come in and speech.</span> <span id="s1572">Well, that’s a good lesson to prove what Freedom of Speech means.</span> <span id="s1573">I agree with it, but I don’t agree at the cost of another part of the public, to be denied the laws.</span> <span id="s1574">I believe something over there was not -- acting wrong.</span> <span id="s1575">And we -- we mustered a lot, and since the Civil Liberties Union were protecting the Nazi so much, we decided we must hit them where it hurts, in their pockets.</span> <span id="s1576">Our campaign continued, and we broke them actually, that they did not have enough contributions, and you know, the legal people are very -- trying to legal, but they wanted money for their time, and looks like they had to abandon the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1577">That’s why, in sko -- in Skokie, they couldn’t muster up and come to march.</span> <span id="s1578">But in Chicago, around city hall, even if it only lasted for two minutes, and the amount of money that it cost the city to allow that to happen, between the police, extra time, and extra vigilance that it -- they needed, was ext -- was a tremendous amount.</span> <span id="s1579">I’m glad to hear that it never happened, another case like that, over there.</span> <span id="s1580">In Florida a few times, there were also marches by the neo-Nazis, but they were done in a different way.</span> <span id="s1581">They didn’t go to the height of Collings, and his gang.</span> <span id="s1582">There were different ways with them.</span> <span id="s1583">And it was on one side the Nazis, and on the other side was the anti-Nazis, us.</span> <span id="s1584">And we protested in loud ways, not to let them be heard, over hel -- and then it was all over.</span> <span id="s1585">So, the means to say is, it happened, but never did it reveal itself to be a case like in Skokie, because over there was the hard core of survivors, and that’s what they wanted, and they almost -- almost won the battle to come and speak, but we prohibited them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Tell -- tell me, did you -- was there, to your perception, complete unity among survivors in -- in the Skokie case, or was there any dissension between survivors at all, about what ought to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: It’s a good question you made, and I’m glad that you asked it in a way, because the movie of Skokie did not bring it out.</span> <span id="s1588">There was no deception, but before long, it was so politicized, the issue, that it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1589">I had over there, amongst us, as I mentioned before, the Jewish Defense League.</span> <span id="s1590">Before long, it took a lon -- I took a look, some Communists were also trying to join us, and by all means, we did not want to have a part of no red flag, no this here.</span> <span id="s1591">So this was the bad part, in part, dissension, no, but joiners, of various opinions, which definitely was not in our way, we found to -- to -- to be the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: And you mentioned a little earlier, Rabbi Montrose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Were you a member of his congregation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Well, I was a part member of his congregation, because I belonged to another congregation.</span> <span id="s1596">I always belonged someplace.</span> <span id="s1597">As a matter of fact, our B’nai Brith meetings, still to this day today, take place on Main Street, in se -- in Skokie central, as we call it, where Rabbi Montrose, still, God willing, presides as the rabbi.</span> <span id="s1598">The rabbi was a very vocal helper now, of course, and as I forementioned, we went to synagogues, too, and the -- Skokie’s central synagogue was all with the help we needed to be granted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Did -- did you -- you mentioned feeling angry with the B’nai Brith, because of their position in the -- in the case.</span> <span id="s1600">Did you -- how did you -- how did that resolve itself?</span> <span id="s1601">I mean, you s -- you just mentioned you -- you continued to be involved with B’nai Brith.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: They had a letter cam -- writing campaign to B’nai Brith, and our words was, if you cannot help us, don’t hurt us.</span> <span id="s1603">In other words, it’s too bad that you interpret it one way, and we see it the other way.</span> <span id="s1604">To us it’s Freedom of Speech, yes, but however, threatening our life is no freedom.</span> <span id="s1605">So I believe B’nai Brith does -- wouldn’t like to see that way, either.</span> <span id="s1606">And we asked them, just stay neutral and leave us -- leave us alone, because you advised us not -- make us comfort.</span> <span id="s1607">You make comfort to the enemy instead of making us comfortable about it.</span> <span id="s1608">And I didn’t resign from being a member of B’nai Brith, because one bad issue does not make you to turn against Anti-Defamation League, because that’s what we was trying to claim it.</span> <span id="s1609">We are being a -- defamed over there, and you -- you permission, what you are saying, is let defamation take place, while you trying to say draw your curtains.</span> <span id="s1610">You know what I mean, or sort of shut your ears, you don’t hear.</span> <span id="s1611">But that is not the way to handle a situation like that.</span> <span id="s1612">And thanks God that later on, B’nai Brith, I believe, is becoming more mature about some of these situations, and they realize that it was not the right thing to answer to us, just draw your curtain, because as a whole, B’nai Brith did lose some members also, in the same way.</span> <span id="s1613">I didn’t -- you know, our lodge still remained very viable, and everything like that, but you know, a lot of other people did not want to just register the mildness to the resolution, as we did, and they just absolutely resigned, and it was hard to bring them back in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Did you feel disillusioned with the American judicial system after the whole case, and after -- after it was decided that yes, the -- the First Amendment was going to be upheld in the form that it had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: As I said, I’m all for the First Amendment.</span> <span id="s1616">I’ll go to fight, if I have to, to survive -- for the First Amendment to survive.</span> <span id="s1617">However, we must literally understand, that threatening of life is not a First Amendment right to be treated under Freedom of Speech.</span> <span id="s1618">We must modernize it, if needed, we must amend things in it, but that cannot -- should not be.</span> <span id="s1619">We don’t know when, tomorrow, when another branch of these hating groups will come up.</span> <span id="s1620">We know what it happened in Memphis, we know what it happened with all.</span> <span id="s1621">But the Jews were on the side to help the Black people, and can you imagine that anybody’s going to tell me that it was a matter of Free Speech?</span> <span id="s1622">No, it was not a matter of Free Speech, it was a matter plain, they wanted to kill, they wanted to destroy, and killing and destruction happened.</span> <span id="s1623">We know just recently, only a year ago, what it happened in Chicago, with the things that it happened against synagogues.</span> <span id="s1624">We know the things that it happened there in schools.</span> <span id="s1625">You see, this is all the outgrowth for people who harbor themselves under the First Amendment right to speak, with right to hate, okay we -- we a -- I know the ADL was very helpful in these cases, to pass laws against hate -- law.</span> <span id="s1626">But it’s -- it’s a different situation between hated laws, and that causes them to be violent, or to come and trap them, openly.</span> <span id="s1627">Neo-Nazis do not come others -- under any other auspices, but threatening the life of the Jews wherever they are.</span> <span id="s1628">And we must learn how to separate, so yes, I am pro-Second -- th-the Amendment, the way it was written, Freedom of Speech, but as I said it, and I cannot reveal it again, how many times I say, that threatening of life, must be put -- it will take an extra amendment to it, just like the hate law was passed, it must pass this part of the hate law, whatever it is, that people’s lives cannot be threatened by any group, by any ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Tell me about how that whole event in Skokie, a-and the legal proceedings which took s -- took -- took about a year, I think to -- to unfold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: How did that affect your perception of yourself as an American citizen, and -- and the American -- did you -- did you feel connected with -- with the country at large, in -- in a sense of -- or did you feel a little more isolated afterwards?</span> <span id="s1632">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: No, to the contrary, I felt very much American at the time.</span> <span id="s1634">I know in the Civil War, we just didn’t throw slogans, and won.</span> <span id="s1635">It took blood almost, and fighting.</span> <span id="s1636">Thanks God that we did not have to shed any blood in order to do things like that.</span> <span id="s1637">So no, never will I be isolated from the American freedom of law.</span> <span id="s1638">However, in all my life that God gives me to live, I will fight for freedom with justice.</span> <span id="s1639">I cannot afford to let my mind or soul separated one from the other.</span> <span id="s1640">There is no freedom if there is no justice.</span> <span id="s1641">So be that justice means that it was not for -- not letting Jews, or Blacks move into a certain neighborhood, or be sitting in the back of a bus.</span> <span id="s1642">Be to the same thing is, when I am denied certain laws, whatever it has to be, that is not justice in these laws.</span> <span id="s1643">So I hope that we remember the importance.</span> <span id="s1644">Freedom must be with justice.</span> <span id="s1645">Freedom without justice is not total freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Okay, I wanted to ask you about something else, but I’m going to flip the tape first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: -- and -- and -- and important for many survivors, as well as just for -- for history of -- of reckoning with the Holocaust, and that was the Eichmann trial.</span> <span id="s1649">And I wondered if you can recall whether you -- you watched that carefully, whether you talked about that with other people, and whether you felt that that was -- that that was an important event.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Okay, I -- first of all, let me touch, before I go to this here, I must put it in, I want to thank the people, Mr. -- Mr. Garber, what his name was, the producer of Skokie.</span> <span id="s1651">Burger, Mr. Burger was his name of the producer, for producing that movie.</span> <span id="s1652">I believe, as time goes on, it will remain a vocal part of the history of Skokie.</span> <span id="s1653">The mayor of Skokie, we took at that time to Israel on a trip, he’s no longer around -- the former mayor that it was at the time.</span> <span id="s1654">But it was a historical event, and I’m gla -- happy and glad, that someone took the time and efforts, even the financial cost, to bring it into light.</span> <span id="s1655">At the same time, I want at this time, to thank all the other people, i-including those who pro -- made the movie of “Schindler’s List,” including -- I forgot his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: Spielberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1658">Including Mr. Spielberg, who gave so much efforts, and money of his cost, to bring these programs, even -- even part what he is paying for in the Holocaust museums, to bring the story of the survivors of the Holocaust, for posterity, so some students of tomorrow can learn what it was done wrong in our time, and in our era, so it shall not repeat itself again.</span> <span id="s1659">When the Eichmann story, which you asked me, took place, I was very carefully watching it on the TV.</span> <span id="s1660">And it proved that the bitter end, that instead of him asking forgiveness for the injustice that he carried out, much more than the law of Nuremberg asked him to do, he stand fast to protect the Nazi era, and he’ll, to the last day, and to the last moment of that trial, stood with his opinion that it was right to do what he does.</span> <span id="s1661">Which it proves it to you, the freedom, and the democracy, given to a murderer like this here, was given by the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s1662">And, at the same time, of other people, we know the case what it happened, it proved the case in point, after the case of Eichmann, then the case of Demjanjuk was brought to Israel.</span> <span id="s1663">And Israel believed in the fairness of the law in judicial way.</span> <span id="s1664">Even though he was proving that in Trawniki, he was serving, in spite that he was not even th-the -- even grossly -- even th-the hater, but he was there in the schools.</span> <span id="s1665">So seeing as they did not have the total accuracy missing to the justice of the Israeli court, to condemn him, or to sue him for whatever it is, they much rather for letting him go free instead of condemning perhaps, in the mind of the -- of the judges to condemn a s -- a person who was not guilty in the case.</span> <span id="s1666">Now, here is a big importance for Israel law to be predominant, and all the world to take, that they believe in the old saying -- in the Communist era, as well as the Fascist era through the Nazis, they’d rather kill a hundred people to find one guilty, while this way, when laws arvee justice, you’d rather let a hundred people free, instead of condemning one people -- one person who is not fully guilty.</span> <span id="s1667">That it couldn’t prove the guilt on him.</span> <span id="s1668">I am proud to hear these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: Did you think -- were you aware of how the American public was responding to that, and that how that -- that things might have changed as far as amir -- American awareness of what had happened during the Holocaust after the Eichmann trial was televised in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Well, American people have haters, like all other countries of the world.</span> <span id="s1671">We know Buchanan for instance, who are the defender of Demjanjuk, and we know the ta -- at the tail end of it, that demjan -- that Buchanan told his way of the war, and everything, that he claims America did wrong, by coming to help diminish the Nazi era.</span> <span id="s1672">So this question is a self centered to understand the -- for every American just to say, look in the mirror and see yourself.</span> <span id="s1673">When we could have a man who was in the era, working with President Reagan, to come out with a book the way he was written, so it’s a very sordid on the American people, because thanks God that we don’t have many Buchanans around, so we can still call ourselves a country of loving freedom, but not with this type of freedom that Mr. Buchanan would like to see going on in this country.</span> <span id="s1674">As a whole, I believe the American people I never could condemn.</span> <span id="s1675">I can only say not many American people are involved in the political systems, and they -- if they don’t take a part in it, it’s basically because they -- they cannot be participant without knowing cases.</span> <span id="s1676">And they don’t take the time to learn it, they feel so free that we don’t have to.</span> <span id="s1677">But to preserve our freedom, we must be participants in all these here political eras.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: You -- have you experienced any anti-Semitism directly since you’ve been in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: I had a few cases where I had to send my cases to the Anti-Defamation League.</span> <span id="s1680">In most cases, when I ever wrote an article dealing with the Holocaust, or for instance when the pope was visiting the USA at that time, and I reminisced in my article to the paper that he was a young pope -- not pope, but he was a young preacher, at that time in Poland, and living in that era, he should know what the Hitlerites did to us, and I was speaking out against Pope Pius, not against him.</span> <span id="s1681">I, as a matter of fact, went through in Israel with Yad Vashem, to make a study of that era, and the whole world knows the secret that the Vatican helped all these here criminals filter through Spain, and other places like this here.</span> <span id="s1682">But it’s the funny thing, when you bring it out in the open, some people don’t like to hear it, because to them, the word of a holy man, or the pope, is becoming a s -- a sacred item, and -- and whatever they say is right.</span> <span id="s1683">That’s how all these problems in the world, through many years, without questions asked, had happened.</span> <span id="s1684">Because the public just wanted to believe one story, and not hear the other side of that story.</span> <span id="s1685">And I’m afraid for that type of thinking.</span> <span id="s1686">So when I had to speak out, and it’s not pleasing to others, I’m sorry to say that, let him tell them -- let him prove that I’m wrong, and it’s another story.</span> <span id="s1687">But at any time my articles appeared in letters to the editor, so on, hate mail came to my doors, with threatening, and the same way.</span> <span id="s1688">And the ADL explained it to me, that because these people are watching those letter writers to the editor, and at any time, they put on all this here kind of paraphernalia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Do you feel safe in this country, or do you feel that the -- this -- that there is the potential for the kind of violent anti-Semitism that happened in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: I feel safe, for the time being.</span> <span id="s1691">But as I said, when you become, in a c -- situation like that, that you’re so satisfied and pleased, that you don’t look on the other side, it’s very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1692">So to say, or to foretell what might happen, first of all, I’m not a prophet, second of all, I’m a believer.</span> <span id="s1693">I hope the younger people of today make it their business to become participants, be of the political system which -- what is going on, and become vocal.</span> <span id="s1694">Don’t keep this story to yourself, it’s not a story to be hidden, it’s a story to be discussed in public.</span> <span id="s1695">I’m very happy in my days, that I discussed certain things on college levels, and high schools, that I spoke to them, and I’m always open for the invitation when invited.</span> <span id="s1696">As a matter of fact, I invited myself a few times to go in colleges where they teach now the Holocaust story, which it became a part of the curriculum to teach, which I hoped that would have happened so many years ago, Hitler would have never been able to come.</span> <span id="s1697">We see what it happens in Austria, with Haider right now.</span> <span id="s1698">Look how it shook up the whole world, you know what I mean, just about letting this party come.</span> <span id="s1699">So I’m very -- I feel very good that people get awakened these days, by any outbursts of this nature.</span> <span id="s1700">But to say that I feel safe, yes, but am I secured for the future what it be?</span> <span id="s1701">I cannot foretell the future, I wish I could, and I would be able to answer that in another way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: It sounds as if you s -- you’ve always been very willing to talk about your experiences --</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: And vigilant, and vigilant --</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: And vigilant, and that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: That was my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: -- that’s probably unusual, because some people, in the earlier years, didn’t feel capable of talking about that.</span> <span id="s1707">Later on, you know, gotten a distance from it.</span> <span id="s1708">When did you start speaking publicly about it?</span> <span id="s1709">Do you have a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: From the first day of my life that I survived.</span> <span id="s1711">I couldn’t speak about it in the ire -- under the Iron Curtain, needless for me to say, it would have been a foolish statement, even to make.</span> <span id="s1712">So I will not tell you that I did, but as soon I got away from that curtain, my mind was open, and I spoke about it, and when I came to the USA, like I said, in 1948, I became a participant right away to organizations, until I did not get my citizenship, I didn’t want to make public some of the things, because let’s just remember like the question you asked me before, the era of McCarthyism, and just think back, ’48.</span> <span id="s1713">In 1948, if you were in Soviet Union, you were right away a question mark, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1714">So to tell you honestly, yes I was watching myself not to get caught in a bad web, because to defend oneself is not an easy situation.</span> <span id="s1715">So, after I became a citizen, I became vocal immediately, and with every era, whatever time it happened, that I was speaking of.</span> <span id="s1716">And it didn’t hurt me a bit that I had to disagree with B’nai Brith, you know, because writing I did.</span> <span id="s1717">I wrote to Mr. Foxman a few -- on a few occasions, and I became known, looks like, to some papers, that as soon they see my name under the article, they don’t print it at times.</span> <span id="s1718">And I played a trick on the -- on a few of them, that I used another name, with my address, and to prove my point, they printed it.</span> <span id="s1719">Which it means, it’s not so much that they care for the story, but they care who writes it.</span> <span id="s1720">And I wish it would be good they would care for the other writers, who write the opposite, to be watching themselves, but unfortunately, there, they’re afraid maybe they can go ahead to touch on the Free Speech amendment, where refusing me there is always ways, and how do they say?</span> <span id="s1721">We cannot let you write unless six months elapsed since the lax letters today.</span> <span id="s1722">Of course, I’m not a hired hand, I’m just a letters to the editor writer, you know?</span> <span id="s1723">So, of all kinds of ways, that’s one of the items.</span> <span id="s1724">I was told by the press, for instance, from the -- from West Palm Beach, says, “You eve -- don’t even live here.”</span> <span id="s1725">And that was the publisher had that.</span> <span id="s1726">I says, “Must one live over there to write an letter to the editor?”</span> <span id="s1727">So, experiencing this through the years, I had the opportunity where I pass by, at one time writing to -- in Texas to a paper, responding on something.</span> <span id="s1728">And I was -- was writing with a -- with a clergyman of high esteem, that the church didn’t like too well, but we found a certain view, something in common, which it was the billing between Hanukah and Christmas, and we corresponded quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1729">So to me, teaching about hopeful ways, about unifying people, about freedom loving people to be together, will always be a subject to talk about, it does not have to be Nazis, it does not have to be neo-Nazis, or any of the -- like that.</span> <span id="s1730">I love to converse with people, but above all, I will never sacrifice the freedom of democracy for anything else.</span> <span id="s1731">That’s one thing I cannot live by, or have any reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: You’ve really become American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: I wanted to ask you, you have mentioned that your -- your store was burned down in 1968.</span> <span id="s1735">Will you tell me about the -- about tha -- those events, the riots, and how you -- what happened, and how you perceived the issues?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: I can conceive in a good, open mind, that what had happened to me with the riots, I did not pluralize ever to say Black people, this, that and the other.</span> <span id="s1737">Because in every situation that it happens, it’s going to be two sides to the story.</span> <span id="s1738">My side of that story’s a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1739">My store did not have just all Black, but I would say there were two butchers, which they were white, and the other butchers, two of them were Black.</span> <span id="s1740">The rest of the store, all my employees were Black, from management capacity, which at that particular time -- so, in other words, [indecipherable] to the era why the riots broke out in Chicago, because of the killing of Martin Luther King.</span> <span id="s1741">My store should not be actually suffering anything like that.</span> <span id="s1742">But this is again, as I told you, freedom without justice does not work, therefore, because innocent people get hurt.</span> <span id="s1743">I consider myself that I was not the party that had to get hurt, but maybe to say I was in the wrong neighborhood, and therefore I got hurt because of that.</span> <span id="s1744">So, many times when I interviewed for jobs, I didn’t hesitate telling my background, what I did, and the first question would come, under the circumstances that you’ve been through, you obviously are prejudiced against Black.</span> <span id="s1745">I says, “No, I am not prejudiced against Black, I’m prejudiced against wrongdoing.”</span> <span id="s1746">I believe in people demonstrate for a cause.</span> <span id="s1747">Making riots and looting, is wrong.</span> <span id="s1748">Regardless that I wasn’t the only one hurt, but that is not the way to spread an issue.</span> <span id="s1749">So be that it happened to me in 1968, with that other issues happened to other people in other times, two wrongs never made one right, and that’s exactly what it is.</span> <span id="s1750">While they are trying to wrong the wrongs, and trying to make them right, it’s no use to follow in the fli -- same footsteps, to make another wrong.</span> <span id="s1751">So, to say that I’m prejudiced, no, I do not see a Black person other than I see myself in that regard.</span> <span id="s1752">I respect him, and I would always hope that I’ll be respected by them.</span> <span id="s1753">I didn’t run into any circumstances other than that, or because of that, but when you go -- I went another time, and reopened another store, and when things began to change to the bad, when my store began to be broken into, and all of these here things, I saw a repetition of that, yes, I went out.</span> <span id="s1754">I made a going out of business sale, and I went away from that neighborhood all together.</span> <span id="s1755">Because I cannot be watching times from changing.</span> <span id="s1756">Times will change whether I watch it or not.</span> <span id="s1757">So I figured, it’s the wrong place for me to be, and I went out of there, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1758">I became a -- an outdoor salesman, I couldn’t re-establish myself back in the retail business, because my fortune didn’t go along with me, in other words, at the same time, I lost too much, insurance companies of that era went broke because of that, so I was just an innocent victim.</span> <span id="s1759">Yes, I feel bad that it happened.</span> <span id="s1760">Yes, I can ask questions, why did it happen to me?</span> <span id="s1761">Maybe to say I didn’t deserve to happen to me.</span> <span id="s1762">It affects [indecipherable], it happened.</span> <span id="s1763">Now, I have two ways of looking at it.</span> <span id="s1764">Do I look with more hatred?</span> <span id="s1765">Seems I’m trying to define that I’m against hatred, so it would be the ca -- same thing that I justify all the bad things that ever happened to me, that they are right.</span> <span id="s1766">So that does not let me, and that’s why those interviews for jobs, when they ask me that question, realize that I can pass the test, that I am not a hate type of person.</span> <span id="s1767">I was sitting next to Jesse Jackson, next to me at the time when we worked together about stopping the Nazis from marching.</span> <span id="s1768">We were joining forces at that time, and I believe they, in many a -- things, what the Black people want to see, any other minority wants to see the same way.</span> <span id="s1769">And I hope it’s clarified.</span> <span id="s1770">I heard just recently in New York, and the things, what it was pulled out, with the four policemen, please do not make riots, do not make break-ins, and I say Mr. Sharpton was right, and I was happy to hear him say these words, because ideals cannot mix with violence.</span> <span id="s1771">When you produce violence with ideals, the ideals get lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: We should say, just for the record, that you’re talking about the Amadou Diallo case [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: Yeah, so this is the idea about it.</span> <span id="s1774">I’m a true believer in these things, even if I pay dearly for it, but everybody knows that with -- just to speak, and one way, it happens to someone else, and you speak -- in other words, when it happens to you, it’s not wrong, it’s not wrong.</span> <span id="s1775">It’s not right to be like that, you can’t -- it’s a good saying that it goes around.</span> <span id="s1776">When one’s husband -- when your neighbor’s husband is laid off from work, it’s a recession, but when the husband from this house is laid off, then it’s a depression.</span> <span id="s1777">And that’s the same thing, I mean, two wrongs, no matter how many times we tried it, will never prove to be right.</span> <span id="s1778">So, no, I did not remain prejudiced due to the circumstances, it happened to me.</span> <span id="s1779">And again, even though I’m hateful to the Nazis, I’m not hateful to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1780">As a matter of fact, last time I was in Israel was in June of 1998, and I was in the company near us, 40 percent of the gatherings at [indecipherable] were Germans, well, they were young German people, with the children of the same -- they were the ages of my own children.</span> <span id="s1781">I spoke to them, I didn’t feel threatened, I didn’t feel any animosity towards them.</span> <span id="s1782">Yes, their parents, their grandparents were involved in all of that, as Mr. Goldhagen said, but this is my statement.</span> <span id="s1783">I can speak German to a young person, and be happy to speak, and that I know how to address them and speak.</span> <span id="s1784">But I cannot speak to a person who’s older than me, or my age, because that -- that language that [indecipherable] all of this here, yelling, and [indecipherable] was only the way to confuse the Jews, and -- and make them -- first strip them from rights, then strip them from anythings that they could, be that it’s food, and they really -- killed out the intelligentsia first, so we were people that it was not enough left of the intelligentsia, nor enough left of -- in us, to be able to resist, and that’s why we didn’t resist in as many --- more than it should have been.</span> <span id="s1785">Besides, the population was not that open to help us, but they would help the others, you know?</span> <span id="s1786">When their kids were taken to Germany, and they didn’t like it, they helped the partisans, because they ca -- had where to escape.</span> <span id="s1787">But Jews, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1788">Let’s remember, the Germans put a price, to catch a Jew was worth a pig, and to catch a partisan was worth a horse, if he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1789">So they always had a price.</span> <span id="s1790">That’s how we -- the -- the way of killing was so glamorized that it wasn’t just the killing.</span> <span id="s1791">How much they can first give him all kinds of punishment, until he wished to be dead, that was the enjoyment to kill them.</span> <span id="s1792">But they -- but in the partisans, when I caught some Germans, to the police -- from the policeman [indecipherable] from that time, they were begging for mercy.</span> <span id="s1793">Please don’t kill me.</span> <span id="s1794">And it was a case, which in my manuscript I described.</span> <span id="s1795">When we caught once that he was from the sondenfuehrer, and a girl that [indecipherable], he pulled out from his pocket pictures.</span> <span id="s1796">He did not know whether we are Jews, or other things, and he thought he would show us pictures of Jewish girls that he has in his pocket, we do not know how these pictures came to be, and why he took them from the Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s1797">Because that was their pleasure place, which they would take good looking girls, take them in there, and use them, you follow me, sexual.</span> <span id="s1798">So, this girl, seeing these pictures what he pulled out, she says, “Harold, step it aside, this is all mine.”</span> <span id="s1799">And she didn’t [indecipherable] on him, she smashed his head til he was dead.</span> <span id="s1800">So I mean, it’s a lot of things to understand about an era, be that it’s resistance, be trying to w-w-way to resist, which people fail to understand what it was, the era at that time, what an era it was to survive.</span> <span id="s1801">But one thing I must comment over here, no matter how bad it was, the rate of suicides, as history will record, was very little.</span> <span id="s1802">In other words, people just wanted to live, to outlive the enemy, no matter how miserable they lived, while living, it still -- it was very easy, you disobey, and you shot, and you’re dead.</span> <span id="s1803">Didn’t have to do any threatening things.</span> <span id="s1804">If you would die -- but people no, they wanted -- that’s what it wa -- that was their expression of resistance, which I like to comment over here about the resistance.</span> <span id="s1805">In 1983, in the gathering in Israel was, we got up about 5,000 partisans.</span> <span id="s1806">The Soviet Union let out their partisans to come to Jerusalem to show in the strong -- we almost mustered almost 5,000 people.</span> <span id="s1807">which the medal that I showed you, that I got from the state of Israel, is hanging over there.</span> <span id="s1808">Anyways, at that particular time, that we got that together, one of the spokesman was a lady, a professor, her name was Kattan.</span> <span id="s1809">The name Kattan in Hebrew means short, small, and she was short, she was a small lady, but her words were big.</span> <span id="s1810">And she once told us, and she knows she’s speaking at a gathering of freedom fighters if you want to say, or resisters.</span> <span id="s1811">She asked the question to us, how would you describe yourself, what you did in the forest as resistance?</span> <span id="s1812">One picked up his hand and he says, “I killed so many Germans.”</span> <span id="s1813">Another picked up his hand, and he talked about other things, what he did against the Germans.</span> <span id="s1814">He [indecipherable] down so many trains.</span> <span id="s1815">The other one was doing -- and doing other diversionary work.</span> <span id="s1816">She says, “Do you consider all of that, what?</span> <span id="s1817">Fighting the enemy, or you consider that resistance?”</span> <span id="s1818">And everybody came out, it’s one and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1819">She says, “No, resistance means if you resisted the enemy for one more day to live while he wants to annihilate you.</span> <span id="s1820">For one more hour, for one more longer, that is resistance.”</span> <span id="s1821">The wire fences round all the camps electrified.</span> <span id="s1822">You could throw yourself against the fence any time, but few people threw themselves against the fences.</span> <span id="s1823">That in itself was resistance.</span> <span id="s1824">Be that you had a machine gun, that you went openly in warfare -- ways, to fight and resist the enemy, or that you withstand in that concentration camp, or that labor camp, or in the ghetto, that you survived an extra day to -- to give the enemy a loss that he didn’t win yet, that is resistance.</span> <span id="s1825">I think I want to inject [indecipherable] in this conversation at the same time, we must learn, and very much be vigilant when we resist certain thing in our democratic way, and above all, I’ll say it one more time, we must always fight for freedom, and laws with justice.</span> <span id="s1826">If you don’t have justice in it, we just don’t have our fulfillment of freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: Okay, I just have a few more questions, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: -- say whatever -- whatever you want.</span> <span id="s1830">Whose -- one question is, we -- did you ever return to Australenka, or to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: I believe, if you remember, I told you the story, when I came to Bialystok, and I met a friend of mine, and he told me that one returned there, and got killed right away.</span> <span id="s1832">I cannot return back to Poland, and see that -- the ground there.</span> <span id="s1833">I must invoke here the story of the 14th century [indecipherable] As we all know, the Inquisition [indecipherable] history of what it was.</span> <span id="s1834">You -- if you wanted to become Christian, you had life, if you didn’t want, they expelled you.</span> <span id="s1835">On the ships of expulsion, at that particular time, the rabbis of the era who were there, with all that creation, they created this [indecipherable] which a lot of Judaism was created.</span> <span id="s1836">They put out sort of a restriction order, that forever after, no Jew shall dwell in Spain.</span> <span id="s1837">To me, that evendoor Franco, who let the Jews escape in the -- the Nazis come to Spain, while Hitler bitterly protested it, but Hitler could not afford to go and fight Franco, you know, for what he did.</span> <span id="s1838">A story, I must tell you that story in my manuscript, I would like to show this, now that you mention, but what I wanted to bring out is, we did not have enough intellectual people, even including Elie Wiesel, who wrote a lot of work, and more like Elie Wiesel, that they did not insert that we cannot return back to these places of se -- of cemeteries.</span> <span id="s1839">In Judaic law we provide a saying, that you cannot dwell on a cemetery, just like we are told with Egyptian people in Cairo live on the cemeteries, because of shortage of room.</span> <span id="s1840">The cemeteries are created for dead people, and not for leef -- live people to live there.</span> <span id="s1841">To us, the biggest cemeteries of the world were left in these European countries, and the biggest one in Poland.</span> <span id="s1842">Therefore, Judaic people are forbidden to dwell there.</span> <span id="s1843">But we did not have enough of the clergy to dwell on that issue, and to make it public.</span> <span id="s1844">To people who come back, and everyone who comes back, who didn’t live in that era, but lives in today’s era, and they come back, and when you talk to them, they have only one thing to say, the anti-Semitism in Poland is very visible, and it’s very open.</span> <span id="s1845">Even though Israel is dealing with the Polish people.</span> <span id="s1846">Even though Israel is letting in Polish people to come to Israel, and everything else.</span> <span id="s1847">Look, anti-Semitism is a disease, and no more like certain diseases are incurable, for the time being, we haven’t found a cure for that anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1848">Should I say that the religion fed into these people is part, if not fully the declaration of anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s1849">Perhaps, maybe it’s one of it.</span> <span id="s1850">But anti-Semitism, we must take it as a disease, and cure as a disease, because we cannot say, “Oh, you shouldn’t say that,” this and that.</span> <span id="s1851">We see -- I say we -- we see these thing -- people in the open, we see what these people are doing, and the anti-Semitism is still alive.</span> <span id="s1852">So, I said I’ll tell you a little story about Spain, what had happened in that era, in the [indecipherable], I mentioned that story in my manuscript.</span> <span id="s1853">At that particular time, Hitler was tremendously trying to influence the Spanish people, first of all that they should join his armies, then help him defeat the enemy, and above all help him defeat the Jews.</span> <span id="s1854">So he used to send them [indecipherable] there, to make speeches, and he tells the story about at one farm area country over there, one of these emissaries came, and gathered them together, and trying to say to them, you know we’re losing the war, only because of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1855">If it wouldn’t be for the Jews, we would not ho -- have suffered all these losses.</span> <span id="s1856">And all what it went bad with Germany, he [indecipherable] tried to blame it on the Jews.</span> <span id="s1857">And therefore, he says, we must root them out, we must kill them wherever we find them.</span> <span id="s1858">When he got through with his speech, all these farmers, everybody had -- they had tools what they used for farming, grabbed them in their hands, and they went chasing to found Jews.</span> <span id="s1859">So illusion -- End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: This is tape number five, side A, of an interview with Harold Zissman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: Even though from the 14th century on, and that we are talking about the year of the 20th century, so for 600 years, no Jews were in the areas there.</span> <span id="s1862">To their dismay, they were running, and running, and they couldn’t find a Jew, so they should kill him to please the speakers, demand, and desire, and what he told them to do.</span> <span id="s1863">Even though it’s only a story, but again, I support what I said to the outset, that anti-Semitism is a disease.</span> <span id="s1864">It’s not a because, because they did this, or because they did that.</span> <span id="s1865">Because we found them in places where Jews did not even live there at all.</span> <span id="s1866">So you’d say why -- wh-wh-why do you got -- want to blame them?</span> <span id="s1867">It’s an inherent disease, like any other diseases we haven’t cured in the world yet, which you have to do, and this disease, apparently, until now, had not been cured.</span> <span id="s1868">And we must hope and strive to cure this disease, until such time will not come -- we’ll still have to be vigilant, and we will suffer with that same disease.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1870">What are the names of your children, and I -- I was just thinking, maybe you could tell us something about -- about your kids, and your grandkids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1872">My oldest daughter’s name is Rosalie, and in Italy, they was a very famous name at the time, and we named her Rosalie.</span> <span id="s1873">So Rosa, Rosa, you find a lot of this here.</span> <span id="s1874">We are very proud, and she has her name at times, since she’s in a school, in a Hebrew school that she calls it Shoshanna.</span> <span id="s1875">As a matter of fact, she just became a grandmother, and she’s be -- going to be called for her grandchild, Safta, which is the Hebrew word for granny.</span> <span id="s1876">And that’s what she chose to be.</span> <span id="s1877">So she’s very much involved in the educational field.</span> <span id="s1878">As I aforementioned to you before in our conversation, I -- which I didn’t do with you on tape, that she was, after she got married, her husband was still going to law school, and he graduated George Washington University, while she took up over there, her Masters, at George Washington University.</span> <span id="s1879">She had taken up another Masters since, and she’s right now studying for her Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1880">She -- she was teaching at the time in -- in a school over there, which it was dignitaries children, some from ambassadors, and so on.</span> <span id="s1881">And when I came to visit with her, there wasn’t enough words th-they -- that I her -- could be heard by the man who was the supervisor, to tell me about my daughter, which I’m very proud of.</span> <span id="s1882">She brought me three children, the oldest one’s name is Jennifer, the next one, who just got married -- and Jennifer is married, and that’s was their first child, Emily.</span> <span id="s1883">The next one was Marissa, which she just got married, and her husband’s name is Ben, and Jennifer’s husband I fe -- don’t want to forget to say, his name is Jeff.</span> <span id="s1884">So therefore, my son-in-law, we call Jeffrey, or we call him Jeff.</span> <span id="s1885">And my son-in-law, as I mentioned, is a graduate at-attorney, and he’s very well a part of the law.</span> <span id="s1886">He’s involved in a variation of businesses, and thanks God he’s doing good for -- for his family.</span> <span id="s1887">My wife, being in love with education, still is t -- like I say, with the education on the school, and I’m happy that all the parents from the children, like it used to be before, and the children, when we come visiting with her, we’ll go to a restaurant, oh daddy, mommy.</span> <span id="s1888">This is my children from this and this grade, and the mommy’s -- so she not -- not only knows the kids well, in a good way, but even the parents of the kids.</span> <span id="s1889">So I’m proud of it.</span> <span id="s1890">Now, the youngest son of theirs is -- is Jordan, and he is right now in Texas, in college, at a -- Dallas, which I’m very happy and proud of him, too, and he looks like he’s going for business in there.</span> <span id="s1891">And my son has two sons, just like he was a gymnast throughout school, from Skokie, from Niles East, his kids did not follow exactly his way, but they played, and we used to come to meet some summertime, to come to Chicago, see them play baseball, and they -- they involved in sports, probably the youngest one likes basketball, what’ll hap -- be outcome.</span> <span id="s1892">The older one, Scott is his name, the younger one is the name Mark.</span> <span id="s1893">My son’s wife name, Susie, and she is also going now for her Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1894">She’s also principal in a school.</span> <span id="s1895">So round and ra -- and around, I’m glad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: And I’m very happy that education worked, and it was my persuasion to the kids since they were little, to help them.</span> <span id="s1898">I’m proud of myself that I could help even my grandchildren, not only my kids, with -- scholastically, with their schools, since my memory, thanks God, was good, and I was always a good student in school.</span> <span id="s1899">So that was the case, that I not only prevailed with me, of telling them, but I’m happy to see the fruition of them, that they’re all doing good, and they’re educated very well, thanks God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: I have the impression, correct me if I’m wrong, that -- that it’s been very important to you to carry on the Jewish tradition --</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: -- and I -- I wonder if -- if you -- if they are all -- they have had Bar Mitzvahs, Bat Mitzvahs [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: You asked a very good question.</span> <span id="s1904">I must say that my son married girl who converted to Judaism, she was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1905">And someone would listen to her on the pulpit, where my grandchildren had Bar Mitzvah, they would not think that she is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1906">In the neighborhood, she is from Skokie, you know what I mean, which it was a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1907">And so it worked good.</span> <span id="s1908">Both of my -- both of their kids are recognizing their Jewishness.</span> <span id="s1909">Both of them had Bar Mitzvahs.</span> <span id="s1910">Then, of course, the oldest one is -- his name is Scott, is now in the university in Ohio -- in -- no, excuse me, in -- let’s see, is it Iowa State College, taking up structural engineering, and we s -- cami -- we -- once in a -- we talk to each other, like I say.</span> <span id="s1911">I come once a year at least to Chicago, so we can visit with each other.</span> <span id="s1912">At times they come here.</span> <span id="s1913">So depends which way, because to me, I -- I cannot put myself in a position to be away from my grandchildren, no more than for my children.</span> <span id="s1914">So, all in all, the three grandchildren of my daughter, I had more closer contact, since they were -- the oldest one was born in Chicago, but the other two were born right here.</span> <span id="s1915">So, they all know about it.</span> <span id="s1916">My daughter, and my son-in-law, have a good write up in the zig -- museum, over here in Miami Beach.</span> <span id="s1917">They also involved with Jewish causes, they are good donors, like I am.</span> <span id="s1918">I gave them the example, as you saw in the room, which I have the accolades for it.</span> <span id="s1919">We believe in Jewish hope, we believe in Jewish future, and yes, being a survivor from the Holocaust, I did not go to blame God for that, as I said it to you before, I blame man, because man could have helped us, and they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1920">So it’s no use to me to look for God.</span> <span id="s1921">In -- in some people’s belief, God put us on earth, and he gave us the wisdom to decide what to do.</span> <span id="s1922">So when we do wrong, we can only blame ourselves, and not the maker.</span> <span id="s1923">It’s the same thing like you ri -- raise a child, and you tell him the good things, and then all of a sudden, the child goes to do a bad thing.</span> <span id="s1924">So, sure, somebody would say -- the outsider would say, “It’s your fault, you didn’t raise him well.”</span> <span id="s1925">But you know in your heart that you raised him well, it’s just that it happened to be that way, and you -- and you probably as a parent, accepted that way.</span> <span id="s1926">But you don’t go to blame the parent that they didn’t raise him well.</span> <span id="s1927">And that is my total belief in that way.</span> <span id="s1928">But yes, I’m very proud to see -- we, in two different Judaism belonging.</span> <span id="s1929">Both of my kids go to Reform, they find themselves more comfortable there.</span> <span id="s1930">I’m a Conservative Jew, and I find myself comfortable where I belong, you know?</span> <span id="s1931">But I never try to interfere with them, I attended services in their synagogues, and whatever it is on my side, what persuasion I believe should be a personal thing, and what you feel yourself comfortable in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: I think I’m -- I’m -- I think that’s the end of my questions for today.</span> <span id="s1933">Do you have anything that -- that you can think of that I haven’t touched -- asked you, that you’d like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: Well, a-as I said to you to begin with, if I was to prepare with question and answers from you to begin with, I could make it in an orderly way, and I would remor less, but since it was part from the others, and part of the new one, you know what I mean, and I didn’t put it in the order the way it happened, it sometimes could be omitted.</span> <span id="s1935">So, I believe I, at the moment cannot think of anything left out, because I believe I s -- not to praise my own self, but participating in so many things, and it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1936">I was a member also the Holocaust Museum, while I was a member also to the Simon Wiesenthal.</span> <span id="s1937">As far as my writing, and asking like this here, I was always, like I say -- I’ll never forget when the movie was made, from Simon Wiesenthal at that time, and in that movie, it showed a case, where typically, what the -- the inmate of a concentration camp becames pregnant -- do you know that movie, what it was, or you don’t -- or you didn’t see it, it was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1938">And she was pregnant by that commanding officer.</span> <span id="s1939">And later that husband -- oh, the -- in -- in camp, which it was the boyfriend of hers, when later, after so many years absence, because he escaped to the partisans, he didn’t know about her, and later when he discovers her -- so when he discovers where she is, he makes so many attempts, and somehow or other, she does not want to s -- recognize herself.</span> <span id="s1940">And the story ends that he makes a trip over there, he builds with his -- sim -- with Simon Wiesenthal [indecipherable] to make the movie.</span> <span id="s1941">And then he comes there, she greets him, and then he takes a look at the child, and he sees the child s-so much close -- in close look at him, he looks like the commander of that camp from which he escapes.</span> <span id="s1942">And she finally admits to him what had happened with the rest.</span> <span id="s1943">And now she tries to tell him why she h -- was in hiding of that whole case, because how she -- she’s still in love with him, and that did not happen out of love that she has a baby with the other.</span> <span id="s1944">And it happened the case is, that she does not want to testify against that particular murderer, from that camp.</span> <span id="s1945">So she tests -- testifies why, she tells him the story why she cannot do that, because take a look at it, that’s his son.</span> <span id="s1946">She had -- what is to be told to that child?</span> <span id="s1947">And that child already was involved with so many good things, pro-Zionism, pro-Israel, and everything like that, while he grew up with.</span> <span id="s1948">So now -- so this case, and the [indecipherable] in other words, that they sort of -- that came the ending, without a conclusion.</span> <span id="s1949">I wrote to Simon Wiesenthal about it, I mean, in -- in the -- in the -- California, and they told me, if you want to, you can write to Simon Wiesenthal your protest, which they gave me the address to write to him in Vienna, and everything like that.</span> <span id="s1950">That was one of my things that I was against it of the ending of that movie.</span> <span id="s1951">In other words, you ended the movie with sort of, what do you think?</span> <span id="s1952">What do you think it was?</span> <span id="s1953">Was she justified not to go to answer, or wasn’t she not justified?</span> <span id="s1954">And it’ll always be a question about it.</span> <span id="s1955">I personally, as I say, she was justified to go even, she answered the question.</span> <span id="s1956">He’s a human being, he’s a child, so she got impregnated by -- in a forceful way, and that should not have stop her from showing to be contessing against him.</span> <span id="s1957">I opposed it tremendously why the mov -- I was happy the movie was shown, but the way it ended, I definitely -- so, which I’m only trying to say, just talking about the Holocaust is not the full satisfaction.</span> <span id="s1958">In my case, when something is wrong, if they do it in a visual way, or the other -- “Max and Helen,” was the name of that movie, and it was -- and it was the movie -- you probably -- could probably, maybe find about it, and that’s what the name, “Max and Helen.”</span> <span id="s1959">And you’d find it -- and basically what I told you in short, is what it deals.</span> <span id="s1960">Like I say, everybody has their opinion, but my opinion was when you put the name of Simon Wiesenthal on there, and he was -- I was -- I’m very happy with the man who discovered so many murderers, that they would have been dome in the cases like this here.</span> <span id="s1961">But no one is perfect, I suppose, in this world, and that was a goofball by Simon Wiesenthal, not that he planned it to work out that way.</span> <span id="s1962">And it was a thing, it was done, it was over.</span> <span id="s1963">I watched that movie twice that night.</span> <span id="s1964">I called California because it was three hours, so the guard, looks like, was the Israelite.</span> <span id="s1965">And I spoke to him in Hebrew, and he gave me even the address to write directly, and it -- I wrote, and I got a letter from them at the same time responding.</span> <span id="s1966">Well, it’s Simon Wiesenthal is responsible, he was the one producing that.</span> <span id="s1967">So, what you talk to us over here [indecipherable] or the others, we had nothing to do with the producing it.</span> <span id="s1968">I merely for the case, so that -- wanted to tell you about it, because for always, and forever, I will remain involved in the cause, or in the fight of justice, because this is, again, it was an unjust case.</span> <span id="s1969">It -- let’s surmise and to say, because she didn’t come to be the witness, maybe he didn’t get the proper punishment, or was punished at all.</span> <span id="s1970">Now, I don’t believe that a murderer should be brought -- so somebody who constru -- who made that movie should have made that part be a -- sure, all of this, but it should have ended in a different way.</span> <span id="s1971">It could have perhaps ended that her testimony was not in a person to person kind of way, but it was in a -- taking a deposition, and therefore he was -- [indecipherable] so much in prison, or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1972">At least it would have had a decent ending to what it is.</span> <span id="s1973">Do you follow me what I am saying?</span> <span id="s1974">But like this here, because it produced a child, and for her to expose it to this child, sooner or later, someday, he will know about it.</span> <span id="s1975">Be that she will tell him, or others will tell him.</span> <span id="s1976">Max had the -- meanwhile, had to leave that sort of -- he was in love with her, she was in love with him.</span> <span id="s1977">And that came in the disturbance, you understand?</span> <span id="s1978">So that’s why they named the movie “Max and Helen.”</span> <span id="s1979">And, like I say, it’s a hard taken movie, to see all the situation, what it took, until he must have told her that godsen came to see that, you know.</span> <span id="s1980">But to my case, what I’m bringing it out, is to prove once more that it’s not just one way or the other, I’m still -- you find the same person all the way around, with the same opinions.</span> <span id="s1981">So, I told you about my children, I told you about myself -- about my wife I’ll wait for you find out.</span> <span id="s1982">She’s been a good wife to me, and a good mother to my grand -- to my children, and grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1983">We just celebrated in January, our 55th wedding anniversary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: Congratulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1986">And I -- we are still in love with each other, which it’s a good sign.</span> <span id="s1987">When our children made our 50th anniversary, and -- a surprise when we were in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1988">I told them, you see, always, whenever you have arguments between husband and wife, take the model from us.</span> <span id="s1989">We also had arguments, but never walked the bedroom door away, close it or stuff like this here, because remember, it could be done, if you want to.</span> <span id="s1990">We have a good Zionistic saying from -- from Intiered sue, he said -- [indecipherable] said it, if you been heroed -- the first proclamation, if you will want to, it will come true.</span> <span id="s1991">And life is that way.</span> <span id="s1992">When two people are married, and they want to stay married, they’ll be married.</span> <span id="s1993">But if they are looking for a break someplace, e -- they’ll find it, you know?</span> <span id="s1994">And that’s the idea about it.</span> <span id="s1995">So I always am happy to say thanks God my daughter celebrated -- she got married in 1968 -- ’69 rather, in si -- ’68 was the riot, she graduated from school in ’69.</span> <span id="s1996">So they had already 30 years of marriage, which it’s a good, happy occasion.</span> <span id="s1997">So my husband -- my son and his wife are in good family standing in the same way, even though he travels, and so on.</span> <span id="s1998">Hardworking, both of them.</span> <span id="s1999">She works hard in her way, and he works very hard in his way, he’s a director in automotive, that he travels out of the country, and so on.</span> <span id="s2000">But he is also very devoted father, and husband, and I am proud to -- to speak about it, and to say it whenever I can.</span> <span id="s2001">If you have more questions, ask them.</span> <span id="s2002">I’ll try and answer them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: Thank you very much, I think that’s -- I think that’s it.</span> <span id="s2004">I appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Okay, Arwin, I must thank the museum for allowing me to express what I did.</span> <span id="s2006">I’m only sorry, as I said to you at the outset, why the volume of my 16 cassettes could not be added onto that, to make that a fuller volume, and it could be somebody sitting down, and see in person.</span> <span id="s2007">Because on the radio it comes out a different story, anybody could imitate, and tell it, but you gotta see the person, too.</span> <span id="s2008">But I suppose that’s all their budget allowed them to do, and I will re-invigorate myself to become again a member.</span> <span id="s2009">I already told you, which I don’t want to go on tape about what it is, not that it -- it’s any difference, but I believe the tape doesn’t need to hear negative stories, I’m not a negative teller.</span> <span id="s2010">So I’ll just say I’ll b -- I’ll be coming back a supporter of the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s2011">I already told you the story what I had to go through a few times, with people in the know, that it should not criticize the mus -- Holocaust museums in -- no matter where it’s built -- being built, it’s our utmost.</span> <span id="s2012">We saw what had happened in Germany, they want to build a museum in Berlin, and that’s where Holocaust museum belongs.</span> <span id="s2013">We must help and support the idea that the people of tomorrow, the German people of tomorrow, and any people of the world, who’ll ever come to visit Berlin, they should be able to see of the bad era of history that it happened, because when you hide yourself behind, you only make that become a repetition, but when you speak about it, you educate things about it, that’s a preservation of not to make the same mistake over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: Well, thank you Arwin, for taking your time to come to my house, and interviewing me, and I hope I gave you satisfaction I’m sure, your interview, if it mets an rating, will probably meet up a good rating on your behalf.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2017">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s2018">It’ll meet up a good rating on your behalf, rather.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">End of Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span
