Ava Mueller.</span> <span id="s18">And I remember that one of the German Gestapo people when I came to concentration camp asked me, you could not be Jewish because my name is Mueller, and I said maybe I'm not, but it didn't help me too much.</span> <span id="s19">It shows you -- and even Jewish language is so very similar to the German, so many names, so many words are the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q.</span> <span id="s21">What is your name now?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A. My name now is Ava Dorfman.</span> <span id="s23">That is my husband of 39 years, and I lost him in 1988, on July 3rd, suddenly, very suddenly.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q.</span> <span id="s25">You were born in _____________?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q.</span> <span id="s28">Did you stay there for very long?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A. I suppose we stayed until a certain age.</span> <span id="s30">I think I went to public school, already to Parochial at that time.</span> <span id="s31">There was a church with a parochial school near our house.</span> <span id="s32">I attended there.</span> <span id="s33">Then my mother --.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q. Excuse me.</span> <span id="s35">Was that unusual for a Jewish person to attend that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A.</span> <span id="s37">There were only two or three Jewish people in the area where I lived, so, we were really very removed from the Jewish section of ___________.</span> <span id="s38">Then, my mother had family in Vienna, so a portion of my life I spend there, and I lived on Liechtenstein Strauss in Vienna.</span> <span id="s39">Then, my father's family lived in _________, and my mother felt that I and my sister Ruzia who was 2 1/2 years older than I, that we should somehow be closer to the family, to know our grandparents.</span> <span id="s40">She did not have too much family in Poland or in Vienna of her close, and then we moved back to ________________, where my grandparents own a building, four story, and my grandfather had a restaurant, and they lived in the lower level, and then on the second floor, my mother, Ruzia and I, you see when I was six months old I lost my father, so I actually never knew him.</span> <span id="s41">There was just a study where there was a drawing, and that drawing was my father.</span> <span id="s42">There were pictures that my mother always showed.</span> <span id="s43">He was 27 years of age and developed a severe case of kidney problems.</span> <span id="s44">He just got his degree in civil engineering.</span> <span id="s45">My mother was only 25, and they looked forward but he didn't survive.</span> <span id="s46">So, between the draw and the cemetery that my grandmother took us always, that was what I know of father.</span> <span id="s47">I didn't envy anyone that they may have had more material things, but I envy everyone who was able to sit on the father's lap or get a kiss from a father.</span> <span id="s48">That somehow I missed always.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q.</span> <span id="s50">What do you remember about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A. My mother was very pretty, very educated.</span> <span id="s52">She spoke five languages.</span> <span id="s53">We were just -- when we grow up we were like sisters, but when she was sometimes saying, I'm only 28 years of age, I said "Well, you're so old."</span> <span id="s54">But we all do that, and she worked in the brewery, which was very big offices, as an interpreter and also as a executive secretary to a director named Rightman.</span> <span id="s55">He was Jewish, and then I understand from another friend, who is a gynecologist that the other director's son, Shal, was his name, is someplace in the United States, and then I was befriended, maybe she was my best friend was Shisko.</span> <span id="s56">They were Czechoslovakian decent, and she and I went together in school, and as I will tell you later on, she played a major role in my life.</span> <span id="s57">And my mother worked there, and so it was a necessary that we were with the grandparents together and then above us was another aunt.</span> <span id="s58">She had four children.</span> <span id="s59">Marguerita was so pretty.</span> <span id="s60">They all perished.</span> <span id="s61">Then there was another aunt who was childless, _______________ and then she was just like a mother.</span> <span id="s62">She was battling a cancer in her larynx and that was the time really that she wanted to see that we would be married so she could see the weddings.</span> <span id="s63">I think that's what prompted one time whatever I will tell you about.</span> <span id="s64">What I would like to say that it is so hard sometimes to comprehend when people speak of six million, and also the fact that one million and a half were innocent children, does not say that we all were not just innocent, justly paid just because we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s65">The fact that everyone of the six million was a person with loved ones, with friends, with dreams for the future, and then they had to face death by whatever means those murderers had for them.</span> <span id="s66">They had a great many of them.</span> <span id="s67">Then, since you spoke with me and I really tried to search my mind.</span> <span id="s68">I must have really, like excavating the back memories from my brain, and reach so many gruesome stories, that I tried very hard to suppress.</span> <span id="s69">I know that lots of Holocaust survivors share those gruesome stories with their children.</span> <span id="s70">I don't know what effect that had on them, but before I got married in the United States, I decided if I ever have a family, I would like to establish as a nearly normal life as it can be.</span> <span id="s71">I didn't want my children to be sorry for their mother.</span> <span id="s72">I didn't want them to have the feeling that they are different from the other children, so I really was very evasive about it.</span> <span id="s73">The only thing at night, I had very bad dreams, as my husband was telling me.</span> <span id="s74">I sometimes screamed or just said don't let them take me.</span> <span id="s75">So I shared lots of things with my husband, and not until the children were in high school and there were many documentaries shown on T.V. and the newspapers and they always asked, "Mom do you know anything about it?</span> <span id="s76">Have you been there?"</span> <span id="s77">And then little by little I would just tell them, not very much.</span> <span id="s78">I have been asked by so many organizations to speak about my past.</span> <span id="s79">I refused it.</span> <span id="s80">The only time I spoke was the Lutheran Church, and that was only because that the minister there felt that everybody who is not Lutheran is going to go to hell and of course, I just thought I'd tell them what hell really was.</span> <span id="s81">That's the only place I spoke.</span> <span id="s82">But, I feel right now that even my children encourage me that I should give testimony.</span> <span id="s83">Just like my son called me yesterday and he said, "Good luck Mom.</span> <span id="s84">I think you owe to the younger generation, because it should never be forgotten what happened."</span> <span id="s85">I personally being so attuned to the anti-semitism which is going right now on, not only in Germany, France or England, but in the United States.</span> <span id="s86">I'm scared for the future generation because just like I hope that the Holocaust in Washington Museum or any other Museums or Memorials which were erected in memory of the six million will be able to educate the people what hatred and bigotry can do, and what they have done even to homosexuals and lesbians.</span> <span id="s87">They tortured them, and it was just because they had other sex preferences.</span> <span id="s88">We should let the people live for what they are, and therefore I feel that I consented to it.</span> <span id="s89">But I have to tell you that the last two weeks, I weighed all together 99 pounds, and I'm pretty sure I'm down to maybe 80.</span> <span id="s90">I can hardly eat or sleep.</span> <span id="s91">It's hard for me to sleep.</span> <span id="s92">There comes something that one son knows about and the other son still doesn't.</span> <span id="s93">When I was in Vienna I met many people, but one in particular was a medical student.</span> <span id="s94">He was like five and half or six years older than I.</span> <span id="s95">He visited us when we went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s96">Then, as I mentioned, my aunt who was childless, she was very eager to have a wedding, especially at that time, the rumors what was going on in Germany, because I think had in 1932 that Hitler started the revolution already in Germany, and at one point I heard my family speaking, oh he's just a maniac.</span> <span id="s97">They don't let him succeed.</span> <span id="s98">They will stop him.</span> <span id="s99">But how wrong they were.</span> <span id="s100">So, at one point, my aunt entertained that maybe we will get married.</span> <span id="s101">His family was not very well to do and neither was mine.</span> <span id="s102">He found a position in ____________.</span> <span id="s103">______________ was near _______________ which was a port, and in September of '39 the German invaded or bombed ____________.</span> <span id="s104">This is the time that my marriage was of seven months only.</span> <span id="s105">That's why I do not have any recollection.</span> <span id="s106">We hardly knew each other as a married couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q.</span> <span id="s108">How long did you know him before getting married?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A. I think around four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q.</span> <span id="s111">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A. Edmond Spritzer (ph).</span> <span id="s113">When the German started to bomb _____________, and they finally marched in from ___________, they start to round up the Jewish young men, able bodied, and that would happen with Mungio, and since then, I never saw him.</span> <span id="s114">I never had a trace of it neither.</span> <span id="s115">I have met any of his family members of his family.</span> <span id="s116">My cousin, who lives now in England, her son is by the way a member of the Parliament from Wales.</span> <span id="s117">They did not stay with Judaism, and he was born as a Episcopalian, but I don't blame them.</span> <span id="s118">There were many times that I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s119">If I were to have a family, I would not want them to be exposed to what I went through.</span> <span id="s120">She and her mother were visiting ______________, and my mother by the way was visiting me, and the panic was so great because it was on the Baltic, ____________.</span> <span id="s121">It was a resort also.</span> <span id="s122">Everybody tried to get inland, and also reach their homes.</span> <span id="s123">What vividly stayed in my mind after searching my memory that I pushed my mother in through a window because the train was so jammed that she can go and _____________ also in some way was able to place her mother and then she and I stayed a while there.</span> <span id="s124">We didn't have any possessions there, but when it start to be very bad, she was married around three years to Doctor____________ and they were located where he practiced, and she and I decided that maybe we ought to go to her home.</span> <span id="s125">That progressed so quickly.</span> <span id="s126">They started to bomb the trains, and we were just having the hardest time to go to Warsaw which was by plane maybe an hour and a half.</span> <span id="s127">It took us four days to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s128">When we came there, her husband _____________, said, look they are already progressing here.</span> <span id="s129">They are vandalizing, even the Polish people vandalizing Jewish homes.</span> <span id="s130">I think it would be wise if you and Ava start to make your way to _________.</span> <span id="s131">That's where her parents lived and my mother and Ruzia, and her father was a very prominent oral surgeon, Doctor Katzner.</span> <span id="s132">It took us twelve days, ten or twelve days.</span> <span id="s133">Everytime the train was bombed, we had to jump, no matter how high the train was into the embarkment.</span> <span id="s134">We were bleeding all over.</span> <span id="s135">Our clothes were torn.</span> <span id="s136">We didn't have food.</span> <span id="s137">But when we stopped, there happened to be a little town.</span> <span id="s138">The people came out and said, what is going on.</span> <span id="s139">Tell us where they are, and brought some food out to us.</span> <span id="s140">When we find, as you know at that time the Germans invaded Poland there was the agreement between the foreign minister of Germany ___________ and ___________ who was the foreign minister from Stalin's, from Russia, from the Bog River east of the Bog River the Russians will invade that portion of Poland.</span> <span id="s141">That of course was this camp ______.</span> <span id="s142">So when we made our way to ______________, she was financially better situated so they lived in a completely different area, and I lived on the front area.</span> <span id="s143">As a matter of fact, when we were in Warsaw, they took only possession, a __________ and it was lucky.</span> <span id="s144">That was the only thing we could cover ourselves at night, because we didn't have anything else.</span> <span id="s145">I did not make a contact with her until after the war.</span> <span id="s146">I did not know what happened to her.</span> <span id="s147">If you are interested I will tell you about it, but when I reach __________, my mother quickly put me into the basement because I don't remember if there were passports, or were they some types of documents that they had to be identified by because the Russians went from one apartment or house to another to take a survey as to how many people are there.</span> <span id="s148">So, Mother was afraid that they will arrest me because I was the newcomer and they were already there.</span> <span id="s149">So, through the contacts of my sister's husband, who was _______________.</span> <span id="s150">She was already married, he was a mathematician and he was working, help the Russians, and he was able to get some papers.</span> <span id="s151">I don't know what they said.</span> <span id="s152">I know that I was able to come out.</span> <span id="s153">That time, the Russians confiscated lots of factories and took us to work, but I didn't feel good.</span> <span id="s154">I felt that I was lightheaded.</span> <span id="s155">I was sick to my stomach and did not know maybe malnutrition or whatever and Poland and that time was already socialized medicine.</span> <span id="s156">I went to see a doctor and found out that I was two or three months pregnant.</span> <span id="s157">I don't even remember.</span> <span id="s158">To this day, I don't know how the pregnancy was not interrupted from jumping so many times.</span> <span id="s159">Sometimes we had to jump every fifteen minutes because the train was so terribly bombed, and I just was pregnant.</span> <span id="s160">My grandparents were still alive at that time.</span> <span id="s161">My grandfather in particular was religious.</span> <span id="s162">My mother was very much for aborting the child, but my grandfather felt no.</span> <span id="s163">So, I still was working, not too much food to begin with, and my sister was working, but she was still living with her husband, more near __________ which was more of a Jewish section.</span> <span id="s164">She played beautifully piano, and her desire was one time to become maybe a pianist.</span> <span id="s165">I don't remember if she already had her son, Gaynish, but I know when the German came he was around a year and half out, so I will have to calculated it back.</span> <span id="s166">Everything is just like a bad dream.</span> <span id="s167">However, we were working, and I think I worked until my eight months, very hard because they did not let us stop.</span> <span id="s168">I don't recall what we were doing, but I do recall that there was like a quota.</span> <span id="s169">If you didn't make so many pieces in one hour, they will push you to a very bad job, sometimes cleaning the worst toilets that you can imagine.</span> <span id="s170">So I was very, very pressed, and not feeling well.</span> <span id="s171">I was rushed out to a hospital to deliver, and she was a beautiful -- her name was Lydia.</span> <span id="s172">She was like 2 1/2 months old and everybody thought she looked like an angle, but somehow, due to the milk, there was not a formula or anything.</span> <span id="s173">Nothing was sterilized, she developed dysentery, like a very bad case of diarrhea, and the doctor hospitalized her.</span> <span id="s174">I went every day to the hospital after work, and they showed me through a window because they felt it was a communicable disease.</span> <span id="s175">But one day I came and they didn't show her and they say she's dead.</span> <span id="s176">That was I think she was only three months or three and a half months old.</span> <span id="s177">That took lots and lots of maneuvering really to get the body out so we can bury her near my father, so she wouldn't be alone.</span> <span id="s178">That was the end of that.</span> <span id="s179">But the Russian was not very easy to live under either.</span> <span id="s180">They just unannounced would knock on the door, came and took whatever they liked.</span> <span id="s181">My mother had some nice china and they wanted it so it was not even would you give me.</span> <span id="s182">I remember being just so attached to the drawing that that was my father and never knew him, but from the pictures sometimes he stood at the foot of my bed and I could visualize him and I was a fan of his _____________ that he had a very nice __________ and of other literary writers and philosophers like Hiner Shuller, a ____________ man, and I thought one day I will have it in my home.</span> <span id="s183">Well, it stayed there until the Germans came, but then they raped also some people-- the Russians.</span> <span id="s184">They also came and tortured you that tomorrow they come and they emptied out, but mostly they were like ________ and when they find our watches they just have like five watches on one hand and the other, they never had those things.</span> <span id="s185">Or they took a nightgown from the women and just wear it as a dress.</span> <span id="s186">They were very primitive.</span> <span id="s187">My mother felt that they interfere a lot in the war of ____________ and when we heard that eventually maybe the Germans come, my mother said, "It couldn't be worse."</span> <span id="s188">But once again, she was wrong.</span> <span id="s189">At least we were alive.</span> <span id="s190">Now, I spoke to a friend of mine who was very young when he left Poland.</span> <span id="s191">He's an orthopedist in our town, and I spoke to Andy Solenski, and I said, for some reason as a matter of fact the night before I came here, I said Andy for some reason I feel that the Germans attacked Russia and forced themselves into our territory that there was in 1939 -- excuse me in 1941 that it was in June, because I remember that was my sister's birthday, and my mother baked a cake and asked _____________ and the little boy who was already alive, to come and stay with me.</span> <span id="s192">That same night we heard shots and commotion and we run to the window and we saw the Russian soldiers running with mattresses under their arm and we knew something is brewing, and that's how the Russians went out, because the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s193">Then, the other set of problems started.</span> <span id="s194">We were in our apartment still and I failed to say that my grandparents had a very hard time when the Russians were there.</span> <span id="s195">When they got drunk they came to the restaurant and sometimes with the bottles of liquor stayed and everything they would just push everything on the floor and just destroy it.</span> <span id="s196">They took it very hard that they could not operate and support the whole family.</span> <span id="s197">My grandmother took very ill and within one week of each other, they passed away.</span> <span id="s198">My uncle who was my father's brother, __________, his daughter is my cousin who lives in Paris, Nira, and is married to a non-Jewish, but non-believer really, a Parisian artist.</span> <span id="s199">She has a son Stephen and his wife Marie-Noell and they visited Mitchell and I here last year, and he continued to operate the restaurant and we still lived in that house the whole family together.</span> <span id="s200">But then they established a Ghetto and they start to line up the people and we had to leave everything behind, and my _____________ that I somehow thought I was going to have that from my father, and we moved and I don't remember the street.</span> <span id="s201">There was a big building with lots of stories, three or four stories.</span> <span id="s202">We moved to an apartment where one and a half rooms, two families lived.</span> <span id="s203">My mother and I. Ruzia was still there, and another family with three children.</span> <span id="s204">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s205">But when the Russians left, _____________, who were very religious.</span> <span id="s206">The father had a beard.</span> <span id="s207">The mother had a ___________.</span> <span id="s208">I don't know what it is in English.</span> <span id="s209">A wig?</span> <span id="s210">I see.</span> <span id="s211">They had a daughter who also by coincidence her name was Rose.</span> <span id="s212">Now, today, I think it is multiple sclerosis.</span> <span id="s213">She was unable to walk.</span> <span id="s214">She was bedridden, and the father of Zigmund encouraged Zigmund that still going back to the Russian occupation, encouraged the boys, there was Zigmund and two brothers.</span> <span id="s215">One of them now a year ago established contact with me ________________, who by the way told me he saw my sister's husband Zigmund after the war in Russia.</span> <span id="s216">He encouraged him to make his way to Israel, but he knew he left my sister and a little child, and he told him he's going to try to reach ___________.</span> <span id="s217">Evidently he never did, because _________ cannot put traces or find him, and never reached us.</span> <span id="s218">Whatever, we were not there to begin with.</span> <span id="s219">Then his father encouraged us to come and live in their house because they had a little house, like four rooms.</span> <span id="s220">And it was once again, very hard to get milk or bread or anything and he was going courageously out trying to get something for his grandson.</span> <span id="s221">One time when he left he never came back, so when ____________ asked me what happened to my father, the only estimate I could say that they caught him or shoot him.</span> <span id="s222">I don't know.</span> <span id="s223">Then the mother did not know what to do with her daughter Rose, and I think she lost her mind.</span> <span id="s224">She was just going around the streets and screaming, and they must have shot her because she never came back, and here I was with Mom, myself, and then Ruzia was at that time, and Zigmund was already in the Russian Army and when the Russians were moving away when the Germans came, they followed the Russian army and that's why he felt then it would be better to have the German people come.</span> <span id="s225">We had both of the atrocities, and before we moved in with this other family, when I said that we lived in that building that had few stories, it's hard to believe how many people jumped to their death from third or fourth floor.</span> <span id="s226">I remember one prominent doctor who did it with his wife together because they didn't want to face what can happen to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q. Was this when the Germans came?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q.</span> <span id="s230">Did you see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s232">So, that's why when you asked me to do that, after 50 years, which is a half century, to really delve into my memory things that I try so hard to suppress, it was very hard for me.</span> <span id="s233">Then, we didn't have any money, and we didn't have any means to support ourselves and there was already the Germans.</span> <span id="s234">I was wearing an arm band with the Star of David and J, Judea.</span> <span id="s235">I took off my arm band.</span> <span id="s236">I was very blonde, long hair, they say blue eyes.</span> <span id="s237">I always thought I have green eyes, and I went to the other side to the brewery, and tried to bring beer, bottles of beer.</span> <span id="s238">It was very small, but I still feel that my wrists were very very affected by it.</span> <span id="s239">I had surgery here and carpal tunnel, and I just went back and forth and sold the beer to the people who had money.</span> <span id="s240">Mama was able to get a bushel of flour and make something to eat for us.</span> <span id="s241">Then the Germans took over the factories the same that the Russians had, and we start to work there again.</span> <span id="s242">But Ruzia was designed to clean the streets, so she came a few times.</span> <span id="s243">She was so delicate, so very pretty, and she said as long as the child is here, and we took care as best we can.</span> <span id="s244">Mother didn't work anymore, and the brewery was taken over by the Germans.</span> <span id="s245">One day she just didn't come.</span> <span id="s246">One day just like the next day maybe came a Polish man.</span> <span id="s247">He was a conductor of a trolley, and he knocked on the door and he asked for Ava and I said I am Ava, and he said that my sister is going to be taken to Auschwitz and she's so hungry.</span> <span id="s248">She would like to have a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s249">I asked him where they are going to march the whole group of people, and he told me.</span> <span id="s250">I took my armband off and went on the other side and stayed there while they were walking.</span> <span id="s251">The men looked like skeletons and they even picked up anything that was on the street.</span> <span id="s252">Sometimes I wonder if it was even something from animals, everything.</span> <span id="s253">I saw Ruzia and I just run out and I don't know, there was a Ukrainian or some German Gestapo took my arm and they said _______________ and I said no, I'm Polish.</span> <span id="s254">I throwed the bread to her and she said please take care of Gaynosh.</span> <span id="s255">I never saw her again.</span> <span id="s256">Then usually the German people used the young Jewish boy as the hatcher man.</span> <span id="s257">They were always the ones to select somebody or to take them somewhere and I know then from before or from school or something that we did together and at that time when it started to be so bad and one time I worked at the factory and there were different rooms and then I heard screaming like agony screaming, and I opened the door and there was a girl -- I don't know if she was 16 or 17, and she was profusely bleeding like you would think somebody had menstrual bleeding.</span> <span id="s258">She said, they raped me with the foot of the stool.</span> <span id="s259">Then I heard other screaming and then a Polish superintendent of that factory came over and grabbed me by the hand and he pulled me down to the basement and that's how I got acquainted with the basement.</span> <span id="s260">Then, at that time, I know I have to do something with Mom and Gaynosh.</span> <span id="s261">I asked -- see in the Ghetto there was like a you have to go through a gate where there were Germans and Ukrainians and the Jewish who were sort of going back and forth, the young men.</span> <span id="s262">At that time, I asked then if there was any possibility that I can get Gaynosh out of the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s263">They said how, and I said we just put something in his mouth and see and I spoke with that Sishko, that from brewery, the director, and I was such a close friend with her, went together with her to school.</span> <span id="s264">I told her that I would like to Gaynosh to her aunt who was without children.</span> <span id="s265">Maybe she will raise him.</span> <span id="s266">She said let me talk.</span> <span id="s267">Then when I came for the beer and she said try it.</span> <span id="s268">I told her what day that would be and so with the armband -- you know there is like a wagon that you sit higher up and when you take the seat there is like a compartment and the baby was around here and maybe in three months over a year I remember and just prior to the gate I stuffed a little hanky in his mouth and then they stopped us and they said ______________ and I said I have to testify because I saw some Jewish people doing something wrong and they take me to headquarter.</span> <span id="s269">When we reach the other side, they couldn't go near the brewery, but they left me off and I held a shawl over my head and the baby and somebody from the back stopped me and I said "yeah," and he said where are you going and I said home with my baby.</span> <span id="s270">Who are you, I say I am Polish.</span> <span id="s271">What is your religion?</span> <span id="s272">I said catholic.</span> <span id="s273">That's what I don't know so many things I was able to get away.</span> <span id="s274">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s275">I placed the baby at that time with them with the understanding that after the war somehow somewhere I will get the baby.</span> <span id="s276">Can I retreat?</span> <span id="s277">When I was in the house of __________, I had the baby and my mother and oh, by the way one time they come in the Germans and __________ that one that was bedridden and just took her out like a piece of garbage, and she was gone, which was a blessing.</span> <span id="s278">Really, I could not lift her every day there was only me and Mom.</span> <span id="s279">There was no real life for her, but in this ____________ house I didn't know it, but the neighbors who lived there for so many years, they know each other.</span> <span id="s280">One time a Jewish family came and said, you know there is a door in the floor going to the cellar.</span> <span id="s281">It was flush with the floor, but there were steps going down where evidently they pickled something for the winter, whatever.</span> <span id="s282">It was like storage room.</span> <span id="s283">Could we hide?</span> <span id="s284">Well, they said if they catch us, we're all going to be dead.</span> <span id="s285">Well, it got so bad that they started to round up people and take them out to the concentration camp, I had 15 people in that cellar including my mom and Gaynosh.</span> <span id="s286">That was before.</span> <span id="s287">There was a bed and I seen him sitting there.</span> <span id="s288">They came, not only that they came, 15 people, but there three children in the age of five to maybe nine and I was so afraid that they may cry or say something loud.</span> <span id="s289">So, I was upstairs and four or five Gestapo men say ____________, everybody __________, and I said in German, there is nobody here, just me and my child.</span> <span id="s290">He said you go here you go there and they stuck the top on the thing and for me to tell them downstairs to sit quiet, I said, but there is no one here, but there is no one here.</span> <span id="s291">There was silence and then when the Gestapo grabbed Gaynosh and I said please don't do nothing to him and the other one said, let him sit we come some other time.</span> <span id="s292">Then he said are you sure you're Jewish.</span> <span id="s293">I said maybe not, but it didn't help me too much, but then he threw an apple, I thought he was going to kill the child, that was a good gesture, and some candies and they left.</span> <span id="s294">I asked once again, what a miracle.</span> <span id="s295">Then when I took out Gaynosh, I placed my mother with a neighbor that we used to live way back where my grandfather's house was.</span> <span id="s296">We didn't have much, but mama had such small little diamond earrings that evidently my father gave her when they were married.</span> <span id="s297">Don't forget that Ruzia was 2 and a half years older so they had some time together.</span> <span id="s298">I think her two rings and she wanted me to take it so I can survive.</span> <span id="s299">They say no, I want you to have that.</span> <span id="s300">Maybe at one time they will ask you to do that so they can buy food.</span> <span id="s301">So we made like a pouch in her dress that she had.</span> <span id="s302">We couldn't take too much with us.</span> <span id="s303">There were only two dresses that each one of us had and we sewed it underneath and that was what I left her.</span> <span id="s304">My heart was somehow easier because I took care of that.</span> <span id="s305">Then, that didn't give me too much time to really do something for myself.</span> <span id="s306">We were just taken in big cattle wagons in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s307">So, I found myself there towards the end of '41, 42, and what one saw in that concentration camp, it's really better to repress that.</span> <span id="s308">One time, of course they had I think it was recreation for them.</span> <span id="s309">Every time at night which were just bunk beds, no pillows, no sheets, no nothing, you just lie there, and roll calls.</span> <span id="s310">When it was snowing or raining or thundering that you put your feet like that and sit with your head down and then they would with the rifles would point out you go to your right, you go to your left, you go to your right.</span> <span id="s311">You never know which one side is better.</span> <span id="s312">Then one of them was to be just get away in some means.</span> <span id="s313">Sometimes they called it twice a night and then you had to get up at 5:00 to go to work.</span> <span id="s314">Then they would give you soup which you could find nothing in it.</span> <span id="s315">One time they put us there to -- let me say, when you came there, they shaved everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q.</span> <span id="s317">This is _____________?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A. Yanosko, Limberg.</span> <span id="s319">They shaved us and then you hear this screaming because they asked everybody to open their mouths and they have like gold crowns, they just knocked it out, which was terribly painful.</span> <span id="s320">They just undress us.</span> <span id="s321">Men, women, children.</span> <span id="s322">It was almost unhuman.</span> <span id="s323">Then they pushed us to different barracks and when evening or at night when they built a fire and there like a ____________ which was like a heap and then they put a big fire and while we were sitting there, you could see the fire.</span> <span id="s324">It was not a recreational fire, it was quite a large area and the flames were going up and with their rifles they were pointing to people giving them instructions to dress, to undress, whatever there was, one gown you were wearing and to throw himself on the burning.</span> <span id="s325">There was a mother and a daughter sitting near me.</span> <span id="s326">I don't think the daughter maybe was 14 or 15 years of age.</span> <span id="s327">He pointed out only to the mother and when the mother was still undressing, the daughter quickly got up and undressed and followed her, and many others perished the same way.</span> <span id="s328">Sometimes they would take us out and they would have those vicious dogs and when they found out that somebody was a rabbi, I remember one was a priest even who tried to hide the Jewish children, and pushed the dogs and you could see how the flesh was coming off these people.</span> <span id="s329">Sometimes they hang the people and the Jewish boys who were in control.</span> <span id="s330">I don't know if they could say no, sometimes I feel, and they were hanging there for us to see and then the Gestapo would say, you are the next.</span> <span id="s331">Just torturing, torturing us.</span> <span id="s332">One time in the roll call order were young people and the older people were sitting and the Ukrainian took -- her name was Bosha, took her out and we thought maybe he was going to save her, but when she came back she said he raped me and then he came and shot her.</span> <span id="s333">I had all her blood, you could everything from her brain.</span> <span id="s334">He shot her right here in the head.</span> <span id="s335">How can you have a very normal life when you think of that.</span> <span id="s336">One time I was selected to well asked to go and sort the clothing of the people who they still round up from different places.</span> <span id="s337">That was the only time that I had done that.</span> <span id="s338">That was the time that I found my mother's dress.</span> <span id="s339">I found the pouch.</span> <span id="s340">Of course there was nothing in it and I asked everybody if they came across Sabina Mueller and I looked at everybody who marched out to work.</span> <span id="s341">So, I don't know if they found her where she was hiding or if she was there and I never saw her because when I talked to my cousin in Paris, she was like 15 years younger than I, Mira said before I went to Auschwitz I was in Limberg and never saw her.</span> <span id="s342">It was a big camp.</span> <span id="s343">At that time there was a Gestapo man who we know that he is sadist.</span> <span id="s344">He was choking people, especially young girls.</span> <span id="s345">One time he selected me to work in his house to clean his house.</span> <span id="s346">His house was like a stone away from the door that rifles and Gestapo and everyone was watching when the people are going out, but the women were not going out anymore.</span> <span id="s347">So, one time, around that time, we were selected to help the men dig trenches, and they said, this is not deep enough.</span> <span id="s348">The men were like skeletons, no food nothing.</span> <span id="s349">Then once again, right, left, right left.</span> <span id="s350">Then they put the men facing the trenches and then the music played, famous _____________ and the __________.</span> <span id="s351">That's how they buried the people or tortured them and the squadron shot the people, sometimes not enough to kill them and then they order to bury them.</span> <span id="s352">And you can hear the voices, help me help me and they were just buried alive.</span> <span id="s353">That time, I made up my mind if they shoot me that's okay.</span> <span id="s354">I spoke to the young man that you used to go with women and men out to the factory to work.</span> <span id="s355">His name was Jacob.</span> <span id="s356">I said, you're coming to that house where I work for that Gestapo.</span> <span id="s357">He never talked to me, he just said pointing that's not clean enough, but he never did anything to me.</span> <span id="s358">He never gave me food neither.</span> <span id="s359">But, this Jacob used to come and bring some cans of milk, which we didn't have it.</span> <span id="s360">I said do you think you can dream up a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s361">I would like to escape.</span> <span id="s362">I have a nephew.</span> <span id="s363">I have to take care of him.</span> <span id="s364">I promised my sister.</span> <span id="s365">He said gosh I don't know how I can do it.</span> <span id="s366">I said you bring that in a basket.</span> <span id="s367">Everybody is taller than you Ava.</span> <span id="s368">I said I will round it up, don't worry.</span> <span id="s369">If they shoot me, they shoot me.</span> <span id="s370">I have nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s371">And one day he did it.</span> <span id="s372">He said 5:00 you have to drop into that row of people and just walk.</span> <span id="s373">Of course I did not look very much like a man, and maybe my walk was funny, but we were almost to get into the trolley when they start, "halt, halt" and they recognize.</span> <span id="s374">I jumped into the trolley and the conductor refused to stop.</span> <span id="s375">He saw that I was escaping and he went.</span> <span id="s376">Later on I have learned that he was shot because he come minus one, that Jacob.</span> <span id="s377">He was shot.</span> <span id="s378">It was also hard for me to live with that he somehow did it for me and he was not able to survive.</span> <span id="s379">That time they went to that factory where I sometimes went to the basement where the women work before, remember I befriended myself with that superintendent.</span> <span id="s380">I went in that basement all alone.</span> <span id="s381">I heard the voices.</span> <span id="s382">I bet they were rats.</span> <span id="s383">I was so scared, but my head was shaved.</span> <span id="s384">I couldn't go out, and I stayed there until they left that building, which was around 4:00 and I knew there was a telephone in some room.</span> <span id="s385">I quickly wanted to call Sishka and I said I escaped.</span> <span id="s386">She said My God, am I going to take you.</span> <span id="s387">You're going to have to wait.</span> <span id="s388">I don't want to tell my mother.</span> <span id="s389">Maybe Stashu, her brother, will somehow pick you up and bring some clothing.</span> <span id="s390">Then I heard steps, and my heart stopped and that was the superintendent.</span> <span id="s391">He said what are you doing?</span> <span id="s392">I said I escaped, can you help me and he said my wife is not going to do that.</span> <span id="s393">Let me talk to her.</span> <span id="s394">He talked to her and she said here is soup.</span> <span id="s395">Eat the soup and go.</span> <span id="s396">Where would I go?</span> <span id="s397">Go back to the cellar.</span> <span id="s398">Let me just use your phone and I can tell her where I am.</span> <span id="s399">She did that, gave me a scarf so I can cover my head and then sometime it was very, very dark that they came and I jumped into there.</span> <span id="s400">They couldn't take me to their home.</span> <span id="s401">They placed me in a shack and they brought me some food.</span> <span id="s402">I think I stayed there for almost three and a half weeks, until my hair grew to something like you have, so I can go out.</span> <span id="s403">Sometime very late at night they would let me take a shower and that was a blessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q. Before we go on, I want to go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A. All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q.</span> <span id="s409">When you saw those people committing suicide, jumping out of -- did you ever think to yourself that you wanted to commit suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A. Not then.</span> <span id="s411">Not then.</span> <span id="s412">Suicide no.</span> <span id="s413">I just didn't care.</span> <span id="s414">When my mother and Gaynosh were taken there was a time when I didn't care.</span> <span id="s415">Only when I found mother's clothing and I knew that she was no longer alive, then I had that great desire to fulfill my promise to my sister.</span> <span id="s416">Because when they took her to Auschwitz and I threw that bread if she caught it or not I will never know, and shear miracle that that Ukrainian or German let go of my arm and didn't pull me together through that marching group, I felt, I have to fulfill my promise to her.</span> <span id="s417">Suicide no, I'm just not geared to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q. Were you afraid of being raped?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A. Yes, that I was.</span> <span id="s420">And by a very great miracle, even later on when I was in Vienna, where I will tell you from the point when I enlisted remind me to tell you about a very close call to rape and I will touch on that.</span> <span id="s421">I'm trying to do it sequence as possible.</span> <span id="s422">Have you have any other questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q. Yes.</span> <span id="s424">When you were escaping --</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A. From the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q. From the concentration camp, but I want to ask you both about the escaping about taking your mother out, about taking Gaynosh out.</span> <span id="s427">It seems very brave to think about going outside and taking the chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A.</span> <span id="s429">It was not so brave.</span> <span id="s430">There was really guts and the will to do that.</span> <span id="s431">I was bringing really income to the family by going everyday out to the brewery, taking my armband.</span> <span id="s432">Good, I was blonde and blue eyes as they say, but nevertheless it was going out, facing -- it was like two different cities.</span> <span id="s433">Ghetto was all Jewish the other side was not.</span> <span id="s434">That was taking a chance.</span> <span id="s435">Walking through the streets and seeing them marching and looking at you and pretend that you are just hah-hah and you just smiling good day.</span> <span id="s436">That was brave.</span> <span id="s437">But then when they took my mother out, I didn't do it by myself because there I have the help once again of the Jewish boys who also took mother out to Gestapo headquarters and then she was going out to our area where we lived.</span> <span id="s438">That was brave because where my father lived, we were known there.</span> <span id="s439">Where my grandfather lived, we were known there.</span> <span id="s440">She was there I don't know how long, but it must have been at least to that year that I found it unless they kept the clothing that long, but that was in the beginning of 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q.</span> <span id="s442">How did you go out everyday, through the gate?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A. No, through the other street that was just a hole and I was just making my way out because there was no wire in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s444">There were just streets.</span> <span id="s445">If you knew the area you could just try to get out, and that's how I went almost every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q. Were you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A. Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s448">Because I wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s449">As _________ said, my cousin from England, my mother always said Ava is so brave.</span> <span id="s450">That was under good circumstances.</span> <span id="s451">Until today, I am the do gooder, always for other people.</span> <span id="s452">I do it today, too.</span> <span id="s453">I think that's my nature, but then my mother was a widow.</span> <span id="s454">We didn't have money, and she was working, and she was very active in an orphanage house.</span> <span id="s455">Her name was on the orphanage house, so every time when she was saying to us, to both of us, if you feel that you are deprived, just look at the children who are much worse off, and then you see how lucky you are.</span> <span id="s456">Then, I said, well, how lucky we are.</span> <span id="s457">But then I did the same thing with my children when they didn't eat, I would just say, see you don't finish, people in Europe would give anything for crumbs, and Mitchell was always joking and he said, mother, pack the crumbs and send them.</span> <span id="s458">But both of them grew up to be very charitable.</span> <span id="s459">I remember we were in New York and walking through the streets there was a man without feet and a beggar and Mitchell said can I have my advance 25 cent allowance.</span> <span id="s460">I'll pay you back, and then he went and gave to the man.</span> <span id="s461">You live by example.</span> <span id="s462">You live by example, and therefore I feel that the children, whether it be German or Polish or Lithuanian, they don't grow up with prejudices.</span> <span id="s463">They're taught.</span> <span id="s464">They're taught, therefore, I feel that really the United States Holocaust in Washington or any other museums are memorials that were erected in the memory of this six million will somehow educate the people and let them know what hatred and bigotry can do.</span> <span id="s465">Not only to a group of Jewish people, but it could be an individual what they have done to the homosexuals or lesbians or to any other group.</span> <span id="s466">One day they may turn because they are catholics, but I think I always think that Hitler couldn't do those atrocities by himself.</span> <span id="s467">He got the masses to follow him.</span> <span id="s468">That is the tragedy.</span> <span id="s469">How blindly people follow.</span> <span id="s470">One, it be crazy or irrational and do what is absolutely against any principle to being a human being.</span> <span id="s471">This is what is hard to understand for me.</span> <span id="s472">Do you have any other questions.</span> <span id="s473">Maybe I didn't make myself clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q. I'm interest to hear a little bit again about your escape from ____________ camp on the trolley.</span> <span id="s475">I don't quite understand how you got away.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A. Well, when you asked me before did I care or was I scared or did I have any reason or would I like to live.</span> <span id="s477">That was the time that I felt that I would like to fulfill my promise to my sister Ruzia.</span> <span id="s478">I had a desire to escape, and in that time, no, I wasn't scared.</span> <span id="s479">If they would have shot me in my own heart I know I placed Gaynosh and I placed my mother.</span> <span id="s480">I didn't know what their fate was going to be at the end, but at that time I felt good.</span> <span id="s481">When I was working for that Gestapo who was that sadist cleaning his house, and then I had to go to the barracks.</span> <span id="s482">I didn't stay, but I came there almost at 4:00 to his house.</span> <span id="s483">4:00 in the morning, without any food, and when I spoke to that Jacob and I told him just drop me off some pants.</span> <span id="s484">I cannot go in a dress or skirt because there was just that outfit.</span> <span id="s485">When he brought that, he said you will have to fall in at 5:00 and march with the men, but you are so short they're going to spot you.</span> <span id="s486">I said don't worry, if they shoot me, they shoot me.</span> <span id="s487">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s488">Just give me a chance.</span> <span id="s489">There was a big gate, and there were dogs and people with rifles to shoot when they didn't like somebody.</span> <span id="s490">Maybe somebody looked very fragile and they didn't let them go.</span> <span id="s491">They just pulled them out and shot them right there.</span> <span id="s492">This we saw too.</span> <span id="s493">Then everybody tried to stand up straight so they still with their last breath of their strength could go out.</span> <span id="s494">I marched in and tried being short to get closer and closer to the first, second row and then just outside the gate was the trolley that took them to the factory.</span> <span id="s495">Then, when I started to walk faster and faster, someone of them spotted me, and they started to "halt, halt, stop, stop, stop."</span> <span id="s496">Nobody stopped.</span> <span id="s497">They were marching and I quickly run into the trolley and said to the conductor.</span> <span id="s498">I'm escaping and I'm not even Jewish, I'm Polish and I'm trying to escape because they took me by mistake, because I didn't know what the Polish person was thinking of the whole story neither.</span> <span id="s499">So, I said they shaved my head and I have to go and find my family.</span> <span id="s500">When they came almost very close to the trolley all the men were there and he took off and they were shooting and he said, I don't stop, I go.</span> <span id="s501">He said in Polish ______________, we go.</span> <span id="s502">But unfortunately later on I know that they shot that Jewish younger man, that Jacob because first of all they know that a woman was in his group, and also that he came minus one.</span> <span id="s503">So, I lived for a while with that guilt too, and when you start to think about it, which I don't want to think about it, you have a very guilty feeling.</span> <span id="s504">Even now that we were in the beginning, well, it still didn't come to the marriage, so I'll tell you that later.</span> <span id="s505">If you have any questions going back, I'll continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q. Go ahead continue on when you were hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A. All right.</span> <span id="s508">I was there in that shacks, two shacks, like I have one now in my own house.</span> <span id="s509">They brought some food when it was very dark, because they still don't know -- there was a cluster of homes of the directors, the higher ups lived on that area.</span> <span id="s510">Higher ups like the directors of the brewery and things like that.</span> <span id="s511">They didn't know what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s512">But when I came there, my feeling was I'm going to see Gaynosh, and I said where is _____________.</span> <span id="s513">Oh, they didn't want to stay here because they were afraid of the Germans and they went to Czechoslovakia, and they took Gaynosh with him.</span> <span id="s514">Gaynosh is Gershin named after my father like my son Gary is always named after my father.</span> <span id="s515">Then she told me that after the war I can find her, which I will tell you what I did after the war.</span> <span id="s516">I stayed there I think to my best recollection of three and a half weeks, to gain a little hair and then one day ______________ came and said you know what, I spoke to Wanda she's in ___________ and she and Peter are working in the underground.</span> <span id="s517">They are helping lots of Jewish people and also bombing the bridges so the Germans cannot go from one side to another.</span> <span id="s518">They said that you should make your way to __________because lots of people registered as Polish to go to Germany or Austria.</span> <span id="s519">Of course, I wanted to go to Vienna because I knew so many people.</span> <span id="s520">In that time, I just once again, took a chance and went to __________ by train.</span> <span id="s521">Somebody could recognize me.</span> <span id="s522">That's that famous blouse that you have the picture that ______________ gave me, and one skirt and that is all that I had.</span> <span id="s523">I registered.</span> <span id="s524">I had to wear an armband that said P "Polish."</span> <span id="s525">They asked me if I would go to Berlin first, and I said no, can I go to Vienna, Austria, preferably Vienna.</span> <span id="s526">Of course you could speak like a Polish.</span> <span id="s527">You could not speak like a Jew.</span> <span id="s528">The Germans said do you speak German and I said yes.</span> <span id="s529">I went to work in Vienna.</span> <span id="s530">_____________ is -- have you ever been in Vienna Joan?</span> <span id="s531">You know where the _____________, just on that street, which you come out and you cross the _____________, which is just like Fifth Avenue in New York.</span> <span id="s532">Then you have that _____________.</span> <span id="s533">This is where ________________.</span> <span id="s534">There was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s535">What was his first name?</span> <span id="s536">Adolph, Adolph Shiltz.</span> <span id="s537">Maybe he still exists, and the Gestapo and the SS, Storm Fuhrer could not bear to have shirts with machine made button holes.</span> <span id="s538">They had to be hand made.</span> <span id="s539">That's what we did.</span> <span id="s540">We found by midway there was five of us who registered in different areas.</span> <span id="s541">But somehow we find ourselves working for that Mr. Shiltz.</span> <span id="s542">My name is --- I'm still in _______________.</span> <span id="s543">I lived longer -- excuse me, I retract, I was in ________________ living with my girlfriend Wanda and Peter and they asked me if I would like to work with them underground.</span> <span id="s544">I said I cannot take the chances.</span> <span id="s545">I wanted to see Ruzia's son and I would rather go on and work.</span> <span id="s546">So, my hair grew like that and I had nice hair.</span> <span id="s547">You have a picture of that, and that's how I register.</span> <span id="s548">I always had a nice smile.</span> <span id="s549">My mother said, the only nice pretty things that I have was my teeth and my eyes and they did not even want to put a filling in my teeth.</span> <span id="s550">There was a Polish girl in Vienna.</span> <span id="s551">They just pulled the teeth, which I lost three on that side, two on that side.</span> <span id="s552">It was a little better treatment.</span> <span id="s553">They didn't kill you, but it was not easy to live and to be somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q.</span> <span id="s555">What was your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A. Ava Stephanie Rutkofska.</span> <span id="s557">And Peter gave me those papers, but my birthday was the same.</span> <span id="s558">When I left, I have a picture with Peter and myself.</span> <span id="s559">I will make a copy and send you that because he really helped me out.</span> <span id="s560">I don't know where he is now.</span> <span id="s561">I start to write but nothing.</span> <span id="s562">Then, I came to that Mr. Shiltz and also they washed the laundry there for those Gestapo.</span> <span id="s563">So, there were baskets that we had to cross the ______________ and go to that Weinberger and I was so ashamed to just carry that dirty laundry there.</span> <span id="s564">There was a Yugoslavian.</span> <span id="s565">He was always in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s566">I really don't know what he was, but he was influential, and knowing that I was Ava, he always called me Avasha, and he always said how pretty I am.</span> <span id="s567">He said, it seems like I see that you are ashamed.</span> <span id="s568">Let me take one side of the basket and carry it with you.</span> <span id="s569">He was very instrumental later.</span> <span id="s570">This is what it was.</span> <span id="s571">So, we had like iron ______ a very mediocre pillow one thin blanket and one was scared of the other.</span> <span id="s572">All girls, are you going to church, are you going to say novena.</span> <span id="s573">Are you going to the evening services, and yes, of course.</span> <span id="s574">And one was watching the other how we are crossing ourselves only to find out that all of us were Jewish.</span> <span id="s575">It wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s576">We all had a shelf were we had our underwear and the blouse, the one blouse I washed every day and ironed.</span> <span id="s577">And working for that Adolph Schiltz, he always tried -- he somehow took to me, his wife too and those two children and the little one.</span> <span id="s578">He said _________ come in here and I said yes.</span> <span id="s579">Do you know what the word __________ is.</span> <span id="s580">You never heard of that.</span> <span id="s581">Then there were other Jewish expressions and I said how would I know that.</span> <span id="s582">Well, aren't you close to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s583">I said, well they could be my neighbors but they did not know the language.</span> <span id="s584">Then that man that I worked for that sadist one day he came in 1944.</span> <span id="s585">He came in Shiltz, Heil Hitler and of course he was such a Nazi and I don't know how I possibly put my head so deep down that he doesn't see me.</span> <span id="s586">Maybe he would not even recognize me.</span> <span id="s587">I had hair and looked different, but I thought my heart stopped.</span> <span id="s588">He was talking about us, Shiltz, with him, because they were looking at our side.</span> <span id="s589">I couldn't say anything to the girls because I didn't know they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s590">So, they say, is something wrong.</span> <span id="s591">I said no I just see that ______________ is here.</span> <span id="s592">I wonder what he wants.</span> <span id="s593">Maybe he is looking for Polish girls because Mr. Shiltz talks to him.</span> <span id="s594">If I get nervous I talk.</span> <span id="s595">As you know, I told you that, and finally he was going like toward us, but there was a little T.V. and that was the time that the Germans had lots of trouble in Russia.</span> <span id="s596">As a matter of fact, one of the Jewish girls, the only one I don't know her name, she was from Lodz of course in the Irish papers she was Marisha, but what I understand her brother was a famous Jewish historian.</span> <span id="s597">I don't know her name and she was singing or reciting the ______________ you know, backwards.</span> <span id="s598">March, march forward and then backwards.</span> <span id="s599">Maybe she expressed herself that way before really it was peace, and they took her and she vanished the last days of the war.</span> <span id="s600">However, they looked on the T.V. and I did not know there was a little T.V. on the shelf and that's where he stopped so they didn't reach us.</span> <span id="s601">It's another miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q.</span> <span id="s603">You mean they had a surveillance camera of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A. Just a T.V., but he didn't want us to know that the Germans were having problems in Russia and they're trying to withdraw.</span> <span id="s605">Remember the time that they were having problems.</span> <span id="s606">You know, we have like rations, it's what they're known here as stamps, but we could by some food for it.</span> <span id="s607">One time I went to restaurant which was a cafe house and I had my P, my armband, and I always was aware of it that people may recognize me because I used to live in Vienna.</span> <span id="s608">There was a woman, I can see her like today, a black hat a black turtle neck.</span> <span id="s609">She was just like you bury people.</span> <span id="s610">All in black.</span> <span id="s611">And she was looking at me and looking.</span> <span id="s612">I couldn't swallow.</span> <span id="s613">I had a cup of soup, and I couldn't hardly swallow.</span> <span id="s614">She just have noticed my uneasiness and finally she came over and she said, hello.</span> <span id="s615">She said, are you hiding.</span> <span id="s616">I said no, I'm working here, a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s617">Where are you working?</span> <span id="s618">I say in a German place.</span> <span id="s619">She said, you can tell me, are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s620">I said no, and she said you can be honest with me.</span> <span id="s621">I would like to help you.</span> <span id="s622">I watched you.</span> <span id="s623">I must have been in the restaurant before.</span> <span id="s624">You always have the same outfit.</span> <span id="s625">Can I buy something for you, and I said, that's the end.</span> <span id="s626">She must be from the German Gestapo.</span> <span id="s627">I said, I don't accept anything from people.</span> <span id="s628">She said, what's your first name?</span> <span id="s629">I said Ava.</span> <span id="s630">Ava, ah, __________, I said Ava, I'm Polish, and she said, confide in me because I will confide in you.</span> <span id="s631">I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s632">My husband was not.</span> <span id="s633">That's why we don't live together, not to bring harm to him, but I have a son I wish you could meet him.</span> <span id="s634">His name is Eric.</span> <span id="s635">I said I cannot date anybody because that's against the rules.</span> <span id="s636">Well, where are you working.</span> <span id="s637">I said not ar away from here and she just extracted from me and I said ________________, and she said I give you the address.</span> <span id="s638">I don't have a telephone.</span> <span id="s639">You can call me.</span> <span id="s640">I said I don't have a telephone where we live.</span> <span id="s641">One time, at work, a German there always were Germans, SS or Gestapo coming came a very handsome tall young fellow, once again Heil Hitler and they start to look once again our way.</span> <span id="s642">I said, uh-huh, that's the woman who denounced me and Shiltz said, "Come in here.</span> <span id="s643">________________ wants to meet me."</span> <span id="s644">I said I don't know anybody.</span> <span id="s645">So, he said, I am Eric.</span> <span id="s646">You know that smile on his face, oh his teeth and I said I don't know you do I?</span> <span id="s647">He said, I think you would know me if we talked together.</span> <span id="s648">He didn't want to speak in front of Shiltz.</span> <span id="s649">That makes me a little easier and I said how do you want to talk to me?</span> <span id="s650">Mr. Shiltz said use my office.</span> <span id="s651">I thought they're wired and they're just going to just -- so he pried again and he said my mother saw you and she really almost fell in love with you.</span> <span id="s652">She made me come and meet you.</span> <span id="s653">I said, for what reason.</span> <span id="s654">Because I can help you.</span> <span id="s655">You see, I'm half Jewish, but I cannot tell them because I am with the ___________ and I said well I'm Polish so that doesn't go together, and I have a Polish boyfriend, and he said, well, he cannot help you, but I can.</span> <span id="s656">I said, well, maybe sometime in the future.</span> <span id="s657">He come once again, and I was in the hands of Mr. Shiltz who said you ought to go out with him.</span> <span id="s658">He never tried to do anything to me.</span> <span id="s659">He just said can my mother -- not he, can my mother buy you -- you will make her so happy.</span> <span id="s660">I said no I don't need anything.</span> <span id="s661">So, one day he came and he told Mr. Shiltz.</span> <span id="s662">He didn't ask me, but he asked Mr. Shiltz if he could take me overnight to -- he named her name, I remember only her name was Elli and she was in the ______________.</span> <span id="s663">I don't remember the street.</span> <span id="s664">She owned a shoe store and a most beautiful apartment and a very known husband of a ____________, and she was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s665">He asked Shiltz that he would like to take me for a date there to a party.</span> <span id="s666">Then I found out that she took over the Jewish families, the store, the shoe store and all his apartment with beautiful things, with paintings that maybe you see in Louvre, and a big bust of Adolph Hitler.</span> <span id="s667">Then came some other young soldiers that they came from Poland, SS men to the party, and Eric was there too.</span> <span id="s668">This young man who was maybe half drunk he was telling the group something that would amuse them.</span> <span id="s669">I just came from near Limberg where we tied each child to a branch of the tree and put it aflame.</span> <span id="s670">And he said, why don't you laugh.</span> <span id="s671">I don't know.</span> <span id="s672">I don't find it funny.</span> <span id="s673">They are human beings.</span> <span id="s674">But they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s675">I said, oh, not to get myself into trouble, and Eric looked at me and he said, well I have some plans to take __________ to show her a little bit around because she can not really go as a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s676">He must have seen something on my face, and I don't know if Ellie knew something or not, but she always felt that I'm her ___________.</span> <span id="s677">She took to me.</span> <span id="s678">One time she came to Shiltz, Heil Hitler, she wants to take me to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s679">Remember marching up those big headquarters, all those steps up with all those swastikas and I went there and she said could you say Heil Hitler and I said Ellie don't ask me to do that.</span> <span id="s680">I'm Polish.</span> <span id="s681">And she said, "I'll protect you."</span> <span id="s682">And she introduced me my ______________.</span> <span id="s683">But she didn't use Rutkofska.</span> <span id="s684">My _______________, so I didn't have to add that.</span> <span id="s685">Then when it was very bad and the Germans were really retreating and there was lots of being in the basement, shooting, and the Russians came in from the other side, she had to go to ___________ to run away, and she said __________ the only thing, stay in my apartment but be sure that you take care of the bust of Adolph Hitler.</span> <span id="s686">Well, that was the first thing that went through the window.</span> <span id="s687">Then I took all the people that I know, Polish, Jewish and asked them to come to the shoe store and take as many shoes as they can, and that was my revenge.</span> <span id="s688">At least to her.</span> <span id="s689">I never saw Eric or anyone.</span> <span id="s690">But you spoke about the rape, but when the Russians came into that part, which later on they retreat on the other side of the Danube, I was living with a family, a German family who were Ellie's friends.</span> <span id="s691">He was a piano player, blind, very nice family, and his wife was Maria.</span> <span id="s692">They took me, so when the officer of the Russians came, they caught me in that building and asked to bring it down.</span> <span id="s693">This person laying down on the table and he said, "I'm going to have intercourse with you."</span> <span id="s694">And somebody went quickly upstairs to I think his name was Paul, that blind man I lived with.</span> <span id="s695">I don't remember the last name, and he came blind with a stick and he said, let my sister go.</span> <span id="s696">That's how close I was to it.</span> <span id="s697">Just because he was blind, I think, that that's what really took that person back.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q.</span> <span id="s699">This was a Russian soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A.</span> <span id="s701">A Russian officer.</span> <span id="s702">Then I understand that many people in that building worried, and then we heard that the American soldiers came on that side and I came down walked on the street and there was an American soldier and I didn't speak English an I said American and he said yes.</span> <span id="s703">Name?</span> <span id="s704">And he said Orbanik.</span> <span id="s705">I said are you Polish?</span> <span id="s706">He said, yes, no speak it.</span> <span id="s707">Never even tried to find him, but then I don't know with that United Jewish restitution who came with the packages and everything like for the Jewish people or was it that ___________ what was that?</span> <span id="s708">Joint Distribution, that's what it was.</span> <span id="s709">So, I came.</span> <span id="s710">I didn't have any food, nothing too much, and I said, I'm Jewish and I would like to register and they said, but you don't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s711">I said, are we going to do in reverse now.</span> <span id="s712">Hitler thought I do, and you say I don't.</span> <span id="s713">He said, well, everybody would like to be Jewish to be a package.</span> <span id="s714">I said, that is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s715">Then there was near the river and there was not far away from the _______________, I was walking along and that person that they showed you, the picture ____________ she was much older than I. I remember only she was coming to a mutual relative, and she was walking with a man and didn't pay attention.</span> <span id="s716">I only heard her saying Oh, that girl looks like Sabina's daughter.</span> <span id="s717">My mother's name was Sabine.</span> <span id="s718">We turned around and she said, oh, maybe that is.</span> <span id="s719">So, I said, who are you.</span> <span id="s720">She said are you Ava or Ruzia?</span> <span id="s721">I said, that's my sister Ruzia, I'm Ava.</span> <span id="s722">She said I'm ___________ and I had to recall when I met her she had always that beautiful hair growing all round.</span> <span id="s723">She was the first one to tell me where my mother was hiding.</span> <span id="s724">She came across in another hiding place with my mom, but then she was very good financially off so she was able to go to a safer place and she never saw my mother again.</span> <span id="s725">So, she said, I hope you're getting food and I told her what happened.</span> <span id="s726">So, she said, ____________, it must be like some name, let me go with you to the joint distribution and let me be a witness and I have that paper if you want to say Anna ___________ and I forgot his first name.</span> <span id="s727">They married eventually.</span> <span id="s728">He was in film industry and they made a statement that I didn't know how to write -- read Jewish.</span> <span id="s729">They asked me to read that I am Jewish and I got a package with eggs and milk, and I broke out because I didn't have anything for so many years and to this day I cannot have eggs because I break out.</span> <span id="s730">I just can have egg beater when they came out.</span> <span id="s731">That's how it was that history.</span> <span id="s732">So after I didn't have to work anymore in Shiltz office, I start to enlist with __________ to somehow finish my education in the business administration and I met a Valerie.</span> <span id="s733">Her father was a veterinarian and we made very good friends, and that was still before they recognized me that I'm Jewish, because that happened in 1944, almost the war was over.</span> <span id="s734">No, no, no, that happened in 1946, after the war was already over.</span> <span id="s735">She invited me to her home to introduce me to her parents.</span> <span id="s736">They were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s737">They asked me to live with them.</span> <span id="s738">Then, in one Sunday dinner came Victor who was a dentist and he started to just ask me out.</span> <span id="s739">Polish, that's what they talked.</span> <span id="s740">They were very happy that we're going.</span> <span id="s741">They liked me, but they said that they were ____________.</span> <span id="s742">You know, when you lived in Prussia which was one time occupied by Germans.</span> <span id="s743">So, they had to go into Army, to the military of Germany, but you were no the SS were you?</span> <span id="s744">He said no.</span> <span id="s745">I fought not to go, but I had to serve.</span> <span id="s746">His father said, yes, we had to.</span> <span id="s747">I just bought it somehow.</span> <span id="s748">One time we went to the beach and on his arm was SS and I said to his parents that they like him very much, but I cannot go.</span> <span id="s749">That would be sacrilegious against my whole family.</span> <span id="s750">He cried, he said I didn't want to this way and that way, and her mother gave me a platinum chain, which I still have because I liked it.</span> <span id="s751">Then there was a Jewish doctor who is now in Chicago, Dr. Heller and his wife Ruthie and I told them that, and he said Ava, denounce them.</span> <span id="s752">I bet the whole practice is overthrown Jews.</span> <span id="s753">He was a Viennese.</span> <span id="s754">I start not to see him, but after when I start to inquire, my mother had a cousin that I know that he sent her sometimes five or ten dollars because my father and my mother helped him when he was a young man to come into a big city from a small little _______.</span> <span id="s755">I am still in touch with his daughter Sadelle, in New York.</span> <span id="s756">She's married to a banker.</span> <span id="s757">He tried to work with the restitution during this period.</span> <span id="s758">The papers started to be processed for me to come here.</span> <span id="s759">At that time I denounced Victor, that he's an SS and his practice should be taken away, and I liked him, but I felt I had to do it.</span> <span id="s760">I did it.</span> <span id="s761">He tried to find me, because he knew me as a Rutkofska.</span> <span id="s762">I saw him one time when I was with my husband, the only time in Vienna he was working and he turned around and I turned around but that's all what it was it.</span> <span id="s763">Never called, nothing.</span> <span id="s764">It was hard to live being somebody else.</span> <span id="s765">It's not easy and especially when I was not recognized.</span> <span id="s766">I had to go on for the longest time to pretend, otherwise I was no one.</span> <span id="s767">But then, I decided to go to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s768">I had to find Gaynosh.</span> <span id="s769">That was the whole purpose.</span> <span id="s770">So, I make myself wait to go to Czechoslovakia but I was _______________.</span> <span id="s771">I didn't belong anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q.</span> <span id="s773">What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A.</span> <span id="s775">That was after the war '45, must be '46 before I even knew that ________________ was going to stop me.</span> <span id="s776">I went because there was a purpose, and they arrest me.</span> <span id="s777">One time, once again, that Yugoslavian, or was he Czechoslovakian, he took me from one barrack to the other and he spotted me just like he helped me with that basket and he said ______________.</span> <span id="s778">He must have had pull, I still don't know what he did, and he said to them in the their language, which I didn't speak, that he knows me.</span> <span id="s779">Somehow they free me.</span> <span id="s780">I Never was able to find Sishka or Gaynosh because he said I want you to leave right now because they may arrest you and I cannot get you out.</span> <span id="s781">So, there was absolutely no way.</span> <span id="s782">Then I started to get in contact with the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s783">All the means that you can possibly think.</span> <span id="s784">When my husband, before he died went with me to Israel, I even went to ____________ made all the necessary information perhaps maybe they took the children to Israel, but to no avail, nothing.</span> <span id="s785">So, the nicest thing, Joan, what happened to me was I thought I would not turn to Judaism.</span> <span id="s786">That was my first thought.</span> <span id="s787">I thought if I ever have a family, I would not like them to go through what I went through just because you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s788">There was no other reason.</span> <span id="s789">As a matter fact, I went to Parochial schools.</span> <span id="s790">And I have in my family people who are today practicing Christianity, but then I knew a friend from Poland, and she was married to a doctor at the same hospital where my future husband now was working, which was the ________________ University Hospital in New York City, where my husband was at that time, the last year resident already in the specialty of Radiology.</span> <span id="s791">They invite me to play tennis with them.</span> <span id="s792">I never possessed my own racket because my mother couldn't afford.</span> <span id="s793">My cousin _______ was very well to do and she was tall 6 feet and from her clothing sometimes they made some dress for me, but we were always very close even though that she is closer to my sister's age, because I always told her the tricks when we came to visit her, as children.</span> <span id="s794">Her mother had governesses for her because nobody should blow on them and I always went _______.</span> <span id="s795">I was like Mitchell right now.</span> <span id="s796">Then, the family was not well to do but a very fine family of Milton Dorfman, and when I worked on Wall Street in the bank, at that time I interpreted German and Polish.</span> <span id="s797">I knew a little bit Russian, and the other girls were Polish and I at one time when Magda said why don't you come and her husband was _______________.</span> <span id="s798">Her son is one of the very known ___________ and he's in music that music that you and I possibly don't understand.</span> <span id="s799">However, he is also a radiologist in Sausolito California, and his father was the governor of Maine and he was a very good friend of Milt, and we played tennis and I said, oh he's so slow.</span> <span id="s800">He's not going to play good tennis.</span> <span id="s801">Well, he played tennis.</span> <span id="s802">I was jumping, but he played tennis.</span> <span id="s803">Then, what attracted me was that so many other people wanted to take me out to Waldorf Austoria or something and I was wondering what they would like to have in return for it, but Milt said we can have a hamburger or a hot dog and he always went like that because he was wearing a jacket from Maury, from his older brother.</span> <span id="s804">I just thought that's nice.</span> <span id="s805">Then I met him in 1948, very vaguely.</span> <span id="s806">That's what I wanted to tell you.</span> <span id="s807">Out of 35,000 people I was selected to be on a caravan of hope to bring my story and also there were two Israeli officers.</span> <span id="s808">I think I sent you a clipping, Joan, of it.</span> <span id="s809">At that time I spoke of it worse than I speak now.</span> <span id="s810">I had developed laryngitis and in our caravan of hope, we stopped in Utica, which is really near where I live since 1954 when I came with my husband at that time.</span> <span id="s811">The people were very nice.</span> <span id="s812">They tried to ____________.</span> <span id="s813">I never knew what that is, but they were very friendly and I spot that.</span> <span id="s814">That was in 1948, memories it was very hard to remember everything, and I even forgot that I was in Springfield.</span> <span id="s815">When I sent you the clippings I said I was looking for some papers, and by coincident I had the clippings from Springfield Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s816">Joan, if I wouldn't see my picture in that article, I cannot recall that I was in Springfield Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s817">No way.</span> <span id="s818">I remember I was in Syracuse University because over there they once again, pretty girl with blue eyes and I always thought I had green eyes, said now Ava Gardner will speak to us.</span> <span id="s819">Of course I don't know who is Ava Gardner.</span> <span id="s820">I didn't see any movies, and I waited and they started to laugh.</span> <span id="s821">It's me.</span> <span id="s822">So, right now, before I came here.</span> <span id="s823">I tried to contact the Utica Observer Dispatch, which is a newspaper, and they told me that if it's '48 or '49 it would be on microfilm in the public library, which I got the clipping that I showed you.</span> <span id="s824">Then I called the library and the University of Syracuse, and they send me a clipping which I showed you.</span> <span id="s825">They were one of the soldiers of the officers was the nephew of the President to the Israeli state of _______________, and the other one lost both legs because I think that was the time that Israel gained independence in 1948 or '49.</span> <span id="s826">So, at that time I went on the caravan of Hope and the other place that stayed out in my mind.</span> <span id="s827">I had always that same blouse that you have the picture.</span> <span id="s828">I did not acquire anything else, and we went to Atlanta.</span> <span id="s829">I don't remember Atlanta but I remember the hotel that we stayed.</span> <span id="s830">There was also a big philanthropist from Rochester ______________, who when we got married, put carpet in our house because he remember me from the Caravan of Hope.</span> <span id="s831">He still lives in Rochester.</span> <span id="s832">He's a great contributor to Israel.</span> <span id="s833">At that time I asked the elevator girl because that was the only category I could afford to have maybe what she wears.</span> <span id="s834">If after work she can take me and I can get another blouse because I still have to go further.</span> <span id="s835">She said I can't go with you.</span> <span id="s836">I said is it because I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s837">I said why.</span> <span id="s838">She said, because I cannot ride in the same bus that you are.</span> <span id="s839">I said why not?</span> <span id="s840">She said, because I'm black.</span> <span id="s841">At that time I think, I'd like to go back, because there couldn't be anything worse at the time to go from one oppression and find that I came to a country that is free and have that.</span> <span id="s842">Who's next I said to myself.</span> <span id="s843">That made a very big impression on me and that's how I know I was in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s844">But nothing of that sort happened in Springfield Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q.</span> <span id="s846">What was the Caravan of Hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A. Caravan of Hope was primary to bring to the attention what happened with the Jewish people and speaking about my ________________, my experiences and for the Israeli soldiers or officers to raise money for the UGA because a portion would be to save the children who came from Holocaust or other displaced families, and to raise money on all the stops.</span> <span id="s848">Then after I came from Caravan of Hope, my husband at that time was just courting me, asked me if we can see each other again.</span> <span id="s849">He's a very fine person, never never speaking about himself.</span> <span id="s850">That's when I met his doctor McKenzie and he was just in the last year of radiology, a resident, a doctor came in and he asked Doctor McKenzie to look over the pictures, the x-rays and he said whatever Doctor Dorfman will say, that is the diagnosis, which I highly thought of.</span> <span id="s851">He asked me to go to a dinner to his family.</span> <span id="s852">I told him, he asked me if eventually we can marry, and I said if your family wouldn't like me, I wouldn't marry you, because I really need a family.</span> <span id="s853">I meant it.</span> <span id="s854">So, we went there.</span> <span id="s855">It was a nice apartment.</span> <span id="s856">The father worked at 70 years of age because he was a self taught person to design dresses.</span> <span id="s857">They called him back at that age because he was so good, and he always said to Mama, you wear this dress funny when I come home.</span> <span id="s858">It was a wonderful family, but when I came there once again, long hair I heard her brother, Uncle Abe saying, nice girl, too bad she isn't Jewish.</span> <span id="s859">That followed me all the time.</span> <span id="s860">So, I opened the door, and I said, but she is.</span> <span id="s861">He was just so happy about it.</span> <span id="s862">Then in 1949, Christmas day, a Professor _____________, who still lives in New York City, who was the Chief of Radiology, lent us the car and we went to Atlantic City, which was so called.</span> <span id="s863">Then he took a position in Des Moines Iowa and that's where my both boys were born in a Methodist Hospital, and we had the circumcision right there in the hospital because the family was so far away that nobody came for it.</span> <span id="s864">Then, my husband really wanted to be closer to the family and at that time -- I enjoyed Des Moines.</span> <span id="s865">There was a beautiful synagogue, a Reform, and there was evening sermons were very nice and educational.</span> <span id="s866">They spoke about everything and about the Holocaust, but then he was offered a position in New York City, which he didn't want to be in a big city not to raise the children there.</span> <span id="s867">Then there was a position in Rome, New York.</span> <span id="s868">We didn't know that Rome was horrible at that time.</span> <span id="s869">I couldn't believe that I lived there.</span> <span id="s870">Then my cousin came from Paris she said this is a slow death.</span> <span id="s871">Why are you living here.</span> <span id="s872">We don't even have a movie.</span> <span id="s873">We have to travel 20 miles to a movie.</span> <span id="s874">But a close knit family, and if you are part of the society or the community then you grow closer.</span> <span id="s875">My husband was chosen among 14 other radiologist one of them Jerry Segal, who is in Utica right now, and is glad that he didn't take it, because there is very anti-semitic, a restricted golf club, and my husband never delved into what is going on, so when they proposed to him, he said fine I like to play golf but then when he found out that we would be the only ones, he felt very bad.</span> <span id="s876">Later we learned that three voices were against only because he was Jewish and the vice president of the ________________, Charlie Getty, who is a very good friend of ours, said I will have to resign.</span> <span id="s877">Because if we can't have a fine person like Milt, we should be lucky that he wants to join.</span> <span id="s878">This is how I joined the ____________ Club, which I was the only one but at that time Rabbi, who is now living in Maryland, Rabbi Weimer said maybe there will be opening.</span> <span id="s879">But they until today they think Milt is Jewish and I'm not.</span> <span id="s880">And Joan, I don't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s881">I feel that I'm still having problems with it because one time I was asked what I am and then when I was Jewish that was no good.</span> <span id="s882">When I was non-Jewish that was no good, so when they asked me I just said I believe that I do things other human beings and that is the greatest religion what you can do, serve the fellow man.</span> <span id="s883">So, lots of people think that I married Milt that he's Jewish, I'm not Jewish and I don't try one way or the other way to correct it.</span> <span id="s884">It's immaterial to me.</span> <span id="s885">Both my children were bar mitzvah, went to the Hebrew school, and Gary right now I have two sons.</span> <span id="s886">One is Gary, one is Mitchell.</span> <span id="s887">They are also two years apart.</span> <span id="s888">Both born in May.</span> <span id="s889">Gary is a professor of Radiology where he is lecturing at the Medical School at Brown and is chief of the department and that's also recently president of the Cardiovascular Society for the whole United States and spoke recently in Sweden.</span> <span id="s890">But above everything, very good son.</span> <span id="s891">Mitchell is in New York.</span> <span id="s892">He's with the New York State Mental Health and he is a psychologist.</span> <span id="s893">He got his masters and hopes one day to get his doctorate degree.</span> <span id="s894">However, once again tragedy struck and we have been married 39 years and children start to make preparation for our 40th wedding anniversary and on the fourth of July 1988, Gary and his family we pick them up at the Syracuse Airport with their little daughter who was 2 1/2 or three years old and we went to our house.</span> <span id="s895">We had a wonderful Saturday, that same day.</span> <span id="s896">I had some people for dessert in the evening, and my husband said, well it's late but we don't have to get up next morning, Sunday, so early.</span> <span id="s897">He never woke up.</span> <span id="s898">I found him sitting in his chair gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q. Ava you were talking about the loss of your husband and how important he was to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A. Well, he was not only a husband, he was a true friend and I didn't speak about my experiences but only with Milt.</span> <span id="s903">He was a very kind and understanding person.</span> <span id="s904">I know that the patients former patients of his are still saying when Doctor Dorfman was here they must have thrown away the mold, how the saying goes.</span> <span id="s905">There isn't a kinder person that you can feel like at home especially when you have radiology.</span> <span id="s906">You go into that big machine you need somebody.</span> <span id="s907">At night evidently I had very bad dreams and sometimes I'd say don't let them take me.</span> <span id="s908">I had to explain to him what I meant.</span> <span id="s909">But one time I think when Gary was around 17 or 18, he was just to graduate from high school, my husband was taken to the hospital with a heart attack.</span> <span id="s910">That was the only one.</span> <span id="s911">He was on very minimal medications and everything was wonderful.</span> <span id="s912">As a matter of fact, that fourth of July when the children came to visit us, Gary could not come very often because he is so busy.</span> <span id="s913">It was only because ten days later we were supposed to go to Alaska where I was taking a group of Senior citizens, and he and Doctor Brown who is on the picture with ________ with me and his wife were supposed to go together.</span> <span id="s914">Gary persuaded me that I should take the trip in that short time because I didn't sit shiva.</span> <span id="s915">There was only one night and they were laughing and making jokes, the man that supposed to get you out of --- I just couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s916">I just said no.</span> <span id="s917">Mitchell had to go back to work and Gary stayed with me and then went on the bus with me to Syracuse until he placed me on that plane.</span> <span id="s918">Of course I don't remember anything about Alaska.</span> <span id="s919">I cried and cried and Doctor Brown tried to give me some sedative and I'm anti-mediation so I just suffer without being calmed down.</span> <span id="s920">Every time they said you have to eat something and I didn't.</span> <span id="s921">That's the time I lost 17 pounds which I never regained.</span> <span id="s922">It was a shock, just a shock because we were together and on Sunday just to find him just --- I took his head and I said, we call each other babe, not Milt or Ava was not known and everybody called him -- my cousin writes letters "how is baby?"</span> <span id="s923">So, I said babe you can take and I stopped because he was cold, and the friend of ours who is the publisher of the paper he still says he remembers when I said "He's so cold, he's so cold."</span> <span id="s924">I was in shock.</span> <span id="s925">They didn't know if I'm going to get out, but they used to have a friendly poker game every Friday in the Sentinel which is our newspaper.</span> <span id="s926">When Milt died, they never resumed it.</span> <span id="s927">George Waters and Shirley said, George doesn't face anyone without Milt.</span> <span id="s928">He was very recognized professionally.</span> <span id="s929">He was president of the whole Society, not only locally but for the New York State.</span> <span id="s930">He was a very good ____________, was a wonderful husband and friend, and a wonderful father.</span> <span id="s931">When you read the clippings, which maybe I left you, he did volunteer radiology for the DDSO, which deals with the mental retardation and they provided a portrait of my husband.</span> <span id="s932">He looks exactly like the write up that Gary put for his obituary in the medical journal.</span> <span id="s933">It was a whole dedication with lots of friends invited and the mayor of our city, Carl Ilemberg said that he doesn't know in his history of serving everywhere he comes from Rochester that two people in the same family would be honored because there was the dedication and the whole radiology department and the DDSO is Doctor Milton Dorfman.</span> <span id="s934">And of course, as you know, I think I mentioned one time to you Joan initially when we spoke like a year ago, that when I saw the mistreating in the concentration camp of the elderly in particular no mercy, and I was so close to my grandfather and grandmother, I said to God, whoever he was at that time, that when I survived the concentration camp I will do something for the elderly and for the children, and I left you the write up.</span> <span id="s935">You'll see that I single handedly I was able to try to get _____________ and through singly handed just raise 45,000 as a third of the whole payment for the land for the building, and then Governor Rockefeller was then the governor and they asked me to speak about the aged.</span> <span id="s936">I don't know if you ever heard of Monsignor Faye.</span> <span id="s937">He said for every President, Kennedy, Johnson and then Nixon as a member on the Committee on the Aging in Washington to the President.</span> <span id="s938">I know Monsignor when he was Father Faye and when they called me for the Catholic charities in Utica that Rockefeller was going to speak, could I come and speak on the aged because I was sort of a pioneer in that area.</span> <span id="s939">I said not with Monsignor Faye.</span> <span id="s940">He's too knowledgeable and so I came and he met me in the White House.</span> <span id="s941">I was delegate to the White House conference on aging and I met him there.</span> <span id="s942">As a matter of fact, when we had the 25th anniversary of the Senior Citizen's Council and the movement in the room I called the __________ University where he is the President of the third world, and I said I would like to speak with Monsignor Faye, and he said who shall I say is calling, and I said he would not know me, but I would like to speak with me.</span> <span id="s943">So, he came to the telephone and he never said Monsignor, he said Father Faye and I said Monsignor you would not remember me he said "Hello Ava."</span> <span id="s944">He said it there was 400 people __________ which is a big beautiful place and he said how can we forget Ava.</span> <span id="s945">Then, just by the Senate and the Congress they proclaimed the whole day Ava Dorfman.</span> <span id="s946">I told Sheri Bolet who is the Congressman you have to give me at 8:00 in the evening the day is almost over.</span> <span id="s947">I hope -- the one thing I will say that God helped me to fulfill my promise, because I started just calling a meeting of the retirees from the manufacturing from cable and I'll call and ______________ and it grew to 3,200 where I was 17 years the president and that was the time when my children were 5 and 7.</span> <span id="s948">I drug them everywhere and every senior citizen was their grandma and grandpa.</span> <span id="s949">As a matter of fact, when I came one time to New York and Mitchell was already after college before he got his masters, I said, Marie will be coming, Mother don't let her call me Mitchey.</span> <span id="s950">Surely enough she did.</span> <span id="s951">But I didn't give up lots of times that they could have spent with the children, but I didn't play cards.</span> <span id="s952">I didn't go anywhere in the evening.</span> <span id="s953">I stayed at home.</span> <span id="s954">When they were in school and before they come to school we almost met because I tried to divide my time.</span> <span id="s955">At the beginning my husband was the chief of the Radiology at Rome Hospital and then opened his own practice, so he was very busy.</span> <span id="s956">As a matter of fact, my husband was very understanding and any honors that were bestowed on me I always felt that he had to have a better part in it because not many husbands would see that on Saturday and Sunday I cleaned the house and ironed because I didn't have the time to do it.</span> <span id="s957">There were others, United Way, Polio, Mother's March and for the children I established a speech therapy where the children from parochial schools and public schools and the deaf school were coming and raised the money to pay the speech therapist.</span> <span id="s958">But it comes back to you.</span> <span id="s959">One time my car was stolen and I had to call the Triple A and Mr. _____________ came and said Mrs. Dorfman we'll have to take that car to the shop and recharge the battery.</span> <span id="s960">I said how will I get there.</span> <span id="s961">Oh, I'll get a ride.</span> <span id="s962">I'll come there.</span> <span id="s963">It was more than the Triple A pays and I aid how much I owe you.</span> <span id="s964">He says nothing.</span> <span id="s965">He shows me a picture, like a newspaper picture of a girl and he said you paid a lot.</span> <span id="s966">I said, how did I. Jackie was in your speech therapy and she was stuttering and having a clef palate and you sent her to Kim Janet in Hunter New York.</span> <span id="s967">You have done wonders because she is now graduating from college.</span> <span id="s968">So, there is you don't ask for rewards but whatever you do good to people it comes back and I feel if my children, and I see them living by that example, and when I sometimes used to say to Gary how come you're getting so late for dinner.</span> <span id="s969">Well, mother it would make you feel good.</span> <span id="s970">I went to the ward where they are really forgotten elderly people and I just thought I'd see what they are doing.</span> <span id="s971">I was happy.</span> <span id="s972">I was happy.</span> <span id="s973">My husband was also very active.</span> <span id="s974">He was the first chairman, president of the _____________.</span> <span id="s975">He tried to be active, and most of all was very kind to the human race, and that is very important.</span> <span id="s976">His parents, when they printed the invitation for our wedding, they said the wedding of our children, the wedding of our children and my father -- which I called him papa, was very nice when the neighbors asked him how is your daughter-in-law and he said I don't have daughter-in-law, I have a daughter.</span> <span id="s977">So, but now that Milt is gone, I'm taking a candle and going to the Temple when I get the announcement that there is the ___________ and I feel that they were close to me.</span> <span id="s978">There is still one sister, Blanche.</span> <span id="s979">Her husband was a doctor in New York City and he died of cancer.</span> <span id="s980">I do come together.</span> <span id="s981">She came to the funeral.</span> <span id="s982">And another son, another brother died so it's really Blanche only who is alive.</span> <span id="s983">I don't know what to tell you else.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q. I have just a couple of questions from before.</span> <span id="s985">You mentioned that there was a particular roll call at the Yunaski camp with this little child?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s987">You see in the summer time when they called us out again sitting on that hot summer day, they put buckets of water just for us to see but not to give us.</span> <span id="s988">We were so dry we couldn't get anything.</span> <span id="s989">But they brought more people in from different areas and among them was a child who was just crawling and the child doesn't know anything so she or he crawled to that bucket and put his hands in and that SS or Gestapo, they're all the same, had a whip with leather fringes, and he kicked the child -- no kicked the bucket and the water just was out and I said, now that you've had your fun, can have the child have some water.</span> <span id="s990">He once again thought that that was very brave and Jews wouldn't do that.</span> <span id="s991">Am I not Jewish and I said no, I'm not.</span> <span id="s992">However, they put the other bucket and the child crawled again and he kicked the child in such a way that we couldn't even look around because we couldn't turn our heads.</span> <span id="s993">Then he came and struck me over my face and I had a big scar here.</span> <span id="s994">Now, I had the surgery I never know but everything happened on that side.</span> <span id="s995">It was not the strap but what he did.</span> <span id="s996">That is what I would always remember.</span> <span id="s997">There were many other incidents too numerous to mention.</span> <span id="s998">I mean the hanging of the people or putting dogs, vicious dogs and seeing the flesh taking of the people.</span> <span id="s999">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1000">It was 20th century and the German people were supposed to be so civilized.</span> <span id="s1001">Where is the civilization taking us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q.</span> <span id="s1003">One last story.</span> <span id="s1004">When you were waiting to come to this country, you were waiting for a ship called the Lillymarlane?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A. From _____________.</span> <span id="s1006">At that time there was a strike an they could not move the boat at that time from Brenehauffer and other friend who came together at that time, Anna Novak, her husband was an attorney and he passed away and she married a Doctor Heller, not the same Heller, and he's with the Northwestern Medical School.</span> <span id="s1007">So is her son in the same place, and Henry her husband then said -- no they came and told us we have to clean the toilets because that's where our buildings, our bunk beds because I remember that Anna and Henry were there, I was here.</span> <span id="s1008">They came and once again Germans clean the toilets and Henry went.</span> <span id="s1009">He was an attorney.</span> <span id="s1010">He went and cleaned for Anna too.</span> <span id="s1011">I said I wouldn't do that, and the German looked at me and said yes you would and I said No I won't.</span> <span id="s1012">Henry pleaded with me in Polish, you are so close to a new life, don't be stubborn, go clean.</span> <span id="s1013">I wouldn't.</span> <span id="s1014">I just wouldn't.</span> <span id="s1015">So, they took me to an office where there was other military person just with a shirt not with that straps and I told him that I had to succumb to anything they wanted.</span> <span id="s1016">After the war I don't feel like I want to do that.</span> <span id="s1017">He said, he looked at me, he sat there and looked at me and he said but don't you want to go to America and start a new life.</span> <span id="s1018">I said yes, but that doesn't mean that i have to clean the toilets.</span> <span id="s1019">He said I'm from Austria.</span> <span id="s1020">They were not very much better, but I told him that I lived there and he said, well, why don't you don that for me.</span> <span id="s1021">I said I wouldn't do that for you.</span> <span id="s1022">I wouldn't do it for me.</span> <span id="s1023">He said, well it seems like you are determined.</span> <span id="s1024">I will tell them that I have a different job for you.</span> <span id="s1025">I don't know what I did and Henry said she won once again.</span> <span id="s1026">Well, won or not won, it was degrading to me after the war that they had to do once again that dirty job.</span> <span id="s1027">But, as they said when I came here it was not so easy neither because the cousin of my mother had an aunt from his wife's side.</span> <span id="s1028">We never knew and he was on vacation when I came.</span> <span id="s1029">He came in July and he was with the children Sadell and Julius and he asked me to be with that aunt.</span> <span id="s1030">Very uneducated and she had a daughter Molly and Molly came in and asked me how the dress looks on her.</span> <span id="s1031">I was always ____________ and I said not so good.</span> <span id="s1032">They didn't know that in the United States you always say oh nice lovely and she felt that that was very offensive to her.</span> <span id="s1033">At one point she said, _____________ hatred did not do that to the Jews in the United States so it must have been that God wanted it this way.</span> <span id="s1034">Well, that was the end.</span> <span id="s1035">I just took my things and found out that the Doctor Heller from Vienna and Rudy were in the United States, and then they asked me come and live with them.</span> <span id="s1036">From there when I started to work at Wall Street with the Polish bank I lived with a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s1037">That's what I want to tell you about, Ann Remler, Zigmund's sister.</span> <span id="s1038">I lived on Ocean Avenue and I wore, -- I don't remember her husband's name but she was Sophie and they were very nice.</span> <span id="s1039">They had two boys and friends came and played.</span> <span id="s1040">At that time I made a promise to my sister's father --in-law.</span> <span id="s1041">He had a daughter who studied medicine in Vienna and I only know that she married an American medical student.</span> <span id="s1042">I know that she was Anna Silver, but I didn't know who she married.</span> <span id="s1043">So when I was -- that was before I married my husband, but we were seeing each other.</span> <span id="s1044">I went to the New York Times and spoke to a then reporter who was very known, Charlie Grutzner, told him that I'm looking for Anna Sabol who married an American, at that time student and they're married and they live right here.</span> <span id="s1045">They are in psychiatry maybe.</span> <span id="s1046">So, in Bellview Hospital some other doctor said, Anna I think they are searching for you.</span> <span id="s1047">She said maybe they're somebody crazy from Bellview and they found out my name, but they came to the restitution office and we met.</span> <span id="s1048">They were both psychiatrists and their two sons came to that people that I lived there.</span> <span id="s1049">That's why I remember there was a Time Magazine and they had an article just around the corner because they lived just around the corner.</span> <span id="s1050">She asked me that she's very sorry that she would like to help me, to give me anything they wanted and I said no.</span> <span id="s1051">You could have saved your family and maybe us, but you asked Zigmund only to come and leave Ruzia and her little boy alone and your family said Shiva and tore his garment and he wants you to know that.</span> <span id="s1052">Then she called my sister-in-law Blanche how she can get me.</span> <span id="s1053">They tried very hard then I married and I said I don't want anything from them.</span> <span id="s1054">But one time I was maybe, a year ago, that's how I find ____________ I said to Mitchell in New York City, you know I wonder if she is still alive because she had a practice and this is the time that we found in the telephone book ____________.</span> <span id="s1055">I said it doesn't say Doctor, so he said well why don't you call and ask, so he called and he spoke and they said yes, which Remler and he said Doctor Remler and he said who you are and he said I'll let you speak to my mother and that proved to me he was the brother of Doctor Remler, of her husband and I understand that he was killed in an accident with his younger son and Anna since then has passed away, but they have a son who is in William and Mary, a Professor and one is a surgeon in California somewhere but I called that William and Mary and he told me that do you know that brother of Zigmund Hiney is in Los Vegas.</span> <span id="s1056">So, see what happens after 50 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q.</span> <span id="s1058">You recently told, and we'll do this shortly, your son Gary about your first marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A. Gary visited me by himself without the family.</span> <span id="s1060">I don't know how the conversation went, but I didn't see too much of his daughter and I thought that Vicki herself could come sometime but she's typical New England, very reserved and she doesn't feel comfortable to come without him, and I said just to hold her in my arms and that's what brought out and I told him.</span> <span id="s1061">I as a mother sense that it made adverse impression on him.</span> <span id="s1062">Why didn't you tell us.</span> <span id="s1063">I said that was a decision between Daddy and I and I was only married seven months.</span> <span id="s1064">I don't even know if I was married.</span> <span id="s1065">It didn't make any impression.</span> <span id="s1066">I didn't even have time to adjust myself.</span> <span id="s1067">The child also, three months, I just didn't and I thought you should know.</span> <span id="s1068">I always thought I was the first born.</span> <span id="s1069">I said you are of a lasting marriage of 39 years Gary and I spent so much time with you in sickness and in happiness and he said are you going to tell Mitchell.</span> <span id="s1070">I said, with time, with time, when it's going to be the proper time.</span> <span id="s1071">And I think I will do when I visit Mitchell at the end of this month as I'm going to the Survivors of the Holocaust they are having gathering in New York City.</span> <span id="s1072">It's not going to be easy, and this is why maybe a whole year that you are trying to make contact, I didn't want to say something that it's not accurate, and it will take me a long time to return to be half normal.</span> <span id="s1073">I cannot ever be normal life.</span> <span id="s1074">In the beginning we didn't have too much, but then we're comfortable, and I still would not spend on me to buy a suit unless I'm pressed to it, but I would donate $5,000 to a cause if it would be for a good reason.</span> <span id="s1075">It's hard when you eat dinner and remember my sister saying that she's hungry.</span> <span id="s1076">You don't forget that.</span> <span id="s1077">You can keep on the bottom somewhere in your memory but it stays with you.</span> <span id="s1078">Any my mother now that I'm definitely over 42 and I realize that 42 is very young, it's a young life and Ruzia never fulfilled her dreams neither and my uncles and aunts.</span> <span id="s1079">I lost 58 with the immediate family not counting farther relatives.</span> <span id="s1080">_____________ lost her father even he obtained papers and went to practice in Warsaw as a Doctor Wosinski.</span> <span id="s1081">It didn't help them.</span> <span id="s1082">Her brother Karl, a medical student, handsome as can be, shot on the street.</span> <span id="s1083">Where do you draw the line.</span> <span id="s1084">My other aunt who was married to Doctor _____________.</span> <span id="s1085">He was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1086">And his daughter who was so pretty, all vanished.</span> <span id="s1087">________________ all those people.</span> <span id="s1088">They're just remnants of my memory but not people.</span> <span id="s1089">I don't think that I to the very last day of my life will ever overcome through it the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1090">But, as my son called me yesterday, "Mother, do it.</span> <span id="s1091">Tell the one that doesn't know everything.</span> <span id="s1092">Do it.</span> <span id="s1093">Tell them everything.</span> <span id="s1094">Do it for us, the younger generation that they cannot forget it.</span> <span id="s1095">That is should not happen again."</span> <span id="s1096">Wouldn't it?</span> <span id="s1097">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1098">I am still scared.</span> <span id="s1099">When I read and I do get _______________ and the Jewish publication and see what's going on on the campuses, what's going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s1100">As a matter of fact the orthopedist that I tried to find out a day that the Germany invade Poland told me that he was to a meeting in Norway and an orthopedist doctor in Norway why you Americans so scared of Russians.</span> <span id="s1101">Why aren't you scared of Germans.</span> <span id="s1102">I was taken then to an underground you would not believe how much ammunition is there and how they greet each other.</span> <span id="s1103">I said Andy, how heil Hitler so lots of things are going on and people for sure are not more sympathetic than the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q. Well, Ava, thank you.</span> <span id="s1105">I know how hard this was for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A. I had to do it.</span> <span id="s1107">Thank you for asking me, because I never will come on my own will.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">End of Tape 3 Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q. Ava, we have a few pictures, if you could please identify?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A.</span> <span id="s1111">This is my mother.</span> <span id="s1112">Her first name was Sabina Muller.</span> <span id="s1113">She was very beautiful and I lost her when she was 42 years of age, but that was before the war taken and given to me by an aunt from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1114">I didn't have any pictures.</span> <span id="s1115">This is a picture that I believe it was taken while I was registering as a Polish girl to work in Vienna because that blouse was given to me by a friend of mine, Wanda and that's the blouse that sustained me through the whole time during my working days in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1116">That is a picture that I think was taken while I was still working for that _______________ in Vienna because it's the same blouse.</span> <span id="s1117">I hope that after the war I hope I acquire other blouse.</span> <span id="s1118">I'm not sure even.</span> <span id="s1119">This picture would be really the first one, because after the war I was so eager to finish my education and there was the Academia ____________ and they took the picture.</span> <span id="s1120">Still the same famous blouse and I would say that that would be the first one.</span> <span id="s1121">If they came relatively in shorter time, it must be at that time taken.</span> <span id="s1122">I came to Vienna in '43.</span> <span id="s1123">The war was over in '45, so it had to be at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q.</span> <span id="s1125">This is the name that you took?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A.</span> <span id="s1127">That Rutkofska.</span> <span id="s1128">Yes.</span> <span id="s1129">I think does it say Stephanie there or maybe not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q. Ava.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A. Ava Rutkofsak.</span> <span id="s1132">Well, maybe I dropped the Stephanie but in my papers I have Stephanie whoever she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q. Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A.
