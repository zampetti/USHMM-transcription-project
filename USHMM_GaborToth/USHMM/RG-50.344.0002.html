id="s123">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s124">They used to -- well, [indecipherable] they delivered babies and held them up and killed them in front of the mothers.</span> <span id="s125">They would maybe cut off a leg for practice and we got some of those to take care of.</span> <span id="s126">But mostly they were nothing but skin and bones.</span> <span id="s127">There wasn’t too much to do, surgically for them.</span> <span id="s128">We didn’t have too much to do there.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s130">Were you able to talk with those people who had been --</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: No.</span> <span id="s132">See, the girls were out in the wards, I wasn’t on the wards, I was in the operating room, so I really didn’t get to talk to the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s134">How did you know what had happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Well, from things we heard.</span> <span id="s136">Mostly from the men that worked in the offices and some that worked up at Mauthausen where the POW’s were -- our -- not our POW’s, the Germans, the SS troopers and that type of thing, from them -- the stories we got from.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: What was a typical day like for you there?</span> <span id="s138">That was in June of ‘45?</span> <span id="s139">Or May of ‘45?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: May of ‘45, yeah, May and June.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: You arrived shortly -- in early May, am -- am I right about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: You know, I can’t remember the dates.</span> <span id="s143">We went to Germany first.</span> <span id="s144">Then the men -- after the war ended, the men -- the officers and enlisted personnel went over to Camp Gusen and liberated it and we were a couple of weeks later before that -- we went over.</span> <span id="s145">They didn’t want us at first.</span> <span id="s146">So it was a voluntary thing whether you wanted to go or didn’t want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Was it much of a choice for you?</span> <span id="s148">Did you have any --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No, we all said yes, we’d go.</span> <span id="s150">There wasn’t any -- I don’t think -- nobody backed out, everybody went.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: And what would a typical day

for bugs and --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yeah, every day when you got there you’d get sprayed.</span> <span id="s158">Down your pants, up your shirts, down your shirts, every place they sprayed you so you wouldn’t get any fleas or bugs or what have you.</span> <span id="s159">In the operating room, repairing things that they had done to the people.</span> <span id="s160">That type of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s162">Long days, were they long days?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: I don’t think

house.</span> <span id="s168">Was three or four houses, everybody was split -- split up into a different house.</span> <span id="s169">And we lived there.</span> <span id="s170">We ate in the mess hall.</span> <span id="s171">And we met a lot of nice people, made a lot of nice friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: What was it like for you women in the evenings?</span> <span id="s173">What would you talk about, what would you -- you’d already been to Africa, but a lot of the women had never --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: No, they hadn’t -- that was their first trip,

discharged?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Oh, December 12th, ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: That was the official date, but we left in September, because we were in Camp Polk, Louisiana and we were discharged there.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Did you spend the whole summer in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Yeah, we got back in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Were you at Mauthausen the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: No, when we first went in, we went over to England.</span> <span id="s185">We went to France.</span> <span id="s186">We went to Germany.</span> <span id="s187">And we went to Austria.</span> <span id="s188">Then we went to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: We had a -- a tent hospital in Austria before we moved to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s192">Yo -- Mauthausen, you mean by the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s194">No, Gusen.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Oh, Gusen.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: There’s two, Gusen and Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: They were very close together.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s200">And you worked at both?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: No, Gusen.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Oh, only Gusen?</span> <span id="s203">Oh, I’m confused then, I thought you were at Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: No, maut -- well, as I remember Mauthausen was only where the -- there was an inf-infantry group that was in there, men, and they had the prisoners there.</span> <span id="s205">I don’t think there was a hospital up there.</span> <span id="s206">I don’t remember it if there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: And were they bringing then the survivors, the patients who’d been in Mauthausen, were they bringing them down to where you were in Gusen?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: No.</span> <span id="s209">I don’t remember a camp -- as -- the DP’s, what have you?</span> <span id="s210">No, that’s displaced person.</span> <span id="s211">But I don’t remember them bringing anybody down.</span> <span id="s212">If they did, I don’t remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s214">So the people that you were caring for had all been at Gusen?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: And what -- what became of those people over time?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: I don’t know, cause they were still there when we left.</span> <span id="s218">Cause when we went in -- when the men went in, the Germans had released them and they were out in the fields and they had to go get them and bring them back.</span> <span id="s219">Because I remember they were digging in the fields and ate raw potatoes and it made them deathly ill, because they weren’t used to eating.</span> <span id="s220">And when they did feed them, they’d always save part of it under their pillow, for fear they wouldn’t get anything any more.</span> <span id="s221">And there was some musicians there and they used to play at mealtime, up on the stage, the ones that were able to play while we ate.</span> <span id="s222">But I don’t remember eating in that dining room.</span> <span id="s223">We were talking about a lot of things.</span> <span id="s224">I remember that I -- remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Di -- Were you ever able to have conversations with those people at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: No.</span> <span id="s227">I never did, no.</span> <span id="s228">Cause see, the operating room was here and we looked out the window and was -- the mess hall was there.</span> <span id="s229">I did go around in some of the wards to see the people, and never talked with any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s231">And y -- and there were only men there?</span> <span id="s232">You didn’t see women and children?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Yeah, there was women there.</span> <span id="s234">I didn’t see any children, yeah.</span> <span id="s235">Cause we -- I operated on women.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Because you what?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: We operated on some of the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Oh, you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s241">And they were in -- they had suffered the same kinds of things?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s243">They tell you there was a -- nearby there was a munitions factory, in the mountain, inside the mountain.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Want to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Where they burned the bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: -- the layout.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did you see it happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No.</span> <span id="s250">And there was -- the chaplain and his assistant doing all the burials you know, and they had big, long trenches with bodies in long, long lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: And they were doing that the whole time you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: See, a lot of them died at first.</span> <span id="s255">As a matter of fact, you couldn’t tell the live ones from the dead ones, they looked -- that’s how bad they looked.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No.</span> <span id="s257">I hadn’t.</span> <span id="s258">They just said we were going to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s259">The colonel said, “You can go or you don’t have to go.</span> <span id="s260">It’s up to you, whatever you want to do.”</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Did he tell you what it was going to be like?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: If he did I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: What was -- were you shocked when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s265">When you don’t know the difference between a live person and a dead one, it’s pretty awful.</span> <span id="s266">Grisly.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: When you got out of the service, what -- and in your later life, what -- what do you think has been the impact of that experience on your life or --</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: An American guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: And that, you know, that disturbed me a little.</span> <span id="s270">They had to hold me in my seat, because I was ready to get up and punch the person, but -- and then even now, you hear people say it didn’t happen, but it did.</span> <span id="s271">Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Do you have family members [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Do they ask --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: I have one son in the Air Force and one son in the Army.</span> <span id="s276">And one son is in -- working for Uncle Sam as a park ranger.</span> <span id="s277">He was in the Air Force in Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Well, they’ve seen my pictures and what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: You took a lot of pictures while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: I had a lot, real lot and somebody said, “Well I’ll print them for you, I’ll have them cop -- printed for you.”</span> <span id="s281">I never saw them.</span> <span id="s282">I lost about six rolls of 36 -- 35 millimeter film.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Before you got back?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s285">When we -- I had to go on an inspection trip in -- in France while they were setting up the hospital, getting things going, I went on an inspection trip with two or three other officers.</span> <span id="s286">And I took a lot of pictures then, all through Germany, all the devastation that was on.</span> <span id="s287">That was before the war was over.</span> <span id="s288">As a matter of fact, I was in the hospital in -- in Brussels, what was the name of the place?</span> <span id="s289">Can’t remember now, but I’m sitting down to eat in this dining room.</span> <span id="s290">Woman next to me said, “Aren’t you Margaret Wood?”</span> <span id="s291">“Yes.”</span> <span id="s292">She was one of my teachers in school.</span> <span id="s293">She was a Red Cross worker.</span> <span id="s294">Another time in France, walking down the street, a boy I went to school with was there.</span> <span id="s295">Twice I ran into people in -- three times, once in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: When you look back on that experience, was it a good experience or a hard experience, or how do you characterize it?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: What was good about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: The things you saw, the people you met, the things you did, your experiences, your friends.</span> <span id="s299">We’ve all been back and forth for years, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: You’ve kept in touch with a lot of the women that you served with?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s302">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s304">When you say the -- the things you saw, s -- one of the good things about your experience was the things you saw.</span> <span id="s305">What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Maybe other cultures and the way other people live and the things that we have that they don’t have.</span> <span id="s307">That type of thing.</span> <span id="s308">The beautiful buildings that were left, the beautiful cathedrals that you saw.</span> <span id="s309">I remember going to mass and -- this was back in Africa.</span> <span id="s310">We went in to mass and we sat down, but you don’t do that, because everybody has their own pew, their own chair.</span> <span id="s311">They bring their own chair and their own kn-kneeling benches, so were sitting in somebody else’s seat [indecipherable] sort of.</span> <span id="s312">It wasn’t the same in England.</span> <span id="s313">I don’t remember going to church in any place else except for -- we went in churches and saw the cathedrals -- some of the cathedrals and things.</span> <span
