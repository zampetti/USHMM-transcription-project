share.</span> <span id="s15">As I explained a little earlier, we start our interviews from the very beginning.</span> <span id="s16">We’d like to learn a little bit about your pre-war life, your family, the world you were born into, and so on.</span> <span id="s17">So I’ll start with the very basic questions.</span> <span id="s18">Could you tell me the date you were born, your name at birth,

know what that is and where that is, others will not know.</span> <span id="s28">Can you tell us a little bit about the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Białystok was the center city for the county of Białostocka(ph) Voivoidsfa(ph).</span> <span id="s30">Voivoidsfa(ph) Białostotsky(ph), that’s come from Białystok.</span> <span id="s31">There was one hospital at that time.</span> <span id="s32">I lived, for the first year, somewhere on the ci – in the city.</span> <span id="s33">And when I was a year, or a year and a half, we moved to the part close to Pałac Branitsky, is Palace of Branitsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: And where’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: I-In there, on part, they were divided, so there was a fence between the one park and the other.</span> <span id="s36">One was the school, which was just ordinary school with the school for the teachers.</span> <span id="s37">The other was the ci-city of Białystok where – where magistrat(ph) is.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Was municipal authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: And at that part there was also a big lake where we used to slide during the night – du-during the winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: So it would be frozen over?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Why we moved to that part, which was the school, because my mother was a teacher.</span> <span id="s44">Both of my parents has only education up to the matriculation.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: What does that mean, matriculation?</span> <span id="s46">High school, or some college?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Twelve.</span> <span id="s48">High school, high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: High school.</span> <span id="s50">Gymnasium, and so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: They didn’t have anything farther than that.</span> <span id="s52">So my mother was specialized in teaching the teachers, and because of that, she was teaching e-even in high school, the 10th and 11th – well, 13 grade.</span> <span id="s53">At that time the teacher, after 12 of the 13 grade.</span> <span id="s54">Otherwise, she has only the right to teach up to the ninth – sixth grade, sorry.</span> <span id="s55">The school was divided six grades, four grades and two top, and then you have the high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: So your mother was a teacher.</span> <span id="s57">Was your father also a teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No.</span> <span id="s59">He was the – they met in Wejherowa, it’s close to the sea.</span> <span id="s60">She was a teacher and he wanted to be the soldier.</span> <span id="s61">And she convinced him to leave the army.</span> <span id="s62">I have no idea what happened during the war on 20 for my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: In 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Because he – in 1920, he was 22.</span> <span id="s65">So most likely he was in the army.</span> <span id="s66">They never talk about that.</span> <span id="s67">The only thing my mother convince him to leave the army.</span> <span id="s68">And because he was in the army before, he was the army reserve.</span> <span id="s69">So from time to time he had to go and learn a bit more for a week or two.</span> <span id="s70">Otherwise, he was a clerk.</span> <span id="s71">A – most likely he was an accountant.</span> <span id="s72">I didn’t know much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: And we lived in the buildings close to the palace.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: What’s a powets?</span> <span id="s76">What’s a powets?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Palace.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Palace, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s80">The buildings were built – when I visit after the war, the walls were most likely close to a meter wide.</span> <span id="s81">So it was always warm, but of course for the restroom we would have to go – share it with two other families and go downstairs somewhere.</span> <span id="s82">There was no hot water, and things like that, because the building at that time was already 150 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: How was it that you lived in this palace?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Because my mother was teaching in the school.</span> <span id="s85">So we –</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: And the school was located in the palace?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s89">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Oh, part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s92">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: And in the – there was a beautiful park, there were tennis courts, which are very, very expensive, but I was not athletic.</span> <span id="s94">My brother, four years older than I am, was in tennis and swimming and everything.</span> <span id="s95">In Białystok there wasn’t – there was a river, but the river whose – which smells very, very badly, because Białystok is a town of industry for clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Textiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: And every – textile.</span> <span id="s98">And everything went into that river, and vo – very small river.</span> <span id="s99">It used to be called Białka(ph).</span> <span id="s100">Right now they call it Biały Rzeka – Rzeka Biały, which means White River.</span> <span id="s101">It was really nothing, it was smelly always, not transparent, but no – nor – no animals, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: So it’s polluted.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Enormously polluted.</span> <span id="s104">You can’t imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Even before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Before the war.</span> <span id="s107">They were going to put it into underground.</span> <span id="s108">What they did afterwards, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s109">I visited Białystok only once from this country, and it was completely different.</span> <span id="s110">Before the war, it was 104,000 people.</span> <span id="s111">And apparently half of the population was Jewish.</span> <span id="s112">I thought it only about a third.</span> <span id="s113">Part of the poorest part was Jewish, and they were all – also little shacks where they were selling every – food and everything, so we would go there.</span> <span id="s114">And I’m sure that it was completely burned while eur – when the Jewish people were fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: I see, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: But I wasn’t there at that time.</span> <span id="s117">Why I say about my father and about the – his experience, because when the war started, he had to go to the army, and with his army, he was going back, back, back –</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Wait, excuse me, I’m going to interrupt.</span> <span id="s119">We’ll come to that point.</span> <span id="s120">I’d like to leave the – the stories and the experiences about World War II to the side right now, and concentrate on – on what – what was life like pre-war.</span> <span id="s121">And I have a few questions already from what you were telling me, and they’re factual kinds of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: One thing also.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: My mother had a servant –</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: – who was taking care of me, and cooking, because she was a teacher.</span> <span id="s127">But she was paying a lot.</span> <span id="s128">It we – the servant lived with us, and she was paying 25 złoty.</span> <span id="s129">If you could somehow – I think that her monthly was 200, or something like that, her moth – my mother’s.</span> <span id="s130">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Your monthly – your mother’s monthly salary was 200 złoty?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: I think so, but I am not sure.</span> <span id="s133">I know that she was paying not 20, but 25 złoty to the servant.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Per week or per month?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: For a month.</span> <span id="s136">For a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: And most of the servants had very little education.</span> <span id="s139">For one, her daughter was somewhere, and I was writing the letter, which she was – so, she was completely – couldn’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: So she was not literate.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Not – not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: So you would write letters for her to her daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: And so, that I know.</span> <span id="s146">We lived in a convertible place.</span> <span id="s147">My father, my mother, my brother, four years older, I and the servant.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Can I in-interrupt right here then?</span> <span id="s149">Your brother – if you are born in 1927, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: He was born in ’23.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: In 1923, okay.</span> <span id="s152">And his name was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Antonyen(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Antonyen(ph) Mikowychuk(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: And your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: She was from mai – her maiden name was Czynska(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Czynska(ph).</span> <span id="s159">And her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Selena(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Selena(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: One name only.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s164">And

yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: She was not?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: My father was from Warsaw, and my mother from Przemyśl.</span> <span id="s171">Well, Warsaw is west of Białystok, and Przemyśl is south.</span> <span id="s172">And I can tell you this story of my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Oh please, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: That’s a most likely true story, completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: And the time is in 1683.</span> <span id="s177">Vienna was defending, and they ask king of Poland to – to c-come and rescue, and Vienna was defended.</span> <span id="s178">That was very important in the history of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: You mean when there was the Ottoman Empire, or the Turkish [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Forces were –</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: And at that time, the king would conduct a fight from the hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: And once a day, he was standing on the top of the hill, and there was a Turk coming on his horse.</span> <span id="s185">And the boy who was at the – we – they bring all the food and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Who was bringing the food, I mean, I guess just the – a – a – a young boy who’s been –</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Young boy.</span> <span id="s188">And he saw that Turk coming, and he killed him.</span> <span id="s189">For that act – czyn in Polish, he was named Czynski(ph), and the king ga-gave him somewhere – right now it’s Ukraine, Humanya(ph).</span> <span id="s190">He gave him a big place.</span> <span id="s191">And of course, he gave him – he was a nobleman, made a nobleman for that czyn.</span> <span id="s192">And he was Czynski(ph).</span> <span id="s193">My mother is –</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Czynska(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: – ma – was Czynska(ph) from that.</span> <span id="s196">But the leet – that – that young boy was Jewish.</span> <span id="s197">And to be a nobleman he cannot be Jewish, he had to be Catholic.</span> <span id="s198">And because of that his mother – most likely they were poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: And he was given a lot of land and being a nobleman for always, and she didn’t like it, chan-changing her allegiance, no.</span> <span id="s201">So she curse him and – up to 11th generation.</span> <span id="s202">I’m his 11th gener-generation.</span> <span id="s203">So what – I have one in 2000 drop of Jewish blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: But I really respect her, that being from poor to – and this is most likely completely true story.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Well, you know what is also interesting is that it is a story that was passed down through those 11 generations, to you.</span> <span id="s207">That is, it’s something that stayed within the family –</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: – as – as – as a story of how – so did your mother come from nobility?</span> <span id="s210">Could you say that she was born in –</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Well, in Poland there is a custom that if a father had three sons or 10 sons, his property is divided equally, except if somebody goes to priesthood.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: So they were pushing boys to priesthood so they would – and because of that, the noble people were sometimes have the piece of land just as m-much as the peasant.</span> <span id="s214">And the story, but I don’t know, it was mo – most likely my grandfather – Poland was taken by Russia and – and so on, three times.</span> <span id="s215">And once, my grandfather as a baby, was carried through the border in a wash basket.</span> <span id="s216">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: From Russia into –</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: – then they didn’t have – from Humanya(ph), which was Poland –</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: – and right now is Ukraine, middle of Ukraine somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I always hoped to – to go there and see whether there are any Czynski(ph) there.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: But most likely not.</span> <span id="s225">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s226">But anyway, so they moved, and my mother was in Przemyśl, somewhere connected with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s227">My grandfather died when she was one year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: And that’s also story in the family.</span> <span id="s230">She was the younger – youngest of four from second wife.</span> <span id="s231">Of course, the first one died, no – not divorced.</span> <span id="s232">So she’s – for a woman, my mother was born 1898.</span> <span id="s233">So at that time, to bring up four children, so my father wish her – I wish that he – that that one will die for you.</span> <span id="s234">That was my mother.</span> <span id="s235">Well, three is easier than four.</span> <span id="s236">She managed somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: She gave good education for –</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: All her daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Good –</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Yeah, all her children.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s243">And she was working with a nurse na – nurse, servant and nurse.</span> <span id="s244">They were cooking and giving lunches to people who were coming, that’s how she supported herself and four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: So that’s your grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: That’s my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: What – what a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: What a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: So, we believe that wom – women are equal, but completely different.</span> <span id="s251">But we are equal.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s253">Well, you survived, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: – and she brought up her children.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s257">So she was a teacher, and because of that we lived there.</span> <span id="s258">And she had a servant, she had to, but in comparison I can’t – did – I didn’t say how big was our –</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Yeah, tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: – apartment.</span> <span id="s261">Four of us and the servant, there were two rooms.</span> <span id="s262">One little room connected with two rooms, and kitchen, and so they couldn’t be – that room could not be used for anything, only just storage of – cupboard.</span> <span id="s263">And the servant sleeps in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: When the Soviets expelled us, a man came in and my mother says, well, we’re here only, and [indecipherable] there no room.</span> <span id="s266">And he said, oh, in our country even Stalin doesn’t have such a good room.</span> <span id="s267">And he believed.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Yeah, he believed, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: He believed.</span> <span id="s270">But it was really very small, but that was cheaper than – because of –</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: She taught –</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: – it was only for teachers –</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: – so it was slightly cheaper, I don’t know how much it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: So, I got the impression – tell us again, there will be people who know geographically where Białystok is, and others who don’t.</span> <span id="s276">Can you tell us where in Poland the city is?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: It’s halfway from Warszawa to – you say Vilnius, I’m saying Wilno.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: So it’s halfway between Warsaw and Wilno, and Wilno is in Lithuania, so that means it’s in eastern Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yes, right now it’s very easter, but is part of – biggest part of Poland was taken by Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: So that means that it’s in the northeastern part, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Slightly north to the Warsaw, but it’s not very far.</span> <span id="s282">I think, if I’m right, it’s 110 kilometers.</span> <span id="s283">That means about 18 miles from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s284">And when my brother finished his middle school gymnasium, four years, that’s the 10th grade, he decided to go and visit my aunt, which was in Pruszków, which is very close to wa – Warsaw, and my grandparents were in Warsaw – on the bicycle.</span> <span id="s285">And he made it in one day, but the more – most thing difficult was the first part, because it was not paved.</span> <span id="s286">It was just a road.</span> <span id="s287">And that’s the main road from Warsaw to Wilno.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Now, within Białystok, were the roads paved?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: They were something what we call koci bur(ph), cat’s heads.</span> <span id="s290">It’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Cobblestones.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Cobblestone.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Cobblestones, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Mostly, and there will – will be some which wer – weren’t paved at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Tell me a little bit about modernization.</span> <span id="s296">You mentioned that in this city there was – there were textile factories that were – that polluted.</span> <span id="s297">Did people have cars?</span> <span id="s298">Did they have

id="s301">And we used to come and see how he was working with the car.</span> <span id="s302">You have the handle in front –</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A:

id="s308">A: Yes, that kind.</span> <span id="s309">So I saw the car, and I saw the first plane, it was the first few days of the war.</span> <span id="s310">I was coming – I’m somewhere close to that biełka(ph) and the plane flew over it, very close.</span> <span id="s311">That was the closest to the planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: So that’s the first time you saw an airplane –</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: – was when the war starts.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yes, when the war st –</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: That means 1941, or

<p><span id="s322">A: My daughter had the plane to – she used to [indecipherable] the plane.</span> <span id="s323">She still have it, I think it doesn’t play.</span> <span id="s324">And my youngest son is a pilot since he was 17.</span> <span id="s325">He is in Poland right now.</span> <span id="s326">But I saw the first plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: You saw the first one.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Well, he’s ple – flying helicopters, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: So the war – the world change very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Yes it has, hasn’t it?</span> <span id="s332">It really has.</span> <span id="s333">In – in Białystok, what would – was it a pretty city, or was it a very, as you say, if it was industrial –</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I don’t know where industry was.</span> <span id="s335">I was close to – well, from us it was very close to – to the main market there.</span> <span id="s336">And I would go with the servant to – when she was shopping in Hahnyehki(ph).</span> <span id="s337">Does – that Jewish part.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Hahnyehki(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Hahnyehki(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s341">Did you have any Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s343">There were – there were two kids in my class.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: And one was a boy, and one a girl.</span> <span id="s346">The girl, nothing special.</span> <span id="s347">The boy was the most intelligent and he usually didn’t get the best grades, and I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s349">A: And I was completely sure that he was much brighter than I was.</span> <span id="s350">So – but the teacher was giving the boy less than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Why would – why would that be?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: She was divorced and my mother said that she didn’t like the boys.</span> <span id="s353">But an-anyway, she recognize him and very often when the war in Spain started –</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: That’s right, the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: – she usually would say [indecipherable] say wha-what’s happening in – in – and he was saying.</span> <span id="s356">He was completely sure.</span> <span id="s357">He was in second grade or something, and knew what was happening in Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: The Spanish Civil War.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: The Spanish Civil War.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Civil War, in ’37.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: He was really a bright boy.</span> <span id="s362">Now, there was one child who was a – e-easter Orthodox.</span> <span id="s363">The – so three out of about 40.</span> <span id="s364">Our classes were large because it was – the school was called Treitanufka(ph), something what you learn how to do it.</span> <span id="s365">So they –</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Vocational school.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Vo – it was vocation for the teacher.</span> <span id="s368">The mother – my mother was teaching the grades.</span> <span id="s369">And the [indecipherable] pedagogic.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Pedagogical, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yes, and those teachers had to learn on us.</span> <span id="s372">And since in the country there were big classes – usually, I think, in Poland were, in cities it will be 30 in class.</span> <span id="s373">But in ours it was 40, and once I was in a connected school, connected class, third and fourth grade together, 60 kids all together, so the teacher would learn how to do it.</span> <span id="s374">Only one year like that.</span> <span id="s375">So, there were big classes.</span> <span id="s376">And out of our 40, there were three children who had the option – there was Catholic religion I think twice a week for an hour – they could stay, or they could go out.</span> <span id="s377">That was not discrimination, they a – all – all the children were very, very glad to leave and do whatever they want.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Not have to be – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: No, that was definitely not discrimination, they could stay and learn.</span> <span id="s380">Our – for instance, we start with the prayer.</span> <span id="s381">They would not have to pray with us, only they have to stand up on the very beginning and the very end of the school.</span> <span id="s382">But they would have to pass religion to pass to the next grade.</span> <span id="s383">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Their own religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Their own religion.</span> <span id="s386">So the rabbi has to say that they passed the religion for the, say second grade, before they will go to the third.</span> <span id="s387">But what they learn, that was his only.</span> <span id="s388">He did not have to say what he consider good for the second grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: And you’re saying this was true for the Orthodox children as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s392">And were there many Orthodox children?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: In my class, only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: And that brings me to another question.</span> <span id="s395">You mentioned that you thought that the Jewish population of Białystok was maybe 30 percent, but after – truly afterwards you [indecipherable] half.</span> <span id="s396">So were there Ukrainians in Białystok?</span> <span id="s397">Were there other nationalities?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: No.</span> <span id="s399">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s402">But there was a joke after the Russians came in, that people used to say when they were in White Russia or Ukraine – we call it White Russia –</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: You’re talking Belarus?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: That they lived Bialosc(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: I can’t pronounce it properly.</span> <span id="s407">They used to say that we’re local, we’re local.</span> <span id="s408">And they say afterwards that Polish people wanted – for 20 years wanted to make them Polish and they didn’t, but the Russians came and did it in two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Well, there is something to that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: I remember from learning about the region around Wilno, the people would say the same thing.</span> <span id="s412">Who are you?</span> <span id="s413">And they wouldn’t say I am Polish or I’m Lithuanian or I’m Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I’m local.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: They say, I’m tutejszy.</span> <span id="s416">I’m from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Yes, tutejszy it’s local, yes</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Yeah, I’m from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Which is an interesting kind of identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Well, because it was under Russia, Poland doesn’t exist for 150 years, and they felt Polish, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Sort of.</span> <span id="s423">Kind of.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Kind of Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: They knew that the – the others are strangers, the others are occupa – occupants.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: And don’t – don’t treat people the same ways.</span> <span id="s429">So – so, they were local.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: They were local.</span> <span id="s431">So let’s talk a little bit more about religion, a little bit.</span> <span id="s432">Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: My parents were not.</span> <span id="s434">They treat – well, I think that the – the problem was that they believed in regulation of birth, and that’s against the ga – Catholic church.</span> <span id="s435">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Oh, so they believed in birth control.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Birth control.</span> <span id="s438">I believe that was the reason, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s439">But they kept us, we were going to – to church every Sunday, and – and well, th-they try not to talk about that, but because of they believe in bir-birth control, they didn’t try to go to church and pretend that they are good Catholics.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s441">But you were – you, nevertheless, would ha – take religion classes in school, and did you go through the various stages of, you know, having a First Communion and a Confirmation, and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s443">There is only one thing.</span> <span id="s444">My mother told me that once a woman came to her and said, I don’t want my child to be in a religion class.</span> <span id="s445">And my mother said, what – well, I’m an athe – atheist.</span> <span id="s446">So all through those years my mother was [indecipherable] something.</span> <span id="s447">There was one atheist.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: And of course her child, who would not go to religion class because that was – only she could not provide a certificate of any religion that he passed.</span> <span id="s450">So he was not learning.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s452">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: But one in years.</span> <span id="s454">So at that time it wasn’t, it was la – and there is one other thing, people av – who say about anti-Semitism in Poland.</span> <span id="s455">I believe that there was no – not really anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s456">It wa – came during the war, brought by Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s457">My husband was a mathematician, and he knew a mathematician in Poland who was very distinct in – in Warsaw Polytechnic.</span> <span id="s458">I forgot his name right now.</span> <span id="s459">And he was very respected, s-some grand or something like that, one year, and the second year they told him to get out of Poland, they allowed him.</span> <span id="s460">But he was married to a Catholic woman and had Catholic child.</span> <span id="s461">So he was expelled and not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: And [indecipherable] sort of –</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: That was during the war.</span> <span id="s464">And he lived with us, he came to United States, he lived with us for a week or two.</span> <span id="s465">And right now, if he’s alive, he’s still teaching in an – Ann Arbor.</span> <span id="s466">But that came, that one year everything was – was bad, it was supposed to be bad because of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s467">And I think something was bad, people can’t take very easily.</span> <span id="s468">So most likely right now there is the real anti-Semitism in part of Poland, not to everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: But it was definitely – I – I want to give you what was before the war.</span> <span id="s471">There were some –</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Tell me before the war, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Before the war there were some people extremist who were saying bić Żyda.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Beat the Jew.</span> <span id="s476">That – those were extremists, but hardly ever.</span> <span id="s477">And so that was not showing what the population was.</span> <span id="s478">But we have, don’t buy in Jewish store.</span> <span id="s479">Last few years we e – if we could avoid.</span> <span id="s480">And the reason was economic, because before Poland received independence into ninet – 18 – Jewish people were taking part of commerce.</span> <span id="s481">Because for a nobleman it was not nice, so if he brings some food, somebody had to bring into the city.</span> <span id="s482">And that was what Jewish people were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Then [indecipherable] Jewish population was very l-large.</span> <span id="s485">Out of 30 millions – no, 33 million people we had before the war, three million were Jewish.</span> <span id="s486">Because when in the western Europe in, I don’t know, 15th 16th century, when there were a fight and they didn’t wan – like Jewish people, Jewish people came, and apparently just past the e-e-eastern border of Poland there was a biggest population o-of Jewish people, because we accepted them.</span> <span id="s487">So that was only when Poland get the independence, and we started to modern life, somebody had to have the – the shopkeepers could not be only Jewish people.</span> <span id="s488">And because of that, Jewish people were fighting the new stores.</span> <span id="s489">Of course, that was economic fight.</span> <span id="s490">The whole part of was – some Jewish people were giving money to this storekeeper who was next to the new Polish store – not Polish, Christian store.</span> <span id="s491">Jewish people were Polish people.</span> <span id="s492">But they were giving him money, so Jewish store had everything cheaper.</span> <span id="s493">After a time, after a year or two, the other one has to close.</span> <span id="s494">Then, the prices in Jewish store went up.</span> <span id="s495">That was known, and because of that we were, don’t buy in Jewish store.</span> <span id="s496">But that was not anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s497">This was justified of – as I said, the noblemen, since they gi – were giving to every son, then they were poorer and poorer.</span> <span id="s498">That was a cul – sort of culture.</span> <span id="s499">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: I want to – I – I want to go to – I understand what you are explaining, but I would like to – I would like to focus on, did this play out in your life at all?</span> <span id="s501">Did your parents talk about such things when you were growing up, about – did you – for example, when you went with your servant – by the way, what was her name, the servant?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: They change, from one to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: I see, so it wasn’t always the same person.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yes, for 12 – 12 years, there were two or three.</span> <span id="s505">The first one was the one which worked with my mother, providing lunches to people.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: So she was my – my nurse on the very beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: So – I mean, was – how did this play out when you were growing up?</span> <span id="s509">Did you know there was a difference between Jewish children and your – and yourself, outside of the religions classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No, I knew something.</span> <span id="s511">For instance, I – I’m – well, I live in commun – community where is a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s512">There are two synagogues.</span> <span id="s513">For me it was a surprise that there are different kind of Jewish – that they need two synagogues close to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: That means in Białystok?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: No, no, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Here, here, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: In Silver Spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: I live in place where there’s a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s520">But, for instance, I knew tha – and I always wonder wha – from me to the closest synagogue is more that 1,000 paces.</span> <span id="s521">And I learned that Jewish people cannot walk farther than 10,000 paces.</span> <span id="s522">So how can stretch it?</span> <span id="s523">They don’t drive, of course.</span> <span id="s524">They go – walk to synagogue.</span> <span id="s525">But I knew about that.</span> <span id="s526">I knew about matzah.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Mm-hm, about Passover, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Ye-Yes, I like it very much.</span> <span id="s529">I didn’t know that it’s a religious, the triangular cake, but we had triangle ca-cakes with poppy seeds inside, and big one, no-not the short one, but short like –</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: I think these are called hamantashen, I’m not exactly sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I – I don’t know, but I knew some things [indecipherable] that they had to wash the – all the dishes somewhere.</span> <span id="s532">So, we knew a little bit of the Jewish culture.</span> <span id="s533">And of course, my parents were very much against us.</span> <span id="s534">That was just before the war, there were some people who were against Jews very strongly, and my parents were saying that it’s – it was completely silly.</span> <span id="s535">When we had to, during the war, under the Russian occupation, we had to go to Warsaw, to German – Germany [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s536">So, my mother went to a friend who was a doctor, and she gave my mother a sign that my mother has a weak – weak heart, and have to stay at home for three weeks.</span> <span id="s537">That was in case we would not be able to pass through Warsaw, and she would have to come back, so she will be able to get her job again.</span> <span id="s538">Of course, that was something what she – it was be punished by whatever, maybe sending to Siberia.</span> <span id="s539">But she gave it to my mother.</span> <span id="s540">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: And she was a Jewish lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: She was Jewish, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Yes, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: And also we have a doctor, h-he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s545">When we started to buy only in Christian stores, we didn’t change him.</span> <span id="s546">So, it was a Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s547">So I really believe strongly there was no anti-semit – anti-Semitism is always in all the world, but in Poland it was not strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: But people believe right now, but taking a bad thing is very, very easy, and since Soviet Union were saying that everything is fault of Jewish people, and so you know, it start.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: So let’s – let’s go back to – let’s go back to the events of your life, and your family’s life.</span> <span id="s551">You were – you were then – your father was working as a clerk, your mother was teaching –</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: A teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: – you were attending the school, which was kind of like the children were the guinea pigs for teachers in training.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: And did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: In – mostly were normal school.</span> <span id="s557">Only from time to time we had that –</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: That sort of situation.</span> <span id="s559">Did your parent talk about politics at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: A lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Of course, we eat always in – i-in – around the table, not – not in front TV or something like –</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Yeah, there was no such.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: So, they were always talking.</span> <span id="s565">My father was very interested in social things.</span> <span id="s566">But I don’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Were they – I mean, were they supporters of any one particular party, or any one particular kind of public –</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: I wish I knew –</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: – but I don’t.</span> <span id="s571">There was only one thing.</span> <span id="s572">In Poland – here you have the names – I was so-so – it was so funny for me when I think he was the principal of the school somewhere in Gloucester where I live years ago, and the street was named by him.</span> <span id="s573">And so there was something opening, and I shake his hand.</span> <span id="s574">Why it was so funny for me, because in Poland there is no – right now there is a lot of streets named by – by the Pope.</span> <span id="s575">But otherwise – I don’t know whether that changed, but in Białystok, there was a street named by Koscza(ph) Kowskei(ph) was mi – misa – some – someone in government.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: And my father objected to it.</span> <span id="s578">And because of that he lost his job, and for four years – that was eight years before the war – for four years he could not find a job, and then all the savings are – went down.</span> <span id="s579">He had one job somewhere in Silesia, and he – somehow he lost it, after he have a year.</span> <span id="s580">So it – we – we were really using all the savings.</span> <span id="s581">And then he got the job in Tarnopol, which is Ukraine right now in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: In tarno – in Tarnopol, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Tarnopol, yes, there was a Voivodswa(ph) Tarnopolski(ph).</span> <span id="s584">And so –</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Okay, so was the region of Tarnopol, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s587">He used to come to us for Christmas, and we were going for vacation down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: And so, if I understand this properly, your father had strong political views of one kind –</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: And because of that he’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: – and that got him into trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Yes,

Kowskei(ph).</span> <span id="s601">And what political party did this minister belong to?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Do you have to –</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: You may be able to find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s606">What did your parents think of Marshall Pilsudski?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: That I don’t know, because in school I don’t think that they were with him.</span> <span id="s608">But anyway, he – Pilsudski was in school a very important person.</span> <span id="s609">And my mother, like she was teaching me to be Catholic, she was teaching me to good Pole.</span> <span id="s610">And that was – I’m not sure that they were with him very much.</span> <span id="s611">I don’t know – I – I was too young to understand when he started some trouble, where they were in that –</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: What they thought of it –</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: No, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s617">Were they – would you think though – I’m trying to get a sense of what was their political orientation.</span> <span id="s618">Were they more on a liberal side, on a – on a socialistic side?</span> <span id="s619">I – I only suggest that because you say they were for birth control.</span> <span id="s620">And in those years, very often –</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: That was progressive, very progressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Progressive, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: I know that there – one teacher had three children, and they were saying it’s too much.</span> <span id="s624">And that time in – when my mother, during the war was teaching in – in the country, my friend was one of 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: So that was the usual.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: So, one thing.</span> <span id="s629">My father, when he was in Tarnopol, he was away from the family.</span> <span id="s630">He was playing Bridge, which is how we –</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: It’s a card game, yes?</span> <span id="s632">He was playing Bridge, the card game?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yes, yes, card game.</span> <span id="s634">And for a very small amount of money, but he also always winning and bringing money home.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s636">So, he was good at it?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: [indecipherable] very little.</span> <span id="s638">But apart from that, he had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s639">So he was apparently taking, at that time, everywhere in the country, people during the winter were just suffering, because they had nothing to work, nothing to eat, and so on.</span> <span id="s640">And so he was supporting the peasant – peasants’ art.</span> <span id="s641">And apparently there was a shop cl – something for that opened before the war, already for a few years.</span> <span id="s642">And people were so grateful to my father, that they gave him an how – ho – handwoven carpet, which was, when I came here I saw something close by – close to it, it will be a thousand or 2,000 dollars’ worth here.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Yeah, yeah, something that beautiful –</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: And they gave it to him –</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: As thanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: – for what he was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: But what he was doing, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: So – so definitely he was for the people, but on the other ha-hand, my mother was paying that five złoty more than usual, the – that’s way other people were taking this – her servants, taught by her, and so on.</span> <span id="s651">But, so was sort of equality for people, good, bad.</span> <span id="s652">Also the – I would say that it would be for everybody, strike your own, and help other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: So those were their values.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: It was not – it was the values – not socialist values.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: But still good for other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: And I think for both my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: My – my mother was a teacher who – who would try to do everything for ev-every child.</span> <span id="s661">It was not just working those hours, she was a really teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: I want to ask something about – about your family in a pers – more personal way.</span> <span id="s663">Is – what was the family dynamic?</span> <span id="s664">Was your – were you closer to one parent than the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Another story.</span> <span id="s666">My father was at work when I was born in the hospital.</span> <span id="s667">And my mother somehow called by telephone.</span> <span id="s668">And the people around us, oh it’s a girl – boy – girl.</span> <span id="s669">I lost my second boy.</span> <span id="s670">They wanted to have only two children, and I was a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: So, my father told me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s674">Jokingly.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Jokingly.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Well, right then he told them he lost –</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: His second boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: – his second boy, because he wanted two.</span> <span id="s680">But he told me.</span> <span id="s681">And I was his favorite.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Whether my mother had a favorite, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s686">But I definitely was his favorite.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: And what kind of personalities did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Is difficult for me to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Were they outgoing?</span> <span id="s690">I mean, they sound like they were very – they liked being with people.</span> <span id="s691">If they – if their –</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Yes, they must be, but to me they were perfect, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Let me say with the [indecipherable] because I will be most likely coming back also, to things other.</span> <span id="s695">When war started, my father had to go to – to the army.</span> <span id="s696">And he – everybody was going back, back, back, so they will re – reorganize and start to fight Germans, straight.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: So they were retreating in order to regroup.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Retreating all the time, because they were going to reorganize.</span> <span id="s699">We had pact – pact of nieagresji.</span> <span id="s700">A pact with Russia that we’ll not be fighting each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: This is called the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: No, no, no, no, you say between them.</span> <span id="s703">We had Poland –</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Oh, Poland</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: – had interaction –</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: A non-aggression –</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: – non-aggression pact.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: – aggression pact, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: So we did not expect our friends to free – free us.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: So they came in – before that, there was a appeal to everybody, young man.</span> <span id="s712">My – my brother was 16, but he – to retreat and form the army and fight back.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s714">I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: So he was retreating also.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: I want to – excuse me, I want to – I want to ask a few other questions about this, since we’re going to start into this.</span> <span id="s717">But before I left your family, I wanted to ask one more question that was about the family, and then go on to the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: And that was what kind of a person was your brother, and were you close to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: I was very close to, he was my friend, not only my brother.</span> <span id="s721">Only four years older.</span> <span id="s722">He was teasing me from time to time, but we were really friends.</span> <span id="s723">And he was very athletic.</span> <span id="s724">I was – I was always choosing my food, and I was small, and tiny and not athletic at all.</span> <span id="s725">And he was in everything, and he was playing music – piano.</span> <span id="s726">My mother was – wanted me to learn piano, I was learning for four years, because piano you don’t have to have good hearing to – to be able to play.</span> <span id="s727">But he was very good, one of the – had some concerts and so on.</span> <span id="s728">So by 16 he was known as good pianist, and good tennis player.</span> <span id="s729">We had that tennis courts, which that’s a very expensive – because you don’t ha – you had to pay for that, but since it was on the school grounds, we – we have it.</span> <span id="s730">So he was very, very athletic, and my best friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s732">So now this –</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Even four years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: That’s – that’s amazing.</span> <span id="s735">I mean, there are very few sibling – I mean, many siblings are close, but such that they could say that – that ther – he’s not only my brother, but my best friend –</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: – is – is quite a compliment.</span> <span id="s738">Now I want to go to the war in this way.</span> <span id="s739">Can you tell me – do you remember the day that it started?</span> <span id="s740">Do you remember where you were?</span> <span id="s741">Do you remember what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Must have been during the night.</span> <span id="s743">No, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Do you remember, were your parents with you together?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: No, definitely not, because my father was in army.</span> <span id="s748">I was only with my mother and my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: And why would he be in the army?</span> <span id="s750">Was he mobilized before the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yes, because he was in the reserve army.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: He was the army when my mother met him.</span> <span id="s754">And because of that, he was in the reserve all the time.</span> <span id="s755">He was the lowest officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: So, he was a sergeant or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: No, no, no, sergeant is under.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Lower than that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s760">He’s second lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s762">Second lieutenant.</span> <span id="s763">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: And during the war he was – before the war in – in the underground army he was lieutenant, and then during the insurrection, captain.</span> <span id="s765">But that’s important for our family, that he was retreating with his people.</span> <span id="s766">And here it –</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Excuse me, excuse me I need to come before that, because there’s a lot I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s768">So, he was in Tarnopol while you were in Białystok, and he was in the reserves from Tarnopol?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: He was assigned to Modlin, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: And Modlin is where in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: I think close to Warsaw, but west of Warsaw, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s775">So when the G-Germans attacked, he was not on the western front, he was around Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Somewhere there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s778">And do you remember when he was mobilized?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: A few – a few weeks before the war.</span> <span id="s780">I know that we shortened the va – vacation, and we came back to Białystok.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: That’s what I’d like to find out about.</span> <span id="s782">You were on vacation?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: I think he in – on vacation always in Tarnopol.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Because it was before the school starts.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: I think we came early, and I think that he has a friend in – it’s called Dvoika.</span> <span id="s788">Is second.</span> <span id="s789">Tha-That’s military spies.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: And I think that he had a friend and that friend said that the war is coming pretty soon.</span> <span id="s792">I think so, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s793">But definitely not a secret, but something what you can tell different.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: And so in other words, during that summer, there was already conversation that the war is coming, and people felt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s797">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: But only from the west, not from the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s800">So this talk about –</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: We had the – some pact with France and England, if some – Germany would have attacked us, they are going to go to war straightaway.</span> <span id="s802">And we still feel badly that they didn’t til the fourth day, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: So you were – your father was in the – taken into the reserves from Tarnopol and somewhere around Warsaw.</span> <span id="s804">You and your –</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: – and your brother and mother returned to Białystok?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: And you talked earlier about that first plane that you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Well, that was during the war already.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Okay, so that wasn’t during the first days?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: On 17th, when Russian attacked, we were still in Poland, free part of Poland.</span> <span id="s812">So, most likely I saw that plane on that day, maybe on 20 of September.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: It was a Polish plane?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Polish plane, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Ah, okay, it was a Polish plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Polish plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: And – and so the first days of the war, your father is someplace, and you don’t know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: I haven’t seen my father from bef – from Tarnopol til February

id="s820">A: And we were thinking about being in the cerl(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: In the cellar, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Cellar.</span> <span id="s823">That is safer, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Bombs were not coming through.</span> <span id="s826">And once we went there, everybody was getting, it was in on the school somewhere.</span> <span id="s827">A-And people sa – started to say, gas, gas, gas.</span> <span id="s828">We went out, we were really afraid.</span> <span id="s829">And we found that one woman, since she couldn’t wash her children’s hands, she wash it with the cologne water.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Okay – oh – oh, cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Eau de cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s834">And the smell of that, and everybody thought it was gas.</span> <span id="s835">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s837">How quickly people are afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s839">So we were afraid of gas, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: So this is – were there German bombardments of Białystok during those first two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Y-Yes, it was, and it went on the close – close to the hospital, somewhere where there were [indecipherable] under the train, there was a – passage under the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Oh, you mean like when you’re going onto a railway –</span></p> <p><span

Fell on that, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: And there was a lot of people.</span> <span id="s848">And my brother, who was helping there, as a scout, he put his body on his arm, and took it to the hospital, and it – it was a dead man.</span> <span id="s849">My brother was 16, so he’s still not an old person –</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: It’s not easy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span

wiping the – she wa – she wasn’t cooking, luckily, for people.</span> <span id="s891">But she was washing the dishes, and I was wiping it and going out and putting the water out.</span> <span id="s892">When Germans came, since that was already hospital, Germans took it as a hospital for one week.</span> <span id="s893">And then they retreated because Russians were supposed to, according to Molotov-Ribbentrop, Białystok was supposed to be in Russian.</span> <span id="s894">So they retreated, and Russian took the hospital, and there was a hospital, with a vo – very good doctors.</span> <span id="s895">A – amp-amputation of the leg or hand look awful, but it’s one of the easiest thing to do.</span> <span id="s896">And people were saying that if that one doctor there would cut the leg off, the person would die for sure.</span> <span id="s897">It was a horrible thing.</span> <span id="s898">When the war started, all the stores had to be open, whether they have anything to sell, or not.</span> <span id="s899">And that – the woman who had the store with – with – I’m thinking in Polish when I am talking about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: It’s okay.</span> <span id="s901">Okay.</span> <span id="s902">It takes a little bit of time sometimes to find the words.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s904">Somewhere where you sell the medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Ph-Pharmacy?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Yeah, pharmacy.</span> <span id="s907">The owner of the pharmacy had that pharmacy open.</span> <span id="s908">She told that to my mother, my mother told me.</span> <span id="s909">There wa – came a man, and she said, I’m sorry, but I don’t have anything left.</span> <span id="s910">And, you really don’t?</span> <span id="s911">What about that?</span> <span id="s912">And there were the – were the little baby, you put here in his mouth so he won’t cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Oh, you – oh, you mean the – I know the word in – in the wrong languages.</span> <span id="s914">Thank you very much, a pacifier.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Pacifier, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s917">So, it was a pacifier, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: A pacifier.</span> <span id="s919">And that was a Russian – I think Russian officer, but an – anyway, is Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: And she ask hi-him, you want one or two?</span> <span id="s922">No, all of them.</span> <span id="s923">And he bought 50.</span> <span id="s924">Everything what we had, it was really luxury for them.</span> <span id="s925">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: So you say the stores emptied out, is that what you’re saying, when the Russian army came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Well, it was almost ev – empty, everything was sold, nothing brought in.</span> <span id="s928">So she said, I don’t have anything, I – and only those pacifiers.</span> <span id="s929">And since there were 50 pacifiers, he bought 50 pacifiers.</span> <span id="s930">There were a time when we didn’t have bread, when – and once we had halvah, you know what it is?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: We could buy a lot of halvah, and we were eating that halvah, because that’s what brought to – was brought to Poland.</span> <span id="s933">And just the beginning of the war, Russians were going to the main square.</span> <span id="s934">In Poland there was – nuns had the orphanage.</span> <span id="s935">And they were going to take the orphanage, the whole orphanage or something.</span> <span id="s936">That was one of the first ma-main thing.</span> <span id="s937">People learn about that, everybody came to that square.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Square.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Thousands of people, and we didn’t let Russians take the nuns out.</span> <span id="s940">My brother was there, I wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: So, they were going to – they were going to –</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: To take that orphanage somewhere, all children from the nuns.</span> <span id="s943">I don’t know exactly what, but I know that we went.</span> <span id="s944">There’s another thing.</span> <span id="s945">The – the first – first half year of the war, we were sent to different classes, mixed together.</span> <span id="s946">People were saying – once my mother said, be very careful what you say, because somebody said that you said, when Polish ef – officers will come from Lithuania, we’ll have free Poland again.</span> <span id="s947">That was be for me, 12 year old, would be so stupid.</span> <span id="s948">But somebody had to say something about me, and because that – they said that stupid thing.</span> <span id="s949">And my mu – somebody warned my mother, my mother say, be very careful what you are saying.</span> <span id="s950">On the other hand, this first half a year again, we had in Poland, a cross in front of the class.</span> <span id="s951">We usually pray just before the classes and after the school end.</span> <span id="s952">And Russians told to take the crosses out.</span> <span id="s953">No crosses in school.</span> <span id="s954">So in my brother’s school, they had the – not – not al-always one, but one of them would bring a cross every day, put it there, take it down afterwards.</span> <span id="s955">But during the classes, there was cross there.</span> <span id="s956">In my s – and in my school – and that was already mix, because I went to seventh grade from six, that was different school, and because of that, I knew half of half – they were specially mixed, so you will never know.</span> <span id="s957">And once, we were finishing the class where would – we would say the prayer.</span> <span id="s958">And we were saying the prayer even when there was a – I don’t know whether we had a cross, or there was no cross, but we were praying into that direction.</span> <span id="s959">Oh, of course, in every class there was Stalin and somebody else there.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: You mean the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Picture, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: So us – one of the girls, and that’s already in that mixed school, say, are you going to pray to the Stalin?</span> <span id="s964">And without anything we turn around, and then after that, every day when we – was a prayer, we would stand up, turn around, so back to this – to Stalin.</span> <span id="s965">So, that’s the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s966">But afterwards we were always afraid, afraid, afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: But I’d like to ask this.</span> <span id="s968">You mentioned of a story of, you know, where a Russian officer went – or Soviet officer went to a pharmacy.</span> <span id="s969">Did you see soldiers in the streets?</span> <span id="s970">Did you see any that you had any contact with?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: They was – they were marching, the whole battalion or something, I don’t know, and they were – were always singing.</span> <span id="s972">They sing beautifully, even in the army, they sing not one voice, but two voices.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: In harmony, yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Like a choir.</span> <span id="s975">And I liked it, and I was so ashamed that I liked it.</span> <span id="s976">I was really ashamed that I would.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: But, 12 year old –</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: – has no –</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: And what was the behavior of the soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Once my mother – there was one man standing.</span> <span id="s983">She – she said, turn around and don-don’t look there.</span> <span id="s984">He was masturbating on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: And looking at my mother.</span> <span id="s987">Since she said so, I – I didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s988">Later on, when I was grown up, I learned.</span> <span id="s989">I remember it.</span> <span id="s990">People, as people, were pretty nice.</span> <span id="s991">Nobody complain about them.</span> <span id="s992">There were no – no excesses.</span> <span id="s993">But they do what they were told to do the – and that one told us to get out of th – our house to somewhere else, because even Stalin doesn’t live so luxurious we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: And so, when did that happen?</span> <span id="s995">Did that happen soon after they came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: They have – they happen – that happened ’39, or was it beginning of ’40?</span> <span id="s997">I don’t know, but definitely I was in Białystok less than a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: So that was beginning of the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: So tell me –</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: But let me – let me say, because I have to speak about my father, because that’s – that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: That was my next question.</span> <span id="s1003">Okay, tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: My father was going dow – back, back, back, and finally he retreated to Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: And Lithuania was free at that time, so he was in the officers of – whatever it called, but camp for the officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: He was going to sit there for the whole rest of the war, because Lithuania was not in war.</span> <span id="s1009">And then the Russians came to help the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s1010">And I don’t know what month was that, February or March?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Oh, when they came to – that was pretty early on –</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: But it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: There – the first battal – the first bases were in October, November of 40, of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Oh, no no –</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: The very beginning it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: No, no, no, that was the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Because of that, there was a camp which was supposed to be in neutral country.</span> <span id="s1019">Lithuania was neutral country.</span> <span id="s1020">It was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: In July – in July 1940 they voted to – to join the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Yes, but the Russians came earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Oh yes, they did.</span> <span id="s1024">In the fi – the – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: I think February or March.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Okay, well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: But anyway, my brother already went and already was arrested, which we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1028">And the Russians then came to the camp, and the camp was not big enough, so my father knew the names of other people, as well.</span> <span id="s1029">And the – they said, you can go back to your families, we’ll give you permi – permit to work, and everything will be fine.</span> <span id="s1030">So my – my father, first of all, he was jokingly said that he will – marry – married my mother because he wanted to have children.</span> <span id="s1031">So of course he wanted to go back to children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: And he was the first one to sign that he is going to.</span> <span id="s1034">And he told me that.</span> <span id="s1035">He make a bid – big fuss when the first transport went out and he wasn’t on that first.</span> <span id="s1036">He was in the second transport, and since he knew the name, there was a third transport.</span> <span id="s1037">First and third went to Katyn, you know what Katyn is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: When they murdered the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Polish officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: – Polish officers.</span> <span id="s1042">But my mother – my father was in the second.</span> <span id="s1043">They allowed him back to pol – to Białystok.</span> <span id="s1044">Didn’t al – let him work, didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1045">And there was talk, people knew the – who – there were first policemen, or somebody else send to Siberia and something like that.</span> <span id="s1046">And somebody warned – I have to come back wa-was about the fear.</span> <span id="s1047">That we were – will be the next in, our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: I see, to be deported, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Deported.</span> <span id="s1050">And my parents packed everything what could be necessary.</span> <span id="s1051">And then the gossip or true, came that young girls were taken to the house of prostitution for soldiers.</span> <span id="s1052">So my parents decided no, we’re not going to, we – we’re going to try to get to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: So, get out of the Russian occupied area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Yes, to German occupied area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1056">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: And at that time they were still friends, German and Russians.</span> <span id="s1058">We – we went – the last night I even slept at my neighbors, because they were told that in case my parents will be arrested that night, to send me and I will be going with that part, through the – they were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: You mean, if they would have been arrested to be deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: But I want to come back also, because I said fear, fear, fear –</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: – and then before that they show how young children, they were opposing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: But once there was a man whose wi – a teacher –</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: – who was – his wife was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1069">He was arrested, and for some reason [indecipherable] let – let go.</span> <span id="s1070">From that time on, all the teachers, if their – if he would come close by, they would start to speak about weather, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1071">Because everybody knew that if he was let out, it was because of pregnant wife, and somebo – the threat him so, not to speak in front of him, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: So, he could be an informer?</span> <span id="s1073">In other words, he was let go –</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: He most likely was promised to be an informer and because of that, nobody blamed him, only everybody was very careful, because we did expect that he was an informer.</span> <span id="s1075">And that was the fear all the time, fear who will say what, and what next.</span> <span id="s1076">So, we – we were trying to cross the border.</span> <span id="s1077">I had a fever at that – I – I was – some common thing which people right now are immunized against it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Flu?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1080">One of the – what’s it used to be called children’s illness.</span> <span id="s1081">Everybody pass it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Measles?</span> <span id="s1083">Mumps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: No, mumps I had later.</span> <span id="s1085">Whooping cough, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Oh, whooping cough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: But anyway, I had something like that, and with that, first we went by train a little bit, then through – people used to have wa – wagon with horse drawn, with – it took us three or four days to come to the middle, between Białystok and the Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: And there was only like 60 kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Yes, but you cannot go straight, you cannot dri-drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: No way.</span> <span id="s1092">So we were trying, and we were caught.</span> <span id="s1093">Those people who were leading us, never were caught before that, and that was 13th time.</span> <span id="s1094">All the men, 16 years and older were arrested and sent to prison.</span> <span id="s1095">My father was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Who caught you – who caught you, was it the Soviets who caught you, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1099">So y – it was not allowed to leave a zone of occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Of course not.</span> <span id="s1101">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Well, if they were friends, one would think that they – you could – you’d have permeable borders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: No, it usually, people, if they cross the border and they were caught, they were saying, if they cau – coming from Warsaw, they would say, we’re coming from Białystok.</span> <span id="s1104">And because of that, they would be sent through.</span> <span id="s1105">But this time they were looking for a spy, or somebody.</span> <span id="s1106">And because of that, all the – our group was maybe 40, maybe 50 people.</span> <span id="s1107">One child was always given something to sleep, and they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: So they wouldn’t cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: And they ca – and carried.</span> <span id="s1110">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: And so you were – you went by horse-drawn carts –</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: – on the roads, but 40 people in a way that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: No, we met only in the gathering last – last place.</span> <span id="s1115">Everybody went by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: But it was my parents knew about that, and I had that fever, and so I-I didn’t even remember quite a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: And so women and children were taken to prison, which was dungeon where the pigs used to live.</span> <span id="s1120">No light, nothing, for three days.</span> <span id="s1121">And after three days, it was the third of May.</span> <span id="s1122">The door opened, and we could see the light, and they said, come out, come out.</span> <span id="s1123">They led us all – we were close to the border, but not at the border, and I don’t remember whether Russian or Germans helped us through the barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Because they wanted to get rid of us.</span> <span id="s1126">So after that we – we joined in – we went to – my mother and I went to my – my father’s sister in Pruszków, which is close to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: And what was going on with your father then?</span> <span id="s1128">He was arrested –</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: He was arrested, he was in – in prison.</span> <span id="s1130">Now, they were friends, all the time.</span> <span id="s1131">My m – my father was in jail in bresh – you call it Brezlitofsk(ph).</span></p> <p><span

else, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: A fortress?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Twierdza, yes, fortress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: A fortress, a fortress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: But that was a – a prison.</span> <span id="s1138">My father was going to be sent to Siberia, and then somebody came and just to be nasty, I don’t know who – who he was, and say, good morning, fa – Mr. Officer.</span> <span id="s1139">They did not know that my father was in the army ever.</span> <span id="s1140">So my father was interrogated again.</span> <span id="s1141">And we saw him after the interrogation, a few months, and my mother said that he still had blacks place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Black and blue marks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Black and blue.</span> <span id="s1144">And he was once saw a woman – pregnant woman being interrogated, and she was kicked in her stomach, and her blood came through the mouth.</span> <span id="s1145">So that was the kind of interrogation.</span> <span id="s1146">But anyway, finally his – they were asking him, where did you put the armament and – and how much and where?</span> <span id="s1147">And he didn’t, so he was saying no, no, no, and finally it was too much for him, after a week or two or three, and he said, I’ll be talking.</span> <span id="s1148">That my father told me.</span> <span id="s1149">And I cannot say exactly what it was, but the – he said, yes, I am put in – there – there is a national park close there.</span> <span id="s1150">In the national park I hid a hundred guns.</span> <span id="s1151">And the man was still writing.</span> <span id="s1152">Two hundred machine guns.</span> <span id="s1153">He was writing.</span> <span id="s1154">Four hundred cannons.</span> <span id="s1155">He was writing.</span> <span id="s1156">And something like that.</span> <span id="s1157">Finally he said, and three planes.</span> <span id="s1158">Then that man beat him once more, and knew that he wouldn’t be able to get anything from him because he doesn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: So the next day he was going to be sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1161">That day, luckily – it was in ’41, and the war started.</span> <span id="s1162">Germans attacked in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: June

cytil(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: The fortress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Fort – fortress, they killed all the Jewish people, at least all the Jewish men.</span> <span id="s1186">My father told me.</span> <span id="s1187">And the rest, they had to dig the trenches.</span> <span id="s1188">For three days they weren’t given any food at all, and in prison they were pretty hungry already.</span> <span id="s1189">And then, after three days, they were let go.</span> <span id="s1190">And good heart almost killed my father, because he was working somewhere, and the woman who was making butter, saw that he was from the prison, and gave him that big lump of butter, which she just made.</span> <span id="s1191">And after three days of not eating and one year of pri – being hungry, he ate all that, and was very, very sick.</span> <span id="s1192">Then he went to Białystok, to where we used to be.</span> <span id="s1193">And he was waiting that maybe my brother – he learn in prison that my brother was arrested, we – we thought that he was already in France.</span> <span id="s1194">And so he wa-waited for about a month, and then come to us.</span> <span

So he was able to get – okay, by that point –</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: By – by then, Germans were in Białystok as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Stock – yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: – because they moved forward.</span> <span id="s1202">As –</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: So you hadn't seen – excuse me – you hadn't seen your father from the time you tried to cross into what was German controlled territory, and he was arrested, and that was in May 1940, until well over a year and maybe in the summer, sometime 1941, is when you see him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: But my mother, when the war started – war between German and Russian, didn’t want us to – to be separated.</span> <span id="s1205">She found a job as a teacher in the country south of Warsaw, and I was staying with my aunt and traveling.</span> <span id="s1206">That was also something I was doing already 13, but traveling every day to school, which was illegal.</span> <span id="s1207">It was called – because after six years, it was only trade school.</span> <span id="s1208">So my school was called zabawkarska, something prepared to make toys.</span> <span id="s1209">So we had, I think nine hours of paint – drawing, and six hours of making something a week, a ye – a week, plus the normal courses.</span> <span id="s1210">But of course the normal books were kept at home only.</span> <span id="s1211">Teacher was saying and we were learning that way.</span> <span id="s1212">But – and I was traveling from Pruszków to Warsaw every day, and then I – I know that I had to have a photograph for my license, or some – no –</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: I.D.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: I – I.D. And so if you are 13 and never did that, to go to do it, it was something, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: It was probably very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Yes, I know that it was.</span> <span id="s1217">But when the war started, with the Germans attacked Russia, then my mother sa – came and take me to the country.</span> <span id="s1218">For two years, I was learning from books, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Can you hold – ho – excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: I want – hold that thought.</span> <span id="s1222">Can we cut for a second [break] Okay, so as I explained, I’d like to find out, before I forget, the sequence of events for your brother.</span> <span id="s1223">The last I understood is that he’s a scout, helping people when there are bombardments in Białystok, and bringing a man to – to a hospital, and someone criticized him for that.</span> <span id="s1224">And then he’s with the Boy Scouts, and they retreat – he was a scout, and they – they retreat and come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: Let me say one thing, because we’ll – we’ll show the – what kind of upbringing it was.</span> <span id="s1226">My brother started to smoke, and scouts were not supposed to smoke.</span> <span id="s1227">So he was going in the fall, say I’m – I cannot be a scout any more.</span> <span id="s1228">And my mother was in scouting, sh-she – she was smoking, she could not be the normal only was helping with camps and so on.</span> <span id="s1229">But she was very involved as well.</span> <span id="s1230">But my brother was going to say, I’m not going to be a scout because I cannot stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: And then the war started, so he, as a scout, went to help in that hospital, because he knew that’s more important than that, but he was going not to be involved.</span> <span id="s1233">But he was very involved in scouting.</span> <span id="s1234">Then here, when the – there was appeal to young men, and see, he was 16 only.</span> <span id="s1235">He went because he wanted to join the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Then he came back, and he was in school a little bit – well, he was – I don’t know, he was taking part in the – putting the cross on the wall.</span> <span id="s1238">But I don’t know whether it was [indecipherable] or there were others, it could be.</span> <span id="s1239">He told me also, that’s the first half o-of the – that’s ’39, that he joined some underground army, and a 16 telling her – his 12 year old sister, don’t tell anybody, but I’m in that.</span> <span id="s1240">And if they will tell me to shoot somebody, I’m going to shoot to kill.</span> <span id="s1241">A 16 year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: It’s frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: It’s hard thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: But he – I knew that he was already in something.</span> <span id="s1246">But then the Polish army was formed in France, and through Romania you could get there.</span> <span id="s1247">He was pretty tall.</span> <span id="s1248">He was 5’10” when he grew up.</span> <span id="s1249">But at that time he was pretty tall, straight, athletic.</span> <span id="s1250">And somebody stupid enough, who was going to take him through the border, told him to wait at the railway station.</span> <span id="s1251">He was arrested there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Excuse me, before we get there – so did –</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: [indecipherable] south of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1255">Di-Did your mother know that he was going to be going?</span> <span id="s1256">Did he tell her, or was this all –</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Yes, yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: – it was arranged.</span> <span id="s1260">That’s why he went after Christmas, so we will have Christmas together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: So, it was all arranged, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: But he never met my father, because my father came, I think February or March, home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: From – from Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1266">So, your brother i – makes his way down to southern Poland to get into Romania –</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: – and is – and is told to wait at this railway station.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1270">And he was arrested there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: By whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: By Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1276">So he’s arrested by the Soviets then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: And what do they do to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: He was in prison in Stanislav – Stanislavov.</span> <span id="s1280">That’s also a city south of Tarnopol.</span> <span id="s1281">Is – right now is Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Ukraine, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: From then he was sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1284">I know what’s happened from him from 13 letters, and I come to the letters later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: And that’s the only thing what I know.</span> <span id="s1287">I don’t know even where he was in Siberia.</span> <span id="s1288">When the – there was a park between Poland and Russia.</span> <span id="s1289">That was before Katyn, so at Katyn there, they started ignore us.</span> <span id="s1290">But they allowed people to go south and form an army, Anders’ Army, you heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: So this was after – after the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, there were many Polish people who were – had been sent to Siberia, who were then released, in order that they could go back and fight the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: And was he released under those kinds of conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Yes, but I don’t know much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: But he went down – apparently that – that was thousands of miles, many people just walked , or – I – how he did, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1297">But there was a first transport to be sent to England, those people who wanted to join Marines and air force.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: And he wanted to join Marines.</span> <span id="s1300">But since they were on the ship for a long, long time, I think they had to go around Africa.</span> <span id="s1301">A friend told him, join the air force.</span> <span id="s1302">So he wanted to join the air force, but since he – he was hungry for long, long time, his eyesight was not very good, so he could not be a pilot, only the navigator.</span> <span id="s1303">So he was a navigator, he was trained in Canada, and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Let’s break a bit, excuse me.</span> <span id="s1305">[break] Okay, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: He flew in [indecipherable] was na-navigator, 50 – 50 times.</span> <span id="s1307">That’s it – one tour.</span> <span id="s1308">Later they changed to a hundred or 150, I think.</span> <span id="s1309">But at that time it was beginning, it was only 50.</span> <span id="s1310">So he flew 50 over Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Fifty missions over Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Fifty missions over Germany.</span> <span id="s1313">And he was only slightly injured once, that’s what he said.</span> <span id="s1314">Afterwards, he was send to a school for officers, and that’s usually in Polish army it’s only when you have the high school finished, and he had only 10 – 10 grades, but he was sent that.</span> <span id="s1315">And the war ended in Europe in May, I believe.</span> <span id="s1316">In – since he was not in fighting army at that time, fi – fighting air force, air force was under the British command.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: RAF.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: RAF.</span> <span id="s1319">He was sent in a different – he was flying the mission in Mosquito.</span> <span id="s1320">This, I thin – believe two – two people plane.</span> <span

id="s1323">That was when he was coming back on 27 on July, same year.</span> <span id="s1324">Most likely, lightning strike it, close to Marseilles, and they all died.</span> <span id="s1325">The youngest one was 19.</span> <span id="s1326">Survived the war, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: So he died after –</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: – the war.</span> <span id="s1330">Did you ever see him then, again –</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: – from the time he had –</span></p> <p><span

believed that he’s alive.</span> <span id="s1338">My parents thought that he died.</span> <span id="s1339">Well, during – well, I have to come back to that.</span> <span id="s1340">Maybe right now.</span> <span id="s1341">When I was in – and my mother were in the prison of war camp, after the insurrection, and there was a list of people sent [indecipherable] on the Polish – part of Polish army [indecipherable] get freedom to our camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Liberate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: And so the list of Polish women, it was close to 2,000, was sent to England and my father was – my brother was looking through it whether my mother was there, and he was surprised to find me.</span> <span id="s1346">So we star – started to exchange letters, and he sent me 13 letters.</span> <span id="s1347">So all I know about him is from those letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: You have those letters still?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1351">They must be very precious for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: He wanted me and my mother to come to England, so he was trying – nothing happened, he wrote that he bought some stockings for me, and that was very difficult at that – just after war.</span> <span id="s1353">He wrote a letter to the queen, and in a week he get an answer from the secretary.</span> <span id="s1354">So le – let’s hope that everybody will work like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: And of course the letter was, I’m sorry, I cannot do anything about it.</span> <span id="s1357">I – I hope that it will – so he never managed to get us to England.</span> <span id="s1358">A-After he died, is the man who was in Tarnopol that told my father that – oh, by then, my – my father was in Murnau, that was camp for officers.</span> <span id="s1359">He came to us.</span> <span id="s1360">Everybody was going like that.</span> <span id="s1361">Autostop through the ger – we – we traveled through Germany,

and that on the page.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: So you had homework.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: And then we would come – yes, under German occ-occupation then.</span> <span id="s1443">And the teacher would ask who had trouble with school.</span> <span id="s1444">And somebody would say, I cannot do the third one.</span> <span id="s1445">So come to the blackboard and we’ll explain.</span> <span id="s1446">That was the kind of le – teaching usually when you’re in school you do not say that you cannot do something.</span> <span id="s1447">There it was the opposite.</span> <span id="s1448">And at that school – I should really come late – when I was in – in the country with my mother, my only problem, she didn’t know Latin, and in Polish school you have to have Latin.</span> <span id="s1449">So I had trouble with Latin later on when I was in proper school.</span> <span id="s1450">But it was cold, it was a very old building, and it was wet.</span> <span id="s1451">So my mother – it was on the second floor, we lived on second – that was where the teacher lived.</span> <span id="s1452">And on the first floor my – my mother would go and teach kids, and I was in bed with my coat, and on the walls during the winter, there was frost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: So you – on the inside of the walls of the building –</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: It was still –</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: – it was frosty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Yes, we had only one out of – we had four rooms, I think, or two rooms.</span> <span id="s1457">There was one stove, but we didn’t had –</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Have heat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1460">And there was a small rail close by.</span> <span id="s1461">So I – my mother and would go and that train was using coal, so from time to time something would fall, so we were looking for granules of coal.</span> <span id="s1462">And yes, it was cold.</span> <span id="s1463">But my father said no, you – you cannot be there, you have to go to school.</span> <span id="s1464">How he found the school, through whom that they would trust me that they would be there, because of course, everybody could always say something.</span> <span id="s1465">So my moth – my father –</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: I’m sorry, I need to interrupt a little bit, just to clarify.</span> <span id="s1467">Your mother is in this village outside of Warsaw and she’s teaching legally, because the children are younger than sixth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: So she’s earning a salary by doing it, and doesn’t have to worry about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Except that the salary was roughly the same salary as before the war, and the prices went up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Luckily, custom in the village is to bring two eggs, to bring an apple, to bring something.</span> <span id="s1473">And we had a little plot of land where we could grow something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: Not too much, but something, as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: So when your father comes back from having been released from prison –</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: – in about the summer of 1941, does he find you and your mother in this village?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: Yes, because he had sister in pr – Pruszków, which is close to Warsaw, and his parents in Warsaw itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: Sorry, not parents, my grandfather died in ’39, where Germans was fighting about Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1482">And my grandmother was very, very frightened of everything, and everybody thought that if you go to the cellar it will be safer, and everybody was going to the cellar, and somebody pushed my grandfather – by – by chance.</span> <span id="s1483">He fell, and was unconscious til – til the very end of the – of his life.</span> <span id="s1484">And that was soon after Germans took Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1485">But my mo – my grandmother was very, very frightened, so she took him to – to his bedroom, second or third floor, I don’t remember, instead of going to the cellar where –</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Everybody else was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: And she put, not to hear so much noise, she put her – what’s – what do you call?</span> <span id="s1488">Something what you cover yourself in bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Blankets, duvets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Not blanket, but something fluffy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Something fluffy?</span> <span id="s1492">A quilt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1494">She put the quilt into the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: Windows?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: – windows, so that she wouldn’t hear so much, and stayed with him all that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1498">And yet she –</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: She died soon after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Did she, yeah.</span> <span id="s1501">And so your father, when he came back, he found you with your mother together –</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: – in this one – and how – did he move in with you, or did he move you to Warsaw?</span> <span id="s1504">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: No, he went to Warsaw by himself, and joined the [indecipherable] army [speaks Polish].</span> <span id="s1506">That was before Armia Kryova.</span> <span id="s1507">Armia Kryova is home army.</span> <span id="s1508">[speaks Polish] – when I joined, it was Armia Kryova.</span> <span id="s1509">And after a time, it was beginning of 1943, he took me to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1510">And on the very beginning I had to have some papers, safe papers, because without the papers anybody could be sent to Germany straight away.</span> <span id="s1511">So I was working to Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1512">I was in archives, so I learned how to put it.</span> <span id="s1513">Everything was what finished, I was supposed to put in the sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: I didn’t know at that time, but the daughter of my boss, she was in Armia Kryova, so maybe that’s where I – my father found the work for me.</span> <span id="s1516">And another thing he said, that time there came a – through Red Cross, a letter, which I remember by heart.</span> <span id="s1517">I’m okay.</span> <span id="s1518">I only lack news about you.</span> <span id="s1519">In Polish it was.</span> <span id="s1520">And so I hope that – that came before that, about two or three months earlier.</span> <span id="s1521">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Who was it from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: From my brother.</span> <span id="s1524">Through Red Cross you can get the message like that, it’s open message.</span> <span id="s1525">And it came to my aunt, because he knew – he didn’t know that we were in Warsaw at that time.</span> <span id="s1526">He didn’t know anything about us.</span> <span id="s1527">We didn’t know – but th – for the first time we learned that he is alive.</span> <span id="s1528">I always believed, but my parents thought that he didn’t – that he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: They didn’t know that he had been arrested.</span> <span id="s1530">They didn’t know that he –</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: He learn – my father learn about him being arrested when he was in prison.</span> <span id="s1532">Somebody apparently was transferred from one prison to another.</span> <span id="s1533">So my father learned there.</span> <span id="s1534">Because we thought the he went to France and maybe he died there –</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: – fighting with the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: But instead my father learn, and because of that, after he was released finally from –</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: – prison, he went and waited in Białystok –</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: – because he thought that maybe my brother will also come.</span> <span id="s1543">But my brother was arrested half a year earlier.</span> <span id="s1544">Almost half a year.</span> <span id="s1545">So, he was already sent out to prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: So your mother, did she stay the entire war in this village, teaching in that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: Up to the first days of insurrection in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: In my – bef – well, first of all, my father – I thought that – about the father, you always think that he’s old.</span> <span id="s1550">In ’43, he was 45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Oh, that’s young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: And he didn’t know what his only son did, but he took his daughter, me, into the army.</span> <span id="s1553">So I joined the a – joined the army, I – my solemn swearing was on the fifth of August, but much before that, I was already the messenger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: So you were in Armia Kryova.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: Armia Kryova.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: And your s – and your swearing in was fifth of August, 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Yes, but I was much before that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: – because during the summer I was working in those ar – archives, and I was definitely at that time already in the Armia Kryova.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: So that meant you were 15 years old, 16 years old, something –</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Sixteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Sixteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Sixteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Sixteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: And so what I was doing, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1566">First of all, my father was at the command of the [Polish].</span> <span id="s1567">Middle force, it was divided into, I think four pieces.</span> <span id="s1568">And he was in the second on in the comman – command of the second one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1570">The second sort of area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: And he was not the commander, he was in the command.</span> <span id="s1572">He – one of his things wa – jobs was taking care of the five messengers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: In between I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: And you were one of the five?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Wa – one of the five.</span> <span id="s1577">And the whole structure, wherever it was possible, was the fifth, because you expect that if somebody will be arrested a day or two, he may su-survive the tre –</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Torture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: Torture.</span> <span id="s1580">But you cannot count for always.</span> <span id="s1581">And because of that, if it’s only five people who know each other, then you can told this for disappear, because somebody is already there.</span> <span id="s1582">And that way it was safer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: So, did any of the five that you were part of a group, did any of them get arrested by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: But one died, I have to tell you, because well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: Please do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: – if – instead of me.</span> <span id="s1589">But anyway, just before the commander of that second [indecipherable], was – had tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s1590">In a very bad shape, and he had to be in hospital.</span> <span id="s1591">And of course, if somebody will say anything, so in hospital you cannot run away from it.</span> <span id="s1592">So, he didn’t have children – he survived the insurrection.</span> <span id="s1593">Only his wife, his second-in-command and I knew where he was.</span> <span id="s1594">So if something were – messages to him were going through me.</span> <span id="s1595">Because if, for instance, my father did not know in hos – which hospital, nothing.</span> <span id="s1596">So he was safe.</span> <span id="s1597">He went out of the hospital, I think about a month before insurrection.</span> <span id="s1598">And my biggest experience during the insurrection was, I was just trying to find out what – we know the date, but what day of the week it was.</span> <span id="s1599">It was – insurrection started Tuesday.</span> <span id="s1600">And we have in the yard of the house where was the command, we have the mass for soldiers.</span> <span id="s1601">So it was not the first day.</span> <span id="s1602">Is on a Sunday then.</span> <span id="s1603">And after that he came to me and ask me, how do you feel in free Poland?</span> <span id="s1604">And I looked at them, I remember that I did not know what to say, and I don’t remember wha – after that I say.</span> <span id="s1605">But finally I realize, this little piece of land is free Poland.</span> <span id="s1606">And for me the whole insurrection was because of that, I was in free Poland.</span> <span id="s1607">People were dying around me, I could die as well, but the – the important thing is, we are already in free Poland.</span> <span id="s1608">That little piece is ours.</span> <span id="s1609">And that changed my whole look at the – peoples say trad – tragedy, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1610">To me it was something, fight in free Poland.</span> <span id="s1611">And that’s what – what he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Who was this person who said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: He – he was the commander of the second –</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Ah, the one who had been in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Yes, that’s one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: And so his –</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: And under him there were 2,000 people prepared.</span> <span id="s1618">I learn later, from another – in his command there were a man who was taking care of something, as – I don’t – don’t know what’s the in command, in – in – in military, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1619">But he told me that there were two – 2,000 people in that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Do you remember his name, the commander?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: His sa – surname was Litvin(ph).</span> <span id="s1622">Oh, I’ll tell you later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: I – I know his name.</span> <span id="s1625">And it happened that after the war he was in Gdansk and my – one of my aunts was there, and they met.</span> <span id="s1626">So [indecipherable] Abramovicz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: Abramovicz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Abramovicz was first name – don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Litvin(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: So his last name was Abramovicz(ph)?</span> <span id="s1632">His surname was Abramovicz(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: Abramovicz(ph) and Litvin(ph) is his –</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: A pseudonym.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: – pseudonym.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1637">Actually, it sounds like a Jewish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: I don’t think he was Jewish, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: No?</span> <span id="s1640">I heard that quite a few people were a part of the insurrection, the Warsaw uprising, who were of Jewish background.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: Definitely yes.</span> <span id="s1642">And I’ll have to tell you all about my little hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Okay, tell –</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: Anyway –</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: – I lived through the insurrection in that part of Poland, in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: We – we never had to go through the nin – sewers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: So it was the safest.</span> <span id="s1651">But anyway, one day somebody was silly enough to say that all people who went from old city, where the fighting was the worst, should sign that they – they knew.</span> <span id="s1652">And they were gathering around the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: They should sign something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1655">They should be who survived and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: And Germans were flying over that, and people were coming to that.</span> <span id="s1658">And we were supposed to work there, our five.</span> <span id="s1659">And the top of our five was a chemist, and she came after her shift, she came for me, and I was asleep.</span> <span id="s1660">And she said, well, she’s so fast asleep, I’ll go back.</span> <span id="s1661">And she died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: She was bombed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: They were bombed.</span> <span id="s1664">Of course, when everybody is gathering, it’s worthwhile.</span> <span id="s1665">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: So do you think was done on purpose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: German did it on purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Yeah, yeah, but the – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: No, no, that was a silly comment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: People are always silly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Once I remember I was going somewhere.</span> <span id="s1674">There was a lot of blood on – and that was terrible, I never seen.</span> <span id="s1675">There was somebody – we had [indecipherable] something we – when you, every day you say – say apple, and you have to answer pear –</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Oh, you had a password.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: Passwords.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: And somebody who came from old city, where the fighting was the worst, when they came through the sewers, which were – not everybody survived.</span> <span id="s1680">And he thought, well, here is everything, you walk like that.</span> <span id="s1681">And somebody ask him at night, what it is the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: The password.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: Password.</span> <span id="s1684">And he didn’t say.</span> <span id="s1685">And the – the one who was asking was saying stop and so on, and he didn’t stop because it’s a safe way.</span> <span id="s1686">And he was killed by that.</span> <span id="s1687">But, it was right, they never knew what it.</span> <span id="s1688">So I was in the insurrection up to the very end.</span> <span id="s1689">And when Polish people managed to get the – Germans called us bandits, but [indecipherable] they really had trouble with us.</span> <span id="s1690">We were prepared for, I think three days of fighting and three days of ammunition.</span> <span id="s1691">I have to back then, year earlier, to Holocaust as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: I want to talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: Yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: I want to talk about the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: – definitely.</span> <span id="s1696">But here I – I want to go to – to my little hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Okay, come –</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: We were sent to Sandbostel, my mother and I, and my father as well.</span> <span id="s1699">Then, the officers –</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: What is Zen Boston, what is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: The name in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: And what was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: The camp for – soldiers camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: So you’re talking about prisoner camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Prisoner camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: So you’ve jumped between – you know, you had three days of ammunition left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: The insurrection was 63 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: And at the end of that, Germans wanted to get rid of us, so they said, we are not bandits, we’re soldiers.</span> <span id="s1712">And from that on, Germans treated us properly, definitely properly, because we were in Sandbostel, somewheres and somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1713">And my father, from that camp went to Murnau, where is only for officers –</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: – also.</span> <span id="s1716">And I don’t remember, but I think it was before the Christmas that we were sent to Oberlangen.</span> <span id="s1717">Oberlangen is close to border of Holland, with empty space all around us.</span> <span id="s1718">And they sent one after another, they sent women from other prisoners of war, which was definitely very safer for us.</span> <span id="s1719">My father said that in Sandbostel they were – Polish men were prepared that if we will be freed, they will try to go at any place to our camp, our –</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: – area, because there are men who are four or five years without women.</span> <span id="s1722">So Germans took all the women.</span> <span id="s1723">Before that they ask who wants to work in th – in the country, or something.</span> <span id="s1724">I think it was volunteer everywhere, that m-maybe there was pressure on women, but definitely not pressure on the – physical pressure.</span> <span id="s1725">No, not physical pressure, psychological pressure.</span> <span id="s1726">Because a lot of women from the prisoner of camp went to work somewhere.</span> <span id="s1727">But we went, just sent to that one camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: I want to interrupt you just for a second, just so that we have the chronology right.</span> <span id="s1729">The uprising starts on August 1st, 1944, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: It lasts for 63 days, which means that by early October it has been quashed, at which point you’re taken prisoner –</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: – and your mother is taken prisoner, and your father is taken prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Were you together at the time, all three of you, or were you separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: For a day or two we were together.</span> <span id="s1737">We were marched, I think about 20 kilometers to Ożarów, and then in a very big camp, and then men was separated from women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: And then you were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: But we were taken as ordinary soldiers, already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: And so then you were put on cattle cars, is that right, on trains to go to Sandbostel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: That’s not comfortable, but is nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: So, when you get to Sandbostel, you are there for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Most likely before Christmas, but I’m not sure whether it before or after Christmas.</span> <span id="s1746">Then we were taken to Oberlangen, which was an empty space –</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: – with only us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Only women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: Only women, from a different camp.</span> <span id="s1751">I was in the second barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: And your – and this was still done by the Germans together, and this was done – did you know why they did this?</span> <span id="s1753">What was the reasoning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Why they took all the women together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: And – yeah, and put them together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: I’m thinking because they thought that it was safer.</span> <span id="s1757">They was done properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: And we were even received three – three times I think, a parcel from Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1760">On-Only three, usually it would be more, food or something.</span> <span id="s1761">Once they sent hygienic things for women, and I learned then everybo – well, we had the little hospital there, for us, and so it was useful.</span> <span id="s1762">But, more than half of women did not have the usual period, because of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: Stress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: Not only stress, hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: We were given food, but Germans didn’t have much of that.</span> <span id="s1767">We had to work in the kitchen for ourselves, so that’s all again – according to a Geneva Convention.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: I cannot say that – somebody once said that it was a special camp or something.</span> <span id="s1770">It was the proper camp, they treated us properly.</span> <span id="s1771">We had to go out to bring the potatoes, but I had unusual smell, and they ask me very often, what is in this soup?</span> <span id="s1772">And I would say that the soup is with salt, or without.</span> <span id="s1773">Sometimes they didn’t have salt.</span> <span id="s1774">I cannot say more salty or less, but salt, or without salt, I could smell it at that time.</span> <span id="s1775">So they always ask me, I never made the mistake.</span> <span id="s1776">So you see –</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: That’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: – it was so little –</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: – that – that – well, we were doing everything.</span> <span id="s1781">We could do during the day whatever we wanted to.</span> <span id="s1782">The restroom were outside, of course, not inside.</span> <span id="s1783">And in one empty hut there was water broken, and even the winter there, it was flowing there, so we would go there, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: So the ice was broken, so there was some water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: No, it was broken, ne-never repaired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: Oh, you mean the fau –</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: But it was an empty one.</span> <span id="s1788">So we were – walked around, there were ma-maybe 10 huts, and only four or five were occupied.</span> <span id="s1789">Altogether we were close to 2,000, I believe.</span> <span id="s1790">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: So how large was a hut?</span> <span id="s1792">How many people fit into one hut?</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: About 200.</span> <span id="s1794">And it was three – well, three level of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Well, they were huts, rather than buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: Of course, because – and we could wash at the end of the – but to the restroom, we would have to go outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1798">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: But three levels, and of course there were wood, and shins – wood planks, and in the middle of it, there was a stove.</span> <span id="s1800">And of course, from time to time we took one plank.</span> <span id="s1801">And so sometimes it was difficult to sleep, no, not to fall down, because on that we had shen-nikeetsa(ph), big bag with straw inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1803">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: So – but – and how did I got the – it was close to Dutch border, I had wooden shoes, and for instance, one of my things was how to walk at night.</span> <span id="s1805">How did I walk to that restroom there on night, so nobody would hear it?</span> <span id="s1806">Try to walk in the wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1807">So that was something what to occupy me, when we didn’t had any pers – anything, we learn history.</span> <span id="s1808">I started to learn – I-I started to learn English before that, but we had one book.</span> <span id="s1809">It was [indecipherable] something like that, it – a some book on lowest level, about some murder or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Like a detective novel or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: M-Most likely detective novel.</span> <span id="s1812">But the three girls who we-were learning from somebody who knew that, were on much better progress, so I was learning what is here, there, at, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: So they were learning English from the detective novel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Yes, because we had that detective novel.</span> <span id="s1815">And it’s still – in Sandbostel we used to walk up and down the corridor there.</span> <span id="s1816">There we were in such a crowd that when we were sleeping on the floor, if we want to turn around, everybody would have to turn around.</span> <span id="s1817">But there was a corridor on which we could not walk during the night, but during the day.</span> <span id="s1818">And I and two other girls who were learning English – English was not popular in before the war, only French and German.</span> <span id="s1819">Russian, we had to learn later, but wasn’t popular.</span> <span id="s1820">But anyway, so we were talking the whole Polish sentence with one word English which we knew, not to forget.</span> <span id="s1821">But then in Oberlangen it was already something like that.</span> <span id="s1822">And of course if we were bored, and if somebody knew something about the subject, there was a conference about that and everybody would cool – come and so it was ordinary –</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Prisoner of war –</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Prisoner of war camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: – camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: And definitely Germans treated – well, sometimes we, if they couldn’t count correct – nobody run away from the camp, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1827">But if they couldn’t count everybody, because everybody would have to come –</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: – but somebody sick maybe, we could stand for two or three hours.</span> <span id="s1830">But that’s the usual in camp.</span> <span id="s1831">Opposite us, opposite this four or five huts, were the others, and there was that little hospital, which we had for – and also, during that morning and evening –</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: Appel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: – count of us, there were boys.</span> <span id="s1834">There were soldiers.</span> <span id="s1835">They were – the oldest one, most likely 12 or 13, and he would say, on top, march, look that, and so on, because they have to be counted.</span> <span id="s1836">They were soldiers.</span> <span id="s1837">In my hut, there were two sisters –</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: Also, prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: Yes, prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: Prisoner of war, too, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: They were, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: And in my camp, I learned later that bo-both went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1844">We knew they were Jewish, we can hear a Jewish accent.</span> <span id="s1845">It’s a some sort of accent, I don’t know whether I would be able to recognize right now.</span> <span id="s1846">Jewish people had that accent, and the best educated had the best Polish, no accent at all.</span> <span id="s1847">You hear the much better pronunciation that others.</span> <span id="s1848">But the just ordinary people had some sort of accent which we could recognize.</span> <span id="s1849">They definitely had, and the older one looked like Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s1850">So – with the f-face.</span> <span id="s1851">Nobody ever mentioned that they were Jewish, of course, because we never knew whether they – even as prisoner of war, whether they would not be taken out.</span> <span id="s1852">And I was talking to that little one.</span> <span id="s1853">I think that she was about 10.</span> <span id="s1854">Apparently, she joined the insurrection, and was a messenger, as I was.</span> <span id="s1855">And she said her biggest trouble was that when she was sent with messages to people [indecipherable] somewhere in there, and she should not ask people where to go if she mistake it.</span> <span id="s1856">And she could not read, so she was putting the messages in between her fingers to remember to whom she has to go and show, if she ge-get more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: She didn’t know how to read?</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: No.</span> <span id="s1859">Apparently she was in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1860">There was no schools.</span> <span id="s1861">Because she must have been –</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: – at least nine, but I think she was about 10.</span> <span id="s1864">And so that’s was a soldier, that’s my little hero – hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: Aye aye, aye aye.</span> <span id="s1866">So she would in – because she didn’t know how to read, she would put –</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: She was putting in t – in between her fingers to remember, because she could not ask somebody on the street.</span> <span id="s1868">She would never know who is that person.</span> <span id="s1869">So, what she did before, for that year, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1870">Maybe she was singing in the streetcars, or so on.</span> <span id="s1871">There were some songs against Germans, which the – the streetcars were so crowded, and nobody would s – would [indecipherable] anything.</span> <span id="s1872">What they did before, I did not ask.</span> <span id="s1873">And apparently – I don’t think that she would be alone with her sister.</span> <span id="s1874">I don’t know whether it was her sister, they used the same name, last name.</span> <span id="s1875">But they were so different.</span> <span id="s1876">One was – my little hero was blonde, and the other one was dark.</span> <span id="s1877">Everybody liked the little one, we didn’t like very much the other one.</span> <span id="s1878">They completely different.</span> <span id="s1879">Most likely they just lived together, maybe they were sisters, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1880">But definitely – I don’t remember where I heard, there was a list of people who – women who were in the camp.</span> <span id="s1881">But then with the age, but I couldn’t find someones who would be – I didn’t know exactly what their age.</span> <span id="s1882">But le –</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: Were there more Jewish young women who were in the ca – in this prisoner of war camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: I don’t know definitely.</span> <span id="s1885">I’m sure that there were more, but this two were in the hut where I was, and I – somehow I talked with that – that little one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: And do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1889">And the – and back in Warsaw, during the insurrection and even before in the resistance activities, did – did you see any people who were Jewish, who were part of these activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: No, I was not close to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: People in France, for instance, people would be punished, but not us in Poland.</span> <span id="s1893">In Poland you must have heard about many people who kept Jewish people hiding.</span> <span id="s1894">And if they would find, the whole family, including small children, would be killed.</span> <span id="s1895">I was not close to that.</span> <span id="s1896">Now, I lived in Warsaw, very close to ge – ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: Tell me, what did you see there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: When you lived close to the ghetto, what did you remember seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: That I have to tell you, the ghetto was fighting.</span> <span id="s1901">First of all, there was a very big wall with the barb wire –</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: Barbed wire, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: – on top of that.</span> <span id="s1904">I think eight feet, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1905">On the other side I was walking very often Żelazna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: Żelazna, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: And so that was – and I think, but right now I don’t remember, but I think that the gate, very often before the insurrection in – in the ghetto, the little children sometimes were walking here and there, maybe begging or something, and I think that Germans allowed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: To walk outside the gate, into the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: A little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: A few steps.</span> <span id="s1912">But I don’t really know whether I remember it right.</span> <span id="s1913">I think that it was that it was possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: Were you ever inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: No, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: Well, sometimes when you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: I wouldn’t get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1919">In the early days I have had some other people say there were streetcars that would go through, and so they could take the streetcar in.</span> <span id="s1920">But that was in the early days of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: There was small ghetto and big ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: I don’t remember next to Żelazna where I was walking, whether that was big or little one, right.</span> <span id="s1924">And in between there was a street, so you could see it, and people could go from one ghetto to another over that.</span> <span id="s1925">And that was – now, one of them, the one which was farther away from me, started to fight a few days earlier, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1926">And then I was walking – we were shocked [indecipherable] we knew that they cannot survive, nothing will – there was a Polish underground and Jewish underground, there were some connection, but we didn’t have a lot of ammunition or anything, even for – for our-ourselves, so we didn’t have later.</span> <span id="s1927">So we couldn’t help, we just had to look helplessly.</span> <span id="s1928">And we were sorry, looking at – at people who were dying there.</span> <span id="s1929">But on the very beginning, on that – that other ghetto, other part was fighting and this one not.</span> <span id="s1930">When I was going through Żelazna street, and over that big wall, I could see a woman – it was April, it was warm enough, she was looking through the window down there.</span> <span id="s1931">They were not fighting.</span> <span id="s1932">And she was maybe even smiling.</span> <span id="s1933">She was definitely not – not horrified, not frightened.</span> <span id="s1934">She was talking to somebody with – it couldn’t – you couldn’t say joy, I – I don’t have the word for that.</span> <span id="s1935">But I was horrified.</span> <span id="s1936">How could she be so calm, when she is going to die pretty soon?</span> <span id="s1937">Where her people are dying?</span> <span id="s1938">It took me a few years to understand that she was proud.</span> <span id="s1939">She knew what’s waiting for her, and I s – I still can see her how it was, and she took it nicely.</span> <span id="s1940">She was glad that – that they fighting and not – not allowing to be martyred by – by themselves.</span> <span id="s1941">It – it give me a – an impression, because we were horrified.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: Well, that stayed with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: That image has stayed with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: A few weeks or months later, my father – I used to go by streetcar next to all get – the ghetto was always closed to us, afterwards as well.</span> <span id="s1946">There was streetcar, and he said, don’t go by streetcar today, not this one, because Germans put – hung some people and so high, so you could see it from streetcar, and there were dead people there.</span> <span id="s1947">So Germans weren’t nice to us.</span> <span id="s1948">And we learn only that during the insurrection, that there was a prison there, and some people were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: Were hung?</span> <span id="s1950">Were executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: Re-Rescued then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: Ah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: And we didn’t know that there was a prison there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: Which prison was it?</span> <span id="s1955">There’s a Pawiak prison, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: No, no, Pawiak, he was somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1957">It was after – after ghetto da – it was – after the Holocaust –</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: – there was a prison there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: Within the – within the area of what the ghetto had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1963">Had you – you know, did people outside the ghetto know of the transports?</span> <span id="s1964">That is that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: On the very beginning, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1966">I knew quite a lot because of my father pretty high position in – in the army.</span> <span id="s1967">So, for instance, when Russians were coming and are close to Wilno, people were saying we’re Armia Kryova.</span> <span id="s1968">At first they were treated nicely, but then they were prison there, something.</span> <span id="s1969">So, before the insurrection, we knew already what was really expecting us, that unless we’ll be strong enough to get Warsaw before the Russians would come in, but they stop, and they didn’t want the allies to – to come in London, whatever, once more they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: – they did whatever they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: Excuse me for a second, we’ve got people talking out here.</span> <span id="s1973">[break] We’re going – we’re going to repeat some of the things we were talking about now, because there was some background noise.</span> <span id="s1974">I was asking you, did you know of – of transports of Jews outside of the ghetto, while you were in Warsaw proper.</span> <span id="s1975">What was happening to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: Maybe later we knew.</span> <span id="s1977">On the very beginning, nobody knows.</span> <span id="s1978">When ghetto was starting, some couple which were Christian and Russian – and Jewish, they could choose the – at least the wife could stay outside.</span> <span id="s1979">They usually would choose to go to ghetto together –</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: – because nobody expected that.</span> <span id="s1982">They expected that people will be separated, but not that.</span> <span id="s1983">Later they knew and most likely we know.</span> <span id="s1984">But for quite a time Jewish people didn’t know that when there is a transport, the transport is to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: So did you know the na – did the – did the terms Auschwitz mean something in 1942 and 1943?</span> <span id="s1986">Did the term Treblinka mean something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: I don’t know when it’s come.</span> <span id="s1988">Before the insurrection, before the ghetto up-uprising, we already knew, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: – how long before that, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1992">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: Because we – we knew that German want to kill all the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: So you did know that.</span> <span id="s1995">You did know that there was – there was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: But not on the very beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: On the very beginning we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: Did you ever, or did your father ever see any Jews being taken from the ghetto to the train station for such a transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">A: And I never – well, walking around in there, there was that gate.</span> <span id="s2003">I never seen it, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: So, most likely they were already driven by some – something.</span> <span id="s2006">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2007">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: So during the war I was not involved with any Jewish peop – person trying to get away, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s2010">I think that I knew the name of a person who was most active in ghetto.</span> <span id="s2011">If you say the name I will tell you that, yes.</span> <span id="s2012">But – so we know that there is a underground there, but we knew that everybody is helpless.</span> <span id="s2013">The – our insurrection was prepared for three days only, because we didn’t have the ammunition for everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Oh, so when you were telling me about three days, it – and it ended up being 63 days –</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: That’s what you were explaining.</span> <span id="s2017">Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2019">Some was taken from Germans, some was – but very little from the – being thrown by allies, but not Russians.</span> <span id="s2020">The Russians, on the very end, helped and they s – threw some bread, I had some bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: Oh really?</span> <span id="s2022">Some bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2024">Completely dry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: We were hungry, but it was the ammunition which we needed.</span> <span id="s2027">And they did not let the allies planes land on their side.</span> <span id="s2028">And because of that there was a lot of people lost because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q: So, were – were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A: Russians stopped, because they wanted us to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: Y-You mean the Russian forces were already at Warsaw and they –</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: Close to Warsaw –</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: – yes, and they stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: The –</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: And had the – and were the insurrections, the people from the uprising, were they expecting the Russians to come over the – and help out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: Definitely, because they were our allies.</span> <span id="s2039">We were not in good – in terms with – with them, because of Katyn, and that time only Katyn, not – not the other camps.</span> <span id="s2040">So it was broken without us, but I think [indecipherable] went to see Stalin just before that, and Stalin didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2041">And no di – they were definitely wanted us to – to be killed off.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: So tell me a little bit – I’d like to get a sense of how – by the time the news about Katyn was revealed, when the Germans found the site of the massacre of the 4,000 Polish soldiers – Polish military men, were you already in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: I was in Warsaw, I don’t remember when it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q: Do you remember learning about Katyn in – while you were in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A: Straightaway, because we knew.</span> <span id="s2046">The Germans allowed the Polish Red Cross, because they wanted everybody to know what Russians did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: So, there was all the news we knew, and since people were killed in – with their all uniform, there were some papers and things like that, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: So they had identification with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: Identification.</span> <span id="s2051">We had not di – doubts that it was the Russians who did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: And were you working at the Red Cross when this news came in, or was this before that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">A: I think it was later, could have been later.</span> <span id="s2054">I don’t remember when it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2056">And you mentioned to me earlier when we were not taping, that your father recognized some names.</span> <span id="s2057">Can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: First of all, the – he was the first one to sign that he wants to come back to his family.</span> <span id="s2059">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: That’s when he’s still in Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: In Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: And then the first transport went out, and he was not on that, so he went back to, most likely the camp – Polish people in the camp, who signed him, and he said, why not I should be?</span> <span id="s2064">And then in the third one, I’m sure that he knew the names, because there was a ter – transport from there.</span> <span id="s2065">I think that Katyn was not only from his camp, but from the others as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2068">I don’t know what the name of his camp was, but definitely he was in the second transport, not the first one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: Okay, and so when – when you learned about Katyn –</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: We knew what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: Yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: Only then we learned, because we – before that we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Did he recognize some of the names of the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: Yes, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2076">So when he – when the identification list was made, he recognized that some of these people had been in this camp with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: Yes, because he would not know that the – there was a thir – third transport.</span> <span id="s2078">They could be from everywhere, but he recognized it – he knew that third one went there as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: I see, I see.</span> <span id="s2080">So there was no – no doubt in your minds that this was not just German propaganda, this was actually true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: We knew, we knew, because Germans wanted everybody to know, and because of that they allowed the Red Cross, Polish Red Cross to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: And recognize.</span> <span id="s2084">And there were letters and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2085">Yes, we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: So let’s go back to Oberlangen, where you are, you know, you’re – you’re there with about 2,000 other women, prisoners of war, and it’s now like the winter of 1945, the war is coming to an end.</span> <span id="s2087">Did people in the camp n – have that feeling that it’s not going to be a lot – long now before it’s all over?</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: Yes, we believe that.</span> <span id="s2089">And it was funny incidents, there were people in Polish army under British command, and they stopped not close to our camp, and Germans ask, why do you stop here for the night?</span> <span id="s2090">Why your women are there?</span> <span id="s2091">Because Germans knew.</span> <span id="s2092">And so they went.</span> <span id="s2093">I think we were rescued about five or six o’clock in the afternoon, because they did not know that there was camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">Q: So you were liberated by Polish forces?</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">A: Polish forces, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q: Oh, that must have been something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A: And that was before the end of the war, about a month, I think about a month.</span> <span id="s2098">It was April.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q: It was April?</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2102">So that’s the first time you’re free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: Aside from the time you were in free Poland in that little courtyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: This is when you were – what happened to you?</span> <span id="s2107">What did – what –</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: Well, after we learn in July that my s – most likely it was beginning of August that we learned that he died, on 27 of July, we decided to go and join our Anders’ Army in Italy.</span> <span id="s2109">And the detail –</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: Excuse me, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s2111">Your mother was with you in Oberlangen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: Yes, and my –</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: And where was your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: – father came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: To Oberlangen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: Okay, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: Just to tell the news.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: And we went there, and it was the last month when somebody could still join the army.</span> <span id="s2121">The Anders’ Army was mainly from Siberia, but also quite a lot of people came who were taken to German army, and they would go through the – to Polish – Polish people who were under the occupied person, and they were forcibly joined the German army.</span> <span id="s2122">So a lot of people came like that, to them.</span> <span id="s2123">But, since the war was over, they was not taking any new people.</span> <span id="s2124">But – and at that time we could not go to England.</span> <span id="s2125">My brother was trying and didn’t before he – he died.</span> <span id="s2126">And so we’re – we were in Italy.</span> <span id="s2127">I was in Porto San Giorgio, and that was [indecipherable] Italy.</span> <span id="s2128">And there was a school for girls who didn’t finish.</span> <span id="s2129">So there were some from the Polish insurrection, some were through ho – went through Siberia.</span> <span id="s2130">One of my friend was a tall, well-built woman – girl, at that time.</span> <span id="s2131">She was in Siberia, she was working in the forest cutting the trees.</span> <span id="s2132">So that’s not exactly a woman job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">A: But otherwise we – we didn’t talk a lot.</span> <span id="s2135">One was – most of them were driving trucks to supply there.</span> <span id="s2136">And one of them said that when it was very hot, th-they would put wet sheets on them to – to cool themselves.</span> <span id="s2137">But otherwise they didn’t say how –</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: What their Siberian experiences were, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: Nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q: But it brought you all so much together, all these people who had such different – different destinies, different hardships, different –</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: And we didn’t talk about our experiences at all.</span> <span id="s2144">It was the school and what – how to do it.</span> <span id="s2145">And under the – under our school, there were food magazines.</span> <span id="s2146">And so we had lot of rats.</span> <span id="s2147">And in Italy you have, in Polish it’s [indecipherable] it’s a sort of – something like a – a – over your bed when you sleep, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: A mosquito net.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: Mo-Mosquito net.</span> <span id="s2150">And she put her leg out, and the rat bit her once.</span> <span id="s2151">My other experience from there was I couldn’t sleep, I went there, and down there, there was – we have military in – people who were taking care of the food under that, and th – about us, and somebody who was passing by, another soldier, came and say, oh well, you have a good – so many women around you.</span> <span id="s2152">And he th – the one who was there said no, there are good people, good women there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: So, in other words, there were people who were looking at you in a different way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: Well, some other people thought that well, when there are women and whatever happened.</span> <span id="s2155">But no – no, it was – it was not.</span> <span id="s2156">And the man who – who was there said so.</span> <span id="s2157">So I heard it.</span> <span id="s2158">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: We – were these soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: Yes, Polish soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Both pole – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: Polish soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: I-I have a question about – about General Anders’ Army.</span> <span id="s2164">Why would people be joining the army, his army, after the war is over?</span> <span id="s2165">What would have been the reason for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: We didn’t want to go to Soviet Poland.</span> <span id="s2167">Poland was not free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: So in other words, it would have been now to fight the Soviets?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: Well, there were some – I think my daughter-in-law father was in Poland still, after the war, after the insurrection, and he was fighting there.</span> <span id="s2170">How he got out, I don’t know, because we didn’t talk about those things.</span> <span id="s2171">But he was one who was still fighting Germans and Russians and he – he was a – we did not fight Russians, because they were allies, so he was still fighting Germans.</span> <span id="s2172">And there were some people left and in Poland a lot was arrested and killed and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: By?</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: It’s not – not – for us, the war did not stop there, even for somebody – we could choose to go out of Warsaw as a prisoner or war, or as a civilian.</span> <span id="s2175">And many people decided to go as civilian.</span> <span id="s2176">If they were found later by Russians that they were in the underground army, they would be arrested, killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: So even though they were allies, having fought in an underground army, they were threats.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A: They were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: This – right now when I am looking at the Ukraine it’s exactly what’s happen in ’39 in Poland, [indecipherable] their people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: Whatever.</span> <span id="s2187">They don’t mind.</span> <span id="s2188">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q: What happened to you after Italy?</span> <span id="s2190">What – what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A: After a year I wanted so much to go to England when my brother was alive – we had to go to England and to be resettled.</span> <span id="s2192">So I was in the camp there, and another year of school, and so I have my matriculation in Polish system.</span> <span id="s2193">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: So in other words, you, while your brother was alive, he wasn’t able to get you to England –</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: But then I had to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">Q: – but after he died, you could go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A: I had to go.</span> <span id="s2198">After a year, all the Polish soldiers were there, and tried to be resettled there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2200">Was there any effort to resettle you into Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: Whoever want to go, could go.</span> <span id="s2202">And out of – we were in [indecipherable] this is – there were about 30 girls in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2203">Two of them went.</span> <span id="s2204">And if you consider that they were mostly young women, because it was the – we were in school, so it was from say 16 to 20, 22, only two decided to go to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: And that was why there are so many people stayed outside.</span> <span id="s2207">We didn’t recognize the Poland as it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: And I ne – I thought I send my children when they were grown up, to Poland.</span> <span id="s2210">My oldest one, I told him, if somebody will ask you something, answer in English, not in Polish, so they will treat you as a foreigner.</span> <span id="s2211">Because that was at the time when it – it could be dangerous, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2212">He was 16 at that time.</span> <span id="s2213">But I never expected that I will be able to go to Poland.</span> <span id="s2214">So, we never expected that, and we – we didn’t expect that at our lifetime, Poland will be free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">A: But right now is still after Ukraine, what would be next is Lithuania, and Poland, they – they were mentioning that at – at first.</span> <span id="s2217">But both Lithuania and Poland are in Europe right now –</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: In the European Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: – and Ukraine is not.</span> <span id="s2220">So, hopefully they won’t be able to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: I want to ask about then your later, your parents, did they go to England with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: Yes, yes, because they were in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2224">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: My mother was still teaching.</span> <span id="s2226">Na – no, she was helping, she wasn’t teaching in school.</span> <span id="s2227">We had proper teachers, with good education, better than my mother.</span> <span id="s2228">And my father, he was going to be sort of expert.</span> <span id="s2229">I don’t know what he was doing before the war, but when the National Health Service was starting in England, he was supposed to help as an advisor, even without the English language.</span> <span id="s2230">And then he got tuberculosis and a heart attack.</span> <span id="s2231">He died on seven heart attack at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: He died when he was 64.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: And this was in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: That was in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: And this was in the 50s?</span> <span id="s2237">In the 1950s or 1960s?</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: That – it was – no, no, at ‘60 my husband and I came to United States, and I hoped to show the house and everything to my parents, and my father died two years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: So in the early 60s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: They were still in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: In England they – they were given the social health, because my – both – well, if my father could not be the expert –</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: – in his [indecipherable] my mother was teaching in Polish schools.</span> <span id="s2245">The – we have Saturday Polish schools everywhere, always.</span> <span id="s2246">So she was helping with that.</span> <span id="s2247">But she could not work without the language.</span> <span id="s2248">And when you’re older it is very difficult to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q: So you – you spent a good decade or more in pole – in England, in the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: Thirteen years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2252">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: And then my husband – there was Polish university – college.</span> <span id="s2254">He was a year ahead of me, and after a time they said we were under the University of London.</span> <span id="s2255">So we had to pass the exams once a year, and that was a college.</span> <span id="s2256">And my husband still can – could go in Polish only.</span> <span id="s2257">I had – I was a year later, in English, and I was not good in English.</span> <span id="s2258">I failed five times, so I didn’t finish it there.</span> <span id="s2259">But I wanted to finish it, so when I came to this country, there – in England there is no – nothing.</span> <span id="s2260">How – you don’t call grades is – for each one you have one or two what – I lost the word, I’m telling you</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">Q: It’s okay.</span> <span id="s2262">So for –</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: But anyway, I could not pass whatever I already learn in engli – in England, only I had to pass it by exam.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">A: So my husband was teaching at the University of Maryland, and I was studying there.</span> <span id="s2266">And I finish my study, I have my bachelor at 42.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: Congratulations.</span> <span id="s2268">Congratulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: It wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s2270">I just wanted to finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: And he – he – was it – and so if I understand it properly, it was that he was able to pass his exams in England in the Polish language –</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q: – which made it easier.</span> <span id="s2274">And by the – and you, coming a year later, had to take those exams in English, even though you knew the subject matter.</span> <span id="s2275">Then, because it was in English, it was hard for you to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: Well, I had to pass five exams.</span> <span id="s2277">One was most likely mathematics; physics and something like that.</span> <span id="s2278">Lab.</span> <span id="s2279">And I was passing four, and the fifth was English, which I could not pass.</span> <span id="s2280">I think five times I failed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: So then I was studying by myself with the books, which – at home.</span> <span id="s2283">But that gave me knowledge, but nothing.</span> <span id="s2284">And when we came to this country t – first two years I didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s2285">And then I join and – at University of Maryland, my husband was teaching there, we wer – lived in Maryland, but they said, you have to pay as much as a foreigner.</span> <span id="s2286">Not lower as Marylander.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: So I was really angry with that – them.</span> <span id="s2289">But later I was going to get my bachelor and then fight by-laws with that.</span> <span id="s2290">And [indecipherable] some Chinese or somebody else did it before me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: So it was changed.</span> <span id="s2293">But it was hard on us, because we didn’t have money, and here I had to pay a li – right now is very, very little, but it’s – it still was a lot for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: It was – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: We came to this country with four children, two were born in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: So you have four children?</span> <span id="s2297">That’s was my next –</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">A: Six children right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">Q: You have six children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2301">Twenty-three grandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: Yes, I am rich.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: How wonderful.</span> <span id="s2305">How wonderful.</span> <span id="s2306">I take it your husband is also po – was also Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: Yes, we lived in Warsaw a few blocks away, but we met in England.</span> <span id="s2308">He went through the insurrection, through Italy.</span> <span id="s2309">In Italy he was studying at Turin University.</span> <span id="s2310">How he did, I don’t know, because he did – didn’t know span –</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">Q: Italian?</span> <span id="s2312">A: Italian.</span> <span id="s2313">So maybe that’s where something in English, I – I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">A: But he –</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">Q: And why –</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: – was studying there for a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Q: – why did you leave the U.K. to come to the United States?</span> <span id="s2319">What was the reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: My husband started to study in England, higher degree.</span> <span id="s2321">Somebody advised him to – to go to one place, and to do [indecipherable] engineering, and he finish master in engineering.</span> <span id="s2322">And he hated if somebody will call him engineer.</span> <span id="s2323">He wanted to study mathematics.</span> <span id="s2324">And his professor in Polish university told him, you are too old for that.</span> <span id="s2325">He finish, he got the doctorate in mathematics.</span> <span id="s2326">And apparently, it was so well thought in this country about the degree he got in England, that he went with somebody he knew from one of the meeting of people with – whatever their interest.</span> <span id="s2327">He took him and my husband got seven offers of a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: And he choose, like that, Maryland, and we are in Maryland ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s2331">And you said you have six children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: And we talked about this a little bit earlier, but tell me, have – do your children know your story, your history, your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: I know that my daughter once said something was so – so out of reason.</span> <span id="s2335">So apparently we didn’t talk enough about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2337">I see.</span> <span id="s2338">Do any of the grandchildren express interest or curiosity about these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">A: Sometimes I talk, but I think they don’t think it’s very important.</span> <span id="s2340">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2342">What would you want younger generations to understand about what your generation went through, what your parents’ generation went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">A: Somehow I’m dissatisfied with people who right now go out and there’s no – not enough work in Poland, so when they can go anywhere in Europe to – to work, they do.</span> <span id="s2344">I – they don’t really think of coming back.</span> <span id="s2345">They don’t think really that they should belong to Poland and not to be outside this.</span> <span id="s2346">And it seems to me they’re – they’re a completely different generation.</span> <span id="s2347">I lived in free Poland, which was under 150 years when we were not free.</span> <span id="s2348">And right now some people are – in Poland are mixed up, and they don’t recognize that they were not free under the Soviet occupation.</span> <span id="s2349">There is a lot of progress in the country, as I – I think I mentioned to you that my brother wanted to go on the bicycle to – from Białystok to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2350">And that half of main road was paved and some half wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2351">Right now, even in the village where my mother lived there, everything is paved.</span> <span id="s2352">There is electricity.</span> <span id="s2353">Right now there are a lot of trees, say cherry trees, which are si – small.</span> <span id="s2354">So it’s easy to pick.</span> <span id="s2355">So you have to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: They’ve been – they’ve been raised that way, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">A: – start – raised like not – not only it’s a different kind of cherries, not the big one.</span> <span id="s2358">So that had to be change, you don’t change it from year to year, you have to do it.</span> <span id="s2359">And there, in that village where my mother was teaching, there was about 2,000 people, and one – one with higher education only.</span> <span id="s2360">So education was allowed, but also some people were pushed, and they should not have the – that higher education.</span> <span id="s2361">But definitely everybody has the – much more opportunity.</span> <span id="s2362">So, the villages went up, and because of that, some people from there don’t feel that we were not free for so many years.</span> <span id="s2363">We – us being outside, we knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s2364">They accepted what it was, and it wasn’t a free Poland.</span> <span id="s2365">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: And so you’d want people to have a – have a greater understanding of what freedom means.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2368">And maybe it’s coming.</span> <span id="s2369">Some people say that schools are not as – as good as it used to be.</span> <span id="s2370">I know from my mo-mother that after we got independence in [indecipherable] the schools were – they were supposed to be like the schools in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2371">That was the example for us.</span> <span id="s2372">But my mother wa-was going with some inspector, wh-who – who he was I don’t know, about once a year for three days, to different schools in the country, where the teacher would have to pass an exam to be –</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">Q: A teacher, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">A: – a teacher there.</span> <span id="s2375">So some people were not very well educated, and the schools went – the level of schools went up and apparently they say that right now is going down.</span> <span id="s2376">I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: It happ – you know, the – it still is countries in development, after – after such changes, it takes a while for – for systems to work, and to improve.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2379">There – right now there are changes there – in Poland, children start at seven, they start at six or something.</span> <span id="s2380">And they – I don’t understand what, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Q: I wanted to ask – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">A: – something is not – not very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Q: I wanted to ask this question in a different way.</span> <span id="s2384">What would you want young people, and younger generations from other countries: from the United States, from Canada, from the U.K., from Germany, and even from Russia, and from countries outside of the European experience, what would you want the children of these countries to understand what you and your family, and the people in Białystok, and the people in Warsaw went through?</span> <span id="s2385">What do you think you’d like them to be able to get about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">A: I don’t think they would learn by themselves if the – if something will happen.</span> <span id="s2387">But what I am not – people – other people are always dissatisfied, I don’t like what’s right now common in the world that the countries are not religious countries.</span> <span id="s2388">Poland was definitely Catholic country, but there was tolerance to everybody.</span> <span id="s2389">And as I said, th-the kids who were going out of religious classes, they enjoyed that.</span> <span id="s2390">And they could stay and learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A: Not pray, but learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">A: And it seems to me that only religion, when you believe – we believe in the same God, only different, and of course, I – I believe it is better than [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2395">But is the same God.</span> <span id="s2396">And people need to – to believe in God, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s2397">If they don’t know, they even form belief that in several gods, or whatever, I don’t know what Buddhists believe, and so on.</span> <span id="s2398">But there is a tolerance, and it was tolerance in Poland.</span> <span id="s2399">But here, right now, I – I – is my – my own saying, that et – atheists are not tolerant.</span> <span id="s2400">They cannot tolerate cross somewhere on the street and somewhere.</span> <span id="s2401">Maybe they feel guilty that they don’t believe in God, but I don’t see tolerance in this country, and everywhere.</span> <span id="s2402">And Poland right now is – is separate of state and – and – and I think it’s going the same direction, lack of tolerance.</span> <span id="s2403">And I’m very dissatisfied with that, so I don’t know whether people can change it again, back to religious tolerance.</span> <span id="s2404">Well, we have Muslims in Poland, some gathering, they – they have the – right now they moved from east to west and so on, so it’s more difficult, but those people were – Poland was always fighting Turks and – and Tartars, they were Muslims.</span> <span id="s2405">So those people were taken prisoners, or were – they were always – they started as our enemies, fighting us.</span> <span id="s2406">And right now we consider them just any other people.</span> <span id="s2407">We don’t have problem with – with Muslims right now in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: But we are tolerant to any religious, and it seems to me that if – well, with Muslims it’s difficult because not all of them are – are fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">A: But it seems to me I would like young people to believe that religion is the base of the social work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: Social –</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: Cohesion, in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: Of society.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: But that’s my thing.</span> <span id="s2418">I-I don’t know what else I would like for the children, I don’t – I do want them to – to believe in God.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2420">Well, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Syska, for sharing your life, your thoughts, your experiences with us today.</span> <span id="s2421">I’m very grateful for it.</span> <span id="s2422">And this then, concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
