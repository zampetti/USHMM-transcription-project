Your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: My parents?</span> <span id="s25">My father died very, when I was six or, six, seven years old, a heart attack.</span> <span id="s26">He had a very, how should I say, active life, he ________________, that's in Germany.</span> <span id="s27">He had a factory of glassware and so forth and he traveled around all Prague, Czechoslovakia, Budapest, England, France.</span> <span id="s28">A very, very strenuous life, you know.</span> <span id="s29">But he was very how should I say, strong willed.</span> <span id="s30">My mother always said to him, "Take it easy, you can't eat more that one schnitzel and that's enough."</span> <span id="s31">But he _______________ and then one very bad day, he passed away and my brother, the oldest one, which unfortunately died in the first World War, took father's part.</span> <span id="s32">He was the one who kept the family going, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s33">And then I grew up and when I was, yeah and that's a very funny part.</span> <span id="s34">My mother wanted not me, a boy, she always wanted a girl.</span> <span id="s35">And while she wanted a girl, she, how shall I say, brought me up like a girl.</span> <span id="s36">I had long hair to my shoulders, reddish hair and so on, so forth and in school they called my Touchin(ph) because my hair, hair was like a girl.</span> <span id="s37">And I cried and went home and was like, I'm not going to school any more unless you cut my hair.</span> <span id="s38">If you don't, forget about it, they called me Touchin(ph) all ready and I don't like that at all.</span> <span id="s39">All right, all right, don't get excited and she went to the barber with me, cut, but what does she do?</span> <span id="s40">She cut it up to here, _______________ you know, what we called in Germany, ________________.</span> <span id="s41">But of course I was already happy that that long hair was gone and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s42">And then as I said before, I went to the ________________ for ________________, high school ________________.</span> <span id="s43">And I was a very, freak child but there's a funny story.</span> <span id="s44">I was not supposed to come really.</span> <span id="s45">I think my being here, how shall I say it in German?</span> <span id="s46">(speaks German here) I shouldn't have come.</span> <span id="s47">My mother was forty when I was born, so they didn't expect me and I came as a seven months boy, weighing only few pounds.</span> <span id="s48">The doctor always told, put Rolfie in the ruhrer(ph), you know what the ruhrer(ph) is?</span> <span id="s49">In Berlin they have the big ovens, from floor to the ceiling and in the middle they put apples in to be browned and stuff to keep warm and put Rolfie in the ruhrer(ph), they called that the ruhrer(ph) and Rolfie was put in the ruhrer(ph) and our landlord always said, "Can we see Rolfie?"</span> <span id="s50">Mother said, "No, he is in the ruhrer(ph)."</span> <span id="s51">They laughed their heads off because they didn't believe, how can a kid, child, be in the ruhrer(ph), you follow me?</span> <span id="s52">And here's the story.</span> <span id="s53">And as I said before I was very weak and so on and so forth and in school I learned Latin, English, French and I had a teacher, Dr. Mink(ph) and he says, "Rolfie, you are very intelligent, you should learn all..." I said, "Doctor, it's too much for me, I can't."</span> <span id="s54">I always lost, what do you call it, _______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Your consciousness?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s57">And my mother came then and said, may I make a long story short, after, as I said I've been up to _______________ and then I left school.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: At what age did you leave school?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: 15,16.</span> <span id="s60">And there I met my friend.</span> <span id="s61">He was two years older than I, I was 16, her was 18, but we met, how shall I say it, you know, like boys meet.</span> <span id="s62">He was very fond of me, he said, "You are a beautiful boy," bah, bah, bah and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s63">He bought me chocolate, _______________ chocolate and took me to the movies and so on, so forth an my mother said, "You spoil the boy, don't do that."</span> <span id="s64">He says, "But I like to.</span> <span id="s65">I get _______________, pocket money and what shall I do with it?</span> <span id="s66">And Rolfie has _______________, so I buy _______________ chocolate."</span> <span id="s67">And we got very fond of each other, but nothing what you think, sex or so, just friendship.</span> <span id="s68">And then I went, my eldest brother, who died in the first World War was in a firm for over 20, 25 years and the boss of the firm knew my mother and me very well and he said, "Send the boy to me, I want him, to teach some ____."</span> <span id="s69">And I went there as a apprentice.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: What was the name of the firm?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Popo(ph) and Ferve(ph).</span> <span id="s72">I, they had buttons, dresses, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s73">Well anyway, short things, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s74">And he thought I was very intelligent and soon he let me take a box with all the stuff and go in the neighborhood trying to sell stuff, you know.</span> <span id="s75">And believe it or not, I had a very good reception.</span> <span id="s76">Wherever I came, people were very nice to me, I sold and bah, bah, bah.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: At what time was that, what year did you start with apprentice?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: 1926, 27, about that time.</span> <span id="s79">But then after awhile I didn't like it and I met another guy in the line and he said, "I have a much better job for you, you can sell much better inside, you don't have to wander around crazy" and I went to _______________ Lehman(ph), _______________ in Berlin and there Mr. Faulk(ph), the director, very friendly to me and I was there for four or five years and then, '31, '32, I didn't like it, because they took advantage of me and so on, so forth, so my mother said, "Why don't you just take it easy for awhile."</span> <span id="s80">Because as I told you before, I wasn't too well and not too strong, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: What kind of health problems did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: What health problems did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: I fell, I became _______________, you know what _______________ is?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Yeah, you lost your consciousness.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s87">Well, my friend very often, if we went to a movie or _______________ and so on, so forth, all of a sudden I was gone.</span> <span id="s88">So he was the one who really, how shall I say it?</span> <span id="s89">Took care of me and he always said, "Don't do that, don't do that," and so on.</span> <span id="s90">And my mother all of a sudden took a very big liking to him.</span> <span id="s91">He came every Friday evening for dinner to our house.</span> <span id="s92">He was like the second child, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s93">And, but at that time, we started already having sex.</span> <span id="s94">And he took me on trips to Venice, Italy, to Budapest in Hungary, and we went practically everywhere.</span> <span id="s95">Switzerland very often and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s96">And I had a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Can you describe your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Can you describe your friend a little bit and how did he go, no, in those times?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Well he took over, his father, I don't know, when did you leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Say it again?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: When did you leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: 10 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Can you remember shoeboots _______________ and cleaning _______________?</span> <span id="s105">Well, his father had a factory on ________________ in Berlin.</span> <span id="s106">But he got very old, 76, 78, so he and his brother took over the factory.</span> <span id="s107">He was a salesman, traveling all over Deutschland(ph) and even to Switzerland, so forth, selling, and his brother was the inside man, factory, you know, you know, the shoeboots, polish had to be done during the night and daytime it was too warm and too difficult to do.</span> <span id="s108">Anyway, they had a big outfit, very well known, ________________ shoeboots and Spectrol(ph) ________________, which was very well known.</span> <span id="s109">I show you later, an ashtray.</span> <span id="s110">And he was very well known, big department stores.</span> <span id="s111">Vairtime(ph), Teats(ph), Yandorf(ph), all these big stores.</span> <span id="s112">Mr. Kroner(ph), any time, we like your stuff and so on, so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: He owned, no, he owned these department stores?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: The father owned, started it in 1910 and he took it over 1926, not he, he and his brother, they two.</span> <span id="s115">His father remained in the factory, but only as a, how shall I say, giving advice, so on, so forth, but he wasn't practically any more in, in the firm, you follow me?</span> <span id="s116">He, my friend and his brother were the ones who were running the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: But I didn't understand fully, the connection to Vairtime(ph) for example, did he own Vairtime(ph) or work for Vairtime(ph) for the big department stores?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: He sold to Vairtime(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: He sold to Vairtime(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Yeah, that stuff, that shoeboots and that _______________, which was very well known and very well liked.</span> <span id="s121">As I said, we had a wonderful life, traveled and couldn't be better, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s122">And then came 1928, '29, his brother married a Jewish girl, she was very, how shall I say, she wasn't like a girl, she was like a man, you know and oh, I forgot to tell you, the brother, in the World War, first World War, went in the World War and got shot in his spine.</span> <span id="s123">They couldn't remove it, they left it there and he was very handicapped from that shooting.</span> <span id="s124">Always laying down and bah, bah, bah.</span> <span id="s125">When he came from the factory she did everything for him, so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s126">But she didn't like that her brother-in-law, my friend, had an affair with me.</span> <span id="s127">And his mother told her once, what don't you like on Rolf?</span> <span id="s128">I think he's the most charming fellow, beautiful fellow, what do you want from him?</span> <span id="s129">And Emil(ph) is very fond of him.</span> <span id="s130">So, but you know in that time, homosexuality in the 20's was like the red cloth to the steer, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s131">So she always, so she said one day, "You go with him."</span> <span id="s132">No, "I will arrange an appointment with Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld.</span> <span id="s133">He should see you and see whether he can help you to get rid of it."</span> <span id="s134">I laughed out loud, didn't say a word and when we were alone, I said to him, "I think she's crazy.</span> <span id="s135">She can't, this is not a sickness, what, what does she think that it is?"</span> <span id="s136">"But if she _______________ you, I tell you what, we are going both to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld, making an appointment, tell him what we experience with your sister-in-law, that we don't like it, that we are _______________ crazy, crazy about things, she doesn't know more" and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s137">And we went to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Can you explain as to who Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld is, in that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld was a man who, in Germany was a law 175, yes the homosexuality law, number 175 and he had a big practice in the _______________.</span> <span id="s140">That is like a little Central Park, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s141">A big house, a villa and he had patients there, laying on one side and here was his private house and very often he made, how shall we say, balls on Saturday evening for the homosexual, with 150, 200 people there, dancing in the garden there and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s142">High prices, but this money was good for him because for that he can experience, go places and look for, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s143">But anyway, as I said before, we went to him and he came in and I never forget that.</span> <span id="s144">Should I tell you?</span> <span id="s145">Where we hang our hat and our coats, there are all pricks out a foot around the whole thing, you know.</span> <span id="s146">I screamed out laughing and the guy who was sitting on the desk, "What are you laughing mister?"</span> <span id="s147">I said, "That's too funny.</span> <span id="s148">To put hangers like this in a..</span> <span id="s149">." "</span> <span id="s150">Well," he says, "this is our trademark, period."</span> <span id="s151">We were besides ourself that's ____.</span> <span id="s152">So then he came in, he was a little, stout man, I expected something completely different, but he is very, how shall I say, imposing and I told him the story.</span> <span id="s153">And he said, "Why do you send that woman to me and I will clear her mind and tell her what is what and why is why.</span> <span id="s154">This is not a sickness, this is what you are born with, period.</span> <span id="s155">And there's no question about it."</span> <span id="s156">I said my friend was very, how shall I say, backward, you know, he never... So I said, "Doctor, would you do me a big favor?"</span> <span id="s157">"Certainly, what is it?"</span> <span id="s158">"Send a letter to that woman and just tell her, or write to her what you told us right now and I would be very, very happy and appreciate it no end."</span> <span id="s159">"No question about it, tomorrow the letter goes out."</span> <span id="s160">So the next Friday evening we came to Emil's(ph) parents for dinner and she came in.</span> <span id="s161">She didn't speak to him, she spoke right away to me, "What did you do?"</span> <span id="s162">I said, "What did I do?"</span> <span id="s163">"Well," she says, "I got a letter."</span> <span id="s164">I said, "And does that clear up your mind?</span> <span id="s165">Does that make you feeling better?"</span> <span id="s166">"It's unbelievable what you did and why you did, giving my address and my name."</span> <span id="s167">I said, "Look, you bothered Emil so much and he was so depressed that I wanted to shut it out once and for all and that's why we went to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld and he sent you the letter and that should clear your mind, period."</span> <span id="s168">So his mother said, "When Rolf told you what he just told you, isn't that enough for you?</span> <span id="s169">Don't you have to go on?"</span> <span id="s170">"I have it my way and not his way."</span> <span id="s171">So we were, how shall I say, not very friendly all the time, you know, til we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: I have a question because you started to tell us that she proposed that you both go to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld.</span> <span id="s173">Was he very known in Germany at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s175">Very well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Why was he so known?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Because, as I just told you, like here for instance, sex or, it was very open, you know.</span> <span id="s180">He had, as I told you, balls on Saturdays, making money and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s181">People come, came from practical all over the world looking for advice from him and he was very, very well known.</span> <span id="s182">Very well known.</span> <span id="s183">So that made her, I think, she had the idea that he could do something about it.</span> <span id="s184">But he, smart man as he was, told her right away, this is not a sickness, there can be nothing done about it, this is something that you're born with, period.</span> <span id="s185">And that's why he wrote her the letter on my account.</span> <span id="s186">But she was still not 100 percent satisfied, but I didn't care any more because what we did was more than enough, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: You said that he lived in an institute, in a big villa.</span> <span id="s188">What did he do in this institute, exactly, do you know this?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: There were people, how shall I explain it?</span> <span id="s190">It's like, not a hospital, it's like a, a there were people, men, who wanted to be a woman, and they were operated on.</span> <span id="s191">Were laying there for one or two months, til they healed and so and that was in 1925, '26, '27, a big affair, very big, very known people, I don't know, at the time being were, couple of them went and got operated on and as I told you before, this side was like a charity and this was a lift and then he was, has a big park and in that park were the parties for 175.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Did you ever go to one of these parties?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Once I went.</span> <span id="s194">And I, I tell you why I went.</span> <span id="s195">He and I, we were very, very, how shall we say, careful.</span> <span id="s196">He had to be on account of his employers and the factory and I didn't want him to be laughed at or whatever it is, God forbid and so on and so forth, so we were very, very careful.</span> <span id="s197">Very seldom.</span> <span id="s198">But that time was a masquerade, so nobody would know.</span> <span id="s199">He didn't take it, I took a mask out, he didn't, he just went.</span> <span id="s200">So I said, "I want to go."</span> <span id="s201">"All right, if you want to go, _______________ , but I don't ____."</span> <span id="s202">So what shall I tell you?</span> <span id="s203">I went to a very famous masquerade man, who for the theater _______________, I don't know whether that name rings a bell with you.</span> <span id="s204">I think he's, not today any more, but he was for a long time very famous.</span> <span id="s205">And I went there and I said, "Look, Hirschfeld gives a party, I'd like to, would love to go in a masquerade and then I can have my hat and my face masked and so on, so forth."</span> <span id="s206">"Mr. Hirschberg, don't worry.</span> <span id="s207">Show me your legs."</span> <span id="s208">I said, "What are you talking about?"</span> <span id="s209">I said, "Show me your legs."</span> <span id="s210">I put my _______________ up.</span> <span id="s211">"Oh, we ____, perfect, perfect."</span> <span id="s212">I said, "What's perfect?"</span> <span id="s213">"You have no bowlegs, that's very good, very important to that costume I want to give you."</span> <span id="s214">I said, "What kind of costume do you want to give me?"</span> <span id="s215">"You go as a fowl."</span> <span id="s216">What do you call it, a fowl, here in English?</span> <span id="s217">You know?</span> <span id="s218">_______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Is it a pheasant?</span> <span id="s220">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: ________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Is feathers?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yeah, feathers.</span> <span id="s224">Big and beautiful, blue.</span> <span id="s225">We

a cousin there and everywhere we ___ and on the 11th of April, 1937, our boat went to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Could I, I would like to go a step back and we go back to this boat in a

forbid, bring a few things that you need," so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s345">So I always went to her house, before we left, weeks after weeks, I got so annoyed, I can't tell you.</span> <span

things from my apartment.</span> <span id="s349">They packed it and sent it to me and he took part, his whole thing in there, from his apartment.</span> <span id="s350">So we left as I said, on the 11th of April, 1937, with the Normandy.</span> <span id="s351">Our _______________ cost 2500 marks, but we didn't do it for ____, we did it because we got the half price in New York, back, if we don't go back on the same.</span> <span id="s352">And that's why we like to have some money here, when we come on, you know.</span> <span id="s353">I don't, you should have seen that cabin.</span> <span id="s354">With green silk, I can't tell you, it was total.</span> <span id="s355">But unfortunately, it was such a storm, even the captain go seasick.</span> <span id="s356">It was awful.</span> <span id="s357">And when we came here, oh yeah, the main thing is, my, I had to go in Berlin, to the military board there because I was still due to serve military.</span> <span id="s358">So in the _______________ I went one morning with my passport and I said, "I want to go to America."</span> <span id="s359">Yeah and there was a man like Hindenburg(ph), that fat, big, oh

everything was a lie.</span> <span id="s369">And he will ask question and question.</span> <span id="s370">Finally he took the stamp, put it on my passport and my heart was jumping.</span> <span

id="s389">"Don't be silly, this is a ____, that's bad, people have bad advice, it's all their fault."</span> <span id="s390">And then we came to the hotel, in the 24th floor and he said, "Look, Central Park.</span> <span id="s391">Is that lovely?</span> <span id="s392">________________."</span> <span id="s393">Anyway.</span> <span id="s394">Then I got over it and we stayed here and the first

us.</span> <span id="s425">And he says, "So how much is the rent?"</span> <span id="s426">The Super.</span> <span id="s427">The Super said, "I can't tell you anything, you have to leave everything to the owner."</span> <span id="s428">And at that time it was a little owner, Ottenberger(ph), also Jew and we came the next day and we realized he just looked at us.</span> <span id="s429">Eyes open.</span> <span id="s430">He says, "You want to rent the apartment?</span> <span id="s431">Are you cooking?"</span> <span id="s432">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s433">"Are you washing?"</span> <span id="s434">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s435">All right I said.</span> <span id="s436">"Well the apartment is really 125 dollars."</span> <span id="s437">"How much?"</span> <span id="s438">I said, "125 dollars, no, that's too much money."</span> <span id="s439">"Okay, you don't cook, you don't wash, you don't eat too much, all right, I give you the apartment for 75 dollars, starting, you can move in on the first of September and pay me the first rent on the first of January."</span> <span id="s440">I thought we were in seventh heaven.</span> <span id="s441">I knew that we had an apartment, I was so happy, so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s442">We stayed til the middle of August and then we went here, it was empty already, they just cleaned it and I wanted to, I was measuring everything, you know.</span> <span id="s443">Then we had the furniture parked at Silverstein(ph), it's a house which takes things which you have to, anyway.</span> <span id="s444">When we brought the things over, you should have seen 74th Street.</span> <span id="s445">In September 8, 1937.</span> <span id="s446">Children were playing with the ____, everything was in ____, you know, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s447">Next door was a old lady, she knocked at the door and she said, "I saw your furniture and I think they are gorgeous.</span> <span id="s448">Can I come in and look at them?"</span> <span id="s449">I said, "My dear lady, we just moved in.</span> <span id="s450">Everything is honky tonky toodle, you won't even know.</span> <span id="s451">When we are finished, I call you and you can come in."</span> <span id="s452">"But don't forget, I'm so impressed."</span> <span id="s453">I said, "No, no, I won't forget."</span> <span id="s454">Period.</span> <span id="s455">That was our entry in 245 West 74th Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: And this is the same apartment where you are living today?</span> <span id="s457">So how many years did you live here?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: 60 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: 60 years.</span> <span id="s460">I would like to ask a couple of questions, but I need to make a big jump backwards for that.</span> <span id="s461">Course, we heard a little bit about the friendship and the relationship, but very little so far about growing up Jewish in Germany before 1933.</span> <span id="s462">You mentioned that you are Jewish, but how was it growing up Jewish before 1933 in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Like everybody else.</span> <span id="s464">The religion had to do anything with you or for you or against you.</span> <span id="s465">As a matter of fact, they never held my friend or me as a Jew?</span> <span id="s466">Why?</span> <span id="s467">A Jew hasn't got blue eyes, they have dark eyes and don't have red hair and are not blonde like he was.</span> <span id="s468">That was their sign for a Jew, you follow me?</span> <span id="s469">So we weren't even kept for Jews to tell you the truth, but even if and when, there was no _______________, nothing doing.</span> <span id="s470">I mean there were of course certain things which, take for instance the ________________, they were Jews who came from the, from _______________ east, with pious long thing.</span> <span id="s471">Children run after them.</span> <span id="s472">They thought they go to a masquerade.</span> <span id="s473">They didn't even know what it is.</span> <span id="s474">I saw it once too, didn't believe my eyes.</span> <span id="s475">But that was a very, how shall I saw, a very small park in the middle of the city in the _______________.</span> <span id="s476">Where if you go a little more to the left, ________________, I remember the name, ________________ and there were those Jews, but they lived like in a ghetto, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s477">And this was the only thing I can remember ever being annoyed as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Annoyed, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Of course, when we went to _______________, shopping, as I told you, children went after them, they thought it was a masquerade, they didn't even know what it is, because they had the long coats, you know, pious, ____, a hat and long hair.</span> <span id="s480">That was the only time that people, what shall I say, took notice.</span> <span id="s481">Otherwise, as I said before, we in Shallatanborg(ph) in the _______________, I never heard anything like it, never, never.</span> <span id="s482">Til '34, '35, when it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Were you brought up Jewish, going to the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s485">I was, he was brought, his father was a very religious Jew, but as I told you my father died very early and we, even my mother, God wasn't good to us she said, you know, she felt hurt that she lost her husband so early and so tragically, you know what I

question, you answered it already, with different answers, but maybe when we, when we talk about it again, because it's such a long time ago, the tension between, on one hand, in Germany you had the paragraph 175 that prohibited homosexuality.</span> <span id="s934">On the other hand you had in Berlin, as you told us, many bars for homosexuals, also different kinds of bars.</span> <span id="s935">You were in a relationship.</span> <span id="s936">So how did you feel as a homosexual in these years before '33 and then between '33 and '37.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Like a stranger, to tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s938">Because I was born in Berlin, right?</span> <span id="s939">And I was a Berliner.</span> <span id="s940">But when the Nazi's came you had the feeling you are a stranger, all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s941">Why?</span> <span id="s942">As I told you my school friend, who I know in his heart he hated the Nazi's, but he put on the Nazi's uniform, comes to a Jews house, surprises me that I nearly got a heart attack when I opened the door and saw him as a Nazi, I said, "Richard, are you crazy?</span> <span id="s943">Or do you want to frighten me?</span> <span id="s944">Or is that a masquerade?"</span> <span id="s945">And then he told me that if he wants to live and if he has to get work, he has to put on the uniform.</span> <span id="s946">And I know deep in his heart, I know him so well, that he hated them and I, I don't know what to say, you know?</span> <span id="s947">And still he put it on.</span> <span id="s948">And in my opinion there were many, many like him.</span> <span id="s949">In their heart they hated them, but outside they had to agree.</span> <span id="s950">Why?</span> <span id="s951">They had to live, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Did you feel accepted being a homosexual and being Jewish in Germany before 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: It doesn't even occur to me, it doesn't even matter.</span> <span id="s954">As I told you before, they never thought, neither my friend nor I, as I told you, I spoke once, you have blue eyes.</span> <span id="s955">Jews have don't eyes, they always have brown eyes.</span> <span id="s956">He said, "You're crazy."</span> <span id="s957">"No, no, no, no _______________", he said.</span> <span id="s958">Jews, my friend was blonde and had all blue eyes.</span> <span id="s959">They had an imagination a Jew had to be dark, black hair and brown or black eyes.</span> <span id="s960">The minute you have blue eyes, you are no Jew, no gentile.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: So you were not seen by your looks as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Therefore you didn't have firsthand experience...</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Frankly speaking, I wasn't really afraid.</span> <span id="s965">The first time I was afraid, that happened when we were in that movie, that was the first time and from that time he was very annoyed and he says, "That's it."</span> <span id="s966">We went, I never forget we went home, he says, "Let's go to America."</span> <span id="s967">I says, "Why?"</span> <span id="s968">_________________.</span> <span id="s969">"That's the end for me," he says.</span> <span id="s970">I hear him like today.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: But were you ever recognized or discriminated as a homosexual before 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: We never, how shall I say it?</span> <span id="s973">We never dressed or overdressed, you follow me?</span> <span id="s974">Like our people were used to do.</span> <span id="s975">On the contrary, sometimes, I had once a fur jacket or what for a birthday, I think, on my 25th or what, he bought it and he, I had it at home since the time, that Nazi's came to power, but it shouldn't, _______________, you see, a friend of mine in the house took the _______________, a very famous doctor, he wrote me a letter, "Rolfie, _______________ wouldn't believe it, the day you left, they had two Nazi's families, set in your apartment."</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: But you said you were very careful in public, also before 1933, when you were together with your friend Emil, why?</span> <span id="s977">Why were you careful?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Because he was afraid when his employees, they, they very often took _______________ woman, out to the theater, to a party, to a _______________ you know and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s979">We hardly knew them but we took them because just to, he didn't want to give the people, the employees the opportunity to ridicule him or make even a _______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: What is a _______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Get money, that he is a homosexual and they take advantage of it.</span> <span id="s982">And that 's why he always, you know that I went in the _______________ there was a famous barhouse, I forget the name.</span> <span id="s983">I was dancing downstairs, he was in the balcony behind a pillar, sitting and _______________ always to be dancer, enjoy yourself, because he was afraid of his employees.</span> <span id="s984">If you have 250 employees, how do you know there is one there and finds out he's dancing with one man.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: And in these times, when one of his employees would have blackmailed him, how would he have reacted?</span> <span id="s986">Would he have gone to the police?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Oh no, he would have, _______________ you know, they are very, very fresh.</span> <span id="s988">_______________ well I know you, but if you are willing to stop my mouth, I will keep quiet, but you see and that he didn't want, he wanted to avoid it, that's why he kept always aside, always.</span> <span id="s989">I sometimes say, "You're crazy, you're a young man, you should," "I enjoy myself in my way.</span> <span id="s990">I don't have to dance like you do and so forth, so on.</span> <span id="s991">I enjoy it.</span> <span id="s992">I enjoyed seeing you dancing, having a good time."</span> <span id="s993">He always said that, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: But he couldn't have gone to the police when he would have been blackmailed?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: That was a beginning that we thought to walk out of Germany, when I got those letters, that was a start.</span> <span id="s996">Beginning of '36, for six or eight months and my lawyer _______________, he said, "Rolfie, don't be afraid, these are beginners.</span> <span id="s997">They don't even know that simply, lousy, Nazi youngsters, they want to make money and thing they can _______________ you, that's it."</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: But in the letters, they wrote, we know that you are Jewish and we know that you are homosexuals, both?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1000">And that, my friend says never.</span> <span id="s1001">As I told you before, I have a friend, she said to me, "Don't sleep at home any more, you come to my house, you sleep there."</span> <span id="s1002">For weeks and that was a trip from Schallatanborg(ph), she lived in Friedenelle(ph), where that was, just a _______________.</span> <span id="s1003">But thank God Emil had a car and he always drove me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: After 1933, how much did you follow politics, how much were you aware that the Nazi's were anti-Jewish and that the Nazi's were anti-homosexual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: '33 we didn't ________________.</span> <span id="s1006">We didn't _______________ notice it til the end, 1934, Goebbels had, you see, that bastard, Göring, Emil's father didn't go to the factory any more, only his other son, the brother of Emil went to the factory.</span> <span id="s1007">And when he, when we wrote him he should come over and he came in '38, I still see him on the boat, taking his two pockets out, meaning I haven't got a penny, you know?</span> <span id="s1008">He say he gave him the passport and you know what he asked him?</span> <span id="s1009">To pay the Nazi's 180,000 marks.</span> <span id="s1010">Then you can have the passport.</span> <span id="s1011">Göring.</span> <span id="s1012">Boy I could tell you stories, you wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1013">If it didn't happen to me I wouldn't believe it either, but it's the truth.</span> <span id="s1014">The God honest truth and it's not enough punishment for them, that they should get what they did to innocent, wonderful, honest people like Kronor(ph), a prince I tell you and those bastards took everything away from him.</span> <span id="s1015">Everything.</span></p> <p><span
