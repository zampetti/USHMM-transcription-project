id="s2">EM: This is Edith Millman interviewing Mr. Raoul Harmelin.</span> <span id="s3">Today is April 26, 1992.</span> <span id="s4">Mr. Harmelin, could you tell me when and where you were born, and a little bit about your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s6">I was born in Boryslaw, Poland, on the 11th of September, 1924.</span> <span id="s7">I am the only son.</span> <span id="s8">My mother's family was quite large, and they were living in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s9">My father's family, and my father come from Brody, close to the border--in Poland, but close to the border of Russia.</span> <span id="s10">I had a very pleasant youth, and a reasonably good education, due to the fact that my father was a doctor in the city, and also because I was the only son.</span> <span id="s11">I was the darling of the whole family.</span> <span id="s12">And my schooling, in primary school, was in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s13">Later on, in high school, at the gymnasium, also in Boryslaw, until I was 15 years old, when, on the 1st of September, 1939, the war broke out.</span> <span id="s14">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s15">EM: Could you tell me a little bit about life in Boryslaw before 1939?</span> <span id="s16">Specifically, could you tell me about any antisemitism that you might have encountered?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">RH: Yes, well, our city was equally divided between Ukrainians, Poles, and Jews.</span> <span id="s18">The city's population was about 45,000 people, and there were about, approximately 15,000 of each nationality.</span> <span id="s19">Due to the reasonably good economic conditions in our city--because we had about two-and-a-half thousand oil wells--the workers were reasonably well off.</span> <span id="s20">Consequently, there was not as much antisemitism as it was in the other parts of Poland.</span> <span id="s21">Of course, there were sections of Jewish populations that was very, very poor, as well as in other populations, but I think, perhaps in Jewish population, the percentage of the poor was bigger than in others.</span> <span id="s22">There was not much between the population.</span> <span id="s23">The Ukrainians and the Poles tolerated to a certain degree Jews, and in my opinion, the Poles, because of the Church influence, and because of their own nature, were perhaps more antisemitic than the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s24">But, generally, the people were living together in peace and harmony, which was also the result of the fact that Boryslaw belonged previously to the Austro-Hungarian empire, and there was reasonable freedom of all nations there.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">EM: O.K., could you tell me a little bit about your religious upbringing?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">EM: Was your family Orthodox, or Zionist, or, could you tell me a little bit about the religious affiliation of your family, and of most of the Jews in Boryslaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">RH: Most of the Jews in Boryslaw were religious, and Conservative.</span> <span id="s29">First of all, my mother's family, my grandfather and grandmother, they were not Orthodox Jews, but they were religious Jews.</span> <span id="s30">My grandfather founded the biggest synagogue in Boryslaw, and he was quite a wealthy man before the war.</span> <span id="s31">And all my mother's sisters and brothers were also religious.</span> <span id="s32">Both my grandparents on my mother's side, and in our home, there was a religious kosher home.</span> <span id="s33">On my father's side of the family, they were even more religious.</span> <span id="s34">My father comes from Brody, as I told you before, and he had two uncles.</span> <span id="s35">One of them emigrated to America immediately after the First World War.</span> <span id="s36">The other one was a printer and a scholar.</span> <span id="s37">He was printing Bibles, and the same as you have a commentary in the Bible with Rashi, he was having his own commentaries.</span> <span id="s38">We had the Bible until the war.</span> <span id="s39">In the middle of the war the Bible somehow disappeared and I don't have it again.</span> <span id="s40">When it comes to myself, I was brought up in a religious home.</span> <span id="s41">I'm not very religious, and not Orthodox at all.</span> <span id="s42">My Jewish education was every day for two hours in the afternoon in the Hebrew school, and also every day I had the rabbi, who was teaching me Yiddish.</span> <span id="s43">That rabbi was the son of the head rabbi of the synagogue my grandfather founded.</span> <span id="s44">He was an extremely clever man, extremely intelligent, and apart from teaching me Yiddish, he was also introducing me to Jewish life, taking me to Jewish films, for instance, Dibbuk.</span> <span id="s45">And, being a modern rabbi he was also caring for my general education as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">EM: Could you tell me what language was spoken in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">RH: Well, my parents spoke either Yiddish or Polish between them.</span> <span id="s48">I spoke with my father and mother only Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">EM: So, you had to have a tutor, the son of the rabbi teach you Yiddish, or do you mean Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">RH: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">EM: Hebrew...</span></p> <p><span id="s52">RH: Hebrew I was learning in Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">EM: But, the rest of your education was in public school?</span> <span id="s54">You went to a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">RH: We had, the primary school was a public school.</span> <span id="s56">The gymnasium, or high school, was a co-educational gymnasium, which was semi-private.</span> <span id="s57">We had to pay for our education.</span> <span id="s58">And because the high school was founded partly by a Jewish philanthropist, a certain amount of teachers were Jewish, too.</span> <span id="s59">We had excellent schooling there, because we had, for some reason, we had excellent staff.</span> <span id="s60">And my basic education was excellent, due to those teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">EM: Did you find antisemitism in this school?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">RH: To a lesser degree, yes, mainly from Poles, who was, who were from some, sometimes for fun, kicking or hitting a Jew.</span> <span id="s63">But generally the atmosphere was quite friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">EM: You said your father was a doctor in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s65">Did he treat Jews and non-Jews, or did mostly Jews come to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">RH: No, he treated Jews and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s67">My father was working for Kasa Chorych which later on was renamed Polyklinic, and we had in our city a specific system.</span> <span id="s68">And the oil companies that were in our city were mainly overseas oil companies.</span> <span id="s69">The biggest one was a French one.</span> <span id="s70">And they provided for their workers health insurance and education, which covered their health and their medicines.</span> <span id="s71">They provided free housing, free electricity and heating, and free education for their children.</span> <span id="s72">That means that they were paying for education of their wor--for their children.</span> <span id="s73">In addition to that, my father had a private practice where he, again he treated everybody--Jews and non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">EM: Could you tell me about a Zionist movement, if there were any Zionist movements in Boryslaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">RH: Yes, they were many.</span> <span id="s76">There were many organizations, who competed with each other.</span> <span id="s77">There was the HaShomer Hatzair.</span> <span id="s78">There was Akiba.</span> <span id="s79">There were many, many other organizations.</span> <span id="s80">There was a Jewish sports club, Kadima [Hebrew for forward].</span> <span id="s81">There were, then there were religious organizations, like B'nai Akiba, and so on, and Beit Ya'acov, and the Jews were very active in their social life.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">EM: Did you belong to any Zionist organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">RH: Well, I, well, more or less, because I was introduced to Akiba, for one and only reason, because we had a good table tennis table.</span> <span id="s84">And then later on I joined a Jewish club, Kadima, which was perhaps the backbone of the Jewish Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s85">And that was until the war broke out.</span> <span id="s86">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s87">EM: In general, would you say that your upbringing before the war was an upper-middle class, or middle class upbringing?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">RH: I think middle class would be the answer.</span> <span id="s89">We had, that is my mother and father had, no financial worries, because in addition to my father earning very good wages at the Polyklinic and having a very good practice, private practice, we also had four oil wells.</span> <span id="s90">Three were fully owned by my parents, and one was in company with a certain Mr. Landau, whose wife survived the war and is in Tel Aviv now.</span> <span id="s91">But, because my grandfather on my mother's side lost everything during the Depression, and because my father's parents were poor, my father was supporting not only our family, but was supporting the two other families, helping them financially in any way he could.</span> <span id="s92">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s93">EM: Could you tell me what the situation was in Boryslaw just prior to September 1st, 1939, and the first days of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">RH: Everybody knew that the war is approaching.</span> <span id="s95">There was a general tension in the air.</span> <span id="s96">Prior to, already a year or two before the war, we had first inklings.</span> <span id="s97">First of all the, Hitler's invasion of Austria, or Anschluss, people came from Au--ran away from Austria, and one of those was my cousin, who came and who stayed with us.</span> <span id="s98">And he was telling us horrible stories.</span> <span id="s99">And we listened to them, and somehow it did not make any impression on us.</span> <span id="s100">It's always like that, when it happens to somebody else and not to you personally.</span> <span id="s101">Then they were, in the western part of Poland there was a place where they kept, the German Jews ran away from Germany at the time, also telling everybody terrible stories.</span> <span id="s102">And they were widely published in, particularly in a Jewish paper which came from Lwow.</span> <span id="s103">That was Chwila.</span> <span id="s104">And, we all hear about it, and somehow again, the general apathy became the Jews, eh, was there, and nobody was paying any attention.</span> <span id="s105">Everybody was living their normal lives.</span> <span id="s106">From time to time you heard about young people going to then Palestine.</span> <span id="s107">And, that was all.</span> <span id="s108">I was with my father on a summer vacation, in Szczawnica in western part of Poland.</span> <span id="s109">And, already then they were building ditches, anti-tank ditches, and everybody was talking quite often about the approaching war.</span> <span id="s110">I came back from that holiday only a week before it started.</span> <span id="s111">And the beginning of the war I remember very vividly.</span> <span id="s112">I was at my friend’s place.</span> <span id="s113">His name was Karol Wanderin [phonetic].</span> <span id="s114">He later perished in the Janowska camp in Lwow.</span> <span id="s115">And the sky was blue.</span> <span id="s116">There was a beautiful summer weather, and suddenly we heard a roar of the planes.</span> <span id="s117">And, well, of course la--before we learned about gas masks and all kinds of things, and, but we didn't have any gas masks.</span> <span id="s118">So everybody ran and grabbed a little bit of soil and put it in a handkerchief and covered their faces.</span> <span id="s119">But nothing happened.</span> <span id="s120">The planes just passed over, overhead.</span> <span id="s121">And then we heard the speech on the radio of the Polish Foreign Minister Beck, who announced that there is a war between Germany and Poland.</span> <span id="s122">The Germans crossed, and so on…</span></p> <p><span id="s123">EM: Could you describe the first few days of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">RH: Well, the war didn't last long.</span> <span id="s125">There was, there was only one bomb dropped on, in our city, which fell in the field, not hurting anybody.</span> <span id="s126">And the pieces of bomb imbedded in the [unclear] everybody was going there to look at it.</span> <span id="s127">And within a very short time, less than two weeks, the Germans were in our place.</span> <span id="s128">The first German troops arrived on bikes, and they, of course there was no Polish resistance.</span> <span id="s129">There were a few shots fired here and there, but the Poles simply disappeared.</span> <span id="s130">And we were, of course, very much afraid what's going to happen, and we expected a pogrom or something to happen, but nothing happened.</span> <span id="s131">And I remember being in the synagogue on the Day of Atonement, and somebody ran into synagogue and said that the Russians are on the outskirts of the town.</span> <span id="s132">And we all went there, and there were rows and rows of Russian tanks with the radio station, with a peculiar smell of their petrol, and the next day the Russians came in, being greeted by everybody, but especially by the Jews, who, who, for whom the Russians were their salvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">EM: Could you tell me if the Ukrainian population greeted first the Germans, and then the Russians?</span> <span id="s134">What was the attitude of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s135">RH: They, now, they ju--the Ukrainians greeted only the Germans.</span> <span id="s136">The reason for it was that Hitler promised them a Ukrainian state, and they were both anti-Jewish and pro-Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">EM: How about the Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">RH: No, the Poles stayed on the outside.</span> <span id="s139">They greeted neither the Germans nor the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">EM: Was there an increase of antisemitic incidents in the, during the war and just as the, for the first days of occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">RH: Well, it was only, that happened only after the beginning of the Russian-German war.</span> <span id="s142">Prior to that, the, a lot of Jews, of course, were pro-Russian, because the idea of Communism, not the practice, promised them something which they didn't have before.</span> <span id="s143">It promised them equality.</span> <span id="s144">It promised them the possibility of an equal life, both in education in the beginning, and getting work.</span> <span id="s145">Because, during the Polish rule, Jews could not study, only very few of them.</span> <span id="s146">And even those who did study, you were greeting by Polish gangs of youth who were beating them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">EM: You mean, at the university?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">RH: The university.</span> <span id="s149">And, the Jews had to stand at the back of the hall.</span> <span id="s150">They were discriminated against.</span> <span id="s151">Even those who gained a degree could not get jobs during the Polish rule.</span> <span id="s152">So, a lot of parents, and mine, too, either intended, or did send their young people overseas to study--either to Czechoslovakia, which was more liberal, or to Italy, who had good universities.</span> <span id="s153">And despite the fascist rule, they were not so much anti-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">EM: Could you tell me, how long did the Germans stay in Boryslaw before the Russians came?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">RH: About a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">EM: And there were no major pogroms.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">RH: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">EM: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">RH: Nothing at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">EM: Now, could you tell me about life under the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">RH: Life under the Russians, economically, was difficult, because, although they promised--and they did--give everybody work, the supply, of goods, was inconsistent and we simply were getting whatever we could.</span> <span id="s162">In addition to that, a lot of Jews specially, but other populations too, were beginning to work for the Russian secret police, and people who were, in any case, in any way connected with authorities or with the police, were slowly being deported to Siberia.</span> <span id="s163">That also...</span></p> <p><span id="s164">EM: You mean, people who worked for the Russian secret police were deported to Si-...</span></p> <p><span id="s165">RH: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s166">People who worked with the Russian secret police, denounced certain people to the NKVD...</span></p> <p><span id="s167">EM: Oh, were denouncing...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s169">And, usually it happened during the night, where about two or three hundred people suddenly disappeared from their homes.</span> <span id="s170">They were loaded into the rail wagons and deported to Siberia.</span> <span id="s171">Also affected were people, Jewish people mainly, who had members of their families in the Polish army in any way, because they were considered suspicious and they were either deported to Siberia or resettled in other cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">EM: Was there an influx of peop--eh, Jewish people from the western part of Poland, or from...</span></p> <p><span id="s173">RH: Yes, yes, quite a big one.</span> <span id="s174">We had a lot of, especially intelligentsia, educated people, as well as anybody else who could run away from western Poland, came then to our city.</span> <span id="s175">It enriched our cultural life, because we got some excellent teachers and tutors.</span> <span id="s176">For instance, one doctor of mathematics from Krakow who was an excellent teacher.</span> <span id="s177">And also the Russian educational system was very good, because it gave students the possibility not only to learn and study, but it was done in such a way that it was made pleasant.</span> <span id="s178">We also had several circles like mathematical circles, geographical circles, and so on, in the afternoons where we received special attention in certain subjects.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">EM: So the, a schooling system continued uninterrupted?</span> <span id="s180">You continued to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">RH: That's right.</span> <span id="s182">We continued to go to the Russian school.</span> <span id="s183">Immediately we had to learn Russian, which we did.</span> <span id="s184">But it was easier for us, because, in our primary school, we had to have the language, which was called Ruski [Ruthenian], which is nothing to do with the Russian language, but it was perhaps very similar to Ukrainian language.</span> <span id="s185">That's why we could learn Russian more easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">EM: So, but the language of instruction before the war was Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">RH: Polish, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">EM: And you had to learn Ruski?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">RH: Ruski, which was, because, this is, this part of Poland, northern Romania, and part of Hungary, formed all that region of people they used to be called Rusini, not Ukrainians, not Russians, but Rusini.</span> <span id="s190">And this is, they still remain in that form.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">EM: And you had to...</span></p> <p><span id="s192">RH: We had to learn officially the same as Polish language.</span> <span id="s193">And we had marks [grades] out of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">EM: How about your religious education during the Russian occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">RH: Well, the Russians first of all mounted a propaganda against religion altogether, any religion.</span> <span id="s196">I still received my education from the rabbi, that is the Yiddish education.</span> <span id="s197">But the Hebrew education was finished because the Russians forbid it.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">EM: Now, could you tell me about the life when the war between Russia and Germany started?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">RH: Well, the war started on the 22nd of June, 1941.</span> <span id="s200">It was the end of our school year, and there was a dance at school, when suddenly the German planes appeared.</span> <span id="s201">And we all ran home.</span> <span id="s202">We didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s203">The next day there was Stalin's speech announcing the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s204">The funny part about it all is that we, only la--the night before the war broke out, the oil transports from our city went to Germany according to German-Russian agreement.</span> <span id="s205">And, the Russians were completely unprepared for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">EM: How long did the war last in your area?</span> <span id="s207">How soon after the outbreak of the war did the Germans occupy Boryslaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">RH: Approximately a week after the beginning of the war the Germans came to our city.</span> <span id="s209">This time they were loudly greeted by Ukrainians, and also by some Poles.</span> <span id="s210">And the next day they found bodies of prisoners in the Russian Secret Police cellar.</span> <span id="s211">They were bound by wire and the following night, the first pogrom started.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">EM: What prisoners were there?</span> <span id="s213">What nationality?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">RH: All nationalities.</span> <span id="s215">Poles.</span> <span id="s216">Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s217">All nationalities.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">EM: But who, or, who imprisoned them?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">RH: The Russians...</span></p> <p><span id="s220">EM: Were they [unclear]?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">RH: The Russian Secret Police, yes.</span> <span id="s222">And, so the first pogrom started.</span> <span id="s223">And it was terrifying.</span> <span id="s224">People were dragged out of their homes, chased and beaten, and they had to go to the row of Germans, and Poles, Ukrainians, who were beating them on the way, and then they were placed in the same cellar of the Russian secret police as, the ones who could make it, because about 200 of them were beaten to death on the way to the cellars.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">EM: Who was doing the beating?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">RH: Poles, Ukrainians, and some Germans.</span> <span id="s227">But very few Germans.</span> <span id="s228">Only, mainly the local population.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">EM: Was this an act of revenge for the people that had been found in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s230">RH: Yes, that was a combination of act of revenge, and the antisemitic feeling which was to some degree hidden, and then it came out.</span> <span id="s231">It was also, I think, jealousy, because they wanted to get Jewish things and, for nothing.</span> <span id="s232">So, it was a mixture of all those three feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">EM: Do you think it was also because of possible greater cooperation between the Jews and Russians during the Russian occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">RH: Yes, well, the cooperation perhaps was not as, as strong as the Poles and the Ukrainians implied.</span> <span id="s235">Because there were quite a few people within the Polish and Ukrainian operation, eh, population who cooperated with the Russians.</span> <span id="s236">But, the Jews were blamed for everything.</span> <span id="s237">Don't forget that a lot of Jews, who were real Communists, and they were imprisoned by the Russ--by the Poles prior to Russians coming, they came out of jails and concentration camp, which was a camp made by Poles, a long time prior to the Second World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">EM: Do you know where the...</span></p> <p><span id="s239">RH: In Bereza Kartuska, in a place...</span></p> <p><span id="s240">EM: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">RH: Bereza Kartuska.</span> <span id="s242">And those Jews, of course, looked for revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">EM: Where was that camp?</span> <span id="s244">Bereza Kartuska?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">RH: I don't know.</span> <span id="s246">I only know the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">EM: But it was in Pol-...</span></p> <p><span id="s248">RH: In Poland.</span> <span id="s249">In Poland, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s250">EM: East, do you know if it was in Eastern...</span></p> <p><span id="s251">RH: And as far as I know, the concentration camp in Bereza Kartuska was established even prior to Hitler coming to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">EM: Oh, you mean, in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">RH: In Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">EM: Prior to Hit-...</span></p> <p><span id="s255">RH: Prior to Hitler coming to power in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">EM: To power in Germany.</span> <span id="s257">And mostly Communists were held there?</span> <span id="s258">Or were criminals or did they...</span></p> <p><span id="s259">RH: No, no criminals.</span> <span id="s260">It was a political camp, and I would say a biggest part of prisoners were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">EM: Was it because there, so many Jews were Communist?</span> <span id="s262">Or was it just because of general antisemitism and suspicion of Communism?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">RH: Well, one and the other.</span> <span id="s264">Jews were Communists because they were underprivileged during the Polish rule.</span> <span id="s265">They thought that the idea will give them some equality in life.</span> <span id="s266">And, that was their solu--the solution of the Jewish youth, because there was lack of education, lack of employment, and there were a big, very big part of Jewish population, despite claims by others, were very, very poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">EM: [tape off then on] Now, could you descri- Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s268">EM: We are continuing the interview with Mr. Raoul Harmelin.</span> <span id="s269">This is tape one, side B. Would you describe your life under the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">RH: Well, I will start with the first pogrom.</span> <span id="s271">Not far from our place was living a petty criminal, with his wife, very, very poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">EM: Was he a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">RH: No, a Pole.</span> <span id="s274">And my mother was good to him, sometimes giving him some food or some clothing.</span> <span id="s275">And when the pogrom started, my mother went to him and told him that, you know, that we know each other so well and so on, he should be kind to us.</span> <span id="s276">And then we were hiding in the attic end of the house.</span> <span id="s277">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s278">EM: In whose house?</span> <span id="s279">In his?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">RH: In our own house, but his, he really helped us then, because he was the leader of, for the district, to drag out the Jews.</span> <span id="s281">And he protected us that nobody came and took us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">EM: You say he was a petty criminal before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">RH: Before the war, in Poland, during the Polish times.</span> <span id="s284">So, after the pogrom has finished, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s285">EM: Well, what...</span></p> <p><span id="s286">RH: Typical to German efficiency, the pogrom was a 24-hr.</span> <span id="s287">one, and when after the 24 hours passed, the pogrom stopped immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">EM: When was the pogrom in relation to the occupation?</span> <span id="s289">What, what, how many days after the...</span></p> <p><span id="s290">RH: Second day after the Germans came.</span> <span id="s291">Then, the Germans and the city authorities started their persecution of the Jews.</span> <span id="s292">First of all we had to wear armbands at all times.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">EM: What color were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">RH: White, with a blue Magen David.</span> <span id="s295">We had to register for work.</span> <span id="s296">We had to register altogether to get food rations, and already then hunger started.</span> <span id="s297">We were picked up individually or from, by, by, em, eh, by Judenrat to go and work and regulate rivers and do all kinds of manual labor.</span> <span id="s298">And during that labor, we were beaten continuously.</span> <span id="s299">And the situation was becoming worse and worse.</span> <span id="s300">At a certain time, we had to, we had to register again, and each of us has, on top of the arm band, on top of the Jewish arm band they had to, we, each of us received a number.</span> <span id="s301">My number was 102669.</span> <span id="s302">I still have the documents to prove that.</span> <span id="s303">I still have the Arbeit, Arbeitskarte, [See attached copy of documents] to, which shows my profession and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">EM: Who organized the labor battalions?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">RH: The labor battalions were organized by the Judenrat, who was requested by the Germans to do so.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">EM: Who belonged to the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">RH: Various people, usually intelligentsia, who...</span></p> <p><span id="s308">EM: Did the Germans appoint them, or were they...</span></p> <p><span id="s309">RH: No, they...</span></p> <p><span id="s310">EM: Selected by the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">RH: They were selected by the Jews, or they selected themselves, because there was no selection.</span> <span id="s312">And later on, they were responsible for supplying labor and for distribution of food and everything else, by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">EM: Was a ghetto established in Boryslaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">RH: Not for a long time.</span> <span id="s315">We were living in our own quarters.</span> <span id="s316">Boryslaw had a special, a special treatment, because of the oil wells situatious [situated] all over the place, and because a lot of Jews were specialists in that field.</span> <span id="s317">And, it was not feasible for the Germans to do so.</span> <span id="s318">We were living there until the first action started, that is in November, 1941, where about 1,500 Jews were caught and executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">EM: What do you mean caught and ex-...</span></p> <p><span id="s320">RH: Col--caught, caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">EM: Oh, caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">RH: Caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">EM: Caught.</span> <span id="s324">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s325">RH: And executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">EM: Where were they executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">RH: On the outskirts of town.</span> <span id="s328">And they had to dig their own graves, and they were shot usually two or three with one bullet, and then covered, and covered with lime.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">EM: Were these people specially selected, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s330">RH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">EM: Were they caught in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">RH: They were caught in the streets at random.</span> <span id="s333">To some degree, the workers, who had already the number, were treated sympatically, that is, they, in some cases they would be released.</span> <span id="s334">But any other Jews, old, or children, or whoever else, it doesn't, doesn't, it did not matter whom they caught.</span> <span id="s335">And they were shot on the outskirts of the town, and that was a 34-hour action.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">EM: That, you say that was in November of 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">RH: '41.</span> <span id="s338">Then, we had the second action, yes, in, sorry, 1942, beginning of 1942.</span> <span id="s339">And again 600 Jews were caught and killed, again on the outskirts of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">EM: But, at that time, the Jews didn't live in a special ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">RH: No, they lived all over the place.</span> <span id="s342">But also at that time, hunger started.</span> <span id="s343">Hunger and typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s344">My father, being a doctor, also caught it, and the situation was tragic, because the Germans were succeeding in the war with Russia, and there was simply no hope in sight for us, except who, and when was going to die.</span> <span id="s345">Then, the most terrible action of all, came in August, 1942.</span> <span id="s346">It was the third action.</span> <span id="s347">We already knew about it coming, because it was already in other towns, and we received telephone information that it's coming towards us.</span> <span id="s348">The action was conducted by special German Vernichtungskommando, [annihilation command] under General Katzman.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">EM: General who?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">RH: Katzman.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">EM: K-...</span></p> <p><span id="s352">RH: Katzman.</span> <span id="s353">K-A-T-Z-M-A-N, who was a crazy man, small, redhead, crazy man, whom I saw when I was passing already in a truck, when they were taking me.</span> <span id="s354">He was all the time screaming and behaving like a lunatic.</span> <span id="s355">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s356">EM: You mentioned in a truck when you were taken...</span></p> <p><span id="s357">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">EM: Where you, where were you...</span></p> <p><span id="s359">RH: I have to explain all that from the very beginning.</span> <span id="s360">We knew that the action is coming.</span> <span id="s361">And everybody tried to find a hiding place.</span> <span id="s362">I was working in Fanto.</span> <span id="s363">We did...</span></p> <p><span id="s364">EM: In where?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">RH: Fanto.</span> <span id="s366">F-A-N-T-O.</span> <span id="s367">That were repair shops, metal repair shops.</span> <span id="s368">We were repairing machines, pumps, motors, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">EM: For the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">RH: For the Germans, of course, or, for the local industry mainly.</span> <span id="s371">They were established before the war, during Polish...</span></p> <p><span id="s372">EM: Was it...</span></p> <p><span id="s373">RH: Times.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">EM: Was it under German administration?</span> <span id="s375">Was...</span></p> <p><span id="s376">RH: Yes, all, all, everything was under German administration.</span> <span id="s377">And there were I think seven of us doing manual labor there.</span> <span id="s378">We were bringing coal from the railway station in five-ton trucks.</span> <span id="s379">Four of us had to go, load up the truck, and came to unload the truck.</span> <span id="s380">We were helping to put the big engines in their proper place for servicing, generally doing the manual labor.</span> <span id="s381">Because of, nobody knew where is the safe place, I was there, and my mother and father were hiding in the radiology room at the Polyklinic, who, one of the workers closed using his key, and they were hidden there.</span> <span id="s382">In the action...</span></p> <p><span id="s383">EM: Was this a Jewish worker, or a Polish worker?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">RH: No, no, no, that was, that was a s-...</span></p> <p><span id="s385">EM: No, the one...</span></p> <p><span id="s386">RH: The one who closed, this Polish worker.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">RH: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">EM: And did he know that your parents are...</span></p> <p><span id="s390">RH: He was my father's patient.</span> <span id="s391">Anyway, the action consisted of two parts.</span> <span id="s392">The action started on the 5th of August, 1942, and about 3,000 people were assembled at the railway station a day and a half later.</span> <span id="s393">About 200 of them went to a camp, at the Ulica Janowska in Lwow.</span> <span id="s394">About 200 were released still for the work in the local industry.</span> <span id="s395">And the rest was loaded in rail cars, approximately 100 to a rail car--children, women, men--it doesn't matter who it was, together, and taken directly to Belzec and murdered there.</span> <span id="s396">We thought that was the end, but about, they were taken away in the morning, but in the afternoon about lunchtime, the action started again.</span> <span id="s397">This was when we were taken from our work place.</span> <span id="s398">Somebody denounced us, and we were taken from our work place in a truck to...</span></p> <p><span id="s399">EM: What do you mean somebody denounced you?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">RH: One of the workers in the plant...</span></p> <p><span id="s401">EM: Denou-...</span></p> <p><span id="s402">RH: Denounced that there are Jews there.</span> <span id="s403">And so we were taken in a truck to assembly point, which was in Kino Grashzina [Grazyna] in our city.</span> <span id="s404">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s405">EM: Kino Grashzina?</span> <span id="s406">Grashzina is...</span></p> <p><span id="s407">RH: "Grazyna."</span> <span id="s408">"Grazyna" is the name.</span> <span id="s409">G-R-A-</span></p> <p><span id="s410">EM: A movie house.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">EM: A movie house.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">RH: A movie house, yes.</span> <span id="s414">And I was one of the first who came there.</span> <span id="s415">Then, they brought, because we were still not out, we were still outside, not inside the hall, they brought another group of women.</span> <span id="s416">One of them was carrying a tiny baby, and one of the Vernichtungskommando men grabbed the baby by the leg and smashed his head against the wall.</span> <span id="s417">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s418">EM: You saw that.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">RH: I saw that, yes.</span> <span id="s420">I don't know who the woman was.</span> <span id="s421">I don't know the name.</span> <span id="s422">So later on they put us inside, and they were bringing people in.</span> <span id="s423">You don't know the names, but, but a, a funny thing happened to me then, because they brought in a lady who was both relative and my mother's best friend.</span> <span id="s424">And before the war, about two years before the war, she sent her son away to Australia.</span> <span id="s425">And her name was Rappaport.</span> <span id="s426">They had a business in our city of parts, machine parts.</span> <span id="s427">And her name was Szichta.</span> <span id="s428">She came in, they took them from their work place, which was the office of an oil company.</span> <span id="s429">And I gave, I still had with me a piece of bread and a cucumber which I gave her, because she was hungry.</span> <span id="s430">And we started to talk and she said to me, "If you survive the war, please remember, tell my son to take revenge for me."</span> <span id="s431">So I said to her, "Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s432">We are all going to die here.</span> <span id="s433">There is no, this is the end."</span> <span id="s434">She said, "No.</span> <span id="s435">You'll survive the war.</span> <span id="s436">Remember to tell Milek to take revenge for me."</span> <span id="s437">Anyway, they started to bring more and more people in.</span> <span id="s438">The place was becoming more than full.</span> <span id="s439">They were using police dogs and butts of their guns to hit us and to chase us into one corner.</span> <span id="s440">There were no...</span></p> <p><span id="s441">EM: Were they all Germans who were doing it, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s442">RH: No, that was, Germans in combination with the Ukrainian police.</span> <span id="s443">One of the police was a man named Babiak [phonetic], who was my school friend, a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s444">My mother, prior to the action, my mother gave me a string of pearls, just in case I may have to bribe my way out.</span> <span id="s445">And he took that away from me, and he beat me up with the butt of the rifle.</span> <span id="s446">And there were no toilet facilities, of course, there, so all people had to do had to do on the floor.</span> <span id="s447">We were simply swimming in it.</span> <span id="s448">And, then at one stage, they, one of the young girls apparently went crazy.</span> <span id="s449">She started to scream and, she was the daughter of--her name was Malach--and she was the daughter of a man who had a strip iron business in our city.</span> <span id="s450">And, they shot her through the head, and they asked for two people to take her body out.</span> <span id="s451">I had been trying to escape whenever I, and so I did, I volunteered to take the body out.</span> <span id="s452">I thought perhaps being outside I might be able to run away.</span> <span id="s453">But, the girl was still alive, and the blood was oozing out of her head, perhaps from the artery in the head, and it was like a fountain.</span> <span id="s454">I was completely covered in blood.</span> <span id="s455">Anyway, we took her out, and I, when we took her out, they shot her again, and they shot her dead.</span> <span id="s456">But, I had no chance to escape at all, and they brought me back in.</span> <span id="s457">Then, the following day, they took us, all of us, to the station.</span> <span id="s458">There were about two-and-a-half thousand people.</span> <span id="s459">And again, there was a selection on the station.</span> <span id="s460">The director of the oil company, who was to some degree sympathetic to the Jews, whose name is Beitz, and he was later a very big figure in Germany, a director of Krupp Works, and also the first man to introduce business relations between Germany--West Germany--and Russia.</span> <span id="s461">That...</span></p> <p><span id="s462">EM: His name was Beitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">RH: Beitz.</span> <span id="s464">I..</span> <span id="s465">.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">EM: And he, was he a German that came from Germany or somebody that...</span></p> <p><span id="s467">RH: No, no.</span> <span id="s468">He was a German who came from Germany, apparently a nephew of, governor of Poland Frank.</span> <span id="s469">He was a very young man.</span> <span id="s470">He was, he looked like a film actor.</span> <span id="s471">He dressed extremely nice.</span> <span id="s472">And so, his wife was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s473">And she had a..</span> <span id="s474">.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">EM: He was a civilian?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">RH: He was a civilian in charge of the oil industry in Poland.</span> <span id="s477">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s478">EM: In Poland, or in Boryslaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">RH: Sorry, in our city, in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s480">That was the only city that, apart from small quantities in the west, Boryslaw was the main producer of oil.</span> <span id="s481">And, at one stage he arrived at the station and started to greet the Germans who were there, who were segregating the Jews.</span> <span id="s482">Somehow I, and a friend of mine who is now in Israel, because their attention was diverted there, and despite the fact that we were guarded by police dogs and machine guns and everything else--the two of us ran away.</span> <span id="s483">The rest...</span></p> <p><span id="s484">EM: You mentioned that he was a little sympathetic to the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">RH: He was helping--right through the German occupation--he was helping the Jews.</span> <span id="s486">In that respect, for instance, he knew in advance when the action is coming, so, before the fourth action started, he assembled all the Jews in his office, and told them not to move from there.</span> <span id="s487">But, the Reiterzugpolizei, which is the mounted police, came when he was asleep and took all the Jews in the fourth action out of the place they were in.</span> <span id="s488">But generally he was sympathetic towards Jews.</span> <span id="s489">He was rewarded after the war for his sympathetic work for the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">EM: By whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">RH: By the Jews, several Jews, and also, they even wanted to put his name as a Righteous Jew in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s492">EM: Righteous Gentile.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">RH: Righteous Gentile in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s494">But, coming back to the action, the rest of, was taken again to either Belzec or the work, or the, or the Janowska camp in Lwow.</span> <span id="s495">And within those three days we lost five-and-a-half thousand Jews from our population.</span> <span id="s496">It was a terrible blow to everybody, because everybody was affected to one degree or another.</span> <span id="s497">And, at the same time, there was hunger.</span> <span id="s498">There were dozens of people dying on the streets, people with swollen legs from hunger, people with open wounds and worms on those wounds, people crying and begging, because death caused by starvation is a terrible death and causes a lot of pain.</span> <span id="s499">And beatings, and everything else...</span></p> <p><span id="s500">EM: But there was still...</span></p> <p><span id="s501">RH: From beatings.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">EM: There was still no ghetto?</span> <span id="s503">Or was this in...</span></p> <p><span id="s504">RH: There was still no ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">EM: So there were non-Jews mixed in with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">RH: We, together...</span></p> <p><span id="s507">EM: Together.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">RH: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s509">Then, just to continue the story, the fourth action came again in the end of October, beginning of November, 1942.</span> <span id="s510">Again, at that time the assembly point was a cinema, or a theater, this time Koloseum.</span> <span id="s511">And, they assembled about 1,500 people there.</span> <span id="s512">At that time I was hidden again by one of my father's patients, who was married to a Jewess, and she was also hidden.</span> <span id="s513">He hid me on the, on the, under the roof of a factory, where he was the manager.</span> <span id="s514">And, I was not supposed to move at all, because not, so that the people underneath me didn't know that there is somebody there.</span> <span id="s515">And so I didn't move.</span> <span id="s516">They took the 1,500 people immediately to Belzec, and they were destroyed there.</span> <span id="s517">When I came out of this hiding, he called me and he asked me how old I am, and I said, "I am 18."</span> <span id="s518">So he said, "Well, you must act as if you were a grown man, because your father was taken in this action."</span> <span id="s519">For some reason, they, out of those 1,500 people that they took to the station, at the station they released all the Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s520">So my father was still alive, and he was still intact.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">EM: How many doctors were there?</span> <span id="s522">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">RH: Approximately a dozen.</span> <span id="s524">I can't tell you the exact figure.</span> <span id="s525">I remember a lot of their names, but not all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">EM: Were, just before the action, or before these actions, was your, were your parents hiding somewhere, or did they still live in their apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">RH: No, they, my father was working.</span> <span id="s528">They took him from the place of work.</span> <span id="s529">My mother was hiding.</span> <span id="s530">Everybody was trying to hide anywhere they could.</span> <span id="s531">It was just the chance that you could be hidden so the Germans and the locals couldn't find you.</span> <span id="s532">Because there was, during the action there was not only the action by the German police and Ukrainians, and the Reiterzugpolizei, they were helped, all during the, all the actions they were very actively helped by the Polish and Ukrainian population, by their young people, hoodlums, and just young people, and generally the population who delighted in showing the Germans where the Jews live, or where they can hide, or if they were hidden, where they are.</span> <span id="s533">And only because of the very big cooperation of the local population, they could have such a success.</span> <span id="s534">In our city we had, apart from the helpers in population, we had quite, quite another form of, we had Schutzpolizei, which was mainly, not mainly, but all, Austrians.</span> <span id="s535">Only the Kommandant of the Schutzpolizei was a German from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s536">They were...</span></p> <p><span id="s537">EM: Do you remember his name by any chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">RH: I know his name, but at the moment it just doesn't come to me in the moment.</span> <span id="s539">We had, the Schutzpolizei consisted of Austrians, who were the most terrible, the most, the most sadistic people I know.</span> <span id="s540">In addition to that, we had Reiterzugpolizei, which is the mounted police, which consisted of all Austrians, young boys who were sadistic to an incredible degree.</span> <span id="s541">And we had the Kriminalpolizei, in which some Poles and Ukrainians worked, but which consisted of Germans.</span> <span id="s542">And we had the Jewish Ordnungsdienst from, appointed by Judenrat, and we simply were hunted like dogs.</span> <span id="s543">We didn't know what to do and where to hide, and whom to trust.</span> <span id="s544">The situation was absolutely catastrophic.</span> <span id="s545">And, so I come now to the fifth action, which was in December, 1942.</span> <span id="s546">That action was mainly for Jewish old people, Jewish women, and children.</span> <span id="s547">That action lasted five weeks.</span> <span id="s548">My mother was hiding at the Ukrainian's place, where he was keeping his utensils.</span> <span id="s549">He, she was standing up in a small wardrobe all the time, and let out at night for a short time.</span> <span id="s550">And all those five weeks she was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">EM: Was this Ukrainian, was he being paid for hiding her, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s552">RH: No, that was my father's patient.</span> <span id="s553">He hid my mother for nothing.</span> <span id="s554">At that time my auntie, my, that is, my mother's youngest sister, and my grandmother--my mother's mother--were taken by the Germans.</span> <span id="s555">And all those people were taken to the cellars of Ukrainian police.</span> <span id="s556">And the Ukrainian police was commanded by a Ukrainian by the name of Peretz...</span></p> <p><span id="s557">EM: Peretz?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">RH: Peretz, who was later on, after the war finished, found and executed in Poland, and, by a yo--an Austrian man.</span> <span id="s559">And he was the overall Kommandant.</span> <span id="s560">And he had an aversion to old people.</span> <span id="s561">At that time I could, a man could travel quite openly and nothing happened to them.</span> <span id="s562">I took my mother's fur and I took it to him, and asked him to release my auntie and my grandmother.</span> <span id="s563">He released my auntie, but she, he said to me, "Die Alte muss sterben" [The old one must die.]</span></p> <p><span id="s564">EM: The old one...</span></p> <p><span id="s565">RH: "The old one has to die."</span> <span id="s566">So, my father got hold of some poison.</span> <span id="s567">I took the poison to my grandmother, and she knew that she has to die.</span> <span id="s568">And, she then said to me, "Yes, yes, my son.</span> <span id="s569">One mother can bring up ten children, but ten children can't save one mother."</span> <span id="s570">The unfortunate part of it...</span></p> <p><span id="s571">EM: Was this your mother's mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">RH: My mother's mother.</span> <span id="s573">The unfortunate part of it was that she gave part of the poison to another lady there, consequently her death was not immediate.</span> <span id="s574">She was dying for one day before she died.</span> <span id="s575">And then they released the body to me and my uncle.</span> <span id="s576">And we took the body, we carried the body to the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s577">We buried my grandmother and, with a penknife I made, I inscribed her name and the date of death on the tree that was standing nearby.</span> <span id="s578">After the Russians came again in 1944, we put a monument to my grandmother there.</span> <span id="s579">Then the, all the people that were there at the fifth action, all the women and children, were taken and shot on the outskirts of the town.</span> <span id="s580">In February 1943, there was another action.</span> <span id="s581">That action was on the 15th of February in 1943.</span> <span id="s582">It was because of the German loss in Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s583">That was a so-called revenge action for Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s584">Again, they took at random 600 Jews and they shot them on the outskirts of the town.</span> <span id="s585">The place was called Doly, which means graves or holes.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">EM: Where were they buried?</span> <span id="s587">Right at the outskirts of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">RH: That's right, yes.</span> <span id="s589">And that was the sixth action.</span> <span id="s590">Then, there were, after the sixth action started so-called liquidation actions, seven, eight, nine, ten and so forth.</span> <span id="s591">But every Jew called was shot on the spot--by anybody who was there.</span> <span id="s592">And then, that's when...</span></p> <p><span id="s593">EM: What do you mean was called to report somewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">RH: Well, we had several sections of Jews.</span> <span id="s595">The Jews, those Jews that were working were to some degree protected.</span> <span id="s596">Apart from the arm bands with the number which we had and the documents that we are working, we also had a little letter "R" on a cloth, which we had to wear in front of our, on our chest.</span> <span id="s597">That letter specified that we are in the Rüstungindustrie, which means the industry necessary for war effort.</span> <span id="s598">And those Jews if they were called, were released because of that.</span> <span id="s599">I was one of those, and at the same time, because of the fact that we had to work in different places, in different oil wells, we also had Passierschein, which was issued by the oil industry, signed by Beitz--I mentioned before, who was the director of the oil industry--and that gave us the permission to move outside the ghetto, outside the Jewish quarter.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">EM: So, oh, so, at that time the ghetto was established then?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">RH: After the fifth action, the ghetto was established.</span> <span id="s602">Again, the conditions in ghetto were poor, because there was no food, no sanitation, no, the, the- Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s603">RH: I will continue now.</span> <span id="s604">Of course, all the facts that I gave you were just cold facts with dates, and happenings.</span> <span id="s605">But, who can describe the fright, the expectation of death, the, the terrible conditions, the screaming, the choking of children by parents who were hiding and didn’t want their children to utter a noise so that they can’t be, they won’t be shot, caught, caught by the whoever it was.</span> <span id="s606">And, and by the incredible feeling of being hunted by everybody in this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">EM: Tell me more about the ghetto itself.</span> <span id="s608">Was it surrounded by a wall?</span> <span id="s609">Were there entrances?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">RH: No, the ghetto...</span></p> <p><span id="s611">EM: Was it guarded?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">RH: No, the ghetto was bordered by certain streets.</span> <span id="s613">It was not surrounded by a wall.</span> <span id="s614">It was just that...</span></p> <p><span id="s615">EM: Was there a fence around it?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">RH: There was no fence, and, the only thing was that the Jews were not permitted to go outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s617">If they did, they were shot at sight, and, or beaten up and shot, and whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">EM: Could you take your armband off and go outside of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">RH: A lot of people were risking that, and doing that.</span> <span id="s620">Some who were caught were shot.</span> <span id="s621">Who were not caught, they were, they survived.</span> <span id="s622">We were living at the edge of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s623">It was so-called Doctor’s House, where we were hiding during those actions, that were Vernichtungs [killer] actions.</span> <span id="s624">They were the last ones before forming a camp in the northern part of the city.</span> <span id="s625">We were hiding in the cellar of the house, and somehow nobody took us out, and we could hear all the screams and beatings and everything passing right in front of us each time the action was on.</span> <span id="s626">And, during those seventh, eighth, and ninth actions, whoever was caught was, of course, shot and killed.</span> <span id="s627">The people who survived, mainly those people who were working, or who had the permits to work, were collected in a camp, which was prior to death.</span> <span id="s628">In a place where they were holding horses, they converted the place to a Jewish camp.</span> <span id="s629">There were bunks there.</span> <span id="s630">They, they, we were sleeping in bunks.</span> <span id="s631">They, we, there was a kitchen who distributed the food.</span> <span id="s632">And every day those Jews who worked in different sections of town could go there, having the paper in their hands, and the site they are in industry.</span> <span id="s633">Other Jews were marched in columns from the camp to certain place of work, under guard, either Ukrainian police--mainly Ukrainian police at that time.</span> <span id="s634">At the time also Ukrainian police was designed to guard our camp.</span> <span id="s635">Again, for some...</span></p> <p><span id="s636">EM: What month was it?</span> <span id="s637">Was, it was in 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">RH: ‘43, yes.</span> <span id="s639">Yes.</span> <span id="s640">That was beginning about February, ‘43.</span> <span id="s641">Even, I think, that’s even in January already, ‘43, because it took some time to, for the camp to be established and then for all the Jews that remained to be, to be put there.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">EM: So there were Jews that worked...</span></p> <p><span id="s643">RH: That’s right, in...</span></p> <p><span id="s644">EM: In the camp.</span> <span id="s645">And they were taken out of this camp to different work sites.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">RH: To, that’s correct, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">EM: How about the ghetto itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">RH: The ghetto was eliminated.</span> <span id="s649">The ghetto, there was non-existent anymore.</span> <span id="s650">The other population of town moved to those places that were reasonably good for occupation.</span> <span id="s651">Other Jewish homes--in amongst those, my grandmother’s home--were sold to the population to be demolished and the material used to their, for their pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">EM: So there were, how about older people, or children, or women.</span> <span id="s653">Were they all...</span></p> <p><span id="s654">RH: They were all killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">EM: They were all...</span></p> <p><span id="s656">RH: Killed, or hidden away somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">EM: All hidden away.</span> <span id="s658">And in this camp there were only men?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">RH: No, men and women.</span> <span id="s660">And, it was mixed.</span> <span id="s661">It was, women had separate rooms, or separate sections.</span> <span id="s662">And they were mainly men and women, able-bodied people, who were still being used by the Germans for work.</span> <span id="s663">For some reason again, Doctor’s House was situated opposite the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">EM: What do you mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s665">RH: On the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">EM: Why was it called Doctor’s House?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">RH: Because doctors were still, because, they had no, not enough either Polish or Ukrainian doctors.</span> <span id="s668">They were using Polish doctors to work in the Polyklinic for the whole population of the city.</span> <span id="s669">And because the doctors have to be available at all hours, there was a doctor’s house where doctors were permitted to go to work, again using their Passierschein, that document that permitted them to work...</span></p> <p><span id="s670">EM: So there were some Jewish doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">RH: Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s672">They were all Jewish doctors in that house.</span> <span id="s673">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s674">EM: Did they treat non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">RH: They treat non-Jews, and Jews.</span> <span id="s676">Of course, they were under strict supervision and so on.</span> <span id="s677">The situation in camp was reasonably bearable, except for Ukrainians who delighted in beating us up.</span> <span id="s678">And towards the end of the camp, a few months before...</span></p> <p><span id="s679">EM: Excuse me, the Ukrainians that were working there, were supervi--were they local Ukrainians...</span></p> <p><span id="s680">RH: Local, all local Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s681">The whole Ukrainian police were locals.</span> <span id="s682">And then at one stage came two Gestapo men to supervise the camp--one older man and one younger.</span> <span id="s683">And for unexplained reasons, the situation improved immensely.</span> <span id="s684">The older man, both men, liked to drink heavily.</span> <span id="s685">And the Jews immediately found their soft spots.</span> <span id="s686">The older man was not completely for war.</span> <span id="s687">He even made some jokes about the defeat and so on.</span> <span id="s688">The younger man was worse than he was, but not as bad, by far not as bad, as the Ukrainian police.</span> <span id="s689">And they were both being bribed usually by either money, but mainly by alcohol.</span> <span id="s690">And we could...</span></p> <p><span id="s691">EM: Do you remember the names of these men?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">RH: I don’t, no, I don’t.</span> <span id="s693">And we, the Russian, we, I was working outside in the oil well, and people who were working there, they were Poles who belonged to underworld, underground organization, A.K., and...</span></p> <p><span id="s694">EM: That’s the organiza-...</span></p> <p><span id="s695">RH: Armia Krajowa [Polish: Home Army].</span> <span id="s696">And they also received underground paper, which I read.</span> <span id="s697">And also at the same time I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s698">EM: You mean newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">RH: Newspa--or leaflet.</span> <span id="s700">It sort, it wasn’t a complete newspaper.</span> <span id="s701">It was printed secretly, of course.</span> <span id="s702">And there they had a radio, where I could listen to news from London, in Polish, and after a certain time I was trained to such a degree that I could memorize all the news and where the battles are in the, in Russia and so on, and what’s happening, and bring all the news to the camp.</span> <span id="s703">And I had to recite all the news so that people in the camp knew what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">EM: How many people, approximately how many people were in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">RH: At different times, different number, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s706">EM: Was it in the hundreds?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">RH: No, the, the, in the camp, between 1,500 and 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s708">And, what happened then...</span></p> <p><span id="s709">EM: Excuse me, the camp, what was the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">RH: There was no name.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">EM: There was no...</span></p> <p><span id="s712">RH: There was, the name what, was simply Zwangsarbeitslager [forced labor camp], of S.S. and Polit--the name was S.S. Sturmführer or whatever, of the Zwangsarbeitslager in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s713">That was the name.</span> <span id="s714">And listening to the radio and then at later stage reading the Polish news by A.K., which were warning Poles against hiding the Jews, and saying that, since the Russians are coming back, the Russian front is, was going west, and the Germans were, all being defeated on all fronts, the Poles, the A.K., which is Armia Krajowa, was warning the Poles against cooperation with the Jews or saving the Jews, because they expected that immediately the Russians come, they would be working with the Russians...</span></p> <p><span id="s715">EM: That the Jews would be...</span></p> <p><span id="s716">RH: That the Jews will be helping the Russians to exterminate the Poles.</span> <span id="s717">The situation was becoming tragic, and everybody was, started to look for place where to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">EM: Now who was warning the, the A.K. was...</span></p> <p><span id="s719">RH: A.K. was warning Poles, yes.</span> <span id="s720">And I read the paper.</span> <span id="s721">There was no secret about it.</span> <span id="s722">At, by chance, my mother, my father knew a man by the name of Makar, who was the mayor of the town, who was a very...</span></p> <p><span id="s723">EM: Was he a Pole, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s724">RH: He was a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s725">He was a very decent man.</span> <span id="s726">And my father knew him from before the war.</span> <span id="s727">Before the war in Boryslaw there was a company by the name of Penier [phonetic].</span> <span id="s728">The director of that company was a Jew named Freund.</span> <span id="s729">And, em, this...</span></p> <p><span id="s730">EM: What kind of company was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">RH: Oil company.</span> <span id="s732">They were all oil companies.</span> <span id="s733">It was very known oil companies.</span> <span id="s734">And this man Makar [phonetic] was one of the directors of a oil well district for that company.</span> <span id="s735">It happened so that before the war, my father, the brother of the Jewish director, Jozek Freund, and that Makar, we were together, holidaying together in holiday homes of that part of the oil company, which was situated high in the mountains.</span> <span id="s736">And they were playing cards together, and they were very friendly together.</span> <span id="s737">When the time came to hide, I had offers for some, from some Poles to hide us, and, but I thought that they were collaborators, and I didn’t trust them.</span> <span id="s738">As it turned out to be, one of them was not only real, but he hid 13 Jews, and he didn’t take any money for it.</span> <span id="s739">But I, you didn’t know whom to trust, because a lot of Poles and Ukrainians were hiding the Jews only to rob them and to denounce them to the Germans.</span> <span id="s740">Anyway, my father went to this man Makar, and asked him if he could do something for us and hide us.</span> <span id="s741">And he said, “I can’t, but I’ll tell my son to hide you.”</span> <span id="s742">This son was working together with my future wife, Rita, in the same office.</span> <span id="s743">And he was considered to be a very big antisemite.</span> <span id="s744">Anyway, we came in there during the night--my future wife Rita and my parents.</span> <span id="s745">Prior to that already in the hiding place was my auntie Ania, who is my mother’s sister, who is still alive today in Sydney, Australia.</span> <span id="s746">And there were other people.</span> <span id="s747">Altogether there were 13 of us.</span> <span id="s748">And we were hiding under the floor of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">EM: Under the...</span></p> <p><span id="s750">RH: Under the floor of the house.</span> <span id="s751">But that was not, it was, you could only crawl in there.</span> <span id="s752">And when we came to the hiding place, we were, of course, paying him for hiding us, but he would not take money for my future wife, Rita, because he was working with her, and he knew that she had no money.</span> <span id="s753">So he said, “For her, I will not take any money.”</span> <span id="s754">He had a wife and two small children, and he risked his life all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">EM: This was the son of Makar.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">RH: This was also Makar, but the son of the old man, who was the director of that oil part.</span> <span id="s757">And we were there for four-and-a-half months, until the Russians came.</span> <span id="s758">And we were hiding during the day under the floor of the house.</span> <span id="s759">We were coming out to the kitchen for the night to make something to eat.</span> <span id="s760">He organized the supply of food so that all his relatives, each of them was buying the food separately.</span> <span id="s761">Because if you would buy the food for 13 people, it would immediately be suspicious, and he would be found.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">EM: That means that his relatives must have also known that you were hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">RH: We thought that no one knows, but everybody knew.</span> <span id="s764">That was, everybody from that family, from that Makar family.</span> <span id="s765">And when we came, then on the 8th of August, 1944, the Russians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">EM: So you were hiding for, you said...</span></p> <p><span id="s767">RH: For a, we...</span></p> <p><span id="s768">EM: From...</span></p> <p><span id="s769">RH: We went to the hiding place on the 13th of March, 1944.</span> <span id="s770">We came out on the 8th of August, 1944, when the Russians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">EM: What was happening in 1944, between January and March...</span></p> <p><span id="s772">RH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">EM: 1944, in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s774">RH: The Jews were, at that time all the eastern part of Poland was already judenfrei.</span> <span id="s775">The Jews that were found there were either killed or sent to our camp.</span> <span id="s776">On the 14th of April, 1944, they deported all the Jews.</span> <span id="s777">That was the first deportation of all the Jews from the camp.</span> <span id="s778">And the Jews went to Plaszow, near Krakow, to the camp there.</span> <span id="s779">And amongst those were my future wife’s mother and father.</span> <span id="s780">But we thought that that was the end of the story.</span> <span id="s781">In the meantime they were bringing again Jews from all over the place, and the Jews that were caught in our city.</span> <span id="s782">And immedia--and again the camp filled.</span> <span id="s783">And they...</span></p> <p><span id="s784">EM: This was the work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">RH: That was Zwangsarbeitslager.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">EM: Zwangsarbeitslager.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s788">And again they took the whole transport to Plaszow.</span> <span id="s789">The third and last transport--of the same number of people approximately--was taken only two weeks before the Russians came.</span> <span id="s790">And apparently that transport could not go already directly west.</span> <span id="s791">They had to go to Hungary, where a lot of people on the way escaped.</span> <span id="s792">They went to Plaszow, and to Auschwitz, it depends.</span> <span id="s793">Also from Plaszow there was a selection, and people went from Plaszow to Auschwitz or other camps, like Mauthausen and other camps--Birkenau and so on--during, they were sent during the selection in Plaszow.</span> <span id="s794">We didn’t know about all that.</span> <span id="s795">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s796">We thought that they were all dead.</span> <span id="s797">We had no idea where they were being taken and so on.</span> <span id="s798">When the Russians came, when the front came, on the 8th of August, 1944, there was still fighting going on in our city.</span> <span id="s799">The Germans were in the mountains shooting, and the Russians below.</span> <span id="s800">I and my future wife Rita came out, and we were literally in rags.</span> <span id="s801">We spoke Russian, because we had Russian in school previous to that.</span> <span id="s802">We met the first Russian troops, one officer and two other men.</span> <span id="s803">And, with a big jubilation we told them that we are Jews, in Russian.</span> <span id="s804">So he said, “What?</span> <span id="s805">Still some Jews survive?</span> <span id="s806">What Hitler didn’t finish, we will.”</span> <span id="s807">That was my first contact again with the Russians--my great jubilation.</span> <span id="s808">Immediately the Russians came.</span> <span id="s809">They, life came to normal.</span> <span id="s810">I forgot to tell you that when the war started between Russia and Germany, prior to going back the Russians dynamited all oil wells, dynamited the electric station, which was the biggest station for the whole area, because we have gas and it was gas powered--dynamited anything they could, dynamited big, huge oil tanks full with oil and petrol.</span> <span id="s811">Big, and, big slices of metal, which from the tanks were flying around like paper, rags of paper all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">EM: That was when the Russians got to...</span></p> <p><span id="s813">RH: This was the Russians in 1941.</span> <span id="s814">Immediately then the Germans reestablished the industry.</span> <span id="s815">Everything started to work about a week later.</span> <span id="s816">But, and this time, also in 1944, when the Russians came, they opened the schools immediately.</span> <span id="s817">They started...</span></p> <p><span id="s818">EM: The Germans didn’t have time to dynamite the...</span></p> <p><span id="s819">RH: No, the Germans didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s820">They didn’t have time.</span> <span id="s821">The Russians opened the schools, and everything was as normal.</span> <span id="s822">Of course, when the Russians came, and the conditions were different there, their army was not the army we knew before.</span> <span id="s823">They, they, [unclear] during 1943 and after the conference in Yalta, and Stalin canceled the International established Officers Corps, and Russian army with officers wearing their insignia.</span> <span id="s824">The whole Russian army and the whole attitude changed.</span> <span id="s825">And already then there was very strong antisemitic feeling between the Russians.</span> <span id="s826">The Russian Jews, officers and others, were trying to change their names, to change their nationality and their passports, because there was open antisemitism throughout the country.</span> <span id="s827">They, during the war, Stalin, wanting to save Russia, introduced the old cry of the old Russia, which was Bij zydow-spasay rossiyu “Kill the Jews, and,” or, “Hit the Jews and save Russia.”</span> <span id="s828">And, the conditions for us were normal.</span> <span id="s829">We went back to school.</span> <span id="s830">We went back to evening school, because everybody had to work during the day.</span> <span id="s831">So, myself and my future wife and whoever survived, some people...</span></p> <p><span id="s832">EM: So how many people would you say, what percentage maybe of the Jews that...</span></p> <p><span id="s833">RH: Well, out of our population, that is 14--15,000 people, 15,000 Jews approximately in our city, plus all the Jews that were brought in from other parts of Poland, which were already judenfrei, 220 approximately, survived.</span> <span id="s834">And a lot of the young boys who survived then, were taken immediately into the Russian army to the front, and a lot of them died on the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">EM: You mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s836">RH: I was lucky...</span></p> <p><span id="s837">EM: They were Polish citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">RH: No, they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s839">EM: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">RH: They were Russian citizens.</span> <span id="s841">They were considered Russian citizens, because there was Russia prior between 1939 and ‘41.</span> <span id="s842">They, we had Russian passports, Russian documents, and they were considered Russian citizens.</span> <span id="s843">And immediately, they were simply either catching people in their work place or anywhere they could, any young people and putting them into the army, usually in the first battalions, who were facing the first fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">EM: Was it a, it was a Russian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">RH: Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">EM: It wasn’t a Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">RH: There was no, no.</span> <span id="s848">The Polish army was forming then in Russia, and was already fighting, and it was near Warsaw and so on, but that was pure Russian army.</span> <span id="s849">We belonged to the western part of the Ukraine, which was, there were no separate states.</span> <span id="s850">It was all one Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s851">And quite a few Jewish boys died on the front then--surviving Hitler, died on the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">EM: Did they also take any Poles that lived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">RH: Yes, they did, but a very small percentage, mainly Jews, and a few Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s854">Because my father was a doctor, and because the doctors in the military commission were my father’s friends, he succeeded in my exemption from military duty.</span> <span id="s855">And I was just working.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">EM: Where were you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">RH: In the oil industry.</span> <span id="s858">And my future wife, Rita, was working as a secretary in the high school.</span> <span id="s859">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s860">EM: Let’s continue about the life in 1944 under the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">RH: When the Russians came in, we could not go back to our house, because high Russian officers were living there.</span> <span id="s862">We were allotted another living quarters, and the Russians have very strict rule regarding the space every person can occupy.</span> <span id="s863">So we had, all of us together had two rooms and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s864">In the same building were living Russian officers and their wives.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">EM: Did your father work as a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">RH: My father started immediately work as a doctor, and because of that, we could somehow manage, because, at that time, money was almost worthless.</span> <span id="s867">But patients were bringing us butter and chicken and whatever.</span> <span id="s868">And we could, we had com--in comparison, we had better conditions because we have something to eat.</span> <span id="s869">Also at the same time I decided that because we had nothing, everything was, we lost everything, to make some money so that we could survive.</span> <span id="s870">And the sense of business, which I perhaps inherited after my grandfather on my mother’s side, enabled me to start something.</span> <span id="s871">I discovered that in a place not far from our city near the holiday resort of Truskawiec, were salt mines.</span> <span id="s872">So, I collected as many, as much clothing as I could.</span> <span id="s873">And I went to the salt mines.</span> <span id="s874">I organized a driver from the Russian army, also a Jew, and they gave me then 900 kilograms of the salt for that.</span> <span id="s875">And I took that on a truck and we took it to Lwow and I sold it there and I made a good profit.</span> <span id="s876">Since then, I started to travel between those mines and Lwow, taking salt to Lwow, and bringing other goods back to us.</span> <span id="s877">Little did I know, I was using the truck from border troops, and little did I know that I was being observed all the time.</span> <span id="s878">Later on, I started to use the trucks belonging to the unit of anti-aircraft artillery, and I had a friend that, a man there, who I thought was a friend, but at the same time he was the spy.</span> <span id="s879">And at one stage they imprisoned me.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">EM: The Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">RH: The Russians imprisoned me.</span> <span id="s882">They brought, they came and they took me away, and no one knew where.</span> <span id="s883">I was taken to a house outside the city, a special trial judge in the form of a Pulkownik [colonel], which is the Colonel, and a Mayor and another officer, which formed a trial jury or judge--because there was, there is no other system in Russia.</span> <span id="s884">They knew everything from the beginning what I was doing.</span> <span id="s885">They were bringing all drivers as witnesses, and they told me quite openly that there is no way out of here.</span> <span id="s886">Either I will be shot or taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s887">They were the only two ways out.</span> <span id="s888">In the meantime, my father was making frantic efforts to establish where I was, and he couldn’t, nobody could find out.</span> <span id="s889">Finally somebody found out that a unit which was, what was called SMERSH, which is an antispy unit, was, took me, and somehow by bribe, by bribing an officer of the secret police in our city, they brought me in the same car under my house and they released me without saying why or what.</span> <span id="s890">And I was released.</span> <span id="s891">Then, a couple of months later, they arrested a number of people in our city.</span> <span id="s892">One of those was a Pole by the name of Jankowski, who was the director of the oil district where I was working, where I told you before.</span> <span id="s893">I was listening to the radio and reading the Polish A.K. [Armia Krajowa] paper.</span> <span id="s894">He was one of those Poles who helped Jews.</span> <span id="s895">He was my father’s friend, and he helped us, and he was the only man who was in communication with us during our hiding place under the floor.</span> <span id="s896">When they imprisoned him, I just came back from another trip, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s897">EM: You continued with your activity with, for buying this salt, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s898">RH: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s899">And his daughter came running, “Please help us.</span> <span id="s900">They imprisoned my father.”</span> <span id="s901">And he was helping also another family, Jewish family, by the name of Szenkler.</span> <span id="s902">And she told us that this man Szenkler is already there at the police, he survived and could they please do something.</span> <span id="s903">So, I was cold and hungry and miserable, because the travel, it was wintertime, and the travel from Lwow to Boryslaw was in an open truck.</span> <span id="s904">But despite that fact I just went immediately to the police, and I started literally screaming at the Kommandant of the police, that that was a good man and he was helping the Jews, and why do you, what do you want from him?</span> <span id="s905">You should release him straight away, and so on.</span> <span id="s906">That was a mayor also who came here specially from Lwow to arrest all the Poles or Ukrainians or Jews.</span> <span id="s907">Luck had it that my father was treating him a few days before for some illness, and he cured him.</span> <span id="s908">And then when, so, when I came screaming...</span></p> <p><span id="s909">EM: A cure, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s910">RH: Well, he only had a flu...</span></p> <p><span id="s911">EM: You mean this Jankowski, or this ma-...</span></p> <p><span id="s912">RH: No, no, this...</span></p> <p><span id="s913">EM: Major?</span> <span id="s914">Major?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">RH: Russian officer.</span> <span id="s916">This Major.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">EM: Oh, Major.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">RH: So, when we came, and I was screaming to that Major that he should release Jankowski and he, that he is a good man and he was helping and so on, he asked this other Jew who came with me, Szenkler, “What do you say?”</span> <span id="s919">And he said, “I- Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s920">RH: ...My father went to this Mayor, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s921">EM: Major.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">RH: Major of Soviet Secret Police.</span> <span id="s923">He was specially sent from Lwow for arresting all the Poles and Ukrainians and Jews at that moment.</span> <span id="s924">And he told them, “Look, you have imprisoned my son.</span> <span id="s925">Please tell me why.</span> <span id="s926">Tell me, help me and release my son.”</span> <span id="s927">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s928">EM: Oh, you mean, he imprisoned you after you yelled at him?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">RH: After I yelled, he imprisoned me with all the other people that were already there in the cell, and that was at the premises of the old, of the old Russian Secret Police, and then the German Reiterzugpolizei.</span> <span id="s930">They all used the same building.</span> <span id="s931">So, he said, “But he tells me that I am wrong, that I don’t know what I am doing.”</span> <span id="s932">So my father said, “What?”</span> <span id="s933">So he said, “Just wait a moment, you’ll see.”</span> <span id="s934">So he hid my father behind the door.</span> <span id="s935">They called me again, and he said, “So what do you say?”</span> <span id="s936">I said, “I say that you don’t know what you are doing.</span> <span id="s937">And you are releasing a good man, you are accusing a good man of, a man who helped the Jews, and, you know.”</span> <span id="s938">So he said, “See?</span> <span id="s939">I told you.”</span> <span id="s940">He said to my father, “See?</span> <span id="s941">I told you.</span> <span id="s942">See what he says.”</span> <span id="s943">So anyway, they, he started to smile, and then he released me in the hands of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">EM: How about this Jankowski?</span> <span id="s945">Did...</span></p> <p><span id="s946">RH: Yeah, the Jankowski was sent away to a prison in Lwow, and then a couple of months later, there was very poor communication, and I was walking from the city, from Drohobycz, which was situated not far from our city.</span> <span id="s947">And suddenly a cart pulled by horses passes me, and a voice says, “You don’t recognize me?”</span> <span id="s948">And I really didn’t recognize him.</span> <span id="s949">His face was, he was very, he lost a lot of weight.</span> <span id="s950">He was unshaven.</span> <span id="s951">But, they released him.</span> <span id="s952">Whether they released him because of my testimony or my screaming, whether they just released him, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s953">But the fact is that he was free again.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">EM: But it was after a couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">RH: After a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">EM: Months.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">RH: Anyway, at that time, the agreement was signed between Poles and Russians, and all the Poles and Jews who wanted to leave and go to Poland were exchanged for Ukrainians who were living in Poland, in the Polish part.</span> <span id="s958">And, of course, 99% of Jews registered, and he was one of the first Poles, Jankowski was the, one of the first Poles to leave.</span> <span id="s959">And we were only waiting to finish, to have a leaving certificate, to have the Matura [certificate of completing secondary education], from our high school, to leave, too.</span> <span id="s960">But, about a week before we had the Matura, because we had our results, the constitu-...</span></p> <p><span id="s961">EM: Matura is that exam that...</span></p> <p><span id="s962">RH: Matura is the leaving, the last exam finishing the high school.</span> <span id="s963">And, the prosecutor of the Secret Police met me in the street, and he said, “Oh.</span> <span id="s964">I want to see you.</span> <span id="s965">Come and see me tomorrow, in such and such a time, in Drohobycz,” which was the next city.</span> <span id="s966">And I knew that the invitation spelled...</span></p> <p><span id="s967">EM: Trouble?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">RH: Jail, at worst.</span> <span id="s969">So I said, “Look.</span> <span id="s970">Please do me a favor.</span> <span id="s971">We are having now our last exams.</span> <span id="s972">How about if I see you immediately after we pass the exams?”</span> <span id="s973">So he said, “Yes, but remember, come and see me.</span> <span id="s974">Otherwise I’ll find you.”</span> <span id="s975">But, after we finished our exams and got our certificates, the following day we were on the train to Poland, and I escaped by, by, by a thread.</span> <span id="s976">So that was my experience in...</span></p> <p><span id="s977">EM: So who left?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">RH: We left first, that is my future wife, Rita, and myself.</span> <span id="s979">My parents stayed behind.</span> <span id="s980">They left later on, also in the same way.</span> <span id="s981">And we went to Poland.</span> <span id="s982">I went to Wroclaw, where, first of all to Gliwice, where relatives, my relatives were, then to Wroclaw where my father and my mother came.</span> <span id="s983">My, we got housing through the city authorities.</span> <span id="s984">My father opened a practice and was working for the local polyclinic.</span> <span id="s985">The life came more or less to normal.</span> <span id="s986">I started to study medicine in the Wroclaw University.</span> <span id="s987">But then again something happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">EM: That was in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">RH: 1945.</span> <span id="s990">Then in 1946, or perhaps in still ‘45 that I can’t be very exact, I think in 1946, there was a pogrom in Kielce.</span> <span id="s991">About 40-odd Jews were killed there.</span> <span id="s992">A number of Jews were wounded, and it was done only by the Polish population.</span> <span id="s993">And my mother said, “There is nothing, we have nothing to look for here.</span> <span id="s994">We have to leave Poland immediately.</span> <span id="s995">It doesn’t matter where.”</span> <span id="s996">We were making efforts prior to that, also, to go either to America and to Australia.</span> <span id="s997">The Australian papers arrived first.</span> <span id="s998">We were very, very lucky to get our passports then.</span> <span id="s999">And we got the visa to go to Australia.</span> <span id="s1000">In the meantime, because I wanted my future wife and her father--who survived Mauthausen--also to come with us, I could go to Australia and bring her as a wife.</span> <span id="s1001">She was already in Austria because she wanted to see her father who survived the camp, Mauthausen camp, and was in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1002">So I went to Austria.</span> <span id="s1003">I married my wife, and I had the legal documents to bring her to Australia.</span> <span id="s1004">In the meantime I had to go back to Poland illegally, because my French visas, it was no longer valid.</span> <span id="s1005">I had to get another one in Poland.</span> <span id="s1006">And then I left Poland with my parents to, for Paris, where we waited seven-and-a-half months for a ship to go to Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">EM: That was in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">RH: That was in 1947.</span> <span id="s1009">Again, about March, 1947.</span> <span id="s1010">And at that time already the relatives from Australia paid for our trip through HIAS, and through our, and we were supposed to be taken care by HIAS in Paris.</span> <span id="s1011">But our first experience after arrival in Paris was quite unpleasant.</span> <span id="s1012">A certain Romanian Jew working for HIAS, a Mr. Kataziner, when we arrived there with my father to report that we have arrived, his words in Ger--in Yiddish were, “Wer hat ach geschickt?</span> <span id="s1013">Who sent for you?”</span> <span id="s1014">That was the greeting we received from them.</span> <span id="s1015">Anyway, they placed us in a hotel at the cost of HIAS.</span> <span id="s1016">We received food coupons, where we could go and eat in the common kitchen in Paris.</span> <span id="s1017">And we were waiting for the ship.</span> <span id="s1018">There were, at that time, there was no [unclear] communication.</span> <span id="s1019">There was very poor shipping.</span> <span id="s1020">No ships were available.</span> <span id="s1021">So we missed the first ship and we got the second ship, which was, the name of the ship was Tiger Water [possibly Tidal Water].</span> <span id="s1022">And in that ship we arrived through Marseilles to Sydney in November, 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">EM: And your wife Rita was still in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">RH: My wife Rita was still in Austria.</span> <span id="s1025">Immediately after arrival in Sydney I started to take steps to bring her in.</span> <span id="s1026">I was very successful, because at that time the waiting period was very, very long, but I had some friends and connections, and with the help of the, of a man, a Mr. Kraus, who was a, in the local central synagogue, he helped me to organize the papers.</span> <span id="s1027">And within two weeks I had the papers for my wife and her father.</span> <span id="s1028">Then I had to organize the loan to bring them in.</span> <span id="s1029">It was a long story.</span> <span id="s1030">Anyway, it took them about a year-and-a-half, and they arrived in Australia in January, 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">EM: Now, briefly, a little bit about your life in Australia.</span> <span id="s1032">What did you do, and what did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">RH: My ri--our beginnings in Australia were extremely, extremely hard.</span> <span id="s1034">Prior to coming to Australia our family, or my mother’s family, a distant family, wrote to us when we sent the papers, that they are very rich and they own a lot of properties and they own a lot of businesses, and we should come as soon as possible, that my father as a doctor will be able to practice, and I will be able to study medicine, and all we have to do is come.</span> <span id="s1035">When we came, the whole story somehow disappeared into thin air.</span> <span id="s1036">There was no room for us to live, my father couldn’t practice, I couldn’t study, we didn’t know the language, and we were completely hopeless.</span> <span id="s1037">Later on, we were, I was living with my, with those relatives.</span> <span id="s1038">My parents got a room in another place.</span> <span id="s1039">They were living there, and we were desperate, because we didn’t know the language.</span> <span id="s1040">We didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s1041">My relative asked me how much money I have, and I said, “Are you joking?</span> <span id="s1042">I have no money.</span> <span id="s1043">We are after the war.”</span> <span id="s1044">So he said, “If you have no money, you are nothing.”</span> <span id="s1045">So that was the comment.</span> <span id="s1046">And, the only thing I told him I knew was how to drive a car, because I went through a driving school in Poland prior to leaving, that I am a medical student, and that I know a little bit of photography, which I used to do in the bathroom at home.</span> <span id="s1047">So, he placed me, he found me a job at the photographer’s place.</span> <span id="s1048">And after two weeks he asked me how much do I get.</span> <span id="s1049">And I said, “Well, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s1050">I am not there yet a month.”</span> <span id="s1051">The payments in Poland were monthly.</span> <span id="s1052">So he said, “No, here are weekly.”</span> <span id="s1053">So I said, “I didn’t get a penny.”</span> <span id="s1054">So he went to this guy, and this guy said, “Well, if he wants money I won’t have him.”</span> <span id="s1055">So that was, that was my initiation.</span> <span id="s1056">The wife of my relative, who was also my distant relative, gave me good advice.</span> <span id="s1057">She said, “If anybody wants to work in Australia, he can break stones and work on the roads.”</span> <span id="s1058">So I said, “Well, that was not exactly my idea of coming to Australia.”</span> <span id="s1059">And so, our beginnings were very, very bad.</span> <span id="s1060">I found a job later on, but the job was paying six pounds, two and six, out of, and after the national tax, it was about five-and-a-half pounds, which was not sufficient for us to live, and to pay rent.</span> <span id="s1061">By that time we had a flat for each, the family lent us the money, so-called “key” money, and because at that time there was no accommodation whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1062">And, [tape off then on] at that time I asked my relatives perhaps to help us, because we literally we didn’t know where to turn and what to do.</span> <span id="s1063">And I asked my, well, I called him uncle, he was my cou--my mother’s distant cousin, to either find me better job, where I can earn a bit more money so that we can survive.</span> <span id="s1064">And his wife was against it, so he refused.</span> <span id="s1065">And then I asked him, there was a business for sale in the center of the city.</span> <span id="s1066">I already by then knew enough photography to be able to do something.</span> <span id="s1067">He again asked his wife and his wife refused to, the loan, so again I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1068">And I was going through the city and I saw notices in pharmacy shops and photographic shops that they were doing seven days developing and printing of films.</span> <span id="s1069">And I thought that perhaps if I could give a 24-hour service I could get some work.</span> <span id="s1070">So, I printed cards and went with my broken English to pharmacies, and the first one was a lady, a Polish Jew, who gave me my first work, a dozen films.</span> <span id="s1071">And I remember doing that all night, because I didn’t know how to do it.</span> <span id="s1072">I didn’t know how to do it commercially.</span> <span id="s1073">And, but they had to be ready for next day.</span> <span id="s1074">Then I bought some books about developing and printing, and again, with the dictionary I was reading and finding out more about commercial part of it.</span> <span id="s1075">I didn’t have any equipment.</span> <span id="s1076">So, I had to have 150 pounds for the equipment, apart from the enlarger, which I brought from France.</span> <span id="s1077">And they, my relatives would not give me a guarantee or loan me any money.</span> <span id="s1078">The Jewish Welfare Society, which was there for their own good, because later on we found out that they were profiting from being the Welfare Society, wouldn’t lend me any money either, unless I had two guarantors.</span> <span id="s1079">So I found finally two guarantors.</span> <span id="s1080">They lent me the 150 pounds, and I started to do all the work in one of my parents’ rooms, which I converted into a dark room.</span> <span id="s1081">And I was doing the work during the day and developing films at night, and it was a vicious circle after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">EM: Was that when your wife was there already...</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">RH: No.</span> <span id="s1084">That was prior to my wife coming.</span> <span id="s1085">Later, when my wife came, the business was already developed, and then she helped me a lot in the business, by working with me.</span> <span id="s1086">And it was a hectic five years’ time, during which my father started to study medicine, because he had to qualify after having already two medical degrees, to work in Australia.</span> <span id="s1087">But the conditions were such that only four doctors per year, four foreign doctors, even if they pass the exams, would be admitted in the whole of Australia--which means, that perhaps in the year 2,000 my father could start practicing.</span> <span id="s1088">Despite that fact, he was still studying, and finished the studies, and in the meantime the law changed, and he was permitted to have a practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">EM: So you never went back to medical school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">RH: I went, after he finished his practice, I went back to medical school.</span> <span id="s1091">I sold my photographic business.</span> <span id="s1092">I went back to medical school.</span> <span id="s1093">But in the meantime, my father was sick in bed with the heart trouble for one year.</span> <span id="s1094">In the meantime also, my, we had the first baby.</span> <span id="s1095">And after a year of medical school in Sydney I had to stop and find work, because, to earn living.</span> <span id="s1096">Well, I think, we’ll finish here, and the other part of my life in Sydney, Australia, was very hard, and still because we had to struggle and we were lucky enough to bring our children--later on we had our second son--in a free country, a country full of food, sunshine, and freedom, and have the children educated and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">EM: Tell me, what’s your, what are your sons doing?</span> <span id="s1098">I know you have two sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">RH: Yes, well, the older son is a doctor.</span> <span id="s1100">He is a specialist--endocrinologist.</span> <span id="s1101">He has a few degrees.</span> <span id="s1102">He started first to study mathematics, and he has a degree of mathe--higher mathematics.</span> <span id="s1103">Then he did the diploma of Education.</span> <span id="s1104">Then he has a diploma of Medicine and Surgery.</span> <span id="s1105">And later on he specialized as an endocrinologist.</span> <span id="s1106">He is a specialist and consultant in two hospitals, as well as having his own private practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">EM: And your other son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">RH: My other son, Martin, is, also has two degrees, and, the first degree is in Computer Science.</span> <span id="s1109">The second degree is the Master’s Degree of Economics.</span> <span id="s1110">And he is presently working and being a partner in a computer company, where they design software for big companies.</span> <span id="s1111">He is also an economic consultant to big companies in Sydney, and he is very highly regarded by all the people he works for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">EM: O.K. Now, just very briefly, the, you don’t have any grandchildren yet, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">RH: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">EM: And whom did they marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">RH: My older son married a New Zealand girl, who was a sister here.</span> <span id="s1116">Later on she did, a hospital sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">EM: A nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">RH: Nur--yeah, a sister.</span> <span id="s1119">Yes, a hospital sister.</span> <span id="s1120">It’s a higher degree from a nurse, you know, sort of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">EM: All right, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">RH: Yes, and then she did a degree in occupational science and health therapy.</span> <span id="s1123">She is working, she is helping my son in his surgery by being the manager of the surgery, because he is very busy.</span> <span id="s1124">He has two girls, typists in the surgery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">EM: She is not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">RH: She is not Jewish, and she’s a Christian, a Presbyterian, from New Zealand.</span> <span id="s1127">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">EM: Your other son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">RH: My other son...</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">EM: Married...</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">RH: Married a Japanese girl who came here, who came to Sydney on a contract because he was a, she was a musical teacher in a Japanese school.</span> <span id="s1132">They met through our distant cousin, also half Japanese and half Jewish.</span> <span id="s1133">And later on they married.</span> <span id="s1134">They went together to Solomon Islands for a two-year’s contract, and they came back to Sydney.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">EM: So both your children, do they feel Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">RH: Both feel Jewish.</span> <span id="s1137">And, the Japanese wife does not know any religion.</span> <span id="s1138">She is a Buddhist, I mean her parents are perhaps, but she is not religious at all.</span> <span id="s1139">She is very curious about Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s1140">She comes to seders and so on.</span> <span id="s1141">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">EM: So, do you continue with your Jewish religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">RH: I continue being, I’m, I am not very religious myself, but I am a national Jew.</span> <span id="s1144">I have very strong national Jewish feeling.</span> <span id="s1145">And, of course, 100% behind Israel in whatever Israel does.</span> <span id="s1146">My other daughter-in-law is a Christian, and, but again, neither of them observe any religion at home, and only when they come to our place, either my son explains some points of the Jewish religion to her, or she is being very curious and asks us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">EM: O.K. That’s, I think that’s it for today.</span> <span id="s1148">Is there anything that you want to add, as far as your experiences go, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">RH: It’s very difficult to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">EM: Any comment that you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">RH: To comprise all the feelings and what I went through, right through the occupation or to, through the Russian period, or before, prior to that, through the Polish period.</span> <span id="s1152">For that, I would need quite a few hours to describe it in detail.</span> <span id="s1153">I gave you only the overall situation, and the dates, as far as I could remember.</span> <span id="s1154">But, but, the precise information I would need quite, quite a few hours to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">EM: So, right now, you, could you tell me in general, you had some help from non-Jews, and some denunciation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">RH: That's correct, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">EM: Do you have any feeling about the Ukrainians as opposed to the Poles, as far as their attitude was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">RH: Right.</span> <span id="s1159">Well, I may say perhaps that this is an individual story.</span> <span id="s1160">We had help both from Ukrainians and Poles.</span> <span id="s1161">As I said before, the Ukrainian hid us under the floor--for money, but he was risking his life.</span> <span id="s1162">And a few Poles also helped us, like Mr. Jankowski, about whom you know, and so it’s difficult to distinguish.</span> <span id="s1163">But overall, the Ukrainians behaved better than the Poles during the war.</span> <span id="s1164">The Poles were doing everything behind our backs, and they were strongly antisemitic.</span> <span id="s1165">They were perfidious in their behavior.</span> <span id="s1166">And generally, I would consider Poles much worse even than the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">EM: And you, you, so your impression is that the Ukrainians, besides the ones that were in the police, were…</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">RH: No, a lot of them were against the Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">EM: Yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">RH: I mean, there were a lot of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">EM: But there were some that were better...</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">RH: But, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">EM: Than the Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">RH: Ukrainians generally were much better behaving much better toward Jews than the Poles.</span> <span id="s1175">They may have been brutal, and when beating the Jews they were, a lot of them were helping the Germans and the Ukrainians to kill the Jews, but generally they behaved much better than the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">EM: O.K., all right, now, you still live in Sydney, and your address is...</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">RH: My, I live in Sydney, in a suburb named Botany, B-O-T-A-N-Y.</span> <span id="s1178">The post code is 2019 in Australia, and this is one of the suburbs in Sydney.</span> <span id="s1179">And my telephone number there is [omitted].</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">EM: Well, is there anything else that you would like to add to this interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">RH: Yes, it’s impossible to describe all the trauma and fright and screams and killings that we went through--before the actions, during the actions, and throughout the German occupation.</span> <span id="s1182">It is also impossible for me to tell it all in just one session.</span> <span id="s1183">It would take perhaps weeks or months to tell you in detail.</span> <span id="s1184">Unfortunately, I remember only too well every little bit of detail of the story.</span> <span id="s1185">[tape off then on] I would like now to give you perhaps a short history of families on both on my mother’s and father’s side.</span> <span id="s1186">My older uncle, my mother’s brother, Maurycy, died in Mauthausen two weeks before liberation.</span> <span id="s1187">My, the younger brother, my mother’s, my uncle, my mother’s brother, died of hunger in a hospital in Lwow, about 115 km north of Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s1188">On my father’s side, the whole family was wiped out.</span> <span id="s1189">My father had two brothers, with wife, with wives and children.</span> <span id="s1190">And his parents [tape off then on].</span> <span id="s1191">Well, this happened in the city of Brody where my father was born, and traces of, or members of the family are now one in Israel, and members, other members in the United States.</span> <span id="s1192">Luckily, some of them survived, because they left Poland before the war.</span> <span id="s1193">The relative who is in Israel was in the Russian army and survived the war there.</span> <span id="s1194">He is in Israel now.</span> <span id="s1195">He is over 70 years old, and I don’t know if he’s still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">EM: He was a first cousin of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">RH: He was a first cousin of my father’s, not mine, but my father’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">EM: Your father’s.</span> <span id="s1199">Do you have any first cousins that survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">RH: No, only second cousins.</span> <span id="s1201">They are all in United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">EM: Is there anything else that you would like to add to this testimony?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">RH: No, this is the whole story, perhaps not, some of the, some of the, eh, items I have omitted or forgotten to add, because, when I give testimony like that, I get very nervous and very upset, and then, of course, I forget some of the small bits and pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">EM: Well, thank you very much for your willingness to be interviewed.</span> <span id="s1205">I want to assure you that this interview is, as all our interviews, are going to be put to good use.</span> <span id="s1206">And we thank you again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">RH: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">RAOUL HARMELIN [1-1-] From the collection
