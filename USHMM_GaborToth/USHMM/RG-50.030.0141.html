war?</span> <span id="s15">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My father had his own business.</span> <span id="s17">We used to be in the lumber business.</span> <span id="s18">There were four brothers that were partners and my grandfather.</span> <span id="s19">My mother was a housewife, take care of the children and also to cook.</span> <span id="s20">I had three more brothers beside me.</span> <span id="s21">One was Menda (ph), Hiram (ph), Slima (ph).</span> <span id="s22">All boys, no girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Were you the youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Yes, I was the baby.</span> <span id="s25">My mother always wanted to have a girl.</span> <span id="s26">My father told me, but it didn't work out.</span> <span id="s27">What happened after the occupation in Germany, when the Germans came in the Ghetto, my mother became pregnant, and it was a girl but it aborted.</span> <span id="s28">She didn't want to have no children.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: So, you were fairly wealthy?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes, well off considering.</span> <span id="s31">We had everything we needed.</span> <span id="s32">Life was good.</span> <span id="s33">The Jews and the Gentiles got along excellent, and we had workers by us and used to come to our house.</span> <span id="s34">They loved our family, and my grandfather, rest in peace, he was my idol.</span> <span id="s35">I worshipped that man.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Tell us about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: He lived with us.</span> <span id="s38">He didn't want to stay with anybody -- he had twelve children, and the only one he wanted to stay with was my mother.</span> <span id="s39">He loved my mother.</span> <span id="s40">I used to worship him.</span> <span id="s41">When he passed away he was 100 years old, and if you saw the man you thought he looked 60.</span> <span id="s42">He used to like to make .</span> <span id="s43">He used to drink with his workers, and he used to call them , that's a nick name.</span> <span id="s44">In Lithuanian means you're a real nice person.</span> <span id="s45">That was his nickname.</span> <span id="s46">He was a fantastic human being.</span> <span id="s47">I used to go to the synagogue with him on Friday.</span> <span id="s48">We weren't religious, but we're observant, but not very religious.</span> <span id="s49">Life was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Did you do other things with your grandfather other than go to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: I used to go walking in the park with him.</span> <span id="s52">I didn't drink with him.</span> <span id="s53">That's one thing I didn't do.</span> <span id="s54">Wherever he went, I was like a little dog that followed him.</span> <span id="s55">Wherever he went, until before the war when he passed away.</span> <span id="s56">Once, he was going to visit his children in America.</span> <span id="s57">He had three sons and two daughters in America, and I wanted to go with him.</span> <span id="s58">He said I can't take you alone.</span> <span id="s59">I got so mad with him that I didn't want to talk to him.</span> <span id="s60">But when he came back, I still loved him.</span> <span id="s61">Even to this day, the most thing I remember is my grandfather more than my mother and father.</span> <span id="s62">I have so many beautiful boyhood memories of him.</span> <span id="s63">I think he pulled me through the war.</span> <span id="s64">Whatever happened he just -- I think he watched over me.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: When did he die?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: He died in 1939, just before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s67">I think he's still watching over me.</span> <span id="s68">Q: Were you close with your brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s70">The whole family was close, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s71">We used to go all over together.</span> <span id="s72">We used to go in the summer time, we used to go to the beach and we used to go on picnics.</span> <span id="s73">We had a nice summer home about seven kilometers away from Kovno.</span> <span id="s74">It was beautiful, a real beautiful life.</span> <span id="s75">Everything was so peaceful and quiet.</span> <span id="s76">There was no hatred between the Gentiles and the Jews, not that I noticed.</span> <span id="s77">I used to have Gentile friends.</span> <span id="s78">My brothers used to have Gentile friends.</span> <span id="s79">We used to play together.</span> <span id="s80">We used to ice skate together.</span> <span id="s81">We used to go swimming together, fishing, whatever.</span> <span id="s82">Life was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: You went to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s85">I went to for about two years so when I start with the Jewish school I didn't learn much.</span> <span id="s86">I tell you forget everything after the years I went I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Did you hear about the Nazis?</span> <span id="s88">You were born in 1930, so you were a baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: There were no wars going on, but nobody realized -- you had no Hitler.</span> <span id="s90">I used to listen to him on the radio, you know, when he used to make the speeches and everything, and I thought that man was a phenomenal speaker.</span> <span id="s91">The way he used to speak was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s92">He would electrify you.</span> <span id="s93">Nobody knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Do you remember the first time you heard him on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yes, in 1936, I remember we were listening to the radio.</span> <span id="s96">We had a short wave radio, and we'd listen to his speeches and I thought he was phenomenal.</span> <span id="s97">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s98">He electrified you.</span> <span id="s99">Those days, they didn't know how bad it was.</span> <span id="s100">Then later on you found out differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What happened in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: In 1939 we heard that the war broke out in Poland and the Germans went into Poland and the Russians came into Lithuania took over the Baltic states.</span> <span id="s103">We were so happy the Russians came in because the Russian soldiers used to be stationed in the woods where we had our summer home there and we used to go there.</span> <span id="s104">We used to go over there and they used to give us they to a child was a big thing.</span> <span id="s105">We used to mingle with them in the woods.</span> <span id="s106">It was a beautiful life.</span> <span id="s107">The only thing they started taking the richer people who had money.</span> <span id="s108">The wealthy people used to send them away, confiscate everything and send them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s109">My father, thank God, they didn't bother him, the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Why do you think that was so?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: I think -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s112">I don't know what happened, but they took everything away from us.</span> <span id="s113">The only thing they left was each one got one horse, in those days a horse and wagon to make a living.</span> <span id="s114">That was it.</span> <span id="s115">No more workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: There was no more lumber business?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Yes, still working in the lumber, but they only gave us like we were the haulers from the forest to the mills to cut the lumber, and they just took everything away.</span> <span id="s118">The only thing they gave each brother got one horse and one wagon, and you had to work yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: So, when the Russians took over you were not frightened and your life didn't change radically?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: No, no, just the luxury that we had changed a little bit, but life in general didn't change at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Now, between 1939 and 1941 when the war started in Russia, did you hear what the Nazis were doing in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No, we didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s123">We heard that they were in Germany, treating the Jews -- they were treating them a little rough, but nobody knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s124">I remember it was Sunday, I knew the exact day, I remember it was Sunday, and they gave an order the Russians gave it's hard to understand anyway -- he came from Moscow to dismantle the planes, to clean the planes, to put in all the equipment there and the Sabbath was Saturday, and Sunday that's when the Germans attacked -- bombarded the airports, and we know that the war broke out.</span> <span id="s125">My father took us all together, went in the horse and wagon, with all his brothers and sisters, the whole family we started towards the Russian border.</span> <span id="s126">We traveled all day Sunday.</span> <span id="s127">Meanwhile, while we were traveling on the road, the German planes were diving and bombing the civilians and the soldiers.</span> <span id="s128">They didn't discriminate who they bombing.</span> <span id="s129">You see people -- as soon as you saw the planes coming, you jumped off the wagon went in the woods in the ditches.</span> <span id="s130">They came by and when you got up the person right next to me, shot dead.</span> <span id="s131">Some people were just blown apart from the bombs.</span> <span id="s132">After the planes left we got back on wagon and we kept on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Did you cry?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: No, I never cried.</span> <span id="s135">And we came to a small town for the night to rest.</span> <span id="s136">We figure tomorrow morning, we'll continue.</span> <span id="s137">Meanwhile, we lost -- my father lost his brothers.</span> <span id="s138">We got separated when the planes were attacking, and we stopped in this little town.</span> <span id="s139">We slept over one of the synagogues there.</span> <span id="s140">When we got up the next morning, the Germans were passed us already.</span> <span id="s141">So, they said all the Jews have to stay here.</span> <span id="s142">They put guards in front of the synagogues.</span> <span id="s143">Nobody could walk out from synagogues.</span> <span id="s144">Even if you had to go to the bathroom, you know because those days there was no bathroom inside so most of them were outside so we had to make in pots and they wanted to get rid of it, and they just took whatever you made and just threw it right back into the synagogue.</span> <span id="s145">We were there for a couple of days, and then they said everybody has to go back where they came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: It wasn't pleasant because food we had in the wagon what we took, but we couldn't get out of the synagogue and you made human waste and everything was inside.</span> <span id="s148">We smelled terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Were people frightened?</span> <span id="s150">You weren't alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: I was with my parents, I didn't have no fear.</span> <span id="s152">Some people were afraid.</span> <span id="s153">Maybe I didn't understand that much.</span> <span id="s154">When you're younger you don't understand as much as when you're older, I guess.</span> <span id="s155">I understand now differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Did you notice other people being afraid or screaming or crying or were people getting together?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Some people were getting beat up.</span> <span id="s158">First of all, it wasn't from the Germans, a lot of Lithuanians, the Gentiles started.</span> <span id="s159">They were doing the beating up.</span> <span id="s160">They were taking away the things that you owned, and we knew something wasn't good already because the way they were treating us.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Did that surprise you because you said you got along very well with your neighbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Sure we were surprised.</span> <span id="s163">You figured you didn't see the racism when the Germans weren't there.</span> <span id="s164">But as soon as the Germans came they changed completely.</span> <span id="s165">I wouldn't say all of them.</span> <span id="s166">I would say 95 percent changed.</span> <span id="s167">Some of them were beautiful.</span> <span id="s168">I mean, some were very nice.</span> <span id="s169">Even in the Ghetto they used to come over the fences and bring you food and everything.</span> <span id="s170">So, I cannot use everybody, but most of them changed.</span> <span id="s171">Q: So, you were in the synagogue for two days.</span> <span id="s172">then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Then they told us we go back to where we came from.</span> <span id="s174">So, we packed up and they gave us a horse and wagon back and we were going back to Kovno.</span> <span id="s175">The way we were going to go one way on this road and the Germans stopped us and he said don't go this way, he says.</span> <span id="s176">Go where the troops are going and nobody is going to bother you.</span> <span id="s177">If you go this way, they're killing all the Jews and taking away everything you've got.</span> <span id="s178">So, my father listened, and we went to the German back to Kovno and we got there.</span> <span id="s179">We went back to our apartment.</span> <span id="s180">The apartment was broken in.</span> <span id="s181">Whatever was left was taken away, but we stayed there and then they told us that all Jews have to put up the Star of David.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">We couldn't walk on the sidewalk, we had to walk on the gutter.</span> <span id="s183">Then we heard that anybody went away where we wanted to go, everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s184">So, the German that told us that we should go with the saved our lives right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: This was one soldier, an isolated soldier?</span> <span id="s186">He wasn't with anybody else?</span> <span id="s187">A: One soldier, no.</span> <span id="s188">Just one soldier.</span> <span id="s189">He was standing in the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Did he also threaten you if you went one way he'd shoot you, and if you --?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No, no, he didn't threaten us at all.</span> <span id="s192">He just said if you want to live you go this way.</span> <span id="s193">A human being.</span> <span id="s194">Then when we get in Kovno, a couple of weeks -- I don't know exactly, I don't remember and they said all Jews have to go to Slobotka.</span> <span id="s195">That's where they made the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Go back a little bit to when you had to put the Jewish star on for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Well, everybody had to wear the Jewish star, and the order was that no Jew was allowed to walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s198">All Jews had to walk in the gutter.</span> <span id="s199">If you're caught walking on the sidewalk, they gave you a beating that you never walked no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Did you ever get beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Not in Kovno.</span> <span id="s202">I got beaten when I was in Birkenau, but not in Kovno.</span> <span id="s203">Q: Were you angry when you had to put on the Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Angry?</span> <span id="s205">I didn't understand that much.</span> <span id="s206">You didn't have any choice.</span> <span id="s207">You just took it the way it was and that's it.</span> <span id="s208">If you want to survive, you did what you had to to survive, but those days it wasn't so serious.</span> <span id="s209">Nobody understood but it was.</span> <span id="s210">The killing and everything -- I had a cousin he was always getting beat up.</span> <span id="s211">This guy must have gotten beat up 20 times.</span> <span id="s212">Every time he looked at a German, he got a beating.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Before the Ghetto was formed, you were in Kovno for a couple of weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Yes, something like that.</span> <span id="s215">I don't know exactly, but a couple weeks until we went into Slobotka.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Were you able to get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Well, we had the maid, and also one of the workers who used to work for us, used to bring us some food and one of the maids that used to take care of us, her name was Naja.</span> <span id="s218">She used to bring us some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: She was Gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s221">Also, one of the workers.</span> <span id="s222">I remember he was a tall, big husky man, also used to love to drink.</span> <span id="s223">He loved our family, and he used to bring us food.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Did you see people being killed during this period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: You saw a lot of people getting shot, but most of the shooting wasn't done by the Germans.</span> <span id="s226">Most of the shooting, the killing was done by the Gentiles, by the Lithuanians themselves, because they could confiscate everything you owned took away your property, took away your apartments, whatever you owned.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: And you saw that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s229">Especially in the Ghetto, I saw a lot of it.</span> <span id="s230">one of the Germans and this was my cousin's friend, he said something to him, one of the Germans.</span> <span id="s231">He took the back of the rifle and he hit him right in the face and splattered his whole face.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: How were you notified about going from Kovno to Slobotka to the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: The proclamation came out and they said all Jews have to report go to Slobotka.</span> <span id="s234">That's where you're going to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Was this outside?</span> <span id="s236">Was there a proclamation written outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: It was written outside and then they were going around with their loudspeakers and saying that.</span> <span id="s238">Also, the rumor was going around, but I don't remember that much of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Do you remember the day you moved into the Ghetto?</span> <span id="s240">A: No, after that I was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: So, what's your first memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Well, my father had two brothers there, in Slobotka, and also my mother had two brothers living there.</span> <span id="s243">We stayed with my mother's brothers.</span> <span id="s244">I remember good times, because you know you didn't realize because we had the freedom to run around.</span> <span id="s245">Nobody bothered you.</span> <span id="s246">You couldn't get out of the Ghetto, but nobody bothered you.</span> <span id="s247">You could walk on the sidewalks again.</span> <span id="s248">I remember my cousin had a bike and I was in Israel the last time and we were talking about it.</span> <span id="s249">He used to take his bike and ride around because the things we had we all confiscated.</span> <span id="s250">And life wasn't bad for me, but maybe because I was young.</span> <span id="s251">The older people were suffering, but when you are a child, especially a youngster, you get everything you want whatever was possible.</span> <span id="s252">Food we never had a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: In the Ghetto you had not problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: No, my father used to work for the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s255">He used to bring the food in to the Ghettos from the outside.</span> <span id="s256">The Ghetto always had food, even most of the people had food, used to do baking, always got flour.</span> <span id="s257">We used to bake, you know, bake the break, used to dry it out and make like a toast so it doesn't spoil so fast so that if you couldn't get no flour you had extra bread.</span> <span id="s258">I don't remember being hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Did your brothers work as well as your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yes, my brothers worked also where the food -- the side by the gate where I told you that's where the stables were.</span> <span id="s261">The only one that didn't work was me.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: What about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: My mother didn't work, no.</span> <span id="s264">Most of the men worked.</span> <span id="s265">The women didn't work.</span> <span id="s266">And then little by little, you know, the first, -- I don't know how long it was, maybe one, two months after, the first action that they told everybody to report to this parade ground around there, and the Germans took certain people on one side and some other people go on the other side.</span> <span id="s267">I remember they told us to go on the left side, and we didn't know which was good, whether the left way was good or the right side was good.</span> <span id="s268">What happened, my father was working and when he came back into the Ghetto, he couldn't locate us, so he found out it was the action.</span> <span id="s269">So he went to the commandant of the Ghetto and he told him that he can't find his family, and the commandant from the Ghetto came and they found us and we were on the wrong side of the action, because people that were on the side that we were on, they went to the Ninth Fort, and everybody got shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Whoever went, nobody came back.</span> <span id="s271">My uncle, my father's youngest brother with his wife and two children was in that action.</span> <span id="s272">They died, also one of his sisters with her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Did your father try to get them out too?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: He couldn't find them.</span> <span id="s275">There was so many, maybe 20,000 people were going inside.</span> <span id="s276">He was happy, must finding us.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: This was a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Yes, the German commandant.</span> <span id="s279">He came and he got us out.</span> <span id="s280">Because nobody knew which was good and which was bad until they started to transport you out.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Did you know after that that they were shooting at Ninth Fort?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Oh, yes we knew it.</span> <span id="s283">People were coming back, like the Gentiles, they said a lot of them were alive when they were shot.</span> <span id="s284">They were still alive and when they put the dirt over the graves, the ground was moving.</span> <span id="s285">After that we knew they were killing.</span> <span id="s286">They had Ninth Fort and they had another one, I think it was the Fifth Fort, but mostly killing was going on at the Ninth Fort.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: So what did you start thinking then?</span> <span id="s288">Did you then get afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: I was never afraid.</span> <span id="s290">I was never afraid.</span> <span id="s291">I never had no fear.</span> <span id="s292">No matter what happened.</span> <span id="s293">I remember one time they were taking all the children away from the parents and my father where the stables were, with the horses, we used to have a cellar there, so he took me and my cousin and the two children and my cousin and another kid and he put us in that cellar and he put wheat over the door, over the trap of the cellar so he figured the Germans weren't going to find us.</span> <span id="s294">What happened to my cousin, she had asthma and from the wheat, it started to affect her.</span> <span id="s295">She couldn't breath.</span> <span id="s296">So, what happened, she lifted up the cover, and the wheat was starting to fall inside, and then she was trying to close it up, and the wheat must have gotten stuck on the hole there and when the Germans came into the stable to see if anybody was hiding there in the straw, the wheat seeping into the hole.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">They opened it up and they found us.</span> <span id="s298">We had to get out from the cellar and like somebody told me Sol, , it means run away.</span> <span id="s299">I started to run and I jumped into one with the horses, one of the bins there where they put the horse feed and I went in that bin and I covered myself with straw.</span> <span id="s300">I figured nobody's going to see me.</span> <span id="s301">So, when the Germans were going and poking into the bins to see if anybody's hiding there, and my brother , he got killed in 1963, he said , that means Sol, they're going through the bins and poking, and run away.</span> <span id="s302">I jumped out from that bin and there was a back door.</span> <span id="s303">I ran out from the back door.</span> <span id="s304">There was a fence there maybe eight nine feet tall.</span> <span id="s305">I was a little thing.</span> <span id="s306">I don't know how I got over it.</span> <span id="s307">I jumped over that fence.</span> <span id="s308">There was an outhouse in the yard.</span> <span id="s309">I opened up the door and I jumped right into the whole in the outhouse.</span> <span id="s310">I stayed there overnight.</span> <span id="s311">The Germans came in to look but they couldn't see me because I was covered with human manure.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: How deep were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: I don't know, it must have been at least three feet deep, and I was covered up to my neck.</span> <span id="s314">After the next day I came back.</span> <span id="s315">After I feel it was safe I came out and my mother and my father and my brothers thought I was dead already.</span> <span id="s316">I came back smelling beautiful.</span> <span id="s317">It took me days to purify me.</span> <span id="s318">They were happy to have me, even though I smelled.</span> <span id="s319">They were happy to have me.</span> <span id="s320">That went on and a couple of weeks later, my cousin and the two children, they all got killed.</span> <span id="s321">At the time they found us in the hole.</span> <span id="s322">Everybody that was hiding there was taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Who told you to run?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: My brother .</span> <span id="s325">Then another time, in another children's action, and they took me away and they put us in a stall to take us away to be killed and my brother was delivering water there and he came in where they had those big wagons for water, it's like a tanker made out of wood.</span> <span id="s326">He got me out and put me in the tanker, in the water, and he took me out from the barracks and took me back home.</span> <span id="s327">He saved my life.</span> <span id="s328">First my brother saved my life, and then my brother saved my life.</span> <span id="s329">There were always actions there and they were always taking away children.</span> <span id="s330">One time I remember they were looking for children, my mother, may she rest in peace, she hid me in the house, they had the big quilts made out of feathers and that's where she hid me.</span> <span id="s331">When the Germans passed by, they didn't find me.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Were you under the quilts?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Under the quilts.</span> <span id="s334">Little by little most of the children were gone from the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s335">We used to have a big river there called the .</span> <span id="s336">That was the only thing that wasn't guarded.</span> <span id="s337">You couldn't escape from there because the guard was so treacherous there that you couldn't go through there.</span> <span id="s338">Also, my cousin, he used to work with the underground.</span> <span id="s339">He used to smuggle arms into the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s340">He used to help people escape from the Ghettos and the Jewish police, because they were called the kopos and they found out about it, and one day they got him in the house and the Jew kopos killed him.</span> <span id="s341">They killed my cousin.</span> <span id="s342">They didn't want any trouble in the Ghetto, because if they find out that you're doing things like that in the Ghetto, they punished and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Did you know that he was helping the underground resistance?</span> <span id="s344">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: What did you think about that?</span> <span id="s346">Did you think it was a good idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: I told him it was a good idea.</span> <span id="s348">It was an excellent idea, anybody that worked in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Did you want to?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: I was a little too young at that age, but I tell you those days you went alone, but now they would never take me alive, nobody.</span> <span id="s351">I would fight.</span> <span id="s352">I knew people that went just like sheep, most of us.</span> <span id="s353">I guess we were taught that way.</span> <span id="s354">If somebody hates you, turn the other cheek.</span> <span id="s355">In the Jewish religion that's what we're told.</span> <span id="s356">We were told respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Sol, you kept running away?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: That's to save my life, but I didn't know how to fight.</span> <span id="s359">We weren't fighters.</span> <span id="s360">I only had one fight in my life and that's a long time before.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Were your brothers in the resistance, in the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: No, the only one that was in the underground was my cousin, my father's sister's son.</span> <span id="s363">He was the only one.</span> <span id="s364">There wasn't that many.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: What do you remember about the Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: The ones were nice.</span> <span id="s367">Everybody gets a little power, and everybody wants to save his own life so what they do to somebody else as long as they could save their life.</span> <span id="s368">They had a little more power than everybody else and they thought that the Nazis would never do nothing to them because they are kopos.</span> <span id="s369">So, the people that they -- like the underground - - they used to take jewelry from the people and give it to the Germans just to save their own neck.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Do you remember seeing things that the Jewish police did?</span> <span id="s371">A: The only thing I remember is my cousin being killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: I didn't see him being killed, but my sister told me.</span> <span id="s374">They came into the house and just shot him.</span> <span id="s375">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: In your normal every day life did you ever see the police, did they ever shove the people or did you hear them say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Even the actions, the Jewish police were involved in that.</span> <span id="s378">They used to walk with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s379">If they knew somebody from their family, they saved them.</span> <span id="s380">That's human nature, and they had that power and that's what happened.</span> <span id="s381">Most of the actions the Jewish police were involved with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: What about the Jewish council.</span> <span id="s383">Did you ever hear about Elkous?</span> <span id="s384">A: I heard his name, but I didn't know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Anybody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: I told you, names I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Did you play with other children?</span> <span id="s388">I mean, as they kept taking children away there were fewer and fewer children?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Sure we played.</span> <span id="s390">As they took away it got smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s391">Ovariotomy there were separations, by the time they liquidated the Ghetto it was tiny, maybe six thousand Jews were left.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Were there particular games you remember playing?</span> <span id="s393">I know you went on bicycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: The children used to play football and soccer.</span> <span id="s395">That's most of the games we played.</span> <span id="s396">We used to go through the water in the summer time.</span> <span id="s397">We still could walk through the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: You went swimming?</span> <span id="s399">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Was there any kind of schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: No schooling.</span> <span id="s402">I know I didn't go to school at all.</span> <span id="s403">Q: Did you have books in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: We had some books.</span> <span id="s405">My uncle, should he rest in peace, he smuggled in some books, they used them on the outside that's because the whole family was involved in buying food in the Ghettos, so he smuggled in some books.</span> <span id="s406">So, I found a picture it was in Israel and I found a picture of my uncle smuggling in the books and he was distributing books to some kids and they didn't know who it was and me and my brother identified him.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Did he give books to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yes, we had books, because my brothers were very educated, especially my brother .</span> <span id="s409">When the Russians came in, he used to teach them Lithuanian, and they used to teach him Russian.</span> <span id="s410">He was an intelligent young man.</span> <span id="s411">He had golden hands.</span> <span id="s412">There wasn't a thing that he couldn't do.</span> <span id="s413">He got killed in 1963 in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Did you ever notice starving people in the Ghetto?</span> <span id="s415">A: I saw people getting beaten up.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: By the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: By the Germans.</span> <span id="s418">If you didn't look at them the right way, they used to beat you.</span> <span id="s419">I saw one child being torn away from the mother and just thrown right against the wall.</span> <span id="s420">When you're young, those things don't affect you so much.</span> <span id="s421">The only time that bothered me was my cousin, he got beaten up.</span> <span id="s422">I mean his hands were , he was bloody.</span> <span id="s423">That's the only time I felt anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Did you get thinner?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Did I get thinner?</span> <span id="s426">I was never fat.</span> <span id="s427">I'm still not fat.</span> <span id="s428">I wasn't starving then.</span> <span id="s429">My weight wasn't bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Were you hearing any rumors why you were in the Ghetto, about what was happening in the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: We heard that people were being killed, but we didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s432">Nobody believed it that they are doing things like that in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Did you believe they were shooting at the Ninth Fort?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Oh, yes, that we knew, because people came back.</span> <span id="s435">I mean the Gentiles came back and they told us that they were shooting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: As the Ghetto got smaller and smaller, were your parents talking about trying to run away?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: You couldn't run away.</span> <span id="s438">It was so guarded that nobody could run away.</span> <span id="s439">Even if you ran away, the Gentiles would kill you.</span> <span id="s440">They wouldn't help you.</span> <span id="s441">There was no where to run.</span> <span id="s442">Maybe the individual could make it, but a family would never make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Your father was going in and out of the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s445">The thing is my father wouldn't leave the family and run away.</span> <span id="s446">He could have run away, but he wouldn't leave the family, because we had a very strong bond, and even after the war, they made if there was a wife, you go back to Kovno to see if you can find the wife and he went back.</span> <span id="s447">He didn't find my mother.</span> <span id="s448">We didn't know that my mother was dead.</span> <span id="s449">So, he found a couple of brothers and some nephews.</span> <span id="s450">But once you got back over there, you couldn't get out no more.</span> <span id="s451">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Do you remember what your apartment looked like in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: In the Ghetto?</span> <span id="s454">It was a small little apartment.</span> <span id="s455">We shared it with somebody.</span> <span id="s456">I don't remember the name.</span> <span id="s457">We had one room for all of us and there was another one and another one.</span> <span id="s458">Two families in two rooms.</span> <span id="s459">The kitchen we had outside.</span> <span id="s460">You had to go outside to cook.</span> <span id="s461">If you had wood you could cook.</span> <span id="s462">There wasn't much wood, if you didn't have any wood, you didn't cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: So, it was quite a different situation in Kovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: We had a beautiful house.</span> <span id="s465">We even had a toilet inside the house those days, which was a big thing.</span> <span id="s466">We had running water, hot and cold water in the house, and we had about seven rooms.</span> <span id="s467">I was on the top floor, because nobody wanted to live on the ground floor because we used to have floods.</span> <span id="s468">There was the and the , the two rivers.</span> <span id="s469">In the wintertime they used to freeze up and we used to go ice skating on them and what happened one day, when it came right before Passover, it started to melt, so the ice, the two rivers used to meet and the ice used to start backing up.</span> <span id="s470">So, all of a sudden you got up in the morning and you had maybe ten feet of water, so nobody wanted to live downstairs.</span> <span id="s471">Everybody used to live on the first floor, one flight up.</span> <span id="s472">One time we got up and we had water right up to the windows.</span> <span id="s473">Those things, still good memories from those things.</span> <span id="s474">When the water used to recede, we used to go out on the ice.</span> <span id="s475">There used to be piles of ice there and we used to jump from one piece of ice to another.</span> <span id="s476">I remember, and I start thinking it was crazy.</span> <span id="s477">The nerve I had for things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: You said if people didn't have wood they couldn't cook?</span> <span id="s479">A: Right, most everything was with wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Do you ever remember not being able to eat because of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Well, if we didn't have the hot food, we ate the cold, whatever we had.</span> <span id="s482">That's why we used to make the bread, we needed the wood to bake, so they used to dry it out so when it's dried out it doesn't spoil.</span> <span id="s483">So we always had a reserve until we picked up some wood something to cook.</span> <span id="s484">It used to be the actions, you know, and then the people were taken away, some people used to take their furniture and break it up and whatever they had left and do the cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Do you remember the names?</span> <span id="s486">A: Names, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Did you sleep okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s489">I made up my mind that I have to outlive Hitler.</span> <span id="s490">When the war broke out, I said I must survive.</span> <span id="s491">With all the things, that was my outlook.</span> <span id="s492">Even the concentration camps, as soon as I got my bread in the morning, I used to put it in my stomach and then nobody could take it away from me.</span> <span id="s493">Because somebody, if you had a piece of bread and other people were afraid to eat their bread.</span> <span id="s494">They wanted to save it for a little later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Somebody found out, they used to kill you for the piece of bread.</span> <span id="s496">Once I ate it, I knew nobody was going to take it away from me.</span> <span id="s497">As soon as I got it, it went into my stomach.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: What did you sleep on in the apartment?</span> <span id="s499">A: In the apartment, we had mattresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: On the floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: No, we had a bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Everybody had a bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Yes, I slept in my brothers.</span> <span id="s504">We had two beds.</span> <span id="s505">I slept with my brothers and my mother and father slept together.</span> <span id="s506">We had blankets, we had a because certain things they allowed you to take into the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: What did they allow you?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Like the blankets, the pillows.</span> <span id="s509">Furniture you couldn't take out there, but the Jewish people used to live in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s510">When they put you together, they put you together with other families.</span> <span id="s511">When we first went into the Ghetto, we stayed with my mother's brother.</span> <span id="s512">Also, my father had a brother right across the street, and their houses were all furnished.</span> <span id="s513">Our furniture was gone from when we came back from running away.</span> <span id="s514">Everything was gone.</span> <span id="s515">When you went into the Ghetto, whatever you got, they put you in with families.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Everybody got assigned to an apartment, that was it.</span> <span id="s517">Whenever you were there, that's what you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: But for you it was fairly orderly?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s520">The separations or the actions, that was an awful time, but when they stopped, you know, you went back to normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Do you remember the burning of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: No, I do not remember the burning of the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Is there anything else you'd like to tell us about the Ghetto?</span> <span id="s524">A: I can't think.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Any sights, any sounds, any smells?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Tell you certain things are blocked out from my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: I want to ask you a question.</span> <span id="s528">When you jumped into the outhouse did you even think about what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: No, I didn't think what I was doing.</span> <span id="s530">I just wanted to save my life.</span> <span id="s531">I didn't know how deep it was.</span> <span id="s532">I just jumped right in there.</span> <span id="s533">I was lucky it wasn't full.</span> <span id="s534">It was the will of survival is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s535">You could go through is just mind boggling, the human being can endure if the will of survival is there.</span> <span id="s536">Even right now when I start to think what I went through in my life, I can't believe that I did it.</span> <span id="s537">I'm here to tell about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: When were you ?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: We heard the Russians because we heard the war was stalled and then about 1944 we heard that the Russians started to move and the Russians were coming close to Kovno.</span> <span id="s540">Everybody was saying that maybe soon we'll be liberated, and a couple of days before the Russians came into Kovno and liquidated the Ghetto, everybody had to gather at a certain place and they marched us from the Ghetto to the train station and went into Kovno.</span> <span id="s541">We boarded the trains and I don't know how many days we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Did they give you any notice?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: No, just one day they said everybody from the Ghetto into the this and this part.</span> <span id="s544">They're liquidating the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s545">Everybody took what belongings they said you could take.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Whatever you could carry, you took along.</span> <span id="s547">I remember we walked over the bridge, we went to the train station.</span> <span id="s548">Everybody bordered the trains.</span> <span id="s549">The families were together.</span> <span id="s550">They didn't separate families there.</span> <span id="s551">I don't know how long it took, two days.</span> <span id="s552">I don't know how long on the train.</span> <span id="s553">We stopped of at .</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Do you remember an approximate date, when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: I think it was July if I'm not mistaken.</span> <span id="s556">I know it was warm already.</span> <span id="s557">Q: Do you remember seeing the Ghetto burning?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: What happened on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: We were together with the family, and they took us to .</span> <span id="s561">It was a little card and they carded me and they said everybody off, women and children separate and men separate.</span> <span id="s562">I was standing with my mother and then a German came over and he looked at me and he says you go over here.</span> <span id="s563">So I went to my father with my brothers and they took us to Landsberg, Loger A.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Did you want to stay with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yes, I wanted to stay with them, but I couldn't.</span> <span id="s566">I was with my father and my brothers.</span> <span id="s567">My father had two brothers that were also there and their children.</span> <span id="s568">The women were left at and the men they took us to Landsberg, Loger A.</span> <span id="s569">They were there for a couple weeks.</span> <span id="s570">The men used to go to work, and the smaller children couldn't work, were left in the camp.</span> <span id="s571">One day they came and said all children, gather in this place, and they came down there and they loaded us on trucks and they took us to Dachau.</span> <span id="s572">I guess when the men came back, we weren't there anymore.</span> <span id="s573">We came into Dachau, we had to get undressed, they deloused us.</span> <span id="s574">That was like they put -- the lousing they cut our hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: They didn't do any of this at Landsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: No.</span> <span id="s577">The only time we got the louse was at Dachau.</span> <span id="s578">They took away all our civilian clothes we had.</span> <span id="s579">They gave us striped clothes because in Landsberg we were still in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s580">They took some of the kids.</span> <span id="s581">They put me in the front soldiers.</span> <span id="s582">There were sections, there were American soldiers in Dachau.</span> <span id="s583">There were French soldiers there.</span> <span id="s584">There were a lot of German political prisoners, that were against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s585">In Dachau we got a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s586">We got some meat.</span> <span id="s587">We got some salami.</span> <span id="s588">That was the first time I saw a piece of salami in years.</span> <span id="s589">Every Sunday we used to get a loaf of bread, maybe because they gave it to the French prisoners they probably got it also from the they got food.</span> <span id="s590">I said, boy that's nice that kind of food because in Landsberg we didn't have any food no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: How long were you in Landsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: A couple weeks.</span> <span id="s593">Maybe two or three weeks tops, and I was in Dachau for about two weeks.</span> <span id="s594">Then, all the Jewish children that they gathered in a certain place and they put us on trains.</span> <span id="s595">We didn't know where we were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: How many children?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: I think about three or four hundred children together, that was left.</span> <span id="s598">They shipped us to -- we came into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s599">We got off the trains in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s600">We walked from Auschwitz to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s601">We didn't go on trains, we walked to there.</span> <span id="s602">That was in the evening, and they said everybody to undress you're going in for showers.</span> <span id="s603">They gave you soap and they gave you towels.</span> <span id="s604">The first group went in before us and we were next to go in and we were going into the crematorium.</span> <span id="s605">It was about 12 o'clock.</span> <span id="s606">It was a big bath there and we were going into the crematorium it was about 12 o'clock and all of a sudden they said, it's closed, get dressed.</span> <span id="s607">We didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s608">They took us from there, they walked us to Loger A in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s609">The next morning they lined us up on the grounds there and we got into two numbers.</span> <span id="s610">A number here and we were there for about two days.</span> <span id="s611">We didn't know what was going on and then one morning the order came everybody outside.</span> <span id="s612">We lined up in big lines from one end of the camp to another and my was completely undressed and he passed by and he looked at you.</span> <span id="s613">He walked over to me and he looked me up and down and he says to me, take a step forward.</span> <span id="s614">I said to myself, we're going to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s615">Then he walks a little further down in front of me and Marvin Shapiro, he lives in New York, too, he looks at him and he says take a step forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">From the whole line, four of us, took a step forward.</span> <span id="s617">The rest that were left standing there, they took them away.</span> <span id="s618">We didn't know where they went.</span> <span id="s619">We found out they went to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s620">They all got killed.</span> <span id="s621">Me and the three more of us, they took us to Loger</span></p> <p><span id="s622">D.</span> <span id="s623">It was an experimental barrack.</span> <span id="s624">In the barrack that they put us in, it was an experimental barrack.</span> <span id="s625">We didn't know, but that was supposed to be a labor camp.</span> <span id="s626">And we were there -- the food they gave you a little slice of bread, a little water and that's it.</span> <span id="s627">Once in a while you got a little soup and that was it.</span> <span id="s628">I got very sick and when I felt I was burning up with fever so I went over to the water there and I washed myself with cold water and I said to myself, whatever will be will be and I laid down.</span> <span id="s629">I got up the next morning and it was like nothing happened.</span> <span id="s630">The fever went away and I felt beautiful.</span> <span id="s631">We were in that camp for about three weeks, four weeks and all of a sudden they walked in and they needed somebody for work on the farm for harvesting not far from the camp.</span> <span id="s632">They took a couple of people from our barrack.</span> <span id="s633">They didn't take me because I was little, small.</span> <span id="s634">Somebody told me he says Sol put some straw in your shoes.</span> <span id="s635">You'll get a little taller, and that's what I did.</span> <span id="s636">I put some straw in my shoes and I got a little taller and all of a sudden a German walks in and says "We need one more," because one of them was sick.</span> <span id="s637">He wasn't healthy enough to go to work.</span> <span id="s638">He came in and he looked and looked and he took me.</span> <span id="s639">I got to work on the farm.</span> <span id="s640">I thank everything that is happening to me all the time I thank my grandfather, he was watching me.</span> <span id="s641">He still watches me.</span> <span id="s642">Everything that happening to me, he's still watching me.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: In that experimental barrack what did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: We didn't know what was going on there.</span> <span id="s645">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s646">All those things I found out after.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: So you didn't see anybody --?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: No, they were making lampshades from human skins.</span> <span id="s649">They were experimenting how to save the soldiers.</span> <span id="s650">They would take the people and experiment to see how they could save the soldiers' lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: So, you never saw anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: No, all those things I found out a little after.</span> <span id="s653">As a matter of fact, I got some pictures from where they made the lampshades.</span> <span id="s654">Somebody took pictures and I got one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: How did you know it was --?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: You looked at him.</span> <span id="s657">You could see his eyes.</span> <span id="s658">That little smile on his face.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: How did you know it was ?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: I didn't know until later on.</span> <span id="s661">I just know one with the gleaming smile on his face just shot you, you.</span> <span id="s662">We didn't know the names or nothing.</span> <span id="s663">Later on we found out who he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Was he tall?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: He wasn't that tall.</span> <span id="s666">He wasn't a big man.</span> <span id="s667">I never looked at size anyway.</span> <span id="s668">First of all, you weren't supposed to look in the face, because if you looked at them, that was it.</span> <span id="s669">You were gone.</span> <span id="s670">Your head was supposed to be this way.</span> <span id="s671">You didn't look up at the Germans.</span> <span id="s672">I learned it because I knew what my cousin went through.</span> <span id="s673">Even if they told you something, you looked down.</span> <span id="s674">I went to work on the farm.</span> <span id="s675">I was a very good worker.</span> <span id="s676">I rolled up my sleeves you know, and I was doing the work.</span> <span id="s677">Before that we were working on the railroad stations.</span> <span id="s678">We saw all the people coming into the camps, a whole trainload of gypsies came in.</span> <span id="s679">The next thing we knew smoke was coming up the chimney.</span> <span id="s680">The whole trainload was just wiped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: You were working on the ramp?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: First we were unloading potatoes from the trains.</span> <span id="s683">Q: This is after the experimental camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s685">That was after the experimental camp.</span> <span id="s686">No, that was before the experimental camp, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s687">That was before the experimental camp, and the whole trainload of gypsies just killed.</span> <span id="s688">They killed the gypsies faster than they killed the Jews.</span> <span id="s689">The crematoriums were going 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s690">What happened, they couldn't burn enough people and the crematoriums what they did, they used to dig ditches and they took human bodies and put wood on, human bodies, wood, human bodies, put stalks up and that's how they burned the people.</span> <span id="s691">Also, they used to take the fat, from the people it used to run off and they used to make soap.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Talking about the crematorium you said you found out later on an explanation of why you got out of there, can you tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: When we came, the first group of children and everybody, they went into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s696">We were the next ones to go in.</span> <span id="s697">We were all undressed.</span> <span id="s698">We had the towels and soap.</span> <span id="s699">We were going to the showers.</span> <span id="s700">It was 12 o'clock and they said no showers today and they took us to Lager A in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s701">The next morning we got up and they put numbers on our arms.</span> <span id="s702">That's the way they identified you.</span> <span id="s703">You didn't have no names.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Everybody was a number.</span> <span id="s705">No names.</span> <span id="s706">A couple of days later, about 48 hours later, they told us to go outside everyone.</span> <span id="s707">We went in a line and one end of the camp to another.</span> <span id="s708">And , I didn't know it was , but I found out later that it was .</span> <span id="s709">They passed me by, they looked at me and they told me to take a step forward and then my friend Marvin Shapiro, he took a step forward.</span> <span id="s710">The rest, they went for showers.</span> <span id="s711">We found out later that what happened how we were saved, the German government wanted talks with the American government and they told them if they're going to give them trucks, they're going to stop burning and they gave them 48 hours.</span> <span id="s712">I was lucky enough to come on the day that the 48 hours started, and that's how I was saved from the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Did you also with the number have a striped uniform?</span> <span id="s714">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: With a cap?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Yes, the cap and the yellow star on it.</span> <span id="s717">Q: All yellow?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yes, yellow start it said Jude in block.</span> <span id="s719">I should have saved those things.</span> <span id="s720">That's a real treasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Before you went into the experimental barrack you were working on the railway lines in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Yes, they took everybody to work, in the camp, everybody went to work so they took us to the railway stations, and some used to carry bricks.</span> <span id="s723">A guy used to bring the blocks from one side and bring it over there and the other group used to take it from there and bring it back to keep you busy.</span> <span id="s724">They gave me a worker, he came from Romania, a young man, and when you put on the rocks you have to carry them, two people had to carry them.</span> <span id="s725">One in the front and one in the back.</span> <span id="s726">He supposed to run with it and you couldn't walk and what happened this guy was a little lazy.</span> <span id="s727">He just came from the concentration camp and wasn't used to working I guess because in Romania the one guy they weren't toughened up like we were already.</span> <span id="s728">He didn't run, and the German that was guarding us picked up a shovel and I got hit in my right arm and now I can't move my arm, for many, many years this caused it to happen.</span> <span id="s729">The shovel broke in pieces.</span> <span id="s730">I didn't even feel the pain.</span> <span id="s731">Now, my arm I can't straighten it up.</span> <span id="s732">I may have to go for surgery.</span> <span id="s733">From that camp they took us to the Loger -- it was going on a couple of weeks and we saw people coming in from the trains, gypsies, Romanian Jews, everybody is coming, they were burning -- they couldn't burn fast enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Were you outside where you saw the trains coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Oh, yes, we were outside.</span> <span id="s736">While we were working there, the trains were coming in with the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: During the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yes, during the day.</span> <span id="s739">You worked a twelve, fourteen hour shift, well, from the morning until at night.</span> <span id="s740">They were going to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s741">The crematorium was day and night, we saw the smoke coming out.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: How did you find out they were gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: You could smell the flesh, you could smell the burning.</span> <span id="s744">Especially when they burned them outside, when they used to pile up the bodies and the wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Did you ever see the piles of bodies?</span> <span id="s746">A: No, it was always away from the camp.</span> <span id="s747">Q: But somebody told you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Yes, after this, the pictures were shown.</span> <span id="s749">You could see when they burned them the outside of the wood, the stench was so that you couldn't even breath.</span> <span id="s750">You could smell the human flesh being burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Did anybody help you in Auschwitz Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Did anybody help me?</span> <span id="s753">Well, when I went to work, no help actually, just self endurance to survive, the will to survive and also worked hard.</span> <span id="s754">They liked when you worked.</span> <span id="s755">When they took me to work on the farm, there was a German guard over there that used to watch us.</span> <span id="s756">The commandant from the camp wasn't around, officials, and he used to say sit down and take easy.</span> <span id="s757">He used to give us his food to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: This was in Auschwitz Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Yes, that was when I was working the farm already.</span> <span id="s760">He was an older man.</span> <span id="s761">He said, that's my job I have to do what they say.</span> <span id="s762">If I'm not going to do it, they're going to kill me.</span> <span id="s763">The commandant came one day, he came -- they take me from the farm, I was in charge, and they liked the way I worked, and he gave me a job.</span> <span id="s764">He said I got a job for you.</span> <span id="s765">He put me where the gate and he said make sure -- because people used to come away from the farm, there used to be potatoes and vegetables and things like that.</span> <span id="s766">There was man on one side and women on the other side.</span> <span id="s767">They were Russians.</span> <span id="s768">There was a lot of Russian women were there and he says, make sure you don't let anybody bring in any food in the camp.</span> <span id="s769">I had to search them.</span> <span id="s770">I was a little kid.</span> <span id="s771">I used to stay by the gate and a little hut or whatever and I was supposed to search them.</span> <span id="s772">I never searched them.</span> <span id="s773">One Sunday morning they had an inspection and they came in and they found potatoes in the box and vegetables.</span> <span id="s774">What happened, they got everybody out that was in November, we got everybody out completely naked undressed.</span> <span id="s775">He made them crawl on the ground like snakes the whole day and the whole night.</span> <span id="s776">He comes over to me and he takes out his gun and I thought he was going to kill me already.</span> <span id="s777">He says to me "You're lucky that I like you, because you're a very good worker.”</span> <span id="s778">He says, "Next time, make sure that nobody brings in any food in the camp, if not you're going to be done.”</span> <span id="s779">Two days later, they started they took the women away from the camp.</span> <span id="s780">I was watching.</span> <span id="s781">I used to inspect.</span> <span id="s782">I was there until they started liquidating Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: How far away from Birkenau were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: I would say maybe five six miles, a big farm.</span> <span id="s785">Q: Did you start checking people after this?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: I used to watch, but you see by that time already the harvest wasn't there no more because everything was harvested already.</span> <span id="s787">What they used to do they used to bury the vegetables in the ground for the winter so they don't freeze.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Did you ever discover anybody stealing or smuggling in food?</span> <span id="s789">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: I took it away but thank God it didn't last long because a week later we were finished already.</span> <span id="s792">We stayed in that camp until they started liquidating the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: How was your food supply?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: The food, we got rations.</span> <span id="s795">If you had a potato, some people used to eat potato.</span> <span id="s796">If you worked on the farm, you took a potato.</span> <span id="s797">But the food you got your ration in the morning, bread and once in a while you saw a little soup and water, and that was it.</span> <span id="s798">You get used to it.</span> <span id="s799">Your body gets used to it.</span> <span id="s800">You eat it up and you learn to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Did you still wear the uniform?</span> <span id="s802">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Did everybody wear uniforms?</span> <span id="s804">A: Everybody wore the uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Do you remember different kinds of insignias they have, different triangles?</span> <span id="s806">A: The only thing I had was a star, a yellow star with a black marking.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: A black mark?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Yes, Jude, it said Jude because you had different nationalities.</span> <span id="s809">You had the Russians there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Did it have a J?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: No it was marked Jude and they had a black marking an they had Russians there, Polish prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Do you remember what color?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: No, I don't know what color.</span> <span id="s814">The only thing I looked was myself.</span> <span id="s815">I had to survive myself, nobody else.</span> <span id="s816">So that's who I looked out for, myself.</span> <span id="s817">The Russians started coming close to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s818">They got us together and we went on the death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Do you know when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: We walked for a couple of weeks, and people were walking and it was winter.</span> <span id="s821">It was in December, no food, no clothes.</span> <span id="s822">You wore the same clothes winter or summer.</span> <span id="s823">It didn't make no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: What shoes did you wear?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: What shoes?</span> <span id="s826">I had shoes with holes in them and the ones they gave me in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s827">That was the only thing I had.</span> <span id="s828">It was two sizes bigger than my foot, but that was it.</span> <span id="s829">I used to put straw into it so it made my size.</span> <span id="s830">We start to go on the death march for about I don't know how long.</span> <span id="s831">Day and night we walked and people used to die like flies.</span> <span id="s832">They used to shoot them right on the spot.</span> <span id="s833">As soon as you fell, that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s834">One night they put us in the barn, the first time in a couple of days that they put us in a barn to sleep.</span> <span id="s835">The next morning we got up everybody .</span> <span id="s836">There was a lot of people that couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s837">Whoever made it walked out.</span> <span id="s838">The ones that were left they burned the barn down with the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: How come you had so much strength?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s841">I still say my grandfather was watching me.</span> <span id="s842">Something was pushing me.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">I'm sitting and I'm thinking and I still don't know how I survived this.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Did you ever want to give up?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Never.</span> <span id="s846">I always said to myself I want out of here.</span> <span id="s847">That is the only thing I had.</span> <span id="s848">That was the whole strength I had from that.</span> <span id="s849">No matter what they did to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: So where were you going on this death march?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: We didn't know where we were going.</span> <span id="s852">Walking and walking for a couple of weeks we walked, without food, without water.</span> <span id="s853">Once in a while they gave you a little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s854">Finally we came to a place, I don't know what town it was, and they put us on trains, open freight cars.</span> <span id="s855">It wasn't freight cars anymore, they were like coal cars, dead winter.</span> <span id="s856">They packed you in like sardines and we were riding for a couple of weeks, without food, without water.</span> <span id="s857">You're packed in that freight car, I don't know how many were, but and somebody used to die you used to throw them right out so you'd have little more space in the car for yourself.</span> <span id="s858">The only water we used to drink was from snow.</span> <span id="s859">We took some snow and used to put it in your mouth.</span> <span id="s860">That's all the liquid you had.</span> <span id="s861">The train that I was in, if 20 people survived the journey, it was a lot.</span> <span id="s862">I don't know how many people there were.</span> <span id="s863">Finally we ended up in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s864">Into Buchenwald we got out from the train, the SS with dogs, and they march us into the camp and they took different, -- the children they put them in different types of groups.</span> <span id="s865">Me, they put me in the Russian barracks there.</span> <span id="s866">They had French in there, they had American soldiers there.</span> <span id="s867">Me, they put in the Russian barracks, me and my friend Marvin Shapiro.</span> <span id="s868">We stayed there for a couple months.</span> <span id="s869">I know we heard the war was getting closer.</span> <span id="s870">You could hear the bombardments.</span> <span id="s871">You could hear the shells exploding.</span> <span id="s872">They wanted the children.</span> <span id="s873">Take the children away.</span> <span id="s874">Most of the Jews they wanted to take from the camps anyway, and the Russians, they said that's it, no more, we're not giving anybody up and they said the Jews .</span> <span id="s875">Nobody should go.</span> <span id="s876">We should start a resistance there and they took all the Jewish children and they were hiding in the barracks.</span> <span id="s877">The one that I was in he was a colonel.</span> <span id="s878">He was one of the leaders that was supposed to make that resistance in camp.</span> <span id="s879">I understand that camp was supposed to be blown up.</span> <span id="s880">As they were looking out all of a sudden you didn't see no Germans no more because they used to be all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">When you looked out, the whole perimeter, you didn't see the Germans.</span> <span id="s882">You just saw a couple of SS in the black uniforms.</span> <span id="s883">As I was looking out, I saw like a tank coming down the perimeter of the camp.</span> <span id="s884">Meanwhile people before that people were dying like flies.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">We didn't have no water, no food, because they were going to get rid of us.</span> <span id="s886">My friend Marvin Shapiro got very sick.</span> <span id="s887">He got typhoid and they put him in an infirmary, hospital whatever it was.</span> <span id="s888">Meanwhile, April 11th I was going from Birkenau from the back from the parameters I saw a tank coming down the camp and the time was about quarter after three, and sure enough the Americans came and liberated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Did you scream?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: No, no excitement whatsoever.</span> <span id="s891">People didn't have no strength to scream.</span> <span id="s892">People didn't eat.</span> <span id="s893">I understand the camp was supposed to be blown up at 4 o'clock.</span> <span id="s894">I didn't know myself, but people were saying.</span> <span id="s895">The commandant called from Weimer, how come you didn't blow the camp up.</span> <span id="s896">The answer, one of the Germans that was in the camp he said you come down and you do it because the Americans were there then.</span> <span id="s897">Everybody came running out you know, you mean we're liberated And the Americans came and the next day they started to cook food with meats and everything fatty and greasy things.</span> <span id="s898">And me, I was a child and somebody told me don't eat that stuff.</span> <span id="s899">The only thing I ate was a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s900">That's it, bread and potatoes.</span> <span id="s901">I wouldn't touch a piece of meat, soup or nothing.</span> <span id="s902">People that were eating it got dysentery.</span> <span id="s903">They got that because the system wasn't used to food like that.</span> <span id="s904">They got dysentery, diarrhea.</span> <span id="s905">They were dying like flies.</span> <span id="s906">People were just dying like flies.</span> <span id="s907">Now, I still say my grandfather was watching over me.</span> <span id="s908">I mean I was so hungry and all that food in front of me as much as I wanted and the only thing I ate was bread and water.</span> <span id="s909">That was going on for about three or four days until I started to take a little meat.</span> <span id="s910">A couple days later they took us out to the camp and they took us to barracks where the German soldiers used to be.</span> <span id="s911">That's what they put us in.</span> <span id="s912">And we were there, with food, with freedom, we could go where we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s913">I went to Weimer and I didn't have no hatred.</span> <span id="s914">Whatever they did I still because my thought is if you got one person that's nice from the whole nation, you can't condemn the whole nation.</span> <span id="s915">There were some that were real nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: So you're not bitter because of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Never bitter.</span> <span id="s918">I take people individual.</span> <span id="s919">I don't take a nation.</span> <span id="s920">You can't just hate everybody with what a couple of people did.</span> <span id="s921">90 percent of the Germans could have done something.</span> <span id="s922">You can't make anybody do something if they didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s923">Everybody looked out for themselves.</span> <span id="s924">They were promised the actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Did you find your family after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: No, I found out my father was alive and my brother was alive and what happened we were in Germany and with children, 522 children I think it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: From Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: No, there were more but like the French government, every government took some because they were without parents.</span> <span id="s929">Belgium, Holland, Sweden, France took children.</span> <span id="s930">522 of use went to France and the funny thing, I forgot to tell you.</span> <span id="s931">I was liberated right on my birthday, April 11, 1945.</span> <span id="s932">It was a beautiful birthday present.</span> <span id="s933">We went to France.</span> <span id="s934">We stayed in a children's home over there.</span> <span id="s935">I went to school a little bit.</span> <span id="s936">What happened, my body was so unused to food that anything I ate I used to get poisoned.</span> <span id="s937">My body just reacted.</span> <span id="s938">I used to break out in boils all over my body.</span> <span id="s939">I used to have boils like my fists.</span> <span id="s940">It took two years almost until my body got used to food.</span> <span id="s941">One day we were supposed to go to Israel, 1945 and what happened, a couple days later before we were supposed to leave, somebody came from he American Red Cross and asked if anybody --- I'm going a little too far ahead of my self.</span> <span id="s942">A guy came into the home and he's asking names and he asking my name and I told him and he said did you have a father and three brothers.</span> <span id="s943">I said yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Your father's name is Simon?</span> <span id="s945">I said yes.</span> <span id="s946">He said well he was liberated in Dachau and they're staying in Landsberg.</span> <span id="s947">I was happy and going to the home I said they found my father and my brothers and I want to go to them and they said okay.</span> <span id="s948">They got me tickets on the train.</span> <span id="s949">I went on the train.</span> <span id="s950">I came to the German border and I met somebody.</span> <span id="s951">This is a little kid he said where are you going and I said I'm going to Landsberg to find out if my father is alive and my brothers.</span> <span id="s952">He said I just came from there.</span> <span id="s953">The whole family went back to Lithuania, Kovno.</span> <span id="s954">I said to myself I'm not going to go I don't know where to find them.</span> <span id="s955">I picked myself up and I went back.</span> <span id="s956">I went back to the children's home.</span> <span id="s957">And while I was there I was supposed to go to Israel and I was saying they came from the Red Cross and they asked if anybody has family in American, and I remember when my grandfather went to American and I knew had some children there and I remember New York, I said yes, I have uncles there and aunts and I remember New York and I gave them the last name because it was the same as mine and he said okay, we're going to put it in the paper any survivors of the Holocaust, and sure enough my cousin is reading the paper and she sees my name Sol Lurie is looking for in America and I got back a letter from her and she asked me my father's name, my mother's name and my grandfather's name and I wrote them back and sure enough it was my uncles my aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">They were so happy that I was alive.</span> <span id="s959">So, I went to America.</span> <span id="s960">I wasn't going to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s961">I figure I'll go to America and be with my family.</span> <span id="s962">At least I have somebody.</span> <span id="s963">So, we made up papers for me in 1947, April 15 I came to America.</span> <span id="s964">I got</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: April is a good month for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Good and bad month.</span> <span id="s967">I got married on April 6 and my wife passed away April 22.</span> <span id="s968">It was good and bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Your mother didn't survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: My mother, the day before the war ended, before my mother was and they were liquidating the camp and my cousin's wife was sick and my mother wouldn't let her alone.</span> <span id="s971">She had to go with her.</span> <span id="s972">My aunt and her daughter was begging my mother, leave her, come with us, don't go with her because they knew the sick people they're going to kill and my mother wouldn't leave her.</span> <span id="s973">They put them in a boat and they sunk the boat.</span> <span id="s974">If my mother would have gone, she would have survived.</span> <span id="s975">I guess her time was up and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Sol, tell us what happened to you after , what changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: In 1987 I was like a piece of stone, I didn't want to talk about the war.</span> <span id="s978">I didn't want no questions asked about it.</span> <span id="s979">I couldn't show affection to my children.</span> <span id="s980">I was messed up pretty bad.</span> <span id="s981">So, I couldn't show affection.</span> <span id="s982">I was like a piece of stone.</span> <span id="s983">In 1987, I had to go in for open heart surgery, and after my open heart surgery, my whole personality changed.</span> <span id="s984">I guess I got another chance at life or got a new life and I became very sentimental, very soft.</span> <span id="s985">I started to show affection to my children.</span> <span id="s986">I started to show affection to my wife.</span> <span id="s987">I always loved my wife and my children, but I couldn't show because anything that you got close to in the war, you lost.</span> <span id="s988">So, I was afraid to show my affection, because God forbid I would lose them.</span> <span id="s989">My open surgery changed my whole personality.</span> <span id="s990">I became so affectionate with my kids, everybody.</span> <span id="s991">Even now when somebody says something, I watch a movie, I start to cry like a baby.</span> <span id="s992">Before it never bothered me.</span> <span id="s993">In 1992, my wife was diagnosed with cancer.</span> <span id="s994">They gave her three months to live, tops if she survived.</span> <span id="s995">She fought for eleven months, it was a miracle to survive.</span> <span id="s996">I guess I got a good chance to get close to her.</span> <span id="s997">I showed her how much I loved her.</span> <span id="s998">She knew it.</span> <span id="s999">I didn't leave her for a minute and she was terminally ill.</span> <span id="s1000">She couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1001">She was in terrible agony.</span> <span id="s1002">She started with 25 milligrams of morphine, she went up to 275 and that didn't help her.</span> <span id="s1003">But I guess God wanted me to survive to show her how much I loved her.</span> <span id="s1004">She was a fantastic human being, a terrific mother a beautiful wife.</span> <span id="s1005">She was so sick and she didn't want to hurt her parents because her parents were still alive.</span> <span id="s1006">Her father is 88 and her mother was 85.</span> <span id="s1007">But the cancer and the will to survive is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1008">They gave her three months, and she fought for eleven months.</span> <span id="s1009">She wouldn't give up.</span> <span id="s1010">She denied that she had it.</span> <span id="s1011">She said I'm going to be beat it.</span> <span id="s1012">I got so affectionate to her.</span> <span id="s1013">I got so close and she showed me her love which was unbelievable and she kept on fighting the cancer.</span> <span id="s1014">She wanted to go to Florida with the cancer.</span> <span id="s1015">She was getting radiation and chemotherapy.</span> <span id="s1016">She wanted to go to Florida.</span> <span id="s1017">She couldn't walk, we went to Florida in a wheel chair.</span> <span id="s1018">The whole time she was in a wheel chair on pain killers, she was getting radiation in Florida, too, and chemotherapy in Florida.</span> <span id="s1019">I guess my wife was looking out for me.</span> <span id="s1020">She wanted me to be happy I guess.</span> <span id="s1021">She fought an unbelievable battle and we have a friend of ours her husband passed away 2 1/2 years ago and my wife used to tell me I should call , maybe she wants to go out with us.</span> <span id="s1022">Her mother also had cancer and she said call and see if she wants to go to support group with us.</span> <span id="s1023">And I didn't want it.</span> <span id="s1024">I loved my wife, but she insisted I had to call her.</span> <span id="s1025">I said okay I'm going to call the Jewish support group.</span> <span id="s1026">My wife was very happy.</span> <span id="s1027">She used to call her and used to call her and used to talk for hours.</span> <span id="s1028">As I was saying she was starting at 25 milligrams of morphine any treatment that she could have and she suffered so from the treatment it was unbearable.</span> <span id="s1029">She used to get such pains in her legs that you could see by the fingers.</span> <span id="s1030">The pain was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1031">The only thing my own invention I used to take hot compresses, boiling hot compresses, turkish style, I used to wrap them on the legs.</span> <span id="s1032">I used to put on a plastic bad, I remember from Europe yet, and that's the only thing that used to relieve her pain.</span> <span id="s1033">I used to get up at night and I knew she was in pain, and I said you got any pain, she says no, I said I know you got pain.</span> <span id="s1034">She said no I don't want to bother you.</span> <span id="s1035">And she went to doctor and she went to the last chemotherapy and she got so sick she was in the hospital and they gave her the chemotherapy and she got blisters in her mouth.</span> <span id="s1036">She couldn't swallow.</span> <span id="s1037">She couldn't even take a drink of water.</span> <span id="s1038">Her face was completely blown up, her lips, the flesh was showing.</span> <span id="s1039">It was such a pity, and the doctor says there is nothing more I can do for you.</span> <span id="s1040">So, she went to another doctor and she went to him and he said you want to hear the truth and she said yes I want to hear the truth.</span> <span id="s1041">He said, there's nothing more I can do for you.</span> <span id="s1042">We came home and she says to me, I don't want to live no more.</span> <span id="s1043">That's it.</span> <span id="s1044">And all of a sudden the pain got so bad I called the doctor and he raised the morphine from 75 to 175 two days later he raised it another 100 milligrams, 275 milligrams and I didn't want to give it to her, I didn't know what the morphine was going to do to her.</span> <span id="s1045">She couldn't take the pain no more.</span> <span id="s1046">I said let's put you in the hospital maybe they can help you.</span> <span id="s1047">She says okay.</span> <span id="s1048">I didn't even want to take her to the hospital because this way I fear that she thinks I'm throwing her away.</span> <span id="s1049">I didn't want to take her to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1050">I took her to the hospital and she stayed there a couple of days and the pain, she was getting injections of morphine close to 275 and she needed medication and she was getting patches and the hospital didn't have it and I had to buy my own medication for that, and in the morning I went to pick up and I said to her she didn't want to eat.</span> <span id="s1051">I used to stay there from 8 o'clock in the morning until 2 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1052">I wouldn't leave her for a minute.</span> <span id="s1053">So at 8 o'clock I said why don't you eat something, she said I can't.</span> <span id="s1054">I said have a chocolate chip cookie.</span> <span id="s1055">She said okay I'll have a chocolate chip cookie if you promise me you're going to go home at 8 o'clock.</span> <span id="s1056">I said okay.</span> <span id="s1057">I gave her one chocolate chip cookie, then she took another one.</span> <span id="s1058">I went home 9 o'clock and the drug store didn't open up until 9 o'clock in the morning and I got the medication for her I got it at 10 o'clock and she was waiting for me all of a sudden I walk in and they're working on her, oxygen, she couldn't breath and as soon as she saw me she stretched her arms out, her eyes bulged, she stretched her arms out to say good bye to me.</span> <span id="s1059">She said Sol, Sol, I came over I said I'm here, everything is going to be okay.</span> <span id="s1060">As soon as I came she relaxed and they put the oxygen on her.</span> <span id="s1061">I transferred her to a private room, and that was Friday she was supposed to go home.</span> <span id="s1062">I was going to take her home because I got in touch with the hospice because she didn't want to die in the hospital and Friday morning I was supposed to take her home, and she died Thursday night.</span> <span id="s1063">I arranged for the funeral and everything I made sure we passed the house when we are going to the cemetery, we stopped by the house.</span> <span id="s1064">Before she died she was pushing me at that lady there and she knew I'll have somebody and she passed away and after she passed away for a couple months I was very confused.</span> <span id="s1065">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1066">I was lonely.</span> <span id="s1067">I missed her.</span> <span id="s1068">The first time I went to I was supposed to go to a party and I didn't know how to go there so I told I didn't know how to go there and she said don't worry you'll find it and a member was right next to us said I'm going to the same party he says follow me and I'll take you there.</span> <span id="s1069">I said okay, and I'm following him and following him and all of sudden I lost him.</span> <span id="s1070">I couldn't find him and I'm going around in circles.</span> <span id="s1071">I said to her I'm lost.</span> <span id="s1072">I don't know where I am.</span> <span id="s1073">She said don't worry Sol you'll find your way.</span> <span id="s1074">And then she disappeared.</span> <span id="s1075">Like a magnet only lives a couple blocks away from me and all of a sudden like it was pulling me, going for a walk I pass by house and I know somebody that lives across the street.</span> <span id="s1076">I couldn't go into her house because it didn't look right and a man lives across the street from me and I know him and I always stopped to talk to her and my excuse was because I'm going for a walk that's why I stopped by.</span> <span id="s1077">Well the thing was I wanted to see I see her outside.</span> <span id="s1078">About a week or so, one day she had a problem with the plumbing and she said to the neighbor across the street I have a little problem, he said why don't you call Sol, so she called me.</span> <span id="s1079">That's I started to go with her and we're going to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: When are you going to get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: October 23.</span> <span id="s1082">And another thing, about my wife, may she rest in peace, at the unveiling, the unveiling was supposed to be with a big storm and we came to the cemetery like the sky opened up for two hours, pouring.</span> <span id="s1083">My son and my daughter got lost and we had to wait for them and after the services everything finished.</span> <span id="s1084">As soon as we pulled out from the gate of the cemetery it stopped raining, the sun came out.</span> <span id="s1085">It's like somebody said everybody is crying for her.</span> <span id="s1086">She was a wonderful woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Thank you, Sol.</span> <span id="s1088">Sol, would you just tell us your number?</span> <span id="s1089">A: It's B 2858.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
