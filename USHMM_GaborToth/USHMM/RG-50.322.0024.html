June 10, 1981.</span> <span id="s6">I am going to interview Dr. Lubelfeld in connection with the Dayton area Holocaust project.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">OK, Dr. Lubelfeld, I want to start by asking your age.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: My age is 73, going on 74.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: What is your birth date?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: Oct 29.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Of what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Are you asking me for the nearest anniversary, or my birth date?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Your birth date!</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: 1907.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: In Warsaw, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: OK and I would like to ask you your parents’ names, please .</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Benedict and Regina.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Your mother’s maiden name please.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Lilienthal.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Was you mother Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Polish?</span> <span id="s24">How long has your family lived in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I left Poland not of my own will, but forcibly on Sept 19, 1939 when I was taken Prisoner of War by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: I don’t believe that you heard the question which I asked, or maybe you didn’t understand me.</span> <span id="s27">I asked “How long has your family, meaning your background -- ancestors -- lived in Poland?”</span> <span id="s28">How many generations back do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: As far as I know at least 400 years.</span> <span id="s30">(That means in the territory called Poland since Poland, itself existed only sporadically.)</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: What did your family do for work, to earn a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: My father was an accountant and my mother was a housewife.</span> <span id="s35">In those days there was no work (for women0 outside in large numbers (at least not in the middle classes).</span> <span id="s36">This of course has nothing to do with the main thing we were talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: No, but we are trying to find this kind of information as background.</span> <span id="s38">Your father was an accountant; do you know whom he worked for?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: In the last job he had he worked in the Italian embassy.</span> <span id="s40">No, it was not an embassy because it was already under the German occupation.</span> <span id="s41">He worked for the Italian consulate.</span> <span id="s42">Actually I am not really sure because I was already in the prisoner camp, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: I would like to ask you now; how many children were there in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Three.</span> <span id="s45">I was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Who were the other two?</span> <span id="s47">Were they boys or girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: My sister, who is still in Warsaw, and my brother, blessed be his memory, who died long before the war, when he was 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: What is your sister’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: It is Irena Chechanofska.</span> <span id="s51">Do you want me to spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: We will get to that later.</span> <span id="s53">What was your brother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Joseph!</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: When you lived in Poland, as a child, in Warsaw, did your family own your own home or did you rent?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Most of the people we were in contact with rented apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: In the neighborhood where you lived, was it primarily a Christian neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Yes; but there were no restrictions.</span> <span id="s59">Jews, in Warsaw, had their own quarter.</span> <span id="s60">This was sort of a historical remain from the past, but Jews lived elsewhere also.</span> <span id="s61">If they wanted to.</span> <span id="s62">There were no objections, at least none that I knew of.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Do you remember, from your childhood, whether the Jews who were in Warsaw at that time, you said that they had their own quarter, were segregated in any way, as far as school children were concerned?</span> <span id="s64">Did you go to school with these Jewish children?</span> <span id="s65">(Several other Holocaust survivors told about strict segregation in classrooms).</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: I had a number of Jewish schoolmates.</span> <span id="s67">That was nothing special.</span> <span id="s68">In every school there were Jewish children of the families who lived in that district.</span> <span id="s69">They walked to school or rode a streetcar.</span> <span id="s70">I had some Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s71">A few people, in this country knew, for example, that religion was taught in the schools in Europe and, since the majority of the children were Catholics -- they were about 60% or70% -- we remained in the classroom and the priest would come and teach religion.</span> <span id="s72">At the same time these few who were Protestant, who were in the class were directed to another classroom and there was a Lutheran pastor who would come and teach them the Lutheran religion.</span> <span id="s73">I remember a very peculiar looking elderly gentleman who would come and teach the Jewish children their religion.</span> <span id="s74">This is how the non-discrimination against religion and not establishing a religion was understood in Poland, in these days.</span> <span id="s75">It worked!</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: You spoke of a peculiar looking gentleman.</span> <span id="s77">Would you describe him for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: To me he was big, because I was small.</span> <span id="s79">By the way, I am not very big, even now.</span> <span id="s80">Anyway, he had a very dignified demeanor.</span> <span id="s81">He must have had some license to teach the Jewish religion, but he was not a rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Did he wear the traditional side locks?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No, you would not have been able to tell whether he was Polish, French or whatever.</span> <span id="s84">He was dressed the same way I am, in street clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: So there were no outstanding characteristics?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: No he was not wearing orthodox clothes.</span> <span id="s87">Many of the Jews, as far as I know, had their own schools.</span> <span id="s88">I am very well informed about this situation of Jews in Poland, since, because of my name, I am always asked, “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s89">I have always been interested in these variances of population, in my own country.</span> <span id="s90">So I read quite a lot about the matter.</span> <span id="s91">It took me a long time until I finally found out enough to satisfy my curiosity.</span> <span id="s92">That does not mean that, if I found a book about Jewish things now, I would read it saying, before I read it, that I knew everything.</span> <span id="s93">The last book about Jewish things which I read about two years ago, is “The Book of Jewish Knowledge.”</span> <span id="s94">A kind of an encyclopedia, but it has nothing to do with our interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Actually it does, because it sort of demonstrates your own background on the subject and that you can talk very well on it.</span> <span id="s96">You said that you had been, because of your name Lubens.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Lubelfeld!</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Lubelfeld, that you had been, from time to time taken for Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: I might have had some ancestor who was Jewish, but a Jewish name would have been Lubel.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Is that a typical Polish name?</span> <span id="s101">It sounds more German!</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No, it is a German name.</span> <span id="s103">There were many German names which were considered Jewish names.</span> <span id="s104">For example one of Hitler’s cabinet minister’s name was Rosenberg (Alfred Rosenberg was the philosopher of Hitler’s, the German Nazi party.</span> <span id="s105">He had been born in Estonia, became Minister of Germany’s Eastern occupied territories during WWII.</span> <span id="s106">He was convicted at the Nuremberg War Crimes trials in 1946 and executed).</span> <span id="s107">I remember that I saw a stationery shop, on the street where I lived, and the name of the owner was Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s108">He was a Jew!</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: You were never able to trace your family, with all the studying which you did, including your mother’s maiden name, that there were any Jews, Lilienthal, again, sounds as if it may be Jewish, if you trace it back to a German heritage.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: All I knew from the tradition in my family, is that my father’s family originally came from either Latvia or Estonia.</span> <span id="s111">When I was in the prison camp I did not think about it or I didn’t remember it; but somehow it had sunk in my memory.</span> <span id="s112">One day a German professor of Socio-Anthropology came and did some research and measurements.</span> <span id="s113">Of course he never came to any agreement on it but, for this anthropologist, who needed such a mass of people for his research, that was just like being put into some kind of paradise.</span> <span id="s114">So, when he examined me he said, ‘Ostbaldischi!”</span> <span id="s115">this means from the eastern portion of the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s116">Then immediately, the story of the origin of my family came back to my mind from under the threshold of consciousness.</span> <span id="s117">I sort of agreed.</span> <span id="s118">Finally, there is another thing which pertains to what we are talking about.</span> <span id="s119">This anthropological thing; the second person who brought my attention to this thing was my wife.</span> <span id="s120">She is British.</span> <span id="s121">She said: “All Poles, all the people from Eastern Europe, you can recognize on the street immediately.”</span> <span id="s122">I said: “Why?</span> <span id="s123">Do they swear in their language of origin?”</span> <span id="s124">she said, “No, because of their flat heads!”</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: That is interesting.</span> <span id="s126">I myself am very interested in anthropology, I have a degree in it.</span> <span id="s127">So I will get back to that research which was done while you were in prison.</span> <span id="s128">I may ask you more questions on that subject.</span> <span id="s129">I would like to return now to an earlier point and ask you, since that should be established, whether you are a Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Well, I am a Catholic, but since my wife is Anglican, we go to the Episcopal Church , to Christ Episcopal Church.</span> <span id="s131">Our son is an Episcopal priest in Lansing Mich.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: However you were raised as a Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Not particularly, just like the rest of the Polish intelligentsia.</span> <span id="s136">We went to church on Sunday.</span> <span id="s137">We observed the religious holidays.</span> <span id="s138">We observed the church laws, in general.</span> <span id="s139">We went to confession at least once a year and took communion.</span> <span id="s140">I was introduced to religious life by my mother and father.</span> <span id="s141">This I think is the normal way of doing it.</span> <span id="s142">That was the case, at least for me, for the environment from which I came.</span> <span id="s143">I can see that you are an anthropologist because, when I talk about these things your eyes, which are radiant anyway, become a little more radiant.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Let’s get back to Poland.</span> <span id="s145">I would like it if you could make some estimates; can you judge what class your family fit into at that time.</span> <span id="s146">would you say middle- class?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Middle class!</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: You called them intelligentsia.</span> <span id="s149">Were your family intellectuals?</span> <span id="s150">Was your father university educated?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes, he had a college education.</span> <span id="s152">He had a degree in accountancy.</span> <span id="s153">He was what you would call here a Certified Public accountant (JL uses the term Chartered Accountant!)</span> <span id="s154">.</span> <span id="s155">I don’t know if he was certified or not.</span> <span id="s156">I did not think about these things then.</span> <span id="s157">I never knew how the second part of my life would turn out.</span> <span id="s158">it came from nothingness.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: I don’t know if you answered my question about what class of people you came from, I got so interested in your answers.</span> <span id="s160">You said “middle class?”</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: You could say, upper middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Was your family politically oriented?</span> <span id="s163">Was your father involved in the politics of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: No, not that I remember.</span> <span id="s165">I don’t think that any political issue deserved attention in the opinion of my father.</span> <span id="s166">My father and mother would be at a table and things were happening in the world and they discussed it all the time.</span> <span id="s167">We children were asking questions (JL was 32 years old in 1939, so he could hardly be considered a child then).</span> <span id="s168">This kid asked most of the questions, he was always sort of on the lookout to get more than he was being given.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: That leads me to the next subject.</span> <span id="s170">I would like to know if you can recall, as a child, what was going on economically or politically, in your country prior to the onset of the Germans?</span> <span id="s171">Now that goes quite a bit further now, that would make you a bit older.</span> <span id="s172">What was taking place politically and economically in Poland during WWI and even before WWI.</span> <span id="s173">That was the time when you were a small child.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: When WWI broke out many people in Poland prayed in gratitude.</span> <span id="s175">One of the Polish national poets prayed for the Universal War of Peoples Recognition by the Lord.</span> <span id="s176">Poland, from the end of the 18th century until 1919 did not exist on the map of Europe as an independent state.</span> <span id="s177">It had been partitioned, at the end of the 18th century between Prussia, Russia and Austria.</span> <span id="s178">Reunification and the establishment of Poland as an independent country was possible only by some miracle who thought about these things.</span> <span id="s179">Some cosmic catastrophe happened and these three great powers collapsed simultaneously.</span> <span id="s180">The19th century was the time of two Polish uprisings against Prussia in 1830 and in 1863.</span> <span id="s181">They ended in catastrophe.</span> <span id="s182">To make a very long story short, or shorter, for the purpose of this interview, I say that one of the questions which I remember I asked, as a kid, was “Daddy, why do policemen speak Russian and not Polish?”</span> <span id="s183">Then I received my first lesson in Polish history from my father.</span> <span id="s184">Now the result of WWI was miraculous for Poland, because all three participatory powers collapsed to such a degree that it was permitted for Poland to reunite and even to win the war of 1920 against Russia (Aug 1, 1920 found the Russian armies under Trotsky 75 miles from Warsaw but by Aug, 23 Polish Marshal Pilsudsky had repeatedly defeated Trotsky and had even encircled three of his armies).</span> <span id="s185">As a pre-teen boy I remember that the Russians, the Bolsheviks, had their big offensive and they came up to the suburbs of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s186">The commander in chief of the Polish army was Marshal Pilsudsky, by a very ingenious tactical maneuver (and the armament from England and France) which in the military schools of several nations has been given as an example of military genius, did organize an attack force which hit the Russian left flank, broke them and went on to their back.</span> <span id="s187">All these Russian massed forces, which were on the road to Warsaw, were cut off from the main body of troops of the Russian army.</span> <span id="s188">This was Aug. 15, 1920 and that was also one of the religious holidays so that people in Poland called this victory over the Russians: “The Miracle of Vistula.”</span> <span id="s189">That was a battle which lasted three days.</span> <span id="s190">The Russians had to move back, to withdraw.</span> <span id="s191">The Polish armed forces, which was a conglomeration of former soldiers of three partitioning powers were then on the bank of the river Neman.</span> <span id="s192">The Polish forces caught up with the withdrawing Russians and they fought a battle and that was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s193">Then there was the Treaty of Riga, which politically and legally established the Polish State, the Polish republic, the Polish Commonwealth.</span> <span id="s194">Until Set 17, 1939, when the Russians broke that agreement there was peace.</span> <span id="s195">I even remember some friendships.</span> <span id="s196">I remember a courtesy visit by the Russian fleet.</span> <span id="s197">There was a battleship the “Marat” and some other smaller units, to the Polish navy in Gdynia.</span> <span id="s198">By the way, I was a career officer in the Polish navy, a regular navy officer.</span> <span id="s199">This is why I remember these things better than other people, who just looked.</span> <span id="s200">So Poland was finally independent, after more than 100 years of being non-existent as a political unit.</span> <span id="s201">Then we had too many political parties.</span> <span id="s202">Poland wasn’t ready for this kind of democratic political structure.</span> <span id="s203">Finally this Marshal Pilsudsky, who was retired, at that time, made a coup d’etat (On May 13, 1926 Marshal Joseph Pilsudsky arrested President Wojciechowski and then, on June 13, the Marshal settled for the job of Permanent Commander in Chief of the Armies, regardless of who would head the government, as a means of controlling the country).</span> <span id="s204">In 1926, if I remember correctly, is when it happened.</span> <span id="s205">It was illegal, but it was effective.</span> <span id="s206">During those 20 years of Polish Independence the nation, the country demonstrated to all those who wanted to see the truth, in Europe, that the Polish Nation had not been really defeated in the partitions.</span> <span id="s207">To us, to the kids who grew up in this period of freedom between the wars it was a time to be appreciated.</span> <span id="s208">Whatever most of us are today, to most of us, it is the result of being a free country which we had then.</span> <span id="s209">Becoming a free country after 100 years or more of not being free, was an event which cannot be wiped out, even by being a Communist country.</span> <span id="s210">There are some good things which, in spite of all the bad things which the present regime has introduced, are enjoyed by the people.</span> <span id="s211">Now let me get back to your question; all the events which were happening around us, and in which we were involved, affected our lives directly.</span> <span id="s212">There were continuous discussions about them and interpretations about the events.</span> <span id="s213">My father had perhaps a somewhat leftist slant in his views, so naturally I had the opposing views.</span> <span id="s214">Naturally!</span> <span id="s215">However neither of our views were very strong.</span> <span id="s216">There was one thing about which we did not have a clear vision.</span> <span id="s217">Because Polish people had always trusted everybody, we fought the German aggression with the weapons of 1920.</span> <span id="s218">Polish cavalry against German tanks.</span> <span id="s219">That was ridiculous from the military point of view, but it is one of the things which lives in the memory of the people.</span> <span id="s220">Poland remained faithful to the principles which are living in Polish history.</span> <span id="s221">One British historian whose name escapes me right now, recognized that.</span> <span id="s222">He told me about the battle of Warsaw in 1920 as one of the battles deciding the history of the world, he did that because, to think humanely, I know that this theory is ridiculous but, just for a moment let’s say: “If Poland had fallen to the Russians in 1920, the Russians would have marched into Germany, which had a communist revolution lingering.</span> <span id="s223">They would go through Germany to France.’</span> <span id="s224">So the history of the world would have been completely different.</span> <span id="s225">Now I understand that “if” in history, just like in individual human life, is ridiculous and I don’t pay much attention to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: You skirted the issue, and I wonder if I could direct you to it, at least a little bit, it is about Polish Nationalism.</span> <span id="s227">Even though Poland was part of Russia and Prussia during the last 150 years, or so.</span> <span id="s228">Can you speak of the nationalistic feeling of the people?</span> <span id="s229">I assume that they felt themselves as Poles, rather than Prussians or Russians during that period.</span> <span id="s230">Do you have any sense of that type of fierce nationalism which people felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: They knew that they were Polish and the partitioning powers respected it and sometimes fought it.</span> <span id="s232">For example, Bismarck introduced a “Germanizing’ policy in the Western part of Poland.</span> <span id="s233">So, in Polish history, Bismarck is a bad guy.</span> <span id="s234">The least oppression was from Austria, the Austrian-Hungarian government, in the south.</span> <span id="s235">They permitted the Polish language in the schools.</span> <span id="s236">The Russians, they were at times, this way and then that way.</span> <span id="s237">There was a Polish language in my time, but there had been attempts, in the past, at Russification.</span> <span id="s238">One had to live, so, since Polish hopes were a prayer for a “Universal War of People Recognition” about which I talked, from the practical point of view and from the point of view of what was then existing, it had little possibility of being answered the way the Polish people imagined it should be.</span> <span id="s239">It was speculation anyway!</span> <span id="s240">So there were many Poles in the Russian military service.</span> <span id="s241">There were Polish generals.</span> <span id="s242">Somebody even said once that, if Russia had not seized the part of Poland which they did, they would have lost the wars which they had with the Turks and with the Japanese even worse than they did.</span> <span id="s243">The result was that, when finally, Polish armed forces were assembled in 1919 you could see people who spoke Polish with a very heavy Russian accent, and others with a German accent.</span> <span id="s244">It was not only a German accent, but a German accent with a passion.</span> <span id="s245">There were also some from the Austro-Hungarian former forces with the “Gemutlich” little slant in their German.</span> <span id="s246">However they were all Polish when the war with the Bolsheviks, the Russian Communists, started turning a little faster.</span> <span id="s247">You could see that these people who might have been culturally, in the external things, German or flavored Russians or Viennese, they were basically Poles.</span> <span id="s248">This perseverance in remaining Polish was to a great extent supported by religion, by the church.</span> <span id="s249">Polish history is such that being Polish and being Catholic, even now, means the same thing.</span> <span id="s250">That is a historical fact which is well understood because, after all, Poland fought with Turks as defendants of Christianity.</span> <span id="s251">Poland fought with Russia for the hegemony of these parts which are now in Western Russia and were then Eastern Poland.</span> <span id="s252">Sometimes I lose the continuity of what I am saying because I am an old man.</span> <span id="s253">Five years ago I would not have made that brag, I just made; so you will have to forgive me for that.</span> <span id="s254">So, even the names go with it.</span> <span id="s255">For example Russian Gen. Marinevsky has a Polish name, Marshal Rokesovsky has a Polish name.</span> <span id="s256">the founder of the KGB, which is the Russian secret police and the terrible NKVD, Cheresvokaika, who was the organizer and founder of it?</span> <span id="s257">Cherchinsky!</span> <span id="s258">(Transcriber wrote these names down phonetically but is not certain of the spellings).</span> <span id="s259">The monument of Cherchinsky stands in front of one of the Polish government buildings on a square in Warsaw or at least it was there in 1974, when I was there and saw it.</span> <span id="s260">There are some people in Poland who say, even, that Cherchinsky was exterminating Russians, whether they were Communists or not, with his NKVD.</span> <span id="s261">So, all these things which were going on were discussed in this patriotic, highly emotional atmosphere, which was also inherent in the Polish history.</span> <span id="s262">Polish people in their history, if you look at it from the ordinary or average Western’s point of view, you could say that Polish people were stupid and impractical.</span> <span id="s263">You have such events in the Polish History like 1683.</span> <span id="s264">That was the year the Turks were besieging Vienna.</span> <span id="s265">The emperor of the Holy German empire (at that time the Holy Roman empire extended from Rome to the German coast and was ruled by the head of the House of Hapsburg who was routinely “elected’ emperor by the Electors meeting in Frankfurt on the Main).</span> <span id="s266">Of the German nation, governed out of Vienna.</span> <span id="s267">The Pope sent some representatives to the Polish king, John III Seviesky, who had been the conqueror of the Turks in several battles, saying.</span> <span id="s268">“Please come to the rescue!”</span> <span id="s269">So John II gathered about one hundred thousand men into an army, no strings attached, no lend lease, no “play now -- pay later” schemes, just for the heck of it, went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s270">He defeated the Turks and relieved the siege of the Emperor.</span> <span id="s271">For this fact the Austrians have reciprocated one hundred years later by participating in the Polish partition.</span> <span id="s272">However that is how the cookie crumbles.</span> <span id="s273">That is what I would like to point out here is that, just for the heck of it, the world may beat them out.</span> <span id="s274">There was the Napoleonic War period when the Polish Court served in Napoleon’s army, because they hoped, without any real reason for it, that Napoleon would rebuild Poland.</span> <span id="s275">A few Polish people did realize that Napoleon was another plain crook, the only thing which they had against him was that he was short in stature.</span> <span id="s276">Polish commanders were usually tall.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Don’t you think that Polish people, as a nation, were militarily naïve about their aggressors?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Politically naïve, not militarily!</span> <span id="s279">This was the last Polish victory in the Napoleonic period.</span> <span id="s280">Another event, which is written about in Polish history books, because it is something to be proud of, comes from the Peninsular Wars.</span> <span id="s281">These are the wars where the British Expeditionary forces (under Wellington) helped the Spaniards fight against the French.</span> <span id="s282">The battles which were being fought, mainly by the Spanish guerrillas included a Polish detachment (on the French side).</span> <span id="s283">There was a battle at a place called Somosiera(undoubtedly this is Pueto de Somosiera).</span> <span id="s284">They don’t teach about that outside of Poland, in the history books.</span> <span id="s285">Somosiera is kind of a valley or ravine.</span> <span id="s286">There were four Spanish batteries there blocking its entrance.</span> <span id="s287">Napoleon said to the Polish forces: “You can do anything1 Go and beat up these batteries!</span> <span id="s288">Attack them!”</span> <span id="s289">So the Polish cavalry, that was light cavalry, attacked.</span> <span id="s290">If I remember correctly, almost all the officers were killed, but the few survivors finally killed the last cannon crew.</span> <span id="s291">They won the battle of Somosiera and we are proud of it!</span> <span id="s292">In WWII there was Monte Cassino (on May 18, 44 German troops evacuated Monte Cassino).</span> <span id="s293">It was Polish troops who finally took Monte Cassino!</span> <span id="s294">In how many history books, through which I browsed, in this country, it is all written as if Eisenhower, himself, did that.</span> <span id="s295">(The book: “Chronicle of the 20th Century” by Clifton Daniels, on p. 568 gives joint credit to Polish and British troops for that conquest which allowed breaking out of Anzio beachhead and continuing the march on Rome).</span> <span id="s296">Then, again, why do I mention it?</span> <span id="s297">It is because, who the hell needed to take Monte Cassino, in the first place?</span> <span id="s298">It could have been passed by.</span> <span id="s299">Now for the Polish people that was another occasion to show how we go up in the smoke and shave them off.</span> <span id="s300">Finally the tragic Warsaw uprising where the Soviet army stopped on the Eastern bank of the River Vistula and watched how the Germans systematically slaughtered the Polish defenders.</span> <span id="s301">I don’t remember how long this Warsaw uprising lasted (it lasted 63 days from Aug 1st to Oct 3rd 1944) and how they were able to live.</span> <span id="s302">That was again with technology beating this Polish uprising.</span> <span id="s303">The Poles wanted to liberate their own capital.</span> <span id="s304">However it was decided that the Russians would be the liberators.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: They would get credit for the liberation of Warsaw, rather than the Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I cannot blame them.</span> <span id="s307">from a tactical point of view it was ridiculous, but taking into account all the factors which came into play in this situation, and that considers psychology of the people, economics and history of the past; it seems terrible now.</span> <span id="s308">All these things were spontaneous things!</span> <span id="s309">Even if they had known that no one would help them they still would have fought.</span> <span id="s310">I think that if the Polish people have learned anything from this, being under the Communist regime, I think that they finally learned political and practical reasons and they have demonstrated it now, (On Jan 24, 1981 millions of Polish workers stayed away from their jobs in support of the Solidarity Union’s call for a five day work week) However that is not the leading layers of the society, not the intellectuals but the workers, who were affected and who were effective.</span> <span id="s311">Can you imagine the worker who is, in the Communist world, supposedly the source of the power of the State?</span> <span id="s312">Here, at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk they are all kneeling at the gate and they are getting the Holy Communion!</span> <span id="s313">You know that “Religion is the Opiate of the People?”</span> <span id="s314">(That was a statement made by Lenin).</span> <span id="s315">Don’t they know that?</span> <span id="s316">Of course they know!</span> <span id="s317">However they held in contempt the people who think this and who want to take this as a basis.</span> <span id="s318">In Poland, now, even communists go to church, particularly those who want to join the Communist party just in order to satisfy the conditions for eating, drinking and sleeping.</span> <span id="s319">I know about one person who is close to me and is in Poland.</span> <span id="s320">He is a very important engineer in the Polish industry.</span> <span id="s321">He has a very fine position.</span> <span id="s322">I am not going to mention his name, and what relationship he has to me.</span> <span id="s323">Before he was promoted to this elevated position, which he has now, he had to become a member of the Communist party.</span> <span id="s324">So he filled out the application, the form, and went for an interview.</span> <span id="s325">I know this as a fact from him.</span> <span id="s326">He told me.</span> <span id="s327">So I asked him: “How did this interview go?”</span> <span id="s328">He said: “This interviewer asked me: Why do you want to join the Communist party?”</span> <span id="s329">and I said to him: “For the same reason that you joined the party!”</span> <span id="s330">The interviewer said: “That is fine, that is reason enough, you are accepted.”</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Let me take you back to WWI.</span> <span id="s332">I like to ask you basically: “Did your father fight in the war?</span> <span id="s333">Was he in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: In my family there were some younger people, older than I, who were in the armed forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Was there no military tradition in your immediate family?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: No!</span> <span id="s337">I was the only militarist.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Can I ask you: You did graduate from high school, didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Of course!</span> <span id="s340">After I graduated from high school I went to Warsaw University.</span> <span id="s341">I don’t like to talk about this because it sounds like bragging, but I was sort of a bright kid.</span> <span id="s342">I applied to the Polish Military School.</span> <span id="s343">I was attending the University and, at the same time, I was a student in the Military school.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: What years are we talking about here?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A; 1926!</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: You were attending both the University and the Military School?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: I was a student in absentia.</span> <span id="s348">In the European system you had to come to the University only for examinations.</span> <span id="s349">So I worked hard.</span> <span id="s350">I didn’t go on dates so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: What type of a degree were you working on at the University/</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: A diploma in engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: And at the military academy?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A; It was rather like AFIT here (Air Force Institute of Technology, which is located at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, prepares mainly U.S. Air Force Officers generally for an advanced career in Science or Engineering).</span> <span id="s355">Do you know what AFIT is?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: It is the Air Force Institute of Technology.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q; It is very difficult to get in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: That is the place from where I finally retired.</span> <span id="s360">I was a professor there for 24 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: We will eventually get to that, but I kind of like to know first of all: do you recall the name of the Military Academy which you attended?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: It was the School of Military Engineering, you would say here.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q; In other words; you coordinated your engineering degree from both schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Now, this was in 1926.</span> <span id="s366">Was this education which you were getting, at this point, being overseen by Russians or Prussians?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, that was independent Poland!</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: That’s right, they had gained their independence in 1920.</span> <span id="s369">So it was a Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Polish Armed Forces School!</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: OK, fine!</span> <span id="s372">Did anything significant happen during this period to you or your family, in this 1926-28 period?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Only that my brother died.</span> <span id="s374">No, nothing else special, just routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: At that time there were a lot of new developments in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yes, at that time Poland, from being an agricultural country built an industrial, you could say, might, it was not that big, but the country became more industrialized, in that short period, than it had been before.</span> <span id="s377">We built an industrial base and a port in Gdynia.</span> <span id="s378">Gdynia has become the largest port on the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s379">That was created out of nothing, just out of a small fisherman’s village.</span> <span id="s380">(Poland needed an access to the sea which it had control of since Danzig or Gdansk was an international city).</span> <span id="s381">In that part of Polish Silesia, industry was developed, there were different industries.</span> <span id="s382">The area was diversified.</span> <span id="s383">Of course, after WWII, under the protection of the “Great, Benevolent Older-brother from the East” they industrialized Poland even more.</span> <span id="s384">Whether that is really good, in every respect, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s385">I knew that, in one respect, it was not so good.</span> <span id="s386">I asked my sister in 1974: “Can we go to the River Vistula to swim?”</span> <span id="s387">She said: “In what?</span> <span id="s388">In that dirt?”</span> <span id="s389">The river is completely polluted.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: When you graduated, that would have been about the year 1932?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: I think that it was in 1931.</span> <span id="s392">That year I was through with my formal education.</span> <span id="s393">I have an advanced degree (probably that was a PH.D degree since JL calls himself Doctor).</span> <span id="s394">Then I was assigned to different schools, army and navy schools.</span> <span id="s395">Finally I was transferred, as an engineer to the navy.</span> <span id="s396">There I was head of the signal Department in the Naval Technical Training Center.</span> <span id="s397">In 1939 I was a Lieutenant Commander in the Polish Navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Could I ask you how many languages you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: I speak Polish, naturally.</span> <span id="s400">I also speak English.</span> <span id="s401">If I am socially with people, who speak French, I speak French.</span> <span id="s402">I also read German and Russian technical books.</span> <span id="s403">I recently discovered that I remember more German than I thought I did.</span> <span id="s404">I have a pen pal in Germany.</span> <span id="s405">He writes to me in German and I write to him in English.</span> <span id="s406">We understand each other.</span> <span id="s407">He uses a dictionary and I use a dictionary.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: When you graduated, in 1931, the Germans and particularly Hitler, who had spent some time in prison, were basically moving out with their program.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Hitler came to power in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Right!</span> <span id="s411">He had been in prison.</span> <span id="s412">Wasn’t that in 1926 or 28 that he had been in prison?</span> <span id="s413">(The attempted coup, in Munich, took place Nov 8, 1923 and he was arrested on Nov 12, 1923).</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I think that he was in prison when he wrote “Mein Kampf” -- “His Fight.”</span> <span id="s415">(Hitler dictated that book, the synopsis of what he planned to accomplish with the thousand year Reich to Rudolf Hess before his release from prison in Dec 1924).</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Were the Polish people, particularly you as a young intellectual aware of what was taking place in Germany at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Were you aware of Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yes, but you know this Polish wishful thinking?</span> <span id="s420">Public opinion was divided.</span> <span id="s421">Some people thought that the final attack of Hitler on Poland is unavoidable.</span> <span id="s422">Some other people thought; “No!</span> <span id="s423">We will go against Russia together.</span> <span id="s424">He won’t do anything to us.”</span> <span id="s425">As time went on the first group was increasing at the expense of the second.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Then you were well aware of what was taking place in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s428">What I didn’t know was how strong they were.</span> <span id="s429">I thought that we were a lot stronger than we really were.</span> <span id="s430">If we use the word “If, If, If’ clause again, talking about historical events, the weather during Sept 1939 was the kind of weather the people who go on vacation pray for.</span> <span id="s431">There was not a drop of rain.</span> <span id="s432">The moment the war with Poland, that September was finished, it started to rain.</span> <span id="s433">If that rain had come at the beginning of September the German tanks would have been stopped in the mud, and who knows?</span> <span id="s434">However, you can always say “If” and “Who knows?”</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: What happened to you after that?</span> <span id="s436">I know that you talked about being transferred to the Navy permanently about 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: In 1933!</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: By 1933 Hitler had come to power in Germany (on Jan 30, 1933 Hitler was voted in as Chancellor by the Reichstag and, on Mar 23, 1933, he was granted dictatorial powers) and you were a young naval officer.</span> <span id="s439">During the period where Hitler was gaining power, in the 1933 through 38 period, what was taking place in Poland and how did it affect you?</span> <span id="s440">In other words, while this was going on, what was Poland doing and what were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Poland had a non-aggression pact with the Russians and a non-aggression pact wit the Germans.</span> <span id="s442">We trusted these pacts; but before 11939, I believe in 1937, but I don’t remember the exact date, the Polish navy got some more ships, some smaller units, which had been built in England.</span> <span id="s443">I remember those destroyers being welcomed in Gdynia, but that wasn’t enough.</span> <span id="s444">The navy’s objective, during the war was to defend the coast.</span> <span id="s445">My mobilization assignment was to be Associate Signal Chief of the coastal defenses.</span> <span id="s446">That is how I became a prisoner of war on Sept 19, 1939.</span> <span id="s447">That was when they caught me.</span> <span id="s448">They made me come out of a hole in the ground.</span> <span id="s449">I must say that I was taken as a prisoner of war by the Wehrmacht(the German armed forces).</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: We won’t get into that yet!</span> <span id="s451">I want to cover a little more of this period before we go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Until the last moment we were proceeding with our work as usual.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: What was taking place?</span> <span id="s454">Were you aware of what was taking place with the Jewish population of Poland during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: The Jews who had money and had sense were emigrating from Poland.</span> <span id="s456">Many of them stayed.</span> <span id="s457">Their families, the families of some of them had lived in Poland for 600 years.</span> <span id="s458">The great influx of Jews to Poland was in the 14th Century.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: When you say influx, did they come from a particular area?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: From Germany!</span> <span id="s461">Most of them came from Germany, because they had been persecuted.</span> <span id="s462">I just read a book recently and I am trying to buy that book but it is out of print, with the title “Thy Brother’s Blood” and the subtitle is “Christian Roots of Anti-Semitism.”</span> <span id="s463">The book is written by Malcolm Hay (the spelling may be wrong) who is a Catholic, a Scottish aristocrat.</span> <span id="s464">I read that book and, from it, I learned things which I had never heard of; that there was always some kind of dislike of the Jews.</span> <span id="s465">That was both here and there.</span> <span id="s466">Some people have Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s467">They like them but dislike the other Jews.</span> <span id="s468">So this Polish anti-Semitism was probably the least virulent compared to other anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: How did it manifest itself?</span> <span id="s470">You said that it was the least virulent.</span> <span id="s471">How did it manifest itself, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: In Poland proper there were no pogroms (that ignores the Lodz pogroms of June 5-6, 1905, and the show trials in Warsaw in Feb 1930, amongst others, which are documented).</span> <span id="s473">There were pogroms in the Ukraine, including in the Polish part of the Ukraine and in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s474">The word “Pogrom” is a generally Slavic word, common to the Polish, Russian and Ukrainian languages.</span> <span id="s475">Polish nobility, landed gentry, employed Jews as administrators of their estates.</span> <span id="s476">When you asked somebody in Poland, “You don’t like Jews, do you?”</span> <span id="s477">they will answer “No, they are different!”</span> <span id="s478">So, this is a general human trait that if somebody is different from you, the first reaction you have is that you don’t like these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Were they able to practice their religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: The Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s483">They had synagogues.</span> <span id="s484">The Jewish religion was taught in the schools in Poland, as I already told you.</span> <span id="s485">Whereas there were isolated cases of anti-Semitism and the dislike of Jews, generally speaking, there was no, at least by comparison with what was happening elsewhere, Polish-anti-Semitism, in my opinion.</span> <span id="s486">There were people who had Polish names which were obviously dating from some three or four hundred years earlier, of Jewish ancestry.</span> <span id="s487">That was in Poland, before the partitions of the 19th Century.</span> <span id="s488">In the pre-partition Poland there was a law, if I remember, that if a Jew was baptized, i.e. accepted Christianity, he was admitted by one noble family and given a coat of arms, he became a nobleman.</span> <span id="s489">He was given land and he could serve in the armed forces.</span> <span id="s490">You could tell the descendents of these people only because the names went something like: Shezan, Sherz, Shezanovsky, since Shez means Cross in Poland.</span> <span id="s491">So if there was a name with this term Cross in it then you could say; “Well, perhaps some ancestor took advantage of this very good offer.”</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So that really meant that they had to renounce their own religion and religious background.</span> <span id="s493">Their names were apparently changed to include the term for “Cross.”</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yes, but there were other things as well.</span> <span id="s495">In the history books, that is in the history which was taught when I was in Poland, there is a character: Barakio Joslevitz (not certain about the spelling) who was a provider for a large Polish detachment during one of the Polish uprisings.</span> <span id="s496">There was a Jewish assimilation in the Polish society, at least to some degree.</span> <span id="s497">However, even apart from that, within Jewish society, itself, there was a cultural explosion.</span> <span id="s498">I think that it was in the 19th Century, in the eastern part of Poland, they had kind of a good period for the development of Jewish culture.</span> <span id="s499">I got this from the “Book of Jewish Knowledge” (that was the time when Hassidim was developed) which I bought.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: When you were in the military, did you serve, in the early and mid-thirties, with Jewish-Polish military men?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: In the Polish navy there were probably six or eight high- ranking Polish naval officers who were not even Christians.</span> <span id="s502">They were still Jews.</span> <span id="s503">I also remember that I attended a Jewish wedding once, It was of a colleague of mine from high school.</span> <span id="s504">He was getting married young.</span> <span id="s505">At that wedding I wore my gala uniform, complete with the lovely belt and trousers with all kind of fancy stuff.</span> <span id="s506">I was a lieutenant at the time.</span> <span id="s507">Then I saw, amongst the guests, an officer from the Polish cavalry.</span> <span id="s508">The Polish cavalry was the most aristocratic of the Polish armed services because of the old tradition of cavalry in Polish history.</span> <span id="s509">They were very specific as to who they would serve with, as, for instance, if your family did not remember King John V Soviesky, or such, then you were not one of them.</span> <span id="s510">Anyway there was that cavalry officer in attendance.</span> <span id="s511">He must have been a captain.</span> <span id="s512">He must have been a Jew, a relative of the family, since he was there.</span> <span id="s513">So we were the only two military people at that wedding.</span> <span id="s514">There was a general who was a Jew, not a Christian.</span> <span id="s515">That was Gen. Mona.</span> <span id="s516">I even remember some of the names.</span> <span id="s517">He was Commandant of the Cracow Military district.</span> <span id="s518">He was an old soldier from Marshal Pilsudski’s early times, when they had the Polish Legion in the Austro-Hungarian army.</span> <span id="s519">He was one of the boys!</span> <span id="s520">The reason why I don’t remember too much of that is that “Who the hell cares!”</span> <span id="s521">People don’t remember things unless they come and contrast against a background which is different.</span> <span id="s522">They just didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: In your background it apparently didn’t.</span> <span id="s524">The noticeable segregation on the part of the Jewish community, despite the fact that they got along, was that a self imposed segregation, by living in the Jewish community, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: No.</span> <span id="s526">From the book which I just read and about which I was talking it seems that the ghetto, in Europe, was a legal arrangement by the governments of these countries to limit, as much as possible, the relations, the intercourse between the Jewish people and the population, in order to save the population from the Jewish influence (The World Book Encyclopedia states: The compulsory ghetto died out with the intellectual and social movements of the Renaissance…” That is what is written in that book, however there was no restriction in Poland which required the Jews to live in a ghetto; however in the Jewish law, this is in the old testament, I don’t know exactly where it is, I would have to ask my son to find that place, the Jews are forbidden to travel a distance greater than a specified distance on the Sabbath, so naturally they had to be not far from the synagogue, or else they could not go to the synagogue on the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s527">This meant that where there is a synagogue, Jews cluster around it.</span> <span id="s528">That was a practical thing.</span> <span id="s529">Besides that, it was a human thing.</span> <span id="s530">I suppose that this is my own explanation, that they like to live together like Poles like to live in the Polish community near Detroit, in Hamtrack(just northeast of downtown Detroit).</span> <span id="s531">I don’t know where it is in Dayton, but there is a Polish grouping not far from St. Adalbert Church on Valley St. People cluster around it.</span> <span id="s532">However they drive so they don’t have the same problem which the Jews have with the Sabbath walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: That is very interesting.</span> <span id="s534">Now let us get to the point where the Nazis have taken power in Germany and you were apparently aware of that and of what was going on.</span> <span id="s535">They were gathering Jews at that stage.</span> <span id="s536">We are talking about the latter part of the thirtieth.</span> <span id="s537">At one point they basically drove them (actually the Nazis selected the Jews of Polish descent for that) to the Polish border and dumped them off, are you familiar with that?</span> <span id="s538">The Polish government did not necessarily participate.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: I don’t know anything about that, but it could be.</span> <span id="s540">I never heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: They were more or less herded together and dropped at the Polish border because, I believe, they were Jewish people of Polish descent who were in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: That might have been some isolated incident.</span> <span id="s543">I don’t remember reading about it in this book, and they write about everything that even is borderline between anti-Semitism and history.</span> <span id="s544">They probably would have written about it, but who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: They were forcibly deporting them to Poland, just before the Germans invaded.</span> <span id="s546">OK, so the next point we should get into is that of Poland and Germany, at the time Germany was invading Poland.</span> <span id="s547">At that time you were in the military.</span> <span id="s548">How did this manifest itself as far as what was happening with your life, when the Germans started invading Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: I was in the place where the first German bombs fell, in Gdynia.</span> <span id="s550">There were many places in the world where they did not know it, but I knew it, however I thought that there is an army group, under the commanding general, and they will show them where to go.</span> <span id="s551">There was a great patriotic fervor.</span> <span id="s552">Of course we believed that the British and the French, who had signed a treaty with Poland, that they would assist us, would help.</span> <span id="s553">I remember the words when we were gathered together by the Germans, as prisoners of war, by our commanding officer, who by the way was given by the German unit who caught us, as a sign of respect, a chivalrous gesture, that he could carry his saber.</span> <span id="s554">We were captured by a Bavarian regiment and they honored our worth as soldiers, for these 19 days of battle.</span> <span id="s555">They gave our commanding officer the right to carry his saber.</span> <span id="s556">Of course when he got into a camp they took the saber away from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Do you recall the date of the first bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: During the early morning of Sept 1, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: You said that the battle lasted for 19 days, before you, personally, were captured?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s561">19 days was the time during which Polish coastal defenses fought on in Gdynia and in the complex around Gdynia.</span> <span id="s562">However that was not the entire coastal defense because north of Gdynia there is a small peninsula.</span> <span id="s563">There were some artillery encampments and detachments and they fought on for, I believe another ten days before they finally had to surrender.</span> <span id="s564">The fire against them was from a German battleship and from smaller German navy units, from the Luftwaffe (the German air force) and the ground forces.</span> <span id="s565">How long can you take it?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Can you recall exactly where you were?</span> <span id="s567">You said that it was early in the morning of Sept 1.</span> <span id="s568">Can you go into a little detail about the situation, as it was during these 19 days?</span> <span id="s569">What was taking place, realizing that you had been bombed?</span> <span id="s570">What is happening to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: I suppose that what was happening to me is the same thing which happens during a war, during combat, to any person wearing a uniform and has a weapon in his hand.</span> <span id="s572">You don’t have time to think about historical developments, political developments, you just do your job.</span> <span id="s573">The first of September I was still in the Technical training Center where I was head of the signal department.</span> <span id="s574">Then I went to my mobilization assignment as Deputy-Chief.</span> <span id="s575">I was second in command, of signals in the Coastal Defense Command.</span> <span id="s576">Then my job was just to make sure that there is liaison, a communication channel between us and Warsaw.</span> <span id="s577">There was an underground cable which was never destroyed during that war by the Germans.</span> <span id="s578">We had communications all the time with the Chief of the Admiralty, in Warsaw, and the Polish General Staff.</span> <span id="s579">So I was just doing the thing I had been assigned to do, working on the communications such as; “This line is broken, so you put the radio here and built another line over there!”</span> <span id="s580">The usual thing which is concern to the Signal Officer.</span> <span id="s581">That was a land assignment.</span> <span id="s582">(Warsaw surrendered Sept 27, 1939).</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Were the casualties great as a result of this initial attack?</span> <span id="s584">How were you holding out as a Polish defense unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: There were several battalions of infantry, some units of artillery, and I believe two airplanes, which were shot down by the Germans early on the second day, if I remember.</span> <span id="s586">They had a regiment, a Bavarian regiment, tremendous artillery, many times bigger than ours, and they had the air force, the Luftwaffe, and the German navy.</span> <span id="s587">They had this battleship, I forget the name if it.</span> <span id="s588">It is a funny thing how the unpleasant things fade away, in one way or the other; you remember only the funny ones.</span> <span id="s589">The first political analysis of the things started when the commanding officer, where we were, gathered the officers together after we had been taken prisoners and said, “Well, we did our job, we were fighting alone.”</span> <span id="s590">By that he meant that the British didn’t help.</span> <span id="s591">They couldn’t, they were disarmed!</span> <span id="s592">The French thought that just by having the Maginot Line (that was the French fortifications facing Germany from Luxembourg down to Switzerland which were bypassed by the Germans in May 1940) they were safe.</span> <span id="s593">Often repeated in different historical backgrounds, one of the most stupid things which can happen to any government, was for the direction of the armed forces, not to take into account the experiences of other armed forces, of other nations, with the same enemy.</span> <span id="s594">The Polish people who, after the September war was finished, escaped through sometimes very complicated means to France, they told the French government about it.</span> <span id="s595">The French didn’t take it into account; they said; “France fights well every second war!”</span> <span id="s596">So they won WWI and they were going to win WWII.</span> <span id="s597">They had more air force and more tanks than the Germans had.</span> <span id="s598">But nothing!</span> <span id="s599">They didn’t realize that the people who don’t want to fight put themselves in the situation in which they have no choice; either fight their enemy far away from their own country, because the beginning is always outside of your country, since the assailant comes from outside your country, so, if you fight when he is still in his own backyard, that is better than when you have to fight him in your own backyard, which is the other alternative.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: I think that this is probably a good place to stop the interview and we will continue next time.</span> <span id="s601">Then we will go into the period where you get captured and your life as a POW (Prisoner of War).</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: As you wish.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: The date is July 8, 1981.</span> <span id="s604">It is 10.10 AM.</span> <span id="s605">I am in the home of DR. Jerzy Lubelfeld to continue our discussion on the Holocaust Project.</span> <span id="s606">As we ended last time I said that, this time we would start with your capture by the Germans.</span> <span id="s607">I was just wondering if you could recall in as much detail as possible the events which took place after your capture as a Polish POW of the German army.</span> <span id="s608">Just go into that experience, if you please.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: I don’t think that this is anything specially unique.</span> <span id="s610">We fought for 19 days on the shore in Gdynia.</span> <span id="s611">We were facing tremendous German power.</span> <span id="s612">We were outgunned by every kind of weapon; by the Luftwaffe; there were, I believe a couple of battleships and some smaller units of the German navy.</span> <span id="s613">It took them 19 days to finish us off.</span> <span id="s614">So, on the 19th Sept, 1939 I came out of the hole in the ground and joined the other fellows.</span> <span id="s615">They put us together in one place, in a very gentlemanly fashion.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Had you been in a bunker of some kind?</span> <span id="s617">or did you dig a foxhole?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: No, it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s619">It was just a hole in the ground.</span> <span id="s620">It was not a previously prepared bunker.</span> <span id="s621">We knew that it wouldn’t last very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Were you alone in this particular hole?</span> <span id="s623">Had you found it by yourself or were you more than one person in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: It was a signal point.</span> <span id="s625">In the hole some technical communications were concentrated.</span> <span id="s626">There were a telephone and a radio station (probably a transmitter and a receiver) and so on.</span> <span id="s627">In that particular place we did not surrender, we were just taken.</span> <span id="s628">In some other places, when the Polish commander saw, that further resistance was useless they would surrender.</span> <span id="s629">We had a stubborn commanding officer.</span> <span id="s630">When the Bavaria regiment took us prisoner, they expressed their appreciation of the knightly virtues and they let the commanding officer have his saber.</span> <span id="s631">Of course the reception committee took away that saber.</span> <span id="s632">It was a nice gesture.</span> <span id="s633">Also the German chaplain of that particular regiment helped our chaplain in the execution of his duties.</span> <span id="s634">So, in the beginning it was not so bad, at least not until we were gathered in the railroad station.</span> <span id="s635">The German train arrived and we were to go to the camp with that train.</span> <span id="s636">The first negative note came when the railroad engineer, in the locomotive, looking at us, spat and said “Schweinhunde” (an insult in German literally meaning “Pig-dogs” or “Filthy Pigs”).</span> <span id="s637">It means literally Swine-dogs.</span> <span id="s638">Of course I imagine that the scientist who, in practice, would develop such a highbred animal would get a Nobel Prize for it.</span> <span id="s639">Anyway, it was just an ordinary thing, typical of wars, with certain small differences.</span> <span id="s640">The German administration of the camp had to obey the Gestapo (Geheime Staats Polizei or Secrete state Police) and the SS (Schutz Staffel, the black shirted elite guard of the Nazis).</span> <span id="s641">They tried to make the whole thing according to the Geneva Convention.</span> <span id="s642">Of which the Germans were signatores.</span> <span id="s643">However sometimes they had to obey the Gestapo and the SS.</span> <span id="s644">For example, one day, all of a sudden there was an unexpected roll call, in one of the camps where I was.</span> <span id="s645">The Germans said; “All these actors who play in the prisoner’s theater” we had organized a theater by the prisoners amongst other things “as well as lecturers who lectured at the camp university should step forward.”</span> <span id="s646">We had organized such a university as well, but I will explain later.</span> <span id="s647">Then they proceeded to read the names of some faculty people, and I was amongst them, as were some staff officers, who were known to us, and obviously to the Germans and whom helped keeping up the morale of the prisoners up.</span> <span id="s648">The Germans who did not like that, which was a sign of their stupidity, since the higher the morale the better, since that makes it easier to administer the camp.</span> <span id="s649">Then they read the names of the Jews that means those who had obeyed the German’s order and had admitted that they were Jews.</span> <span id="s650">They had asked us, the Polish officers whether they should admit that they were Jews.</span> <span id="s651">Our senior officer told them; “You are under the Geneva Convention!</span> <span id="s652">So all you have to do is to tell them your name, your number and your rank, but nothing else.</span> <span id="s653">They have no authority to ask you your religion, if any.”</span> <span id="s654">Some of them did admit their Jewish origin and that they were Jews.</span> <span id="s655">So about 400 of us were gathered together, put on a train and taken to another camp.</span> <span id="s656">This camp was in Westfalen (the area of Germany which includes the Ruhr and Bonn).</span> <span id="s657">Here comes a little philosophical excursion outside of our topic.</span> <span id="s658">Very often, in human life, something happens and we think that the world is ending, that everything, including God, is against us, that a terrible thing is happening to us, then after a year or two, three or four, by comparing our feelings of that time to the actual historical events which have taken place you see that it was a blessing.</span> <span id="s659">In this case, for example, this transfer to another camp resulted, later, in 1945, in that the Germans didn’t have the time to evacuate us and to push us east.</span> <span id="s660">Therefore we were liberated, not by the Russians but by the Americans.</span> <span id="s661">However “If’ and you can insert many of these “If” sequences, but it may have been such an “If” clause here which may have sent us into Euphoria and wind up tantamount to hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: We are now coming to the end of this tape.</span> <span id="s663">Let us stop at this point and continue on another tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">This is the continuation of the second part of an interview with Dr. Lubelfeld.</span> <span id="s665">I like to continue by asking you a question: first of all do you recall the name of the prison camp to which you were assigned?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s667">The first camp was Prenslau, not far from Stettin (today this is the Polish city of Szczecin) which is a harbor at the estuary of the Oder River.</span> <span id="s668">This is now part of Poland.</span> <span id="s669">The second camp was in Neu Brandenburg, not far from Prenslau, in the same general region.</span> <span id="s670">The third and last camp was in Dessen near Farburg in the eastern corner of Westfalen (transcriber could not locate these towns).</span> <span id="s671">I do not know if this is of interest to you or not, but I have found a German historian, or rather, he found me, and we have been corresponding for several years now.</span> <span id="s672">He is working on German prison camps during the war.</span> <span id="s673">That is his area.</span> <span id="s674">He sends me all kind of literature.</span> <span id="s675">He sent me photographs of his last camp.</span> <span id="s676">In this last camp, one night in the fall, a British bomber, which had been hit in a raid, discarded useless weight and, in the process, dropped two bombs in our camp.</span> <span id="s677">More than 90 officers were killed and about 200 were wounded.</span> <span id="s678">The German priest, in that village, was most helpful, not only during the remaining part of the war with hospital services and funerals but he kept the entire cemetery in perfect order.</span> <span id="s679">He also maintains correspondence with a club or an association of former POW from that camp.</span> <span id="s680">These former prisoners are located in Poland, of course.</span> <span id="s681">The son of this lady, the lady lives in Warsaw, was one of the victims of that bombing.</span> <span id="s682">This priest sent her a picture of the tombstone, the grave and the flowers.</span> <span id="s683">He takes care of all these things for this, amongst other graves.</span> <span id="s684">This lady could not travel, so she did a very good thing and wrote about it to that priest.</span> <span id="s685">I know about it because a friend of mine sent me a copy of that letter.</span> <span id="s686">This lady has found and takes care of the graves of several German soldiers located not far from the place where she lives.</span> <span id="s687">Of course everything, between the Caucasus and Berlin, is covered with German graves.</span> <span id="s688">Nobody has been taking care of these graves, except for people like this lady.</span> <span id="s689">Of course soldiers are soldiers and they carry out orders.</span> <span id="s690">Of course the German soldiers, with their accuracy, exaggerated somewhat.</span> <span id="s691">This example shows that a good thing very often brings, from the other side.</span> <span id="s692">Something good as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: I would like to ask you one question about that incident, then I would like to go back and ask you something else, entirely.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: I am sorry, but when we start something on this, the conversation opens up.</span> <span id="s695">After all this is a great event on the historical scale.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: That is right!</span> <span id="s697">That is what this is all about.</span> <span id="s698">I want to record what your feelings are about this and you are to express your thoughts.</span> <span id="s699">I want to ask you though, in regards to this particular incident; they were apparently able to document the fact that it was a British plane and that it was an unintentional bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: that must have been investigated by, I would think, the Polish government.</span> <span id="s701">(During most of the war there were two Polish governments, one in England, which included several pre WWII cabinet ministers; and one located in Russia, which included military officers and members of the pre WWII Communist party).</span> <span id="s702">That was so because, under the Communist-Russian inspiration, they would like to blame anything on their former allies, if they could.</span> <span id="s703">I don’t have any details as to how that was discovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Let’s go back then and start over with the first of the camps in which you were.</span> <span id="s705">I would like to know, first of all, was it an international camp, or was it a camp for Polish prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: It was uniquely a camp for Polish officers who were captured in the war.</span> <span id="s707">We had some transients of other nationalities.</span> <span id="s708">These were POWs passing through and staying in the camp for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s709">Some were British, some Yugoslavs.</span> <span id="s710">(That appears highly unlikely, due to the timing suggested by JL.</span> <span id="s711">Belgium entered the war on May 10, 1940 and Yugoslavia on Mar 27, 1941, by then he had changed camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: How many were there in there, do you recall how big a camp it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: If I remember correctly, it contained between two and four thousand but I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Can you give us an idea of the average daily routine, of what you were entitled and expected to do.</span> <span id="s715">How did your day go?</span> <span id="s716">How did you pass the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: As far as the Wehrmacht was concerned everything went according to the Geneva Convention.</span> <span id="s718">They really tried to observe it!</span> <span id="s719">Of course there were some psychopath amongst the guards, some sadists.</span> <span id="s720">You see the Polish armed forces, during WWI were nonexistent as such, however there were those Polish Legions who fought on the side of the Central Powers -- i.e. the Austrian-Germans -- or on the side of the Russians under Marshal Pilsudski.</span> <span id="s721">For that reason the Polish armed forces included certain things which could be equated to the Germans, in such things as military rules.</span> <span id="s722">There was no history if war with Germany and the German empire for a thousand years.</span> <span id="s723">The last time in history when there were some wars between Poland and Germany was at the beginning of the eleventh century, however there were the Teutonic knights who were a German military order and, with them, there were fights during several hundred of years.</span> <span id="s724">Finally the war with the Teutonic Knights ended in 1410, when there was a great battle during which the knights had their power broken.</span> <span id="s725">Then it took almost another hundred years to wipe out the Teutonic Order, however their spirit was not wiped out.</span> <span id="s726">I believe that in 1525 the last former Master of the Teutonic Order , who happened to be a nephew of the Polish king accepted the Lutheran faith and became a lay prince.</span> <span id="s727">According to the feudal customs and laws he came to Cracow and paid homage to his uncle, the Polish king.</span> <span id="s728">The name of this latest Master of the Teutonic Order was Albert von Hohenzolern, who turned out to be the founder of the famous house of Hohenzolern (that is the house to which the kings of Prussia belonged).</span> <span id="s729">So the Polish people really had a bad feeling against the Germans who became the substitute of the Teutonic Knights.</span> <span id="s730">The cultural, economic and other relations with the Germans were good.</span> <span id="s731">After the invasion from the Mongols of Russia and Poland and other parts of Europe had depopulated Polish towns they were repopulated again by invitations which the Polish kings addressed to the Germans and others.</span> <span id="s732">Many Germans came to Poland.</span> <span id="s733">That is why you see, in Poland, many Poles with German names.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: You believe apparently that there was a great assimilation between German and polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Until the partition of Poland at the end of the 18th century it was a yes and no relationship.</span> <span id="s736">For example the Prussians, the heirs of the Teutonic Order, were on the side of the Swedes when the Swedes invaded Poland, in the middle of the 17th century.</span> <span id="s737">There are good books on the subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: You didn’t really answer my question which concerned itself with the routine of camp life.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Considering everything, it wasn’t too bad.</span> <span id="s740">We were a little envious when we compared our conditions with the POW camps of Americans and the British on German POW.</span> <span id="s741">With us it was just the lowest level of the Geneva Convention.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: You were discussing the routines in camp.</span> <span id="s743">What type of things did you do during the day?</span> <span id="s744">Did you have to answer roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: I will tell you what was available.</span> <span id="s746">Things which we had to do was to attend the roll call.</span> <span id="s747">There were three a day; the morning, the mid-day and the night calls.</span> <span id="s748">We had sports, we had a library which was well provided with books which the Germans had appropriated in those western territories of Poland which they incorporated “for ever,” as they thought, into Germany.</span> <span id="s749">There were books from Polish libraries.</span> <span id="s750">We had the priceless “Camp University.”</span> <span id="s751">We had it just because there were a number of academic teachers amongst the prisoners in the camp.</span> <span id="s752">Then according to the practice of Polish schools it was a natural thing to organize a “Camp University.”</span> <span id="s753">The Germans loved the idea because they thought that this would keep the minds of the prisoners concentrated on things other than escape.</span> <span id="s754">They hated escapes because it would throw a bad light on the commandant of the camp.</span> <span id="s755">There were escapes, of course, I taught at the Camp University until the Germans forbade teaching electronics.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Why did they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: They said that we were making a transmitter and receiver out of the things which they gave us.</span> <span id="s758">They thought that we would be able to communicate with Churchill (British Prime Minister from May 10, 1940 through July 1945) or something like that.</span> <span id="s759">There was another victory of order, strict German order, over common sense; they forbade teaching of the German language.</span> <span id="s760">That was because they thought that, if we learn German, it would be easier for us to escape.</span> <span id="s761">From all the escapes which I know about, the most successful, the most brilliant, was by a guy who did not speak a word of German.</span> <span id="s762">Because he couldn’t communicate with civilians, he avoided them.</span> <span id="s763">That was a contribution to his successful escape.</span> <span id="s764">He escaped to Yugoslavia in the fall of 1939 and, for Christmas, he sent a Christmas card to the German commandant of the camp.</span> <span id="s765">He also mailed one to the Polish senior officer in the camp and to the guys in his barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: How did they get through the censors?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Escapes were possible because some of the people were traveling outside of the wire fence for certain things.</span> <span id="s768">Not all the services were located within the barbed wire, some of them were outside.</span> <span id="s769">We managed!</span> <span id="s770">It is written in another book how they made their escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: How did the postcards get through the German censors?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Correspondence was according to the Geneva Convention.</span> <span id="s773">There were special form letters which were given.</span> <span id="s774">There was a specific number.</span> <span id="s775">I believe some which we could send anywheres we wanted, others were restricted to specific recipients.</span> <span id="s776">Of course they were censored!</span> <span id="s777">We knew what we shouldn’t write and we knew how we could put between the lines what we wanted to say without them getting wise to it.</span> <span id="s778">Our families wrote to us on ordinary stationery.</span> <span id="s779">They were censored as well.</span> <span id="s780">We knew how to get the messages we wanted through the censors.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Were you ever personally involved in an escape attempt?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Was there a reason for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s785">It was because I didn’t really believe that the war was going to last that long.</span> <span id="s786">I thought that I was naïve and silly.</span> <span id="s787">I did think that in 1940 this powerful, mighty French army -- the French had more tanks and airplanes than the Germans, as well as artillery and everything -- would squash Germany like nothing.</span> <span id="s788">They were missing one component for any military action to be successful; they didn’t have the will to fight.</span> <span id="s789">They just didn’t want to fight!</span> <span id="s790">I truly thought that they would.</span> <span id="s791">I was even making bets with my friends in camp that in the summer of 1940, we would be free.</span> <span id="s792">In the summer of 1940, France was conquered!</span> <span id="s793">We didn’t know that the British were disarmed.</span> <span id="s794">Churchill was a blessing for Britain, but he was a little late blessing.</span> <span id="s795">They called him a warmonger!</span> <span id="s796">The Germans word for that is “Kriegshetzer.”</span> <span id="s797">Then it became a risky attempt to escape.</span> <span id="s798">The Germans announced that any Polish POW who would be caught outside of a camp would be considered a spy and that he would be shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s799">From the escapes, which I know of, half of all these who were caught were actually executed.</span> <span id="s800">I considered all these things together and I had a feeling against doing it.</span> <span id="s801">I didn’t really believe that my contribution to the war was worth the risk.</span> <span id="s802">Maybe I was scared, which is a normal thing which military people have to live with, but my feelings were not uncontrolled, so I don’t worry about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Were there any apparent cruelties which were carried out in the camps toward the POWs?</span> <span id="s804">Were the Germans mean to the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: I haven’t seen anything like that.</span> <span id="s806">I heard of some trigger- happy guards shooting somebody who came too close to the wire, but I didn’t see anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: How about the food?</span> <span id="s808">were you adequately fed?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: We didn’t get enough food!</span> <span id="s810">If it hadn’t been for the food parcels from our friends and families in Poland and our comrades-at-arms in England and of the people whom we knew in the world were sending food parcels to us, as well as to the International Red Cross, which gave us American Red Cross parcels, I doubt if anybody would have survived.</span> <span id="s811">The food which the Germans provided us with was just water and rutabaga, and, of course, small portions of everything.</span> <span id="s812">However, even that paucity of nourishment had its good side, at least personally for me.</span> <span id="s813">Before the war I walked like Napoleon Bonaparte with my hand on my stomach, here.</span> <span id="s814">I had hyper-acidity.</span> <span id="s815">I was on the road to ulcers.</span> <span id="s816">Three months in prison camp cured me of that and it has never returned.</span> <span id="s817">Al, I had to do to cure myself was to be hungry, and I was hungry for several months .</span> <span id="s818">so that cured me and even had some good points.</span> <span id="s819">As the time goes on, all these small unpleasantnesses, including the lack of freedom, one feels that one has the right to freedom, get out of focus.</span> <span id="s820">After five or six months of imprisonment you ask yourself: “What do you want to be free for?”</span> <span id="s821">and “What can I do with freedom?”</span> <span id="s822">you wonder, at the same time what you did with your freedom before the war and whether you are sure that it was something you can be proud of.</span> <span id="s823">There were things available which I would say led to spiritual improvement, in retrospect.</span> <span id="s824">As everything else in the world, it had its price.</span> <span id="s825">The price of that spiritual improvement was the blasted nuisance of being a POW.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Were you ever, or did you know of prisoners who were ever interrogated by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s828">Everybody with a German name was.</span> <span id="s829">Actually, I don’t know whether everybody was or not.</span> <span id="s830">Many of us who had German names were interviewed.</span> <span id="s831">They were propositioned, and I use the word advisedly, to declare themselves as “Folksdeutscher,” otherwise said of German ancestry with the reward for it being that you would be put into a separate part of the camp and get good German food in abundance.</span> <span id="s832">Later you were going to be put into the German armed forces, get to wear a German uniform and to swear allegiance to the Fuhrer (i.e. to Hitler).</span> <span id="s833">Then you would go to fight for the thousand-year German Reich and for the glory of Europe with the Russians (Germany and Russia were allies from the invasion of Poland on until the invasion of Russia in June 1941).</span> <span id="s834">When my turn came the fellow who interrogated me was a German staff sergeant.</span> <span id="s835">He said that he had a degree in sociology from a German University.</span> <span id="s836">He tried to convince me that I should do this.</span> <span id="s837">I said: “No!”</span> <span id="s838">he said: “Why?”</span> <span id="s839">Then I started telling him what would happen, and I was a prophet!</span> <span id="s840">I told him that very soon -- and that was before they attacked Russia so he could not know that --he couldn’t use that argument any longer because the Russians had their allies at that time -- so I told him that either the Russians would jump on them, or they would jump on the Russians.</span> <span id="s841">He didn’t believe me, but I think that I was very close to converting him.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Was anyone convinced to go over to the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Maybe, of those two or three thousand people in the camp, if there were one or two officers who were converted, at least temporarily, that was all.</span> <span id="s844">I don’t know of one single fellow POW, of mine, who would not believe that in spite of all the victories which the Germans had had then, they would be defeated.</span> <span id="s845">We had this feeling Lord knows where it came from, this irrational conviction, that they would be defeated.</span> <span id="s846">Of course it was irrational, because the Germans were very closer to winning the war.</span> <span id="s847">If Hitler had not been so stupid they would have won the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Were you ever bothered by the possibility that someone in the camp may have been German, or placed there by the Germans, as you see so often in the stories, as a plant of any kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A; No!</span> <span id="s850">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: You never had a problem that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: The utility of such a plan would be only one; that he could find the people who were planning to escape.</span> <span id="s853">This was so because the Germans knew that they would not find anybody in the camp who didn’t believe that they would lose the war, so they didn’t need any plant to find that out.</span> <span id="s854">so, the only thing a plant could find out was who was planning to escape; however, if the plans were made truly methodically even those who shared the room with the planners didn’t know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Now, you were actually in three separate camps.</span> <span id="s856">Was there any distinguishing feature about each camp which made one very different from the others?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: The differences between the first camp and the second were insignificant.</span> <span id="s858">Practically there was no difference between them.</span> <span id="s859">The third camp was slightly different in one way, in its composition.</span> <span id="s860">A large number of senior Polish officers, many of the retired or reserve, when they saw what was happening, they escaped from Poland to Romania.</span> <span id="s861">(Romania first lost a province to the Russians through the German-Russian treaty of 1939 and then was awarded that province plus a major portion of the Ukraine by the Germans, as the Russians retreated).</span> <span id="s862">They, according to international law, were put into internment camps by the Romanians, and, when the Germans occupied Romania, the Germans forced the Romanians to give up all these Polish old folks.</span> <span id="s863">I call them that since most of these Polish people had an average age between fifty and sixty, and up.</span> <span id="s864">They were waiting for us in that third camp (this means that it wasn’t until after June 1941 that JL and his fellows reached that third camp) in Westphalia, when we arrived there.</span> <span id="s865">They actually were the first battalion and we, the youngsters -- even I was a youngster at that time -- formed the second battalion.</span> <span id="s866">So there was this difference of the ages between the two.</span> <span id="s867">Half of the camp were old people, many of them pessimistic, but quietly so, the others were the youngsters who were doing all kind of things.</span> <span id="s868">I think that these were good things which they were doing for themselves and for their country.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: As far as the camp was concerned what was the reason for you, or for your group of people to be transferred from one camp to the other and then to the final third camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: In Prenslau we were in a camp which was located in Germany army buildings.</span> <span id="s871">There were not just huts, they were true buildings, some “Kaserns” (these were the typical three or four story brick buildings used for permanent camps since the late 19th century).</span> <span id="s872">This was a place where the German army normally was stationed.</span> <span id="s873">After a while they needed this camp for the second wave of German soldiers, which they started to train.</span> <span id="s874">They needed the space!</span> <span id="s875">So they transferred us to another camp which was located near Neu Brandenburg.</span> <span id="s876">This second camp was in big garages, also of the German army.</span> <span id="s877">After a while they needed that also and some of the Polish POWs were moved out into some provisional huts.</span> <span id="s878">I think that the last transfer, this is all speculations, because I don’t really know, was because they wanted to get rid of people who were bitching about thing, who were dissatisfied with everything and said so in a loud way.</span> <span id="s879">Actually none of the prisoners knew for certain, why these transfers were made.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: You mentioned, during our first interview, an incident into which I want you to go a little more in detail now; about the German anthropologist who visited one if the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s882">The German anthropologist asked for, and was given, by the German army, the opportunity to make some anthropological measurements of the Polish POWs.</span> <span id="s883">He wanted to see the ratio distribution of different anthropological types and other experiments (this was completely contrary to the Geneva Convention).</span> <span id="s884">It was a funny thing, when he examined me he decided that I was “Ostbaltisch”.</span> <span id="s885">That is coming from the east Baltic area.</span> <span id="s886">That reminded me of something which my father had told me long ago, about our relationship with the Estonians and Latvians and such.</span> <span id="s887">That was not important, but one thing which it would be worthwhile to mention is that, generally speaking, in my lifetime I will not consider these five and a half years during which I was a POW in a prison camp as a loss.</span> <span id="s888">By considering it altogether I think that the net value of that POW time was positive for me.</span> <span id="s889">Of course I don’t mean that it was of practical value, so that I could sell it, but that it was of value to me philosophically and spiritually.</span> <span id="s890">That of course does not mean that, if history could repeat itself I would volunteer to stay at a POW camp.</span> <span id="s891">If I did it would put me in a special class, that of those who are nuts.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Did you form any personal, long lasting relationships, while you were in any of these camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: I became very close friends with some of these people, but then we were physically separated.</span> <span id="s894">Most of them went back to Poland, after the liberation.</span> <span id="s895">Some went, as Displaced Persons (DP) to different countries.</span> <span id="s896">Sometimes I hear the names of people from the Polish navy.</span> <span id="s897">We still keep in touch.</span> <span id="s898">We have a Polish Naval Association, which is a worldwide organization with headquarters in London, England.</span> <span id="s899">We get a quarterly publication which gives information about people and events.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Can I ask you at what point, during these five years, when you were a POW, did you realize that things were not going well for the Germans?</span> <span id="s901">Did you realize that there was a turning of events so that, maybe, one could see the possible defeat of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s903">We had a whole group of strategists and practical analysts.</span> <span id="s904">We had some senior staff officers in the prison camp.</span> <span id="s905">They would give a lecture about conditions and about how they changed, what the situation was and so on.</span> <span id="s906">Besides that we could read from the German newspapers, we actually learned to read between the lines.</span> <span id="s907">In addition to that we had a secret radio, as a matter of fact, we had two in the last camp.</span> <span id="s908">So we listened to the BBC (British Broadcasting Service -- the BBC served as a prototype for the Voice of America -- the BBC broadcast into Nazi occupied Europe in various languages at regular times every day -- listening to it was a major offense).</span> <span id="s909">The first thought, which was an intellectual back up to the otherwise emotional feelings of the bias that the Germans just had to lose the war, because we wanted them to lose the war.</span> <span id="s910">The first rational thing to support that emotional thing was when the winter came in 1941 and they failed to take Moscow.</span> <span id="s911">When they were not able to take Moscow we knew that, no matter how long it would last, this was the end.</span> <span id="s912">There were some German officers who knew that also.</span> <span id="s913">The German commandant of one of these camps was a German general, the old Imperial German General type, with dignity, a gentleman.</span> <span id="s914">It just so happened that when that general, during WWI was a major or captain he had been together with one of our Polish colonels, who then was also a youngish officer.</span> <span id="s915">They had been friends in the German army.</span> <span id="s916">Quietly that Polish colonel was escorted to the prison commandant’s quarters.</span> <span id="s917">Probably the general would pretend to interrogate the colonel.</span> <span id="s918">They had a very good time together.</span> <span id="s919">Later the colonel would tell us that the general did not believe in a German victory.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Basically you were well informed as to events outside of camp!</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s922">We had the newspaper and we listened to the radio.</span> <span id="s923">We learned to read the German bulletins by reading between the lines.</span> <span id="s924">The fact that we knew that Russia -- and we have more than one thousand years of experience with the Russians -- would be hard to defeat helped.</span> <span id="s925">We had a feeling for all of these things, when they couldn’t take Moscow.</span> <span id="s926">Russia can be conquered only if the attacker goes along the meridians, because it is the meridians which divide different nationalities and ethnic parts.</span> <span id="s927">People who go on parallels into Russia will have the same fate as Napoleon and Hitler.</span> <span id="s928">Naturally there is no principle without exceptions, so, for example if the parallel attack by Hitler could have succeeded in getting Moscow; there was only one place east of Moscow where they could have regrouped and that was Kujbysev.</span> <span id="s929">However no one knows whether they could have recovered from that blow to their morale.</span> <span id="s930">Moscow was already evacuated (the city was actually only partially evacuated and Stalin and his lieutenants never left), the government left Moscow, so it was already the beginning of the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: It took five more years until it was really ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Some entities take long to die.</span> <span id="s933">This does not mean necessarily that they deserve that kind of a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Before we come to the part where you were liberated from these camps, is there anything which you would like to disclose about the details of the camp experience now, on tape, before I ask you questions about the liberation of the camps?</span> <span id="s935">Is there anything which you would like to say about the camps themselves, something which has not been included?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: I really believe that I made a summary by saying that the general experience which I had evaluated as being positive.</span> <span id="s937">That may however not be the opinion of other former POWs if you talk to them, especially if one, after the liberation had his life affected in a different way, not in the positive way, as it was with me.</span> <span id="s938">Another fellow might have another opinion and he may have different feelings.</span> <span id="s939">I don’t hate the Germans!</span> <span id="s940">I have not killed a single German in my life!</span> <span id="s941">I have some German friends here.</span> <span id="s942">They did terrible things in the Holocaust!</span> <span id="s943">Now, as I read more and more, I know how terrible the Holocaust was.</span> <span id="s944">I knew that even before I read the books.</span> <span id="s945">However I don’t believe that the Holocaust was the only Holocaust with the emphasis on the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Note: Here again some discontinuance is present as the tape goes from forward into reverse.</span> <span id="s947">Some portion of the interview appears to be missing, but it does not seem to be crucial.</span> <span id="s948">It cannot be helped!</span> <span id="s949">It appears that the interview resumes after the third POW camp had been broken up, while the Germans were in full retreat.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: We were trying to keep from being hungry, now that the German transportation system had been heavily damaged by Allied air raids.</span> <span id="s951">Now our food parcels did not come so often, so we went slowly.</span> <span id="s952">We came to a German village, I remember the name, called Borgentreisch, and the Germans put us into barns.</span> <span id="s953">That was a luxury situation we were not sleeping in these bunks, in these terrible beds, but in hay.</span> <span id="s954">At 8 o’clock they woke us up, however there was something unusual; we saw German officers of the camp crew loading the trucks and going away.</span> <span id="s955">The German guards, the German soldiers were fraternizing with the Polish prisoners.</span> <span id="s956">So we get out of the village and we see these soldiers giving their rifles to the POWs; so we see that this is the end.</span> <span id="s957">We see one of these reconnaissance planes, American planes, making the signal that there is a unit of SS (the black shirted Nazi elite guards.</span> <span id="s958">SS stands for Schutz Staffel or Protective Group.</span> <span id="s959">They provided the guards for the extermination camps and similar duties).</span> <span id="s960">ahead who are trying to put up some resistance in the way of the American advance.</span> <span id="s961">The American advance there was spearheaded by the second armored division.</span> <span id="s962">They started shooting at each other.</span> <span id="s963">This was already April 1, 45 Easter Sunday!</span> <span id="s964">There was a light rain, actually a drizzle, but we call it, “Sauer-kraut soup.”</span> <span id="s965">So we were caught in this drizzle and they were shooting over our heads, that is both the Germans and Americans.</span> <span id="s966">Naturally we just plopped in the mud and waited to see what would happen.</span> <span id="s967">After two hours we see the first American tanks and there no longer is any shooting.</span> <span id="s968">We are free!</span> <span id="s969">Of course our senior officer was Gen. Berbetzky (at least that is what it sounds like) and he sent a delegation to the advancing American unit, some envoy with a white flag.</span> <span id="s970">The envoy was to explain to the Americans that these were POWs, however they knew that already.</span> <span id="s971">So, as a result of that, there is a free for all.</span> <span id="s972">Which means that you can go wherever you want.</span> <span id="s973">The Americans said that their advice is for us to go back to our camp where we have a place to stay for the time being instead of camping in the open.</span> <span id="s974">The American tank crews threw us chocolate bars and cigarettes and passed.</span> <span id="s975">I found the chocolate bars OK!</span> <span id="s976">As far as cigarettes are concerned, I don’t smoke but nobody knew how handy they could come in.</span> <span id="s977">I walked back to the camp, about eight km.</span> <span id="s978">away.</span> <span id="s979">On the way I found a nice German farm.</span> <span id="s980">I went in there and explained to the farmer that I wanted milk.</span> <span id="s981">He gave me a bottle of milk and I gave him, I believe, five Camel cigarettes.</span> <span id="s982">He did not want to take these Camels, but I insisted that I should pay him for that milk.</span> <span id="s983">I analyzed later on that by insisting that he take them it kept me in the dignity of not being the heir of someone else’s effort.</span> <span id="s984">The Americans defeated the Germans so I get free milk?</span> <span id="s985">Hell no!</span> <span id="s986">I pay for the milk!</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: How many prisoners were together at that time?</span> <span id="s988">Now I am going back to the point where you were liberated, after the shooting stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: The whole camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: How many was that approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: 2,500 or 3,000 people!</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s993">So you had basically been turned loose to do what you wanted to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Were you in any kind of prison uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: No!</span> <span id="s997">We had, on our backs some kind of sign.</span> <span id="s998">I forget what it was.</span> <span id="s999">It was on the back of the coat.</span> <span id="s1000">Other than that we were wearing military uniforms.</span> <span id="s1001">(He does not explain how these lasted through five and a half years).</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: You remained in these uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Yes, we didn’t have anything else to wear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: I just thought that there were some devices to separate you from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: The summer uniforms were different, but you could recognize them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1007">When you went back to the camp and had gotten the milk, were you alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Yes, I was by myself.</span> <span id="s1009">I walked slowly because my ankles already started swelling, although I was a young fellow.</span> <span id="s1010">Anyway I opened the bottle and drank about half of it.</span> <span id="s1011">It went through me!</span> <span id="s1012">My stomach had been completely delined.</span> <span id="s1013">The lining in it, which is necessary for the process of digestion, wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1014">However I was pleased with myself.</span> <span id="s1015">It was, at last, the first tangible act of some free choice.</span> <span id="s1016">When you are in a prisoner of war camp, one of the experiences is that you know for certain that, whatever happens to you, is an unadulterated, direct, God’s well, since you cannot contribute anything significant to what is happening to you.</span> <span id="s1017">Obviously that is still God’s will, but in a completely different modality.</span> <span id="s1018">This bottle of milk restored my ability to philosophize.</span> <span id="s1019">In any case the Americans gave us their rations and all the latrines in the camp were out of order for three days.</span> <span id="s1020">So they gave us, then, half rations.</span> <span id="s1021">Then the Americans moved out and the British took over this part of Germany as occupation force.</span> <span id="s1022">Still the same week, the week after Easter, two Messerschmitts (German military planes) came and started shooting all over the camp.</span> <span id="s1023">When I saw the Messercshmitts shooting I had the purely irrational reaction -- there was a trench.</span> <span id="s1024">It is true that this trench wouldn’t give me any physical protection, but I saw, a couple of feet on my right side, bullets hit.</span> <span id="s1025">The Messerschmitt was shooting at me!</span> <span id="s1026">But he was a lousy shooter!</span> <span id="s1027">Thank God for that!</span> <span id="s1028">There was one fellow prisoner killed during that shooting.</span> <span id="s1029">He had attached his little mirror to the window and he was shaving.</span> <span id="s1030">He was shot1 Q; How many prisoners actually returned to camp?</span> <span id="s1031">Would you say that it was a majority of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: All of them!</span> <span id="s1033">Some of them immediately started to make approaches to the American command.</span> <span id="s1034">Some of them obtained rifles and joined the American forces as guards for the German prisoners.</span> <span id="s1035">That was good for young people, not for me.</span> <span id="s1036">I was too old for that!</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: How long would you say that the Americans stayed, before the British took over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: About a week or two.</span> <span id="s1039">The next big news was that the order came from the Polish Admiralty in Britain, that was the Polish navy under British command, calling all Polish naval officers, who had been POWs to go to England.</span> <span id="s1040">They sent special trucks and we got on these trucks.</span> <span id="s1041">They took us to Belgium by the land, which had been desolated.</span> <span id="s1042">There we saw the results of the aerial bombings and the artillery fights.</span> <span id="s1043">We saw a great number of German armored vehicles -- and some allied ones too -- which had been incapacitated.</span> <span id="s1044">These were the remains of the war!</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Physically, how were you during the trip?</span> <span id="s1046">Had you recovered sufficiently to make a trip like that without too much discomfort?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: I didn’t even think about physical discomfort, because the balance for my feelings was provided by the actual fate towards which I was going.</span> <span id="s1048">The past was left behind me.</span> <span id="s1049">That is however probably part of my disposition.</span> <span id="s1050">Even now, when I am an old man, I don’t look too much behind me.</span> <span id="s1051">That is why I have forgotten so many things.</span> <span id="s1052">Now, there isn’t much to look forward to!</span> <span id="s1053">but whatever it is, I am still looking forward to it.</span> <span id="s1054">To get back to my story, we boarded a British destroyer which took us out of Europe.</span> <span id="s1055">I believe that we boarded it in Ostende, Belgium, and it took us to Tilbury, better known as Gravesend, England which is part of the port of London.</span> <span id="s1056">There we were welcomed by a group of people who were headed by Adm. Unru (the spelling is uncertain), the commander of our fleet who had also been a POW in Germany.</span> <span id="s1057">He had been liberated somewhat earlier, maybe two or three weeks before us.</span> <span id="s1058">After he received us, they sent us to Brighton, which I on the Channel for recuperation.</span> <span id="s1059">The next thing which happened was that, in Brighton, tailors came to take measurements for our new uniforms.</span> <span id="s1060">Then I was assigned to the Center at the Training College.</span> <span id="s1061">Of course I first had to attend some refresher courses.</span> <span id="s1062">It was a good thing for that I knew English.</span> <span id="s1063">The course was in the harbor of Plymouth and that is where I met my wife.</span> <span id="s1064">Did I ever tell you how I met her?</span> <span id="s1065">No?</span> <span id="s1066">Well, a friend of mine who is now in Buffalo and I had a few drinks at the Officer’s Club.</span> <span id="s1067">Then he said: “Do you know what?</span> <span id="s1068">Our Polish society has a ball in the City Hall, let’s go there and see!”</span> <span id="s1069">so we went there and we saw some ladies sitting against a wall, waiting to be invited to dance.</span> <span id="s1070">So he asked one lady and I asked another, I said to my dancing partner; “Young lady, I could be your father!”</span> <span id="s1071">She said: “Oh, well, that is very interesting.”</span> <span id="s1072">After the dance I brought my partner back and he brought his partner back.</span> <span id="s1073">Then I asked the one he stopped dancing with for the dance and he asked the one I had been dancing with.</span> <span id="s1074">I started the same routine: “Young lady, I could be your father!”</span> <span id="s1075">She said: “Oh, I have to ask my mother about that!”</span> <span id="s1076">That is how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: What is your wife’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Joan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Please, her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Elliott, her full name was Joan H. Elliott.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Were you married in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Yes, but not until I already had a contract for a job in the U.S.</span> <span id="s1083">It took three years for courting and for trying this and trying that.</span> <span id="s1084">I wouldn’t even declare my feelings, which she knew without declaration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Was she of English or Polish background?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: No, No!</span> <span id="s1087">She is English!</span> <span id="s1088">She is British because she has Scottish and Irish as a mixture, and also some English blood.</span> <span id="s1089">The only Polish she speaks are the words pertaining to cuisine and love, for obvious reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: How long did you then stay in the Polish navy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: The British government, together with the American government, refused to consider the Polish government in exile in London, as the real Polish government (this resulted from the division of Europe at the Yalta conference as it was reported, on March 17, 1945).</span> <span id="s1092">They gave recognition to this Communist government which had moved from Moscow to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1093">For that reason all the Polish armed forces in Britain were given an opportunity to declare whether they wanted to go back to Poland, and many did, or of they didn’t want to do that.</span> <span id="s1094">Then the forces were reorganized.</span> <span id="s1095">Those who didn’t wore the same uniform and got the same pay and formed the, so- called “Polish Resettlement Corps.”</span> <span id="s1096">So, if anybody says anything against the British (about betraying the Poles who risked a lot to fight for them) that person must be either uninformed or plain darn stupid.</span> <span id="s1097">The reason for that is that the British, even for me who, although I was in the armed forces, was with them only at the end of the war, they gave me, as they did to all the members of the armed forces, including those who fought with their very lives, some pretty good gratuities.</span> <span id="s1098">They gave me something I didn’t expect.</span> <span id="s1099">It was not an awful lot, but it was a nice little round sum to start a new life with.</span> <span id="s1100">Anyway the Training Center, where I was, changed into a school with different departments and I was made the head of the Electrical Engineering Department.</span> <span id="s1101">I knew that, unless they had some attachment to some existing educational system in England, that way or returning to civilian life would really not be of any value.</span> <span id="s1102">For that reason I got the approval fro my superiors to look around.</span> <span id="s1103">I don’t know if I should tell you all these things because this sounds like blowing my own horn, but I went to London, contacted the right people and, to make a long story short, I made the arrangement that our program would be exactly the same as that of London University which gives so called; “Kids and City of London Institute Diplomas.”</span> <span id="s1104">These diplomas are in different fields and, in this case, Diplomas in Electrical Communications.</span> <span id="s1105">The representatives from London University would come to our school with the final examination papers.</span> <span id="s1106">That was in 1946 and 47.</span> <span id="s1107">In 1948 the last graduates left and I started writing applications to all kinds of schools all over the world, including British schools.</span> <span id="s1108">I received all kinds of answers.</span> <span id="s1109">I wrote even to Abyssinia, also called Ethiopia.</span> <span id="s1110">The best answer, to my applications, I received, was from the University of Detroit.</span> <span id="s1111">They sent me a contract!</span> <span id="s1112">Since I had my undergraduate degree in Math, I offered that I could join the Math department.</span> <span id="s1113">They offered me the job of Assistant Professor of Math.</span> <span id="s1114">With that contract, it was easy to get the “Non-quota-visa” and to get married.</span> <span id="s1115">Now I didn’t speculate or hope on thin air.</span> <span id="s1116">I had something tangible.</span> <span id="s1117">We were married in 1948 and we came to Detroit.</span> <span id="s1118">The British government paid for the transportation.</span> <span id="s1119">I remember the first days on that ship!</span> <span id="s1120">At that time Britain still had those restrictions with food.</span> <span id="s1121">My bride was laughing at me when I was reading the menu this way and that way (on ocean going ships it was customary to provide passengers, free of charge, with any number of desired dishes, at every meal).</span> <span id="s1122">I could say, with the advance knowledge that, what I am going to say, is stupid, that this whole Holocaust, this whole bloody WWII was fought for one and only one reason, to make Jerzy Lubelfeld a happy man.</span> <span id="s1123">When I say this, I realize how stupid it is, the only accompanying thought, which I can add to this is the great gratitude to the dispenser of happiness and unhappiness in the world into whom so many people do not believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: You have one son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yes, one son, but he is the large economy size, so to say.</span> <span id="s1126">He is six feet, two and a half inches.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Where was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: He was born in Detroit, in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: I have a question which I would like to ask you about the raising of your son.</span> <span id="s1130">You have gone through a rather traumatic life, prior to getting married and having him.</span> <span id="s1131">I like to ask you; if this experience, which you have lived through, has in any way maybe altered the way in which you would have raised your son, otherwise?</span> <span id="s1132">In other words, did this experience as a POW, lead you to raise your son in a particular way, because of your background, or do you think that you would have raised him the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: It must have done so because it is impossible, in life, not to be affected by the experiences of yesterday, in the life of today.</span> <span id="s1134">The now is always built on what was yesterday.</span> <span id="s1135">However I would not say that this was done in some kind of an explicit way; it must have been somewhere in the background, of course not the details or the particular events, but the whole flavor of it.</span> <span id="s1136">The whole part of human destiny is placed in the general Divine Providence.</span> <span id="s1137">Definitely the kid had a religious upbringing.</span> <span id="s1138">This upbringing did not change his attitude towards philosophy and religion.</span> <span id="s1139">He still kept an open mind.</span> <span id="s1140">I think that the Lord has blessed us, praised be His name, that our son never said that he had a generation gap or something of the type.</span> <span id="s1141">He said; “I never had a generation gap with my folks!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: That is very interesting.</span> <span id="s1143">Now you were in Detroit, in 1950, when your son was born, did you come directly to Dayton from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1145">When I became a U.S. citizen, in 1953, I tried to get another job.</span> <span id="s1146">I will make a long story short.</span> <span id="s1147">I wanted to return to my proper field which is Electrical Communications, Electronics.</span> <span id="s1148">I wrote to AFIT.</span> <span id="s1149">The next thing I knew was that I had an invitation to come for an interview.</span> <span id="s1150">The next thing I had was a contract.</span> <span id="s1151">You know, when I look over the past there are some points, markers, which divide one part of my life from another.</span> <span id="s1152">When I leap over that particular frontier, between one part and another; I go through it without knowing that there is anything special which happens.</span> <span id="s1153">That is with one exception in my life.</span> <span id="s1154">When I was returning to Detroit, from that first interview with AFIT, I stopped in St. Joseph’s Church.</span> <span id="s1155">I believe that it is in Findlay, Ohio.</span> <span id="s1156">I prayed for this appointment.</span> <span id="s1157">I only prayed that I would like it; I had a warm feeling inside of me that it was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1158">It must have been in the modality of the Providence, which can be sensed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: So you did come to Dayton to work at AFIT?</span> <span id="s1160">I believe that you stayed with the Air Force institute of Technology for almost twenty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: For 24 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: What year did you retire?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: In 1977.</span> <span id="s1164">However they rehired me then for another six months to finish the supervision of those students who were doing their thesis under me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: We just have a very little bit of time left on this tape.</span> <span id="s1166">I was wondering if I might use this last bit of time to ask you about your feelings of what is going on in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: I am glad, of course, and this is consistent (Pope John Paul II visited Poland in June 1979; Lech Walesa met the prime minister in July 1980; that same month dissident leaders are arrested, then, the government gives in to the strikers and a 17 day work stoppage is ended; Sept 1980 sees a further strike settlement, the change of the prime minister and the organization of Solidarity, a further strike, this one involving millions of workers, occurs in Jan 1981; Prime Minister Pinkowski resigns and is replaced by Gen. Jaruzelski in Feb. 1981).</span> <span id="s1168">with the knowledge of Polish history.</span> <span id="s1169">It is good.</span> <span id="s1170">I think it is good, if you look at it not only from the Polish point of view but the general point of view; look at the picture when they started to have strikes in the Baltic ports of Gdansk and Gdynia.</span> <span id="s1171">You see the Polish workers, who are supposed to be Communists or Socialists, you know that they are supposed to be against capitalism, and they are meeting and getting Holy Communion.</span> <span id="s1172">They truly want, when all these things which they ask for are finally reduced to a minimum requirement, they want to have honest rulers, and people who do not abuse their power, an honest government.</span> <span id="s1173">They don’t care whether the government is Communistic, or what.</span> <span id="s1174">These are not the workers who put at the top of their dreams that they have to have higher wages, higher benefits, all through strikes; they treat all these other requirements for wages and freedom and recognition of their union as means for bringing about, in the rulers, honesty.</span> <span id="s1175">They just succeeded!</span> <span id="s1176">I think that Stanislaw Kania, the present head of the Communist party is an honest fellow.</span> <span id="s1177">The Prime Minister, Gen. Jaruzelski, is an officer.</span> <span id="s1178">He must have some soldierly virtues and other virtues.</span> <span id="s1179">He is an honest man.</span> <span id="s1180">American readers probably don’t see these things, when they read about these trouble in Poland, but I see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Have you been back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: In 1974 after 35 years of not seeing anybody, I finally went to see my sister.</span> <span id="s1183">I spent three weeks in Warsaw in May of 1974.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: You have basically been here a long time.</span> <span id="s1185">You have been away from Poland for a long time.</span> <span id="s1186">Do you have any desire to go back there to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: No!</span> <span id="s1188">No!</span> <span id="s1189">I would not go back because I have strong ties here, specifically my wife and my son.</span> <span id="s1190">I don’t have to live in Poland to be useful to the Polish ideals.</span> <span id="s1191">In a small measure I still think I am that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: I was going to ask you about that ring.</span> <span id="s1193">I noticed it some time ago.</span> <span id="s1194">Can you describe what it is and why you wear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1196">It is the Polish naval emblem!</span> <span id="s1197">This was made by a sailor.</span> <span id="s1198">He made two rings like that.</span> <span id="s1199">They are made out of a Polish coin, of a silver coin, the size of a half dollar,</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Did he make it for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: it is very laborious work, time consuming and hard work.</span> <span id="s1202">I saw it and I said: “I’ll buy it!”</span> <span id="s1203">He hesitated for a moment then he sold it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Was that before you became a POW?</span> <span id="s1205">Is that something you have had always?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: No, that was in England, after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Is there anything which I have neglected to ask you during this interview?</span> <span id="s1208">Again, as I said, we are coming to the end of this tape and the end of the interview, so is there anything which I should have asked you, which you would like to comment on, at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: The only thing which I would like to emphasize again is that this entire thing is supposed to have a connection wit the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1210">Now, from the way I talk, the connection with the Holocaust is only a tiny dimension.</span> <span id="s1211">It is because these things happened when the Holocaust was happening.</span> <span id="s1212">It is only a topical or casual connection.</span> <span id="s1213">I don’t know if there is more, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1214">Of course it is absurd to think that the world would have to go through WWII, in order to make me happy.</span> <span id="s1215">However is it?</span> <span id="s1216">Look at the universe!</span> <span id="s1217">Probably we are the only Homo sapiens in this universe!</span> <span id="s1218">Then the question comes; well, maybe people will say: “This is absurd!</span> <span id="s1219">It is impossible!”</span> <span id="s1220">Even the religious people will say: “The Lord is too generous to make only people!”</span> <span id="s1221">Let’s investigate this whole thing; the entire planet earth, the solar system.</span> <span id="s1222">Without the solar system and the planet earth, such as they are, there would be no people, no human beings.</span> <span id="s1223">Therefore it is not completely stupid to say that this terrific solar system extending in space and in time for tremendous distances was created to make people.</span> <span id="s1224">Some will say; “Oh!</span> <span id="s1225">It is just a coincidence!”</span> <span id="s1226">but I don’t believe in coincidences.</span> <span id="s1227">A coincidence is a thing which we cannot explain rationally.</span> <span id="s1228">If we don’t know the reason, we can postulate any reason which would not be inconsistent with the whole picture, so maybe this philosophical question: “Is WWII only to make Jerzy happy?”</span> <span id="s1229">is not so stupid after all, providing it gives you an entry into a wider, universal plane of application.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: We will end with that thought.</span> <span id="s1231">I would like to thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1232">I have enjoyed meeting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Thank you for coming here and squeezing all these things out of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: My pleasure!</span></p></body></html>
