at Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2243">Now can you imagine what other camps were?</span> <span id="s2244">Now I just wanted to tell you.</span> <span id="s2245">We went there and these children came with two 16, 17 year old girls from Holland and one old doctor, a Jewish doctor who was years ago in the tropics like so many in Holland were.</span> <span id="s2246">And we were given a small house.</span> <span id="s2247">That was at the time when it was a fortress, a tuberculosis hospital.</span> <span id="s2248">And these children were put in there and we even had beds for them because that was still there.</span> <span id="s2249">Naturally we were scared to death that they'll all catch tuberculosis, and we too.</span> <span id="s2250">And this old doctor said, "As far as I know, there is one thing we can do for these children--blood transfusions."</span> <span id="s2251">They had typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s2252">And he did what he could.</span> <span id="s2253">He went

something that isn't done anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">FS: And you said he collected money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">IR: He collected whatever we had in valuables to bribe these guards to give him plain bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">FS: These were Czech guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">IR: Czech guards.</span> <span id="s2281">And we could have that and boiled our water, no milk, the cheapest cottage cheese that they could get and rye bread.</span> <span id="s2282">And that was what we fed these children and they pulled through, to stop this awful diarrhea.</span> <span id="s2283">That was what they had day and night, diarrhea.</span> <span id="s2284">Completely dehydrated bodies, little bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">FS: And you say these children had no names.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">IR: Some of them knew their name, but they all had only one, a first name, around their neck on a string.</span> <span id="s2287">And there were little ones that couldn't even talk yet.</span> <span id="s2288">So we knew this one was Magda or Lisa or whatever, Holland names.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">FS: You gave them names?</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">IR: No, that was their name around their neck, the first name, but no family name.</span> <span id="s2291">Because the families had given these children to gentile people to hide them without names, and the younger ones didn't know a family name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">FS: And how many were in this transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">IR:

Switzerland that people asked, "We have no children.</span> <span id="s2297">We would like to adopt these children."</span> <span id="s2298">And a few among other ones was this Schwester Rita [unclear] in New York.</span> <span id="s2299">You know the story.</span> <span id="s2300">When she came to New York where afterwards her husband lived with another woman.</span> <span id="s2301">He wanted a divorce.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">IR: She had a little boy taken along.</span> <span id="s2303">And that one couple in Chicago that I met later on had that little boy.</span> <span

your husband I will not let you go anywhere alone.</span> <span id="s2324">I will go with you."</span> <span id="s2325">And she went.</span> <span id="s2326">And we both--they said, "Your name isn't

what shall we do?"</span> <span id="s2334">And she said, "You can refuse but did you ever have a chance to say you want to go and you can't go?</span> <span id="s2335">I go.</span> <span id="s2336">It might be a chance that we are safe."</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">FS: Did you expect to go to Switzerland or did you expect to go to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">IR: We didn't expect anything.</span> <span id="s2339">They told us Switzerland because...</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">FS: Did you believe them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">IR: I didn't.</span> <span id="s2342">Some

to the Schweizer [Swiss] border."</span> <span id="s2413">Suddenly everybody thought, all right, maybe it really is true after 24 hours.</span> <span id="s2414">And then they came and told us not far from Friedrichshafen, somewhere, I think I wrote it down, that all the women--we all had short cut hair for the one reason everybody had lice.</span> <span id="s2415">And there so many people died,
