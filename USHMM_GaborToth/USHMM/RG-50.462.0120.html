they could get and rye bread.</span> <span id="s2282">And that was what we fed these children and they pulled through, to stop this awful diarrhea.</span> <span id="s2283">That was what they had day and night, diarrhea.</span> <span id="s2284">Completely dehydrated bodies, little bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">FS: And you say these children had no names.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">IR: Some of them knew their name, but they all had only one, a first name, around their neck on a string.</span> <span id="s2287">And there were little ones that couldn't even talk yet.</span> <span

their neck, the first name, but no family name.</span> <span id="s2291">Because the families had given these children to gentile people to hide them without names, and the younger ones didn't know a

you."</span> <span id="s2325">And she went.</span> <span id="s2326">And we both--they said, "Your name isn't on."</span> <span id="s2327">And she said, "I go with my friend.</span> <span id="s2328">I

to the Schweizer [Swiss] border."</span> <span id="s2413">Suddenly everybody thought, all right, maybe it really is true after 24 hours.</span> <span id="s2414">And then they came and told us not far from Friedrichshafen, somewhere, I think I wrote it down, that all the women--we all had short cut hair for the one reason everybody had lice.</span> <span id="s2415">And there so many people died,
