at Wright State University, in Dayton, Ohio.</span> <span id="s8">I am conducting interviews with Survivors of the Holocaust who live in this area.</span> <span id="s9">I am interviewing Mrs. Emma Fiszlewicz, as part of this project on April 30, 1981, at 10:00 a.m. in her home.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">OK.</span> <span id="s11">Let’s start with your place of birth and date.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I was born January 16, 1923, in Kreisk, Minsk (area of Minsk,) in Russia.</span> <span id="s13">My father was a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s14">My mother was a midwife.</span> <span id="s15">We lived in this Kreisk for a very short time.</span> <span id="s16">I was a little more than one year old, when my parents moved and I remember nothing from that place.</span> <span id="s17">My father, as a pharmacist, was transferred every few years to open a new pharmacy.</span> <span id="s18">So we moved to Kreisk, Lofts Lavada, also in the Minsk region, a small town near Minsk.</span> <span id="s19">We lived there for about five years.</span> <span id="s20">Then we moved to Uchwalt, then to Lemina, all in the Minsk area.</span> <span id="s21">We lived there for a few years and then, when I was about twelve years old, we moved to Uchwally, also near Minsk.</span> <span id="s22">I was in the 7th grade in this town of Uchwally.</span> <span id="s23">That is then where I finished my elementary school education.</span> <span id="s24">We didn’t yet have high schools, in these small towns.</span> <span id="s25">So I had to go into the city of Minsk.</span> <span id="s26">There I started to study to be an architect, that is an architect technician, not an engineer.</span> <span id="s27">That was in 1937, when I started this school in Minsk.</span> <span id="s28">It was a four-year school.</span> <span id="s29">(Please note that between 1919 &amp; 1938, Minsk was about ten miles inside Russia from the Polish border).</span> <span id="s30">On June 25, 1941 I had to get my diploma.</span> <span id="s31">Of course in order to get my diploma, I had to do a project.</span> <span id="s32">When the project was done, I was to answer questions by a kind of jury.</span> <span id="s33">If I did all of this right I would get my diploma.</span> <span id="s34">The jury was to meet on June 25.</span> <span id="s35">However on June 22, the war started.</span> <span id="s36">On that day, I was in my dormitory.</span> <span id="s37">That dormitory was in a wooden building, just like a barrack.</span> <span id="s38">All the students were told that on the night of June 23, we had to sleep in the basement of the school.</span> <span id="s39">The school was a big house.</span> <span id="s40">We heard the bombs.</span> <span id="s41">We were very scared.</span> <span id="s42">We didn’t know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s43">At 4:00 a.m., the teachers told us that we had to run away.</span> <span id="s44">We had to run away on foot.</span> <span id="s45">We didn’t have any transportation.</span> <span id="s46">They told us “Go on this highway on the way to Mogilev.”</span> <span id="s47">So we couldn’t do anything else but run, without clothes, without food -- with nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: You went to a lot of detail about what happened there, but you didn’t talk about your family life, when you were growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about how many brothers and sisters you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: We were four sisters and one brother.</span> <span id="s52">I was the youngest one.</span> <span id="s53">My brother was in the service at the time when the war started, in the army.</span> <span id="s54">Once the war started, I never did see him again.</span> <span id="s55">He was moved right to the action, as you say, the front.</span> <span id="s56">My one sister was in Moscow at that time because she had trouble with her legs.</span> <span id="s57">She was there to study and to take medical care of her legs.</span> <span id="s58">Another sister was not in very good health, she was always home.</span> <span id="s59">The other sister was in another town working.</span> <span id="s60">She was also a pharmacist.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Did you give me your maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: My maiden name was Giertier.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: The area where you grew up, was it a rural area?</span> <span id="s64">Was it more like a city or were there more farms?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: It was more of a farming area but, since my father was a pharmacist, we were living a more citified life.</span> <span id="s66">My mother was also helping my father because she was a midwife, but she would have to go to other towns to help the ladies with the babies, and her health was not that good.</span> <span id="s67">So she learned how to fill prescriptions.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Did you attend Synagogue?</span> <span id="s69">Did your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No.</span> <span id="s71">We were not allowed.</span> <span id="s72">My father was an older man, at the time, he was 65 -- now it doesn’t seem that he was an older man but, at that time, it seemed like it.</span> <span id="s73">At that time, a 65 year old man was considered an older man.</span> <span id="s74">He was still working.</span> <span id="s75">He was in good health.</span> <span id="s76">He was registered to be a religious school teacher, but he was not allowed to teach us, and, if he would have done it, He would have been prosecuted for this.</span> <span id="s77">In a small town everybody knows everybody.</span> <span id="s78">It was a Communistic regime.</span> <span id="s79">So I don’t know much about religion, and I am very much ashamed of it.</span> <span id="s80">Now I could learn some and I do.</span> <span id="s81">I go to the Synagogue, but we didn’t have the proper education from the beginning.</span> <span id="s82">I still don’t know a lot about religion.</span> <span id="s83">I feel as if a big part of my life was missing, because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: You were not able to celebrate any of the High Holy Days?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No, not much, just very plainly, in hiding.</span> <span id="s86">We did not want anybody to know, so we did very little, not too much celebration.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: What was the language, which was spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A; The language was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s89">But, since we were living in Russia I had to learn Russian also.</span> <span id="s90">We went to a very little school.</span> <span id="s91">In one room were all the children through the fourth grade, and one teacher taught us all.</span> <span id="s92">Everybody was taught by the same teacher at the same time.</span> <span id="s93">But we learned Yiddish pretty good; I speak Yiddish pretty good.</span> <span id="s94">I can speak it and write and read it.</span> <span id="s95">Then after I finished the fourth grade I went to Russian school.</span> <span id="s96">It wasn’t so hard to change; I did pretty well in school.</span> <span id="s97">I was very good in languages and I was pretty good in math also.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: So there were Jewish and non-Jewish people going to the Russian school?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yes, but very few Jewish students.</span> <span id="s100">It was a small town.</span> <span id="s101">There were about eight Jewish families.</span> <span id="s102">I can’t remember exactly, maybe five, maybe seven, I couldn’t even remember now who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Were you especially close with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A; I can’t say that I knew them very well because I lived only for one year in that little town and then I had to go to Minsk.</span> <span id="s105">After that I was home only for short vacations.</span> <span id="s106">Only one of my friends was Jewish, the rest were Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: What kind of activities did you participate in?</span> <span id="s108">They didn’t really have to be involved with the synagogue, but maybe with the theater, or was your father involved with politics, or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: No.</span> <span id="s110">My father was not involved in politics.</span> <span id="s111">We didn’t have much of a theater, whatsoever.</span> <span id="s112">We really couldn’t afford anything.</span> <span id="s113">All we had was a gramophone.</span> <span id="s114">How did we get a gramophone?</span> <span id="s115">It was actually by mistake.</span> <span id="s116">My father ordered medicine which came in big boxes and they made a mistake and sent us a box with the gramophone with the other boxes.</span> <span id="s117">(Note that in Europe, pharmacies carry nothing but pharmaceuticals).</span> <span id="s118">Naturally a gramophone is really a record player.</span> <span id="s119">We had maybe three records, but we had many copies of the same record.</span> <span id="s120">Maybe we had sixty discs, but they were all copies of these same three records.</span> <span id="s121">Still, the gramophone was a big attraction in our little town, like when television first came.</span> <span id="s122">I remember that they were Russian songs.</span> <span id="s123">We tried to send it back and get actually what my father had ordered, but we never could get that straightened out, for some reason.</span> <span id="s124">So it remained with us.</span> <span id="s125">We had other activities.</span> <span id="s126">We would go to the river and swim and go to the woods and pick blueberries.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Would you describe your childhood as being a happy time?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: No.</span> <span id="s129">I would not describe it as being a happy time.</span> <span id="s130">We didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s131">I wouldn’t say that it was unhappy either.</span> <span id="s132">I am thinking of now, when the children have so much to play with.</span> <span id="s133">We certainly didn’t have anything to play with.</span> <span id="s134">We didn’t have dresses.</span> <span id="s135">There was a time when my father had a brother in the U.S.: he had run away from the Czar.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: I never knew about that.</span> <span id="s138">He ran away from Russia before I was born.</span> <span id="s139">I remember once that we got some money from our uncle, but the money was not useful.</span> <span id="s140">All we could do was to take it to the “Toctime”.</span> <span id="s141">That is where you had to take the foreign money.</span> <span id="s142">I remember that we got some stockings and dresses.</span> <span id="s143">Oh, we were so very happy.</span> <span id="s144">I remember the brown stockings.</span> <span id="s145">We probably also got some groceries, I believe.</span> <span id="s146">I was a child then, so I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s147">I remember that we also got some tennis shoes, that I remember, bought from this “Toctime” store.</span> <span id="s148">I remember also that, when I was ten years old, there was a government crisis.</span> <span id="s149">Then it cost a lot of money to buy flour to make bread.</span> <span id="s150">I remember that I could not fall asleep.</span> <span id="s151">My father had to borrow money!</span> <span id="s152">I remember that he had to borrow money to make bread.</span> <span id="s153">That was not very happy.</span> <span id="s154">You see I didn’t have a very happy childhood.</span> <span id="s155">Later, I remember that I went to the big city, Minsk, to go to the school for architects, I was with my sister, who was about one year older, or one and a half years older, but we went to school together, in the big city.</span> <span id="s156">Then, in Minsk, we saw a line for butter and sugar.</span> <span id="s157">We had to wait in line to get butter, I believe it was ½ pound, since they wouldn’t let us have more.</span> <span id="s158">We bought one thing and another, to make a package to send home.</span> <span id="s159">I was 15 and she was 16, and we were so happy to be able to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Your father decided not to leave Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Do you know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: First of all he was a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s164">Maybe the only pharmacist in a radius of maybe 20 km.</span> <span id="s165">So he believed that he had a duty to perform with the pharmacy.</span> <span id="s166">Secondly he didn’t get any orders to leave -- it wasn’t his pharmacy.</span> <span id="s167">He couldn’t just lock it up without an order and go away.</span> <span id="s168">Also we didn’t have any transportation!</span> <span id="s169">My mother was a very heavy woman, weighing maybe 220 lbs.</span> <span id="s170">with heart problems and other different illnesses.</span> <span id="s171">My sister also wasn’t well.</span> <span id="s172">We had no way to go.</span> <span id="s173">Furthermore, we didn’t believe that it would be that bad.</span> <span id="s174">My father remembered World War I.</span> <span id="s175">At that time, they didn’t single people out.</span> <span id="s176">After all it was a war, of course, and everyone was involved in it, but I never remember my father saying that we were persecuted.</span> <span id="s177">So, all together we did not even think of leaving.</span> <span id="s178">We couldn’t anyway.</span> <span id="s179">We just stayed, and when the Nazis came (i.e. the German National Socialist; i.e. Hitler’s party) the first thing, it started.</span> <span id="s180">We couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s181">Before they came we heard that we would have to run.</span> <span id="s182">There were airplanes throwing bombs.</span> <span id="s183">We were so scared!</span> <span id="s184">We were scared of the bombs because the houses were small ones made of wood.</span> <span id="s185">But when the Nazis came with trucks and they took the people, the Jewish people, then we heard the motor of an airplane running, we were so happy that it was not a truck.</span> <span id="s186">However, the truck did come and I started to run away.</span> <span id="s187">I heard the shout: “Rous!</span> <span id="s188">Rous!”</span> <span id="s189">, (meaning “Out!</span> <span id="s190">Out!”)</span> <span id="s191">.</span> <span id="s192">These were the Nazis, actually Russians wearing Nazi uniforms, you know Russian Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s193">I tried to run away -- I ran to the cowshed.</span> <span id="s194">I really don’t know how come I was so strong, since I was only 17, but I tore out part of a wooden door; however, they caught me from the other side.</span> <span id="s195">They hit me over the head, and took me like everybody into a big room, which had been used by the Russian government.</span> <span id="s196">The government of this area of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Was that before you went to school in Minsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No, I am talking about the war.</span> <span id="s199">Did you want to ask other questions before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: So, that was after you came back from school?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s203">Let’s talk about how you went to Moscow.</span> <span id="s204">I meant to Minsk to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: We had never gone to a big city, my sister and I. My brother who was older, maybe four years older than my sister, “Since you have pretty good brains, you better go to that there architectural school, and besides that, they have only so few places remaining available”.</span> <span id="s206">You know it was only one school which had only a certain number of open spots for students.</span> <span id="s207">So we went and took our tests.</span> <span id="s208">You know there were entrance examinations to cover Russian geography, amongst many other subjects.</span> <span id="s209">I don’t know which they were now.</span> <span id="s210">My sister and I, we both went to the same school.</span> <span id="s211">We both passed the entrance examinations.</span> <span id="s212">I felt so relieved when I heard that I passed, that it was amazing.</span> <span id="s213">It was so many years ago, it was in 1937, but I still remember that I said: “Let’s treat ourselves to ice cream.”</span> <span id="s214">That was a true treat!</span> <span id="s215">We had gone to take the examination but we had never gone to a big city before, and Minsk was a big city for us.</span> <span id="s216">So our brother was our chaperone.</span> <span id="s217">He made certain that we would get to our relatives.</span> <span id="s218">I never knew them although I had their names.</span> <span id="s219">Their last name was Gordon.</span> <span id="s220">I know, I remember, that they lived on a street called Sacha, which means dry.</span> <span id="s221">Our brother was with us and we got into a streetcar and he said: “Now you get off!”</span> <span id="s222">So my sister and I got off, but he said: “Oh, it is too early!”</span> <span id="s223">, and he went further.</span> <span id="s224">We were like two goats, we started to run after the streetcar, to catch our brother and we did not find him.</span> <span id="s225">We got lost, but we knew the name of the street and the name of our relatives, but we had no money, not a penny.</span> <span id="s226">We were still very young, she was 15 and I was 13.</span> <span id="s227">We kept on asking how we would get to Sacha Street.</span> <span id="s228">We couldn’t find it and we didn’t have any money to get on a streetcar.</span> <span id="s229">It started to get dark so I said that we better go and find our school.</span> <span id="s230">We finally found our school and they took us up to the dormitory.</span> <span id="s231">That wasn’t so far.</span> <span id="s232">Everything was fresh and clean.</span> <span id="s233">We were so happy that we could lay down and rest.</span> <span id="s234">It was very close to the railroad station and we could hear the locomotives.</span> <span id="s235">In the morning we started our examinations, which took two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Did you have any trouble there because you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s237">Were there a lot of other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: They didn’t tell us, but we felt different.</span> <span id="s239">They did not associate with us too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Do you remember any incidents which happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Do you remember anything about going to school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: No, not anything special.</span> <span id="s244">No, we tried to learn all we could.</span> <span id="s245">But, what I do remember is that we sometimes wanted to buy shoes and when we did we had to go at night and stand in line at the stores.</span> <span id="s246">We couldn’t do it in the morning because the store was so far away from the school.</span> <span id="s247">It however, was safe and we had no trouble walking at night, you know two young girls, walking alone to the store.</span> <span id="s248">You know one would wait and one would go in and then we changed again.</span> <span id="s249">I remember that it was safe.</span> <span id="s250">Nothing happened to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Oh, four years!</span> <span id="s253">In 1941, I was supposed to get a degree, my diploma after being questioned about this project.</span> <span id="s254">That is when the war started.</span> <span id="s255">We had to run away, as I told you.</span> <span id="s256">I never got my diploma.</span> <span id="s257">Nobody got them.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: How did you feel when you first heard about the war having started?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Oh!</span> <span id="s260">I was never a politician.</span> <span id="s261">I never learned about politics.</span> <span id="s262">Even now, I don’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s263">It was to me as if it happened suddenly.</span> <span id="s264">I was shocked!</span> <span id="s265">I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s266">I was young, you know, 17 years old.</span> <span id="s267">Which other 17 year old knows about politics?</span> <span id="s268">Maybe there are some, who are interested in politics.</span> <span id="s269">It came to me as a terrible shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: When did you first hear about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: In the papers, the next day.</span> <span id="s272">The war started on June 22nd, 1941, and on the 23rd, at night, after school, they told us: “Don’t go home!</span> <span id="s273">Don’t go to the dormitory!</span> <span id="s274">You stay, tonight, on the floor in the basement!”</span> <span id="s275">Some of them were laying down, some of them were sitting, some of them were shaking, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s276">All the time we heard bombs fall.</span> <span id="s277">I hope that you will never get to hear it, except sometimes you see it on TV.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: So how or when did you decide to leave?</span> <span id="s279">In which direction to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: They told us.</span> <span id="s281">They told us to leave and about the way to Mogilev, that city about which I talked earlier.</span> <span id="s282">They said: “Go on the Mogilev road!”</span> <span id="s283">That is the highway which was to take us to that city.</span> <span id="s284">We ran away on foot.</span> <span id="s285">There was no transportation whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: That was for everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yes, for everybody from our school.</span> <span id="s288">Everybody had to run on their feet.</span> <span id="s289">We ran from 4:00 o’clock in the morning, to 2:00 o’clock the next morning.</span> <span id="s290">For 22 hours without food, without rest.</span> <span id="s291">We would walk the best we could.</span> <span id="s292">We never thought that we could do that.</span> <span id="s293">We would walk and run and walk and run.</span> <span id="s294">I didn’t think we could do that.</span> <span id="s295">Finally we got to a little town and we could not walk anymore.</span> <span id="s296">Somebody from our group had a friend in that town, I don’t exactly remember how it happened, we got to a house and they let us put ourselves on the floor and lay down.</span> <span id="s297">Then we couldn’t get up anymore.</span> <span id="s298">Our feet were terribly swollen.</span> <span id="s299">We were tired.</span> <span id="s300">The people probably gave us some milk, but I don’t remember now.</span> <span id="s301">I know that they gave us something to eat.</span> <span id="s302">Then the next day we had to go again.</span> <span id="s303">We couldn’t stay there, first of all the bombs and then I decided to go to my parents.</span> <span id="s304">In about a week of walking and running being hungry, since I was without food, I got to my parents.</span> <span id="s305">They were so happy to see me alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Was your sister with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A; No.</span> <span id="s308">My sister was in Moscow, at that time.</span> <span id="s309">Her eyes were crossed and she was so ashamed about it.</span> <span id="s310">Somebody had told her that in Moscow they performed surgery for it.</span> <span id="s311">She didn’t actually ask permission.</span> <span id="s312">She just went to Moscow, to get the surgery.</span> <span id="s313">You see that is a good thing about Russia: people don’t pay for medical expenses.</span> <span id="s314">That is the only good thing.</span> <span id="s315">She had her eyes corrected by surgery.</span> <span id="s316">She was so glad.</span> <span id="s317">She wrote to the school in Minsk to mail the papers to the school in Moscow.</span> <span id="s318">So she was there when the war started.</span> <span id="s319">I was glad because she could not travel like I did.</span> <span id="s320">No!</span> <span id="s321">She had a bad ankle and a problem on the other foot.</span> <span id="s322">I think you call it elephantiasis.</span> <span id="s323">(EF gives the name in Polish and then explains) I know this is better in Polish, because I lived there a long time in Poland and I talk Polish with my children here, they were born in Poland.</span> <span id="s324">My parents, as I told you were very happy to see me; as a matter if fact they were so happy that they cried.</span> <span id="s325">So therefore I was at their house.</span> <span id="s326">We were told that, in a short time, when the Nazis, the Germans would be there, the Jews would have to wear a yellow star, either in the back or the front, or on the arms.</span> <span id="s327">Sometimes they would catch us on the street and they would order us to work for them -- without pay, of course -- and at times they treated us like animals.</span> <span id="s328">They did just what they wanted.</span> <span id="s329">We couldn’t do anything against them, we just had to wait.</span> <span id="s330">One day there came some Russians in Nazi uniforms.</span> <span id="s331">They took all of us out of the houses by ordering “Raus!”</span> <span id="s332">which means ‘get out’.</span> <span id="s333">They put all of us in a room, as I told you earlier, they put everybody in there, even people who were dying.</span> <span id="s334">If somebody had to carry them that was done.</span> <span id="s335">They all had to be there, the little ones, the old ones, everyone.</span> <span id="s336">We thought that we were going to die in a minute.</span> <span id="s337">I was 17 and I thought: “I am going to die in a minute!”</span> <span id="s338">I was so terrified.</span> <span id="s339">I didn’t want to die!</span> <span id="s340">I was healthy, I was young.</span> <span id="s341">You know, how would you feel about the idea that were going to die?</span> <span id="s342">I felt so bad that I started to pull my hair out.</span> <span id="s343">My father cried because my sister in Moscow would be all by herself, sick in one leg small and with one leg big.</span> <span id="s344">That sister’s health was never very good.</span> <span id="s345">She was always pale -- we all tended to favor her from all the children because she was not in good health.</span> <span id="s346">We figured that she would be all alone in the whole world, because we were going to be killed.</span> <span id="s347">My father didn’t cry a lot for himself.</span> <span id="s348">But what happened is that they let us go an hour or so later, after they robbed everyone.</span> <span id="s349">They just took whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s350">That evening, they came to the house and took my father, they said ‘for work”.</span> <span id="s351">But our apartment was in the same building as the pharmacy.</span> <span id="s352">They got oil to oil their rifles from the pharmacy.</span> <span id="s353">We thought that it was true that they took him for work, but they killed him that same night.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: How did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: After years!</span> <span id="s356">That evening, after my father had been taken, an older man came in, whom I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s357">He talked to my mother.</span> <span id="s358">Nobody knew me and I didn’t know them, because I was away at school.</span> <span id="s359">He told my mother to make me run away.</span> <span id="s360">He told my mother that he had once been designated to be killed, but that he didn’t wait, that he ran away.</span> <span id="s361">He ran away so he was still alive.</span> <span id="s362">He told my mother: “Make her run into the woods, make her run anyplace.”</span> <span id="s363">My mother said, “A young girl, how can she?</span> <span id="s364">Where would she go?</span> <span id="s365">How can I let her go?”</span> <span id="s366">However he said: “If she won’t go she will be killed by the Nazis.”</span> <span id="s367">So, my mother said: “If you are right, she needs to wear clothes like a country girl:.</span> <span id="s368">She meant for me to cover my hair because my hair would identify that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s369">You know, I have curly hair and most of the Russians have straight, blond hair.</span> <span id="s370">So I ran away, in the morning.</span> <span id="s371">I didn’t know where to run, but we were in a war, where there was no information, we didn’t have any newspapers, no radio, we didn’t know anything about what was going on.</span> <span id="s372">So people would say: “The Russians are coming”.</span> <span id="s373">That was good for us.</span> <span id="s374">They said that the Russians were pushing the Nazis back, so we were very happy about it.</span> <span id="s375">Of course, we were not in love with the Russians, with the government, but, at least they did not kill us.</span> <span id="s376">So, since the fellow told me to run, I ran in the direction where the Russians would be, on the road to Smolensk.</span> <span id="s377">I thought that the Russians had freed Smolensk, due east of Minsk.</span> <span id="s378">I went by the small road because I didn’t dare go by the main highway.</span> <span id="s379">I thought: “What if somebody catches me?</span> <span id="s380">What should I tell them?”</span> <span id="s381">So I decided that I would stay around where my parents were.</span> <span id="s382">I had no money, nothing.</span> <span id="s383">Actually money was nothing, you could not buy anything for money.</span> <span id="s384">So I was dressed in these clothes of a country girl, and that is all I had.</span> <span id="s385">I waited for somebody to ask me: “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s386">Or “Where do you want to go?”</span> <span id="s387">So I decided that I was going to say that I ran away from a prison, because there were many people in prisons.</span> <span id="s388">The prisons were full of people.</span> <span id="s389">They were in prison only if they stole such as if you worked with sugar or whatever one could put one’s hands on.</span> <span id="s390">They would steal such things, because people would not accept money if you wanted to buy bread.</span> <span id="s391">All the people stole what they could from the place where they worked because everyone worked for the government and the government didn’t take money so other ways had to be found.</span> <span id="s392">You put some sugar in your pocket and, if they catch you, you were put in a prison.</span> <span id="s393">So I would say that I was put into the prison, and now, the Nazis let us go, because they didn’t want to see that.</span> <span id="s394">I would tell them that, now I was going to my parents.</span> <span id="s395">I would try to ask the people for directions to the little town on the way to Nagidor (I am not certain of this name).</span> <span id="s396">That is the direction in which I would have to go if I was to get to the Russians.</span> <span id="s397">So I would go from one little town, to another little town.</span> <span id="s398">When I came to a town where there were Jewish people I had to rest.</span> <span id="s399">It was 40 km (about 25 miles) from my house.</span> <span id="s400">It was the third day.</span> <span id="s401">When I saw that little town with Jewish people in it I said: “Here, dear God, you are still alive.</span> <span id="s402">Run!”</span> <span id="s403">Of course we didn’t know where to run.</span> <span id="s404">They could not run the way I did.</span> <span id="s405">I said that.</span> <span id="s406">They said: “ You are a Communist!</span> <span id="s407">You are just spreading propaganda!”</span> <span id="s408">They didn’t believe it that the Nazis would kill us.</span> <span id="s409">I said: “Why would I do that?”</span> <span id="s410">And I added: “Wait, they took my father away!”</span> <span id="s411">They still wouldn’t listen to me.</span> <span id="s412">I thought: “Maybe they are right.</span> <span id="s413">I left my mother and my sister”, my sister was never in good health.</span> <span id="s414">Then I thought: “Why shouldn’t I be with them?</span> <span id="s415">What is the matter with me?</span> <span id="s416">I should be there.</span> <span id="s417">I am going back!”</span> <span id="s418">I was in a strange little town.</span> <span id="s419">I talked to a man, who was very sick, they called him the prosecutor.</span> <span id="s420">He was actually a shoemaker but he was so smart.</span> <span id="s421">Actually I did not know him myself but I judged him by the way people talked about him.</span> <span id="s422">I told him that I was sorry that I ran away, and I told him: “You know what, I am going back!”</span> <span id="s423">I said: “ I ran away from my mother and my sister and people will say that I am stupid; they don’t do anything to the Jews.</span> <span id="s424">They probably took my father for work.”</span> <span id="s425">I said: “I am going back!”</span> <span id="s426">He said: ‘ No, you’re not going back!</span> <span id="s427">Your mother was killed, your sister was killed.”</span> <span id="s428">This was not true.</span> <span id="s429">I found out after the war stopped that my mother and my sister lived for six more months.</span> <span id="s430">However I suppose that he told me that in order not to let me go back.</span> <span id="s431">When he told me that, I cried very hard, of course.</span> <span id="s432">He told me that my sister had put bad luck on the Nazis and that I would have to go on walking.</span> <span id="s433">So I walked, and I walked and I walked and I walked and it started to get cold and snow started falling.</span> <span id="s434">I didn’t have any warm clothes.</span> <span id="s435">I actually didn’t even have cold clothes.</span> <span id="s436">Vermin got upon me.</span> <span id="s437">I got head lices.</span> <span id="s438">I couldn’t wash myself.</span> <span id="s439">I didn’t have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s440">However I couldn’t stop.</span> <span id="s441">I had to go on.</span> <span id="s442">I would get into a house, they would let me sleep sometimes.</span> <span id="s443">Most of the time they let me sleep overnight, before I went further.</span> <span id="s444">Sometimes people would even give me something to eat.</span> <span id="s445">I went on and on and my head opened here and I got open sores and the lice would walk over my wound.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Do you want to stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No, let us go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Do you remember anything about the people you stayed with?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s450">One lady said: “if I let you in, maybe someone will let my husband in, because he was in the war.”</span> <span id="s451">She didn’t know whether he was alive.</span> <span id="s452">Maybe he was running as I was because some parts of the army had split up when they were defeated.</span> <span id="s453">Maybe he also running, like me, without a home, without food, without anything.</span> <span id="s454">I said: “Would you let him stop over there?”</span> <span id="s455">She let me rest.</span> <span id="s456">She didn’t have a bathtub like that but it was a little town and she went out for some water and put it in a container.</span> <span id="s457">I washed myself.</span> <span id="s458">She even gave me something to put on my wound.</span> <span id="s459">Then I had to go further, and I went.</span> <span id="s460">I went every night someplace and I had to ask people to let me in because there was snow.</span> <span id="s461">There was a lot of snow.</span> <span id="s462">Still I had to walk.</span> <span id="s463">I walked like that for three months -- maybe four months.</span> <span id="s464">I am not certain.</span> <span id="s465">One night I heard shooting and in the morning the Russian army was around where I was.</span> <span id="s466">The Russians had pushed the Nazis back.</span> <span id="s467">I believe that by that time it was the beginning of 1942.</span> <span id="s468">So I was so happy.</span> <span id="s469">I said: “Probably they will give me some help.</span> <span id="s470">Maybe they will give me some transportation.</span> <span id="s471">Maybe they will give me some shoes because my shoes were all torn up.”</span> <span id="s472">I had had to put some rags on my feet.</span> <span id="s473">My feet were frozen and the skin would come off.</span> <span id="s474">I told them that I was Jewish, that I didn’t have anything, that I had run away from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s475">They would listen to me as you listen to a dog.</span> <span id="s476">That is what they did to me.</span> <span id="s477">They didn’t care.</span> <span id="s478">They had their own problems of course.</span> <span id="s479">So the last night in that house where I was when the Russians came I told them that I was going to Moscow because I had a sister in Moscow.</span> <span id="s480">This was the only relative I had.</span> <span id="s481">I said: “I have to get there!”</span> <span id="s482">What else could I do?</span> <span id="s483">The lady I was staying with had a daughter living in Moscow.</span> <span id="s484">She didn’t know whether her daughter is alive and her daughter didn’t know if she is alive, since there was no mail in the country.</span> <span id="s485">So the lady asked me to, if I ever got to Moscow, to at least give a letter to her daughter.</span> <span id="s486">I said that I would try.</span> <span id="s487">She gave me some clothes, into which I changed.</span> <span id="s488">They were fresh clothes!</span> <span id="s489">That was so nice!</span> <span id="s490">On the way to Moscow I was walking in the deep snow.</span> <span id="s491">I still didn’t have any transportation.</span> <span id="s492">I heard a car behind me and I obviously had to go to the side to let the car through.</span> <span id="s493">The guy who was driving stopped.</span> <span id="s494">He said: “And where are you going in that big heavy snow?”</span> <span id="s495">I told him that I was going to Moscow.</span> <span id="s496">He asked me: “Do you have a Moscow passport?”</span> <span id="s497">I said: “No, I have nothing with me.”</span> <span id="s498">He said: “How come you are going there?”</span> <span id="s499">I told him that is where my only sister is, all the other members of my family have been shot.</span> <span id="s500">He said: “They won’t let you in in Moscow.</span> <span id="s501">You have to have a Moscow passport.”</span> <span id="s502">I said: “I have to?”</span> <span id="s503">So he said: “I have barrels in my truck.</span> <span id="s504">Get in a barrel and hide there well.</span> <span id="s505">If they catch you -- because they will probably check the truck – tell them that I didn’t see you, that you hid away by yourself.”</span> <span id="s506">I said: “OK, I will do that.”</span> <span id="s507">I was very pleased and thanked him.</span> <span id="s508">We got into Moscow without my being seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: They didn’t stop the truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: They probably did.</span> <span id="s511">I don’t remember exactly -- although I am surprised that I don’t remember it because it was an important moment in my life.</span> <span id="s512">However I truly haven’t thought about it in 40 years.</span> <span id="s513">So I came to Moscow, and I began to look for my sister.</span> <span id="s514">I had her address.</span> <span id="s515">I still remember the street name and I know that it was in District 1V of Moscow.</span> <span id="s516">I cam there but there was no school around there.</span> <span id="s517">My sister had been in an Institute of the University.</span> <span id="s518">The school had been evacuated -- we didn’t know where they were evacuated to.</span> <span id="s519">So I did not know what to do with myself.</span> <span id="s520">Then I remembered about the letter and I said: “I am going to find these people.’</span> <span id="s521">I found them and they were so happy to hear that her mother was alive.</span> <span id="s522">The people I came to lived in a half basement.</span> <span id="s523">They gave me a place to sleep, they gave me a bath, they gave me food and they gave me fresh clothes, not new but fresh clothes, to change to.</span> <span id="s524">Oh!</span> <span id="s525">I was so happy!</span> <span id="s526">then they suggested that I go to a “evacupunkt”, that is a place to which they evacuate people.</span> <span id="s527">I got there and I told them my story.</span> <span id="s528">I remember that they gave me a piece of white bread to eat.</span> <span id="s529">I remember that I gobbled it all up like a dog.</span> <span id="s530">I was so hungry, you know.</span> <span id="s531">There also was a Chinese boy.</span> <span id="s532">He told me that he didn’t like that bread and he gave me his bread.</span> <span id="s533">I ate both pieces and I was still hungry.</span> <span id="s534">So they sent me to a displace persons center (DP) away from Moscow.</span> <span id="s535">There they gave me a place where I could live with another girl in one room with another family.</span> <span id="s536">The girl was a Jewish- Polish girl, of about my age.</span> <span id="s537">We slept in one bed.</span> <span id="s538">That was OK.</span> <span id="s539">You know what else one could expect?</span> <span id="s540">Next I got a job.</span> <span id="s541">Once I was sitting at the table and one woman was waiting for me to take her name.</span> <span id="s542">What I was working in a place where they drew blood to send to the soldiers.</span> <span id="s543">That woman said: “You got a letter today!’</span> <span id="s544">I said: “Why, did you see it?”</span> <span id="s545">I got really excited when she said “Yes1” and wondered who I could get a letter from.</span> <span id="s546">The letter was from my sister.</span> <span id="s547">My sister was still in Moscow!</span> <span id="s548">They had evacuated her from one place to another.</span> <span id="s549">Later the Nazi armies started to get closer to the city to which I had been evacuated.</span> <span id="s550">I got so afraid that the same thing which happened before, would happen again.</span> <span id="s551">I said that I had to get out of there.</span> <span id="s552">This time I went by train.</span> <span id="s553">I said good-bye to my friend, to the girl I lived with.</span> <span id="s554">I told her: “I am not going to stay here any longer.</span> <span id="s555">I am so scared!</span> <span id="s556">I am going to Middle-Asia, actually I mean Central-Asia.”</span> <span id="s557">I remember that I got some groceries, a jar of honey amongst other things.</span> <span id="s558">When I came to Central-Asia, in a little small town.</span> <span id="s559">There we worked with cotton.</span> <span id="s560">I didn’t like it there because I had no friends.</span> <span id="s561">So I stayed there for a couple of months, and I said: “No, I don’t like it here -- I will go to another place!”</span> <span id="s562">When I got to the train station, my jar with the honey fell out and broke.</span> <span id="s563">We usually say that this is for happiness, when something broke like this.</span> <span id="s564">Actually within a short time I met my husband, my future husband.</span> <span id="s565">He was from Poland.</span> <span id="s566">I was from Russia.</span> <span id="s567">He had his problems he went through when he ran away from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s568">In a short time we got married.</span> <span id="s569">It was not really a matter of love.</span> <span id="s570">I suggested to David that we could make it easier.</span> <span id="s571">We went to the justice of the peace and that is the way we got married.</span> <span id="s572">We called the few friends we had together and we made a little party.</span> <span id="s573">We really didn’t have much with which we could make a party.</span> <span id="s574">Then we lived together for 37 years.</span> <span id="s575">I had three children.</span> <span id="s576">The first child was born in Russia, it was the first year after I got married, at the end of 1942.</span> <span id="s577">That was my oldest boy.</span> <span id="s578">Then the war stopped in 1945 and my husband said: “We will go to Poland.”</span> <span id="s579">They said that the Polish people can come to Poland.</span> <span id="s580">We took my sister along.</span> <span id="s581">First she didn’t want to go, but then she decided to go, then she decided that she wouldn’t go, back and forth, but finally she said that she would go with us.</span> <span id="s582">There was no family except me.</span> <span id="s583">So we took her along.</span> <span id="s584">She got married in Poland.</span> <span id="s585">I had two more children in Poland.</span> <span id="s586">Then we came to the U.S. in 1964.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: How long was it between the time you left Moscow and the time you went to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: I was in Moscow for only two days.</span> <span id="s589">They didn’t let me stay longer.</span> <span id="s590">And I left Russia in 1946.</span> <span id="s591">So I was in Poland for 18 years.</span> <span id="s592">Now Polish is my main language, because I had two children there, they went to school.</span> <span id="s593">I had to check their homework.</span> <span id="s594">So I learned Polish very well and another thing here, I speak Polish.</span> <span id="s595">I even write to my sister in Polish.</span> <span id="s596">My sister is in Israel.</span> <span id="s597">She has three boys.</span> <span id="s598">Her husband was a bad one, she did not have a good husband.</span> <span id="s599">I am ashamed to say that he left her, three years ago, for a young woman, thirty years old, and he is sixty.</span> <span id="s600">He has children older than his new wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Your sister moved to Israel from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes, I was supposed to move to Israel, but my daughter got sick, at the time when we received the telegram to get into the boat (for Israel).</span> <span id="s603">So we decided that we would go to Australia, because there was no way to go to the U.S., but all my life I had dreamed about coming to the U.S. I still remembered that we once got money from the U.S., from our uncle.</span> <span id="s604">We could get stockings and such.</span> <span id="s605">So I felt that it was a very good country and I dreamed about America.</span> <span id="s606">Then there was a way to come to America, instead of Australia, so I decided that I better not go to Australia.</span> <span id="s607">So here I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Do you remember much about your life during the four years you lived in Russia?</span> <span id="s609">During the war?</span> <span id="s610">When you were first married?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s612">I remember.</span> <span id="s613">After we got married we had to live in a room with another couple, an older couple.</span> <span id="s614">People who had honeymoons had their own little place, even if it was one little room, but not us.</span> <span id="s615">I had to live in the same room with that couple, even the first night after getting married, in that one, same little room.</span> <span id="s616">That was disturbing.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Was it difficult to find a place?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yes, it was, very difficult.</span> <span id="s619">In the beginning it was impossible.</span> <span id="s620">Later, we found a place.</span> <span id="s621">It took awhile.</span> <span id="s622">After that first, older couple, we had to move to another place, where we lived with another couple.</span> <span id="s623">But in that second place, at least, they had another bedroom, although they had to pass through the same room.</span> <span id="s624">But finally we got our own room.</span> <span id="s625">This kind of was our own home.</span> <span id="s626">It was only a room.</span> <span id="s627">There was a kitchen and everything in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Did you have problems because you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s629">Do you remember anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: We just were not liked because of it, but we managed.</span> <span id="s631">Really we did live a quiet life.</span> <span id="s632">We didn’t bother anybody.</span> <span id="s633">I can’t say that they bothered us a lot.</span> <span id="s634">They didn’t like us.</span> <span id="s635">It caused problems.</span> <span id="s636">I don’t really know why.</span> <span id="s637">However no one really did us harm.</span> <span id="s638">Who cared what they did say, with the war going on at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Do you remember much about what was going on in the world then?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: No, we didn’t have any newspaper or radios.</span> <span id="s641">As I said: I was not a politician, never was and I still am not, even now, I know nothing about politics, not much anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: What did your husband do?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: My husband was a tailor.</span> <span id="s644">But you could say, in general terms, that he was a businessman.</span> <span id="s645">In Russia he was in a concentration camp, that was not by the Nazi, but by the Russians.</span> <span id="s646">I don’t exactly know if you would call it a concentration camp, it was at first a work camp.</span> <span id="s647">He was not allowed out from there.</span> <span id="s648">It was in Siberia.</span> <span id="s649">He had a weight problem; he was very thin because they didn’t get food -- you know I mean that they didn’t get proper feeding.</span> <span id="s650">He weighted 50 kg (about 110 lbs.)</span> <span id="s651">Actually I guess that it was even less than that -- once he weighed 100 lbs.</span> <span id="s652">At work he had to carry sacks of sugar that weighed 100 kg -- twice his weight.</span> <span id="s653">He had to work so very hard.</span> <span id="s654">He was a tiny man, thin and not in very good health.</span> <span id="s655">That work made him sick.</span> <span id="s656">He had an accident, at work.</span> <span id="s657">He hurt his spleen.</span> <span id="s658">From then on his spleen was enlarged through all his life.</span> <span id="s659">He had pain.</span> <span id="s660">In the beginning the pain was severe, but afterwards he seemed better and the pain was not so severe.</span> <span id="s661">In the beginning he was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s662">However his spleen was always enlarged.</span> <span id="s663">In 1975, they performed surgery.</span> <span id="s664">That destroyed him, I feel certain, since I believe that the surgery did him no good.</span> <span id="s665">After the surgery he was in terrible pain.</span> <span id="s666">He had to have another surgery and another surgery and then they amputated his leg.</span> <span id="s667">He lived without that leg for one-and-a-half years, then he passed away.</span> <span id="s668">He was in terrible pain at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: You said that he was from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s671">He went back there, after the war and he didn’t find anyone alive.</span> <span id="s672">His parents had been very young.</span> <span id="s673">His mother was 43 and his father was about the same age.</span> <span id="s674">There were six children and nobody, but nobody was alive.</span> <span id="s675">His parents were in the Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s676">You probably did hear about the Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s677">We didn’t know how his brothers and sisters were killed.</span> <span id="s678">One of his sisters was so beautiful that when she walked everybody would turn around.</span> <span id="s679">She was so beautiful, I never met her, however my husband told me and a cousin of his told me also.</span> <span id="s680">She was taken by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s681">She had a little baby and her husband said: “When my wife goes, I go also.”</span> <span id="s682">He went with her and they were both killed.</span> <span id="s683">One of the sisters was also in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s684">She was 14.</span> <span id="s685">There were also three more brothers of my husbands, we never found out how and where they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Where in Poland did your husband come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: In Stettin, (today this is the town of Szczecin).</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Do you recall anything about your life in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yes, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Was your husband a tailor again?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yes, he was.</span> <span id="s692">There was some anti-Semitism when my daughter was three years old.</span> <span id="s693">The neighbor, next door had a grandchild who was also three years old, maybe the grandchild was two-and-a-half years old.</span> <span id="s694">The two children got into a fight.</span> <span id="s695">The old lady came our to my daughter and put her in a corner under the stairs and said: “You, Jew, you killed Jesus Christ, now you want to kill my granddaughter!”</span> <span id="s696">My three-year old got scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Did you have any other problems like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Yes, we had.</span> <span id="s699">My husband was riding once, in the train, and they wanted to throw him out.</span> <span id="s700">They were some Polish men.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Not from the running train?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Yes, from the running train.</span> <span id="s703">It was lucky that they didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s704">Still they had threatened him.</span> <span id="s705">When he came he had been so scared.</span> <span id="s706">He never wanted to go again by train, to be treated like that.</span> <span id="s707">That is the reason why we left Poland.</span> <span id="s708">We truly had actually never had wanted to live in Poland.</span> <span id="s709">However there was no way to get out of there, so we lived in Poland for 18 years.</span> <span id="s710">We had three children and we did not get any babysitters and anyway I was not able to get a job there.</span> <span id="s711">My vision was always bad after the war.</span> <span id="s712">Before the war it had been fine or else I could not have finished my architectorial school.</span> <span id="s713">There I had to make drawings without glasses.</span> <span id="s714">However the walking without food -- some of it in the fresh snow -- my vision became bad.</span> <span id="s715">I went to doctors.</span> <span id="s716">What they gave me was stronger and stronger glasses.</span> <span id="s717">That was all they could do.</span> <span id="s718">Now there are no more stronger glasses available.</span> <span id="s719">So, since you had to be able to read and write to get a job I couldn’t get one.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Did you, officially, meet Jewish people while you were in Poland?</span> <span id="s721">Did you have friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s723">We had some friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Did you attend Synagogue there?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Not very much.</span> <span id="s726">Sometimes, maybe twice a year for the High Holidays.</span> <span id="s727">I think that, maybe people don’t like me very much.</span> <span id="s728">Maybe it is because I don’t recognize them.</span> <span id="s729">When I walk in the street and somebody will come by and shake their heads, as people often do, to greet me, I don’t notice it.</span> <span id="s730">People think that I don’t want to notice them.</span> <span id="s731">Maybe that is the reason, or maybe I am just not a likeable person.</span> <span id="s732">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s733">However this is how it has been all my life.</span> <span id="s734">People say that I don’t look at people.</span> <span id="s735">I look, but I can’t see them -- you know.</span> <span id="s736">It is hard for me because I have very bad vision, as you can tell by looking at my glasses.</span> <span id="s737">The first time you were here, I looked different, didn’t I?</span> <span id="s738">Isn’t that so?</span> <span id="s739">You don’t remember!</span> <span id="s740">I was wearing contacts, however when I do I still have to wear glasses.</span> <span id="s741">The other glasses look better than these, but I can wear them only with contacts.</span> <span id="s742">However I don’t like the contacts because they are not so good for my vision.</span> <span id="s743">You see, the doctor tells me that I have to remember to blink, when I wear my contacts, because if I don’t blink and because my contacts are pretty big and they are made of plastic so my eyes don’t get oxygen.</span> <span id="s744">Sometimes I see like through a milk glass.</span> <span id="s745">Therefore I try to avoid the contacts.</span> <span id="s746">However when I want to look a little better, you know, so I wore the contacts.</span> <span id="s747">I also wear them when I went to a singles group.</span> <span id="s748">Then I put on contacts.</span> <span id="s749">However they are not good for me.</span> <span id="s750">I cannot afford losing any of my remaining vision.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: What was the main language which you spoke at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Did your husband speak Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s755">We also spoke some Yiddish too, but not all that much.</span> <span id="s756">For some reason, we adopted the Polish language.</span> <span id="s757">Maybe because of the children.</span> <span id="s758">They were born there and then they started to speak Polish.</span> <span id="s759">Maybe it was a mistake that I didn’t start with Yiddish, the way my parents did.</span> <span id="s760">I don’t know, but most of the Jews we knew spoke Polish with their children.</span> <span id="s761">So did we.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Did they attend school?</span> <span id="s763">I mean public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Were there any special events which occurred which made you finally decide to leave Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: We wanted to go right away.</span> <span id="s767">When we returned to Poland from Russia, the Poles threw rocks into our train, when we first arrived from Russia.</span> <span id="s768">Some of the Christian Poles put Jews in the windows of the train so that the people, who were going to be hit by the rock, would be Jews.</span> <span id="s769">Jews were the ones they intended to throw the rocks against.</span> <span id="s770">Obviously there were some Christians coming back from Russia.</span> <span id="s771">The Christians put Jesus in their windows so that the rocks would not be thrown against them.</span> <span id="s772">So my husband wanted to leave Poland, escape from Poland to the free world.</span> <span id="s773">But that was illegal, still people did.</span> <span id="s774">In order to flee Poland they tried to keep the children under control.</span> <span id="s775">Sometimes in attempts to do that they would kill the children by smothering them with a pillow to keep them from crying out.</span> <span id="s776">That happened generally while they were trying to cross a border.</span> <span id="s777">Obviously this suffocation of children was not done intentionally, of course it didn’t happen often, but still it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Did you know people who were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: We could have left Poland right away.</span> <span id="s780">In order to leave you had to pay money.</span> <span id="s781">Maybe they would not have charged us much, because he (the fellow who smuggled people out of Poland) was a friend of my husband’s.</span> <span id="s782">But I was afraid that something would happen to my child, he was one-and-a-half year old.</span> <span id="s783">I was afraid that he would be suffocated.</span> <span id="s784">We also didn’t know where to go after we crossed the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: That is when you found out about your parents, as you mentioned previously?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: I found out in Russia, after the war was over in 1945.</span> <span id="s787">I wrote a letter to my friends in the little town where I had lived before our last move.</span> <span id="s788">She wrote me that there were some who survived, Russians, not Jewish people.</span> <span id="s789">Her sister was a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s790">We went to school together.</span> <span id="s791">She also was cute, that Russian girl.</span> <span id="s792">She worked with the Russian underground.</span> <span id="s793">I found out that my principal, whom I had in the last grade in school, was also with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s794">That was hard to believe.</span> <span id="s795">I have no idea whether he was made to work with the Nazis or whether he volunteered.</span> <span id="s796">Of course, since I never went back to that little town I don’t know whether it is true or not.</span> <span id="s797">I didn’t have to go there and I didn’t want to -- ever.</span> <span id="s798">Maybe that was a mistake.</span> <span id="s799">Maybe I should have gone there to find out for myself.</span> <span id="s800">However I dreamed many times of that.</span> <span id="s801">In my dreams I would come there and my house was in peace.</span> <span id="s802">Actually it wasn’t our house, it belonged to the government.</span> <span id="s803">Maybe I should have gone there; but since nobody was left alive; why should I?</span> <span id="s804">With a small child, by then.</span> <span id="s805">It really wasn’t that easy for me to go there from Asia to the region of Minsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Do you remember the place where you were in Central Asia?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Vehvaly (that is what it sounds like but the transcriber can not locate it, however EF spelled it as shown).</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Do you remember anything about Poland which you would like to tell us about?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: I can tell you how I got here.</span> <span id="s810">Do you want to hear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Could it wait until the next time, when I will interview you again?</span> <span id="s812">If that is OK with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: This is the second interview with Mrs. Emma Fiszlewitz at her home on May 7, 1981 at IDAM.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Before we begin today, would you like to add anything to what we talked about before in regards to your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: I didn’t go over what we spoke about before, in my mind.</span> <span id="s817">I am busy teaching English to Russian Jews (that was the time when families of Russian Jews who had succeeded in leaving Russia were being resettled in the Dayton, Ohio area).</span> <span id="s818">Teach them to write English and to teach them Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Let us start then with when you decided to come to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: We applied to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s821">My sister went to Israel.</span> <span id="s822">When the time came for us to go to Israel, when the telegram came, my daughter, who was three years old at the time, was very sick.</span> <span id="s823">She had strep throat.</span> <span id="s824">She was very sick, we couldn’t go, we had to stay on in Poland.</span> <span id="s825">Life is very hard in Israel.</span> <span id="s826">The immigrants live in the beginning in barracks, made of iron -- they were very hot.</span> <span id="s827">We didn’t think all that much of Israel.</span> <span id="s828">Maybe that wasn’t all that nice if us, but we never had had a good day in our lives yet, and we wanted things to be easier.</span> <span id="s829">We couldn’t go to the U.S., but there was a way to go to Australia and my husband had cousins there.</span> <span id="s830">We were pretty happy with that idea, so we decided to go to Australia.</span> <span id="s831">Before we could get the papers we found out that the people who were born in Russia were able to go to the U.S. I had uncles in the U.S. about whom I told you.</span> <span id="s832">These uncles had wanted to have my father come over and they would open a pharmacy for him in the U.S.</span> <span id="s833">They were going to provide us with money to buy food and clothing.</span> <span id="s834">So when I heard that there was a chance to come I was very happy.</span> <span id="s835">I already had a passport to go to Australia, so I went to Warsaw and asked the people, who were in charge of all this stuff, to change my passport.</span> <span id="s836">They gave me a little paper and said that it was OK.</span> <span id="s837">We returned to the city of Stettin, where we lived, and received a note from the police.</span> <span id="s838">It told us to come over that day, then we got so scared, we were scared that they were going to harm us because I changed from one place to another.</span> <span id="s839">So my husband asked me: “Now, what did you do?</span> <span id="s840">Now we are going to be in trouble!”</span> <span id="s841">So I went to the police.</span> <span id="s842">My husband came with me also, but he wanted to remain outside, to see what would happen.</span> <span id="s843">We were both scared.</span> <span id="s844">As a matter of fact we were so scared that we couldn’t sleep all night.</span> <span id="s845">However nothing really happened and they just changed my visa.</span> <span id="s846">We had thought that they would take my papers away, but they just validated them to go to the USA.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: How did that become possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Because I was born in Russia and could travel under the Russian quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: What about your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: I could take my husband, he had that right; and my children also.</span> <span id="s851">So everything got prepared to go to the U.S.</span> <span id="s852">We received a note from the embassy a note to come over-- that was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s853">We went there to sign the papers and obtain the visa.</span> <span id="s854">They asked for a copy of my Russian birth certificate.</span> <span id="s855">I had to tell them that I didn’t have any copy.</span> <span id="s856">I had established through the courts in Poland, that I was born in Russia.</span> <span id="s857">He said: “No, no, that is not good, we need an original!”</span> <span id="s858">I asked: “ How am I going to get such a document?”</span> <span id="s859">I had to go to school, so I had it, but where am I going to get such a thing now?”</span> <span id="s860">So he said: “I am sorry!”</span> <span id="s861">So I went back to the secretary and I said: “ Oh, Gosh!</span> <span id="s862">What can I do?</span> <span id="s863">We were all prepared to go to the U.S. with the Self-Help organization (this was a Jewish organization which helped settle new immigrants to the U.S.).</span> <span id="s864">With all the furniture.”</span> <span id="s865">We were ready to go.</span> <span id="s866">She said: “He is a nice man.</span> <span id="s867">Go again and ask him.”</span> <span id="s868">So I went back in and I said in English: “I have been learning English for years.</span> <span id="s869">If you only could let me go.”</span> <span id="s870">Because I took English lessons over the radio.</span> <span id="s871">There were such lessons twice a week over the radio.</span> <span id="s872">The whole family also learned English, but very little.</span> <span id="s873">When he heard me speaking English, he signed my papers right away.</span> <span id="s874">Oh, my children were so surprised and my husband was so happy.</span> <span id="s875">I don’t remember which date it was that we got our visas.</span> <span id="s876">It was the beginning of 1964.</span> <span id="s877">We came here on April 29, 1964.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Where did you arrive at?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: In the port of New York.</span> <span id="s880">They took us right here to Dayton.</span> <span id="s881">My husband wanted to live in NYC, because in NYC he had friends and in NYC he may have been able to have his own business.</span> <span id="s882">Here he had to work for $1:60 an hour (that was minimum wage, at the time) -- so he was very, very unhappy, since for this $1:60 you couldn’t make a living.</span> <span id="s883">My son made $1:00 an hour and he gave us his check.</span> <span id="s884">He was so happy, he made once an extra $5:00 for something he did.</span> <span id="s885">I was ironing clothes in the basement and he came in: ‘Mamie, Mamie!”</span> <span id="s886">I didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s887">He said: “I have $5:00 an extra $5:00”.</span> <span id="s888">He was so happy.</span> <span id="s889">He gave me all the money he earned.</span> <span id="s890">So finally we bought the business because my husband wasn’t very happy working for $1:60 an hour.</span> <span id="s891">He started to feel bad with some kind of pain in his back.</span> <span id="s892">So we bought the business.</span> <span id="s893">Then he again became unhappy because we didn’t have money to operate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Could you explain what kind of business it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Dry cleaning business.</span> <span id="s896">I had to write the names and I could not understand what was said and how to write.</span> <span id="s897">We had to operate machines.</span> <span id="s898">We had to hire a man who does it, but he was drunk and sometimes he would not come and the machine would break.</span> <span id="s899">There was nobody we could call to repair it.</span> <span id="s900">My husband didn’t know anything about machines.</span> <span id="s901">He was a tailor.</span> <span id="s902">He is rather a businessman.</span> <span id="s903">If I would have let him he would have had businesses all over the State.</span> <span id="s904">However I was the administrator, and my English was terrible.</span> <span id="s905">We had only been in the country for maybe two-and-a-half years or three years in the U.S., altogether.</span> <span id="s906">I could do a few things, but to be such an administrator was very hard for me, but if we had more business, I would go crazy.</span> <span id="s907">I was almost crazy.</span> <span id="s908">I cried every night, because we left the house in the dark in the morning and came home in the dark.</span> <span id="s909">My daughter was only ten years old.</span> <span id="s910">She never had had a working mother.</span> <span id="s911">I didn’t have to work in Poland.</span> <span id="s912">We made enough to get by.</span> <span id="s913">As you might say, it was not too bad.</span> <span id="s914">My husband had had a clothing store in Poland.</span> <span id="s915">My daughter said: “In Poland, my mother is home, and here my mother goes to work from dark to dark.</span> <span id="s916">I don’t see her.</span> <span id="s917">I have to cook dinner, clean the house and take care of everything.”</span> <span id="s918">So I was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s919">We couldn’t only do the business which came in through the door, we had to take over the business from the guy we had bought the dry cleaning business from.</span> <span id="s920">We had to take care of the business from motels in order to get enough money to pay the bills.</span> <span id="s921">It was stuff which we had to pick up in the morning, not very early, only at 9:am, and by 5:pm we had to have everything back.</span> <span id="s922">Oh, that was quite a rush business.</span> <span id="s923">Sometimes the machine would break, sometimes, the girls wouldn’t come -- sometimes something would be mixed up.</span> <span id="s924">We also did laundry.</span> <span id="s925">W also had machines to do the shirts.</span> <span id="s926">If something got lost or mixed up or torn it got expensive at $18:00 or $25:00 per shirt.</span> <span id="s927">One time we had to pay $175;00 for a suit, because it got hooked on something in the machine and there was a tear.</span> <span id="s928">We didn’t want to lose the business from the motels because without them we couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s929">I cried way into the night and I did probably have a breakdown, but I didn’t go to the doctor.</span> <span id="s930">My son would say: “Mother, think that you are working for somebody, don’t think that you are working for yourself.</span> <span id="s931">Don’t worry!</span> <span id="s932">Somehow it will work out!”</span> <span id="s933">I couldn’t -- I was just very unhappy.</span> <span id="s934">Then we needed a clothes presser rapidly.</span> <span id="s935">I don’t remember what happened but our presser quit.</span> <span id="s936">Are you very interested in what I am telling you?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s938">I wanted to find out how you got established, and how difficult it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: So we needed a presser and I put an ad in the paper.</span> <span id="s940">A man came up and said he was a presser.</span> <span id="s941">So I asked him for an interview and I interviewed him.</span> <span id="s942">He said that he had had a dry cleaning business of his own.</span> <span id="s943">A business in NY.</span> <span id="s944">I said: “If you had your own business.</span> <span id="s945">I don’t think that you are going to work for me.”</span> <span id="s946">So he said: “So I buy it from you!”</span> <span id="s947">So he was ready to buy it from the beginning, from the first day.</span> <span id="s948">I said OK.</span> <span id="s949">We had our machines from the start and we were in the business for 12 years.</span> <span id="s950">When he came up with the idea of buying our business we had been in the business for maybe seven years.</span> <span id="s951">I believe.</span> <span id="s952">We had already bought our shirt unit and we had one more payment left to do for the machines.</span> <span id="s953">So I said: “OK.”</span> <span id="s954">I knew that my husband would like to sell the dry cleaning business and go into the clothing business instead.</span> <span id="s955">I told him that we paid $10,000 for our business, without the shirt unit, and I added: “Give us the $10;000”.</span> <span id="s956">It had actually coat us the $10,000 plus $6,000 for the shirt unit.</span> <span id="s957">He agreed to give us $10,000 after he came to our house to look through the books and papers.</span> <span id="s958">I knew that my husband wanted to take the $10,000 and invest it in a clothing business.</span> <span id="s959">There was a clothing store on Main Street which was going out of business due to bankruptcy so I said to this would be presser: “Listen, I know now how to conduct this business and I will sell it to you.</span> <span id="s960">If we buy another business and if we would not be able to make it -- in the new business -- would you give me a job here?”</span> <span id="s961">He said: “Are you crazy?”</span> <span id="s962">I said: “Am I crazy?</span> <span id="s963">Oh, Oh!</span> <span id="s964">I am not crazy!</span> <span id="s965">I am not going to sell the business to you.”</span> <span id="s966">So we did not sell it.</span> <span id="s967">Then I told myself: “I don’t have to cry.</span> <span id="s968">I own a business!</span> <span id="s969">Why should I cry?</span> <span id="s970">It is hard, sure, but if I work for someone else it will be hard too.”</span> <span id="s971">This fellow opened my eyes.</span> <span id="s972">I told myself.</span> <span id="s973">“I am not unhappy, I don’t have to cry.</span> <span id="s974">We are pulling through!</span> <span id="s975">Next month, once the machines are paid off, I will have $150:00 more each month.</span> <span id="s976">No, I am not going to sell!</span> <span id="s977">My husband didn’t say “No” and he didn’t say “Yes”.</span> <span id="s978">I truly don’t know why because he was not very sick yet.</span> <span id="s979">Of course he was somewhat sick, all his life, because of his spleen injury in the Russian work camp, about which I told you.</span> <span id="s980">They also had him do some welding but gave him nothing to protect his vision.</span> <span id="s981">Once at night he got up and when he came back to his bed, in the dark, he saw all kinds of lights and he layed down on the edge of the bed and hurt himself.</span> <span id="s982">Still he had to go to work in the morning, in spite of his injury.</span> <span id="s983">He had to go 18 kilometers, about 11 miles, by train.</span> <span id="s984">Then he became very sick at the train station and they had to call the ambulance which took him to the hospital.</span> <span id="s985">I got a message that I was to go right away that very day, but that day the train didn’t run any longer due to flooding, on the tracks.</span> <span id="s986">So I went by foot, it was not good for me.</span> <span id="s987">I had walked so much before.</span> <span id="s988">So I walked the 18 kilometers and I found that he was very sick.</span> <span id="s989">I walked back also.</span> <span id="s990">I couldn’t sty there, at the hospital; there was no place to stay.</span> <span id="s991">After a week or so, they discharged him from the hospital and he came back.</span> <span id="s992">He still was not feeling good.</span> <span id="s993">He was very pale.</span> <span id="s994">I would put a chair out for him, in the sun, every day.</span> <span id="s995">I would try to give him good food.</span> <span id="s996">That was very expensive, but I managed to give him every day an egg or some meat, amongst other things.</span> <span id="s997">So he was OK, after awhile.</span> <span id="s998">He was OK, but all the years after that, his spleen was enlarged, that is what the doctors always told him.</span> <span id="s999">But the doctor didn’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s1000">I don’t know whether they can do anything about an enlarged spleen, or whether they can’t.</span> <span id="s1001">When you go to the doctor he gives you pills, he doesn’t tell you much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Was your husband excited about coming to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1004">We all wanted to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Did you receive some kind of aid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Yes, from the Jewish Center.</span> <span id="s1007">As a matter of fact, we were brought over by the HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society).</span> <span id="s1008">They paid for the transportation and they took care of us.</span> <span id="s1009">We stayed in Paris for a whole week, waiting for the boat with which we were to cross the Atlantic.</span> <span id="s1010">They paid for the hotel.</span> <span id="s1011">It was not a very big hotel, but it was a good one.</span> <span id="s1012">We also had friends who were living in Paris.</span> <span id="s1013">We were with them for dinner once or twice.</span> <span id="s1014">We couldn’t afford to buy any better food than we got in the hotel, that means the hot rolls, which were available.</span> <span id="s1015">However we couldn’t get a cooked meal, so we went to our friends.</span> <span id="s1016">Of course, we had Polish money but we were allowed to take only $5:00 per person out.</span> <span id="s1017">That money was exchanged from Polish to American money.</span> <span id="s1018">Therefore we had no money while in Paris.</span> <span id="s1019">We had some crystal with us, and we told our son to sell a crystal vase.</span> <span id="s1020">He went to sell it, but he couldn’t speak French.</span> <span id="s1021">He showed them that he wanted to sell it and a fellow thought that he had stolen it someplace -- so the fellow called the police.</span> <span id="s1022">My son was with a friend, another boy, who was going to come with us to the U.S. also.</span> <span id="s1023">So we had to go to the police station and they just couldn’t understand us.</span> <span id="s1024">I talked Polish, since my English was not good enough.</span> <span id="s1025">Some of the people in the police station spoke English but that was no help.</span> <span id="s1026">Finally we found someone who could speak Yiddish, and we explained.</span> <span id="s1027">So they let us go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: What happened when you came to NYC?</span> <span id="s1029">Was that a family from Dayton which had sponsored you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: It was not a family but a Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s1031">HIAS is a Jewish organization, which helps Jews from all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Did they take care of you in NYC?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yes, when we were in Poland they started to take care of us, and they did continue over here too.</span> <span id="s1034">But we wanted to be in NYC and they would not let us.</span> <span id="s1035">I understand now, we probably could not have made a go over there.</span> <span id="s1036">They gave us an apartment on Lexington Ave. They gave us the most important things like furniture.</span> <span id="s1037">It was OK used furniture.</span> <span id="s1038">They gave us dishes.</span> <span id="s1039">They took care of us for two or three months.</span> <span id="s1040">They also found a job for my husband.</span> <span id="s1041">However, as I told you, that job did not pay much.</span> <span id="s1042">It was not enough.</span> <span id="s1043">However we made it.</span> <span id="s1044">I looked for a job also and went to work, even though the only thing I could find was to be a dishwasher for $1:10 an hour.</span> <span id="s1045">I stayed there, working, for a few months.</span> <span id="s1046">However that made me cry all the time.</span> <span id="s1047">I found it easy to cry, and so did my husband.</span> <span id="s1048">I better not say anything bad, about my husband since he’s not alive any more.</span> <span id="s1049">He was a good guy, but he had a temper.</span> <span id="s1050">Later I worked for Kettering Hospital, first as a dishwasher and then later they transferred me to the kitchen as a salad girl.</span> <span id="s1051">Then my husband bought the business -- so I ran the business for 12 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: How do you describe life here, as compared to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Oh this land here, I have to tell the truth, I cannot lie, one has to work very hard.</span> <span id="s1054">This life we got involved in was too much for us.</span> <span id="s1055">That dry cleaning business is very hard.</span> <span id="s1056">Something always breaks.</span> <span id="s1057">Neither my husband or I could drive and the clothes had to be picked up and delivered the clothes.</span> <span id="s1058">A laundry woman would come to pick up the shirts from us to do them, since at the time we didn’t have a shirt machine, in the morning.</span> <span id="s1059">In the evening one of my two sons, the older one, who at the time worked for the NCR, didn’t have time to eat, he rushed through his food in a minute he had to rush back to get the shirts and deliver them to the store, so I could put them in order.</span> <span id="s1060">Oh, believe me, it was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s1061">We had to work from dark to dark.</span> <span id="s1062">However this fellow, when he wanted to buy the business, he opened my eyes.</span> <span id="s1063">So I stopped crying.</span> <span id="s1064">However I had cried from the beginning, from the first day we had the business until the time came when he wanted to buy it.</span> <span id="s1065">Then my husband got sick in 1975.</span> <span id="s1066">He told me: “Just go on with the business.”</span> <span id="s1067">As a matter of fact he and my younger son picked up another motel, the new Stoufer Motel, to do their laundry.</span> <span id="s1068">That indeed was a big motel with a lot of business.</span> <span id="s1069">We did work for them for probably three years, and then my husband got very sick.</span> <span id="s1070">The doctor said that, when he comes out of the hospital, he would have to go to a nursing home, or I would have to be home.</span> <span id="s1071">So I got rid of the business and I took care of my husband.</span> <span id="s1072">However he didn’t live too long anyway, only two months.</span> <span id="s1073">From then, until now, I didn’t know how well I did that I did not put him in a nursing home.</span> <span id="s1074">I found it out, because just here, about a month ago, in April, I went to a singles group, as I told you; there a lady told me how bad her father was treated in a nursing home.</span> <span id="s1075">Until then I didn’t know how good my decision was to take care of him at home.</span> <span id="s1076">She said that they would give water which was too hot.</span> <span id="s1077">Her father had been amputated also, like my husband.</span> <span id="s1078">My husband was for one-and-a-half years without a leg.</span> <span id="s1079">He had an artificial leg.</span> <span id="s1080">Oh they say how good the artificial legs are.</span> <span id="s1081">Maybe they are very good, maybe it wasn’t the artificial leg but my husband was in pain for four years.</span> <span id="s1082">At the time the doctor made me decide I didn’t know anything about nursing homes -- I just wondered to myself: “Why should I keep this business?”</span> <span id="s1083">So I just sold the business.</span> <span id="s1084">I sold it for pennies.</span> <span id="s1085">For whatever I could get, because he wanted me to be home with him.</span> <span id="s1086">I am so glad that I did that, especially since I found out now, a month ago, that I did a very good thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Before you sold the business, how do you describe any social life you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: I didn’t have any social life, none whatsoever!</span> <span id="s1089">I didn’t have time.</span> <span id="s1090">We were in the store six days a week.</span> <span id="s1091">I always did the bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s1092">I used to pay by check.</span> <span id="s1093">At times I had two girls working for me, at other times one girl, sometimes even three girls, it all depended.</span> <span id="s1094">I had to give them the checks on Tuesdays.</span> <span id="s1095">So every Tuesday morning I got up at four o’clock.</span> <span id="s1096">Somehow I never found time on Sunday to write the checks.</span> <span id="s1097">I had no social life, none whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Did you have a chance to attend synagogue at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Twice a year, on the High Holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: You don’t feel that the synagogue is the center of the Jewish Community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: I don’t want to answer this question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Do you usually associate with Jews or non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Only with Jews.</span> <span id="s1104">I shouldn’t say “only”, there is a lady to whom I am teaching Hebrew, and she is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1105">We became very good friends.</span> <span id="s1106">However I go to the Jewish Center now!</span> <span id="s1107">I am not a “Senior Citizen” yet; but I don’t have any other places to go.</span> <span id="s1108">When I go to another place I feel terrible!</span> <span id="s1109">I don’t have any friends.</span> <span id="s1110">When I go to the Center I meet many people.</span> <span id="s1111">Usually they are older than I am, Senior Citizens.</span> <span id="s1112">These are the friends of mine whom I have now, that is better than nothing.</span> <span id="s1113">They are very nice people, but I cannot find a friend to whom I, maybe, could get married to.</span> <span id="s1114">The men are all too old, and I would not want a very old man for a husband.</span> <span id="s1115">The youngest one is 70 and he does not think to get married, and we have one 94.</span> <span id="s1116">I belong to the singing group.</span> <span id="s1117">I am not saying that I have a good voice however they do want me to be with them, and to sing with them.</span> <span id="s1118">So I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: What else do you participate in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: As I said I give English lessons to Russian couples.</span> <span id="s1121">I teach them a little Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1122">I am learning Hebrew myself.</span> <span id="s1123">(The Russian couples are Jews who were recently resettled in the Dayton area).</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: At the Jewish Center?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yes, I know Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1126">However Yiddish and Hebrew are like day and night.</span> <span id="s1127">So, she was in the class and she couldn’t read when the teacher asked her (Note that Yiddish is a language about 1000 years old which is usually written in Hebrew characters.</span> <span id="s1128">It is basically a Germanic language but with Polish, Hebrew, Aramaic and Roman expressions and words -- it was not written much until the XVIII Century and then was adopted to localities by utilizing local expressions.)</span> <span id="s1129">I felt sorry for her.</span> <span id="s1130">Everybody else could read.</span> <span id="s1131">There were seven students in the Hebrew class.</span> <span id="s1132">Everybody else was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1133">This poor lady, she was about 38 or 39.</span> <span id="s1134">She tried but she just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1135">She was sitting behind me so, when the class ended I said: “Do you mind if I help you?</span> <span id="s1136">I will be happy to.”</span> <span id="s1137">She lived far away from me so we worked together over the telephone, in the morning.</span> <span id="s1138">She had a book and I had a book.</span> <span id="s1139">If she didn’t do it right I corrected her, and that she appreciated.</span> <span id="s1140">I don’t know why I don’t have any non-Jewish friends, but I just don’t have any.</span> <span id="s1141">Oh, come to think of it, I had another very good friend, actually I have more but I just forgot about them.</span> <span id="s1142">That one lady used to work with my husband.</span> <span id="s1143">She is from Latvia or maybe it is Estonia, I am not certain.</span> <span id="s1144">When my husband was very sick, and I had to have an alteration done and I couldn’t do them because I am not a tailor, se would do the alterations for me.</span> <span id="s1145">I nearly forgot about her, being non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1146">She and her husband were very nice people.</span> <span id="s1147">She would do the alterations for me and charge me very, very little.</span> <span id="s1148">She would say: “Emma I am only charging actual cost” So she would charge me only $1:00 and I would charge the customer $3:00.</span> <span id="s1149">She knew that I was making money on this -- she actually wanted me to do that.</span> <span id="s1150">Then there was another very good friend who taught me how to drive.</span> <span id="s1151">I had to learn how to drive, but I was scared of cars because when I was a child there was an accident.</span> <span id="s1152">I was just a little girl, eight years old, and I was playing with a little girl my own age.</span> <span id="s1153">A car came -- that was a strange thing because we didn’t have many cars at that time, we would see a car very seldom around 1930 -- and killed her instantly.</span> <span id="s1154">I was lucky that I was in the house.</span> <span id="s1155">I had just gone into the house to get something, maybe something to eat or drink.</span> <span id="s1156">After that I was so scared of cars.</span> <span id="s1157">When my son started to learn to drive my face was so crazy when I watched him that the lady who was teaching him said: “Emma!</span> <span id="s1158">Will you stop it!</span> <span id="s1159">You are scaring him!”</span> <span id="s1160">I was truly scared of cars, but my husband had to learn and so did my children, but I never wanted to learn.</span> <span id="s1161">I said: “No!</span> <span id="s1162">I will never learn -- I will never want to learn”.</span> <span id="s1163">But when my husband got sick I said: “I have to learn!”</span> <span id="s1164">Oh I was shaking.</span> <span id="s1165">Now I am teaching a young girl how to drive; that young girl had a driver’s license, but she does not have a car.</span> <span id="s1166">That young girl came from Russia five months ago.</span> <span id="s1167">She never had had access to a car in order to practice.</span> <span id="s1168">Now I am ready to go on a vacation with my son and I want her to take care of Mrs. May, and to come to my house and water the flowers.</span> <span id="s1169">So she needs a car, and needs to know how to drive, and that is why I am teaching her so that she can do all these things.</span> <span id="s1170">I hope that it will all work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Do you think much about your former life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: I had a good husband, still I had a hard life.</span> <span id="s1173">I didn’t have a good day in my life.</span> <span id="s1174">Well maybe I had a few good days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Was that before or after you came to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: I am sorry to have to say that I didn’t have a good life in the U.S. I was happy to come here.</span> <span id="s1177">Before I started the business, it wasn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s1178">My husband was not happy, so it made me less happy, when we had to work for someone.</span> <span id="s1179">However once I had a business I got very involved, and I had no time left for myself.</span> <span id="s1180">People said that, in the business, I would run like a chicken without a head.</span> <span id="s1181">That is probably true because I had so many things on my mind.</span> <span id="s1182">On Saturdays, I didn’t have help.</span> <span id="s1183">So on Saturdays, I had to do everything myself.</span> <span id="s1184">If a customer was coming, I had to take care of him.</span> <span id="s1185">I had to take the laundry and the dry cleaning in and check the items off.</span> <span id="s1186">Then I had to clean them if people were in a hurry so that people could get their things back.</span> <span id="s1187">I had to do everything: clean them and wash them and iron them and order material.</span> <span id="s1188">I can’t even tell you how busy I was on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s1189">It was just plain terrible.</span> <span id="s1190">I am truly glad that I don’t have that business anymore.</span> <span id="s1191">I am happy about it.</span> <span id="s1192">It was just too bad that things didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s1193">You know, my husband was dreaming that, after we retired, we would go to Florida and have a good life.</span> <span id="s1194">Maybe we would live there for a while because we never had had a good time yet.</span> <span id="s1195">In the communist countries there is always something to worry about this thinking that in the future, perhaps, it would be OK, but it never happened.</span> <span id="s1196">Maybe we had it worse than some people, I don’t know, but my life certainly was not a happy one.</span> <span id="s1197">Still he was a good husband.</span> <span id="s1198">He would give me whatever he made.</span> <span id="s1199">He didn’t go to other women like some of them do.</span> <span id="s1200">That was OK.</span> <span id="s1201">However we didn’t have time to live.</span> <span id="s1202">Life was very hard for us, indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Did you ever return to Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Oh, God forbid.</span> <span id="s1205">I never wanted to and I don’t want to go to Poland either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: What about your children?</span> <span id="s1207">How do you view their lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: I would say that they are pretty happy.</span> <span id="s1209">They are all married.</span> <span id="s1210">They all have good jobs.</span> <span id="s1211">My older son works for Inland Manufacturing Company and he also is a teacher in Patterson Co-op High School.</span> <span id="s1212">He teaches electronics.</span> <span id="s1213">My younger son is in San Diego, California.</span> <span id="s1214">He has a master’s degree in business.</span> <span id="s1215">He married an American born Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s1216">They are very happy.</span> <span id="s1217">They have a girl, who is two-and-a-half years old now and I am going to visit them at the end of this month.</span> <span id="s1218">My older son is married also.</span> <span id="s1219">He has a little boy.</span> <span id="s1220">His wife is very, very nice.</span> <span id="s1221">I love her.</span> <span id="s1222">She is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1223">She is from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1224">She is a very, very nice lady.</span> <span id="s1225">I can talk to her about anything, even more than I can talk to my daughter.</span> <span id="s1226">My daughter is very nice to me also.</span> <span id="s1227">She works, she is the manager in the nutrition center.</span> <span id="s1228">She finished OSU.</span> <span id="s1229">She wanted to be a vet, but she couldn’t get into the field.</span> <span id="s1230">She married an American boy.</span> <span id="s1231">He converted as my husband wanted.</span> <span id="s1232">They are all OK.</span> <span id="s1233">Each wants me to live with them, but as long as I can be on my own, which means that I am in good health, and I have my own house I am managing OK so far.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Do you have any experiences in your life which you would like to pass on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: I have no idea what is meant by this question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Do you talk much to your children about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: They know.</span> <span id="s1238">I wrote a story about myself and I thought that I would publish it, but I never did.</span> <span id="s1239">I wrote it in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1240">I wrote it in Russian, I wrote it in Polish; it is now laying down someplace in a drawer.</span> <span id="s1241">I wrote to the “Jewish Forewartz”, that is a daily Jewish paper.</span> <span id="s1242">I mailed them some parts of another little story which I wrote.</span> <span id="s1243">I went on writing and writing.</span> <span id="s1244">They said that it is OK, it is interesting.</span> <span id="s1245">I stopped writing when we got into the business, and then I was so involved and never had time.</span> <span id="s1246">So it never got very far.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Do you think that it is something important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: No, maybe not.</span> <span id="s1249">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1250">I wrote about my life, so this is it; everybody knows about it.</span> <span id="s1251">Our Rabbi knows it.</span> <span id="s1252">One lady had it on paper, she wanted to publish it in our newspaper (probably the Jewish Chronicles of Dayton), but for some reason or other it has not been published.</span> <span id="s1253">She told me that because I was in the paper not too long ago, in September of last year, when I received my citizenship -- she told me that, because of this mention of me in the paper, they cannot publish my article right now.</span> <span id="s1254">I don’t care whether they publish my article or not.</span> <span id="s1255">She just wanted to, for her own good, because she promised me money.</span> <span id="s1256">She runs the paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: You just got your citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: I didn’t take the time while I was running the business.</span> <span id="s1259">Then I didn’t have time for anything.</span> <span id="s1260">I cleaned my house when I had time.</span> <span id="s1261">It was terrible but I am not one to complain, but truly it was very hard.</span> <span id="s1262">Now I am getting used to being alone, but for a while I just couldn’t bear to be alone.</span> <span id="s1263">I felt so unhappy to be alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Can you think of anything you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: I hope that these circumstances never happen again.</span> <span id="s1266">I lost my parents when I was 17.</span> <span id="s1267">I still cry about it.</span> <span id="s1268">I can’t help it.</span> <span id="s1269">Probably my eyesight would be much better if that had not happened.</span> <span id="s1270">I didn’t have any food -- I was walking and hiding and I still cry about it.</span> <span id="s1271">I just can’t talk like a human being.</span> <span id="s1272">I just cry like a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: I want to thank you for co-operating with us.</span></p></body></html>
