Q: Uh-huh.

Q: So your thought--did you think if you were going to go back to Palestine, going to Hamburg was the best idea?

Q: And how did you feel about that?
A: I didn't feel so good about it because they told us on the way the--the men--there was a few men also and women older than me, and they told us, "If you go in the army, you going to have a baby." And I didn't understand. Because it's not like now the young people know everything when they are 10, 11, 12, you know?
Q: Right.
A: I came from a very religious family. So I said I'm not going in the army to have a baby. What I'm going to do with a baby? So they took blood from me. But I was hiding. Three nights I was sleeping under--three couples were in a room, and I was hiding at night under their bed. They didn't even know that I am there. And so after the third day--they came from a kibbutz ___+. And they ask who wants to go in a kibbutz. So me and other two people we went there. So there was no men there. They should do the work in a kibbutz, you know. I was worked there very, very hard. For a year I stayed in kibbutz.
Q: What did you--what was your job?
A: There all the--every time they changed. First, was from the bananas to--to take down the leaves, the big leaves, you know, with a big knife. The--the sun should come to the bananas. They would get ripe. And then the second was I--I worked in the kitchen because I knew--I told them I know how to work in the kitchen. And the third job was to wash the diapers from babies. And no money. They didn't--they just give you short pants, long pants, khaki. You know, for khaki? And sandals. And that's it. And food. Okay. We were happy. We had food. We had where to sleep. And I was there for a year. A year's time.
Q: Did your brothers emigrate or--
A: My brother, after year, one came to America, and one is still now in Israel. He is--God bless him--he is 90 years old.
Q: So you--but you came to Israel first.
A: Yeah, I came to Israel. Yeah. I came first, yes.
Q: Well, Palestine at the time--sorry--actually.
A: Yes. All the same Israel but still fighting. And there I got to know my husband, also, in 1950.
Q: And how long were you in Israel?
A: 11 years.
Q: And why did you come to the United States?
A: I don't know. We had a friend. He came before us, and he said, "You come to America. Your husband is going to make a lot of money" and you this-and-that. And we came, and I'm sorry to the day.
Q: You wish you would have stayed in Israel?
A: Yes.
Q: Did you--after the journey on the Exodus, were you--did you stay in touch with people that you had gone through that experience with?
A: That we went together to--on the Exodus?
Q: Well, if they were on the Exodus with you, this was the same group of people when you went back to Palestine.
A: Yes. You know what? When we came back to Hamburg, we--everybody--every girl has to wash clothes for three guys, you know, because the men didn't know how to wash clothes. So everybody had to--every girl had three boys to wash for them clothes. And we did that, you know. We were very close, one with each other, but not, you know--we were always together.
Q: And did you stay in touch with them when you lived in Israel?
A: Yes, yes. Yes. They--even one of them, too, wanted to marry me. But--we were still young, and we didn't--we didn't know what we want, you know. We didn't have nothing. We didn't have no money. We didn't have our home. We didn't have nothing. So that's why everybody lived for himself, to see from what we can live.
Q: And looking at the Exodus experience, sort of as a whole, how did you feel when you were experiencing that as a concentration camp survivor?
A: Very bad. Very bad. We thought that's it. We finished in concentration camp because I saw when they burned my--my parents, my brother. And the other brother two weeks before the war was over, they killed him. They shoot him. So I know that's it.
Q: But--my question is when--because of what you had experienced in the camps, when you were on the Exodus, did you--how did--I mean how did you feel having this experience, as a Holocaust survivor, after what you had already survived?
A: ___+. But we were happy that we going to a land that was going to be ours. We were going to fight for it.
Q: Did you think of the British in the same way as you thought of your European captors, or what were your feelings on--on the British?
A: Well, we--we didn't got to know them. We--we didn't see nothing. We didn't know about the British. We didn't know--we didn't know, no.
Q: Okay. Are there--are there any other details from that experience and being on the boat that you can think of that we haven't covered?
A: No, I don't know. I really don't know no more. I don't--I don't. It was--it was terrible, a terrible thing.

A: Yeah.
Q: What was her name?
A: She wasn't in touch with me anymore, but we found each other in Brooklyn.

Q: And did you talk about your experience?
A: Oh, yeah. We always used to talk about it. Some people didn't believe that the English did that to us. Even now they don't believe there was an Exodus. A lot of people. I think so.
Q: So you--you--you--actually--you talked about your specific experience on the Exodus.
A: Yes, yes. A lot. But, you know, when we came--when we came--then right away to war. They got killed. I knew a boy--we were--we were, you know, on the ship, were also together talking and that he died the next day when he went to war.
Q: You--you mean in--in Palestine.
A: In Palestine. He was 17 years old. And a lot of--of--a lot of people got killed right away.
Q: And how--how did you feel about that, as a survivor who had already survived so much, then participating in fighting?
A: They said they have to fight. They have to fight because we suffered so much and they killed our--our parents, our families. So we had to fight. And the Haganah told us, it's going to be ours, you know. So we going to have a home here and we going to live here and that's what we felt. And everybody who didn't go, we worked hard, you know. Because--the men mostly. In every kibbutz and in every moshav, they went to war. So whoever could went to help them, you know. I didn't go because for one purpose because they told me I was going to have a baby, you know. So I said ____+ what am I going to do. So I didn't go. A lot didn't go away. Girls, not men. All the men--all the younger boys went. And a few survived. And we got in touch. And I was sick anyway. Because they hit me in the--in the concentration camp, they hit me on the head, and I was fainting a lot from that.

Q: So--but there was no--I mean were there doctors on the boat that helped take care of you, or what was the situation like?
A: No. No, not really. No, no. Maybe there was. I don't know. They didn't help me.
Q: Okay. I think that covers--I'm trying to think if there's anything else that we didn't cover because you've already done another oral history where I think we have all the information. We just didn't get everything about your experience on the Exodus.

A: Thank you very much. I got pictures from the Exodus. My--my grandson gave it to me. I don't know from which museum they send it to me. Very nice. The whole ship.
Q: I saw that you had one that you showed in your other oral history. There was a photograph.
A: Yes, there was a photograph. I--I saw it--I was sitting by doctor's ____+ in the office. And I used to--now I cannot see. I have macular degeneration. So I don't read so much.
