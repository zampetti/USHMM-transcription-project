id="s11">Q: Can you just beginning by stating your name, date of birth, and where you were born, whatever your name was, if at all different at any time?</span> <span id="s12">Whatever your name was then?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My name is Erwin Baum.</span> <span id="s14">I'm born on April 15, 1926 in Warsaw, Poland.</span> <span id="s15">Attended only – unfortunately four years school.</span> <span id="s16">Why I say four years, I couldn't make it to the fifth grade because I was beaten up by the Polish boys too much, so I failed to go to school.</span> <span id="s17">I made excuses to stay home.</span> <span id="s18">So I failed, and had to go for two years to grade four, and finally I graduated to the fifth grade, which I never made it; that's when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s20">The other thing I was going to mention to you, is that you don’t need to pay attention to the camera.</span> <span id="s21">You can just talk to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s24">Tell me a little bit about life before the war?</span> <span id="s25">What was your family life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">What was—?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I was one of seven children.</span> <span id="s28">We lived in one big room in Warsaw, opposite from Army barracks.</span> <span id="s29">My father was a tailor, concentrated on making suits, uniforms for the officers and higher ranks.</span> <span id="s30">We lived quite comfortably.</span> <span id="s31">It was approximately 1933, '34, until my father got sick.</span> <span id="s32">And my mother also ran a little candy store up in front.</span> <span id="s33">My father got sick and eventually he died at age 48.</span> <span id="s34">I don't remember exactly the year, '45.</span> <span id="s35">I'm sorry, '35 or '36, and life became very, very, very unbearable, very hard for my mother and seven children to take care of us.</span> <span id="s36">We had to leave the apartment because we could not afford to pay the rent.</span> <span id="s37">So a gentleman by the name of – I think of Grenholc who had a factory and an a and a wood plant, where they cut wood and sold in round packages for heating, and also a factory of making cement blocks for sidewalks.</span> <span id="s38">And he offered to my mother a shed where she would sell coal and wood by the kilo, and we could have our place to stay.</span> <span id="s39">And I remember we were sleeping in that shed with the leaking roof, we had to put basins to catch the rain.</span> <span id="s40">It was very unbearable.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">01:04:00 At that time my mother learned somehow that there is in existence an orphanage on Krochmalna Street, run by Dr. Janusz KorczakAnd when I speak of Janusz Korczak, I 1 Janusz Korczak (1879-1942), physician, writer, and educator.</span> <span id="s42">In 1912 he was appointed director the Jewish orphanage at Krochmalna Street in Warsaw, Poland.</span> <span id="s43">Israel Gutman, ed., Encyclopedia of the Holocaust (New York: Macmillan Publishing, 1990), s.v. “Korczak, Janusz.”</span> <span id="s44">would gladly give half of my life for him, that kind of a man he was.</span> <span id="s45">Mother tried to get somebody to – made an application, because she never learned how to read and write, none of us could to fill out any papers.</span> <span id="s46">Finally, application was made, and very intensive investigation took place, and I was accepted to this orphanage.</span> <span id="s47">However, my mother said I'm the youngest child and she would like to keep me around her as long as she can.</span> <span id="s48">So my brother Icek, which he calls himself Joseph now, if possible he would go in.</span> <span id="s49">So he was accepted to go in full-term, and I went to visit him, and I never wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s50">I was always crying when I had to go back home.</span> <span id="s51">So they give me permission to be – they call it “half internat,” internatwas orphanage, that mean that I could spend the whole day, have my meals, go to school, but I have to go home to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s52">Again, every night I cried when I had to go home.</span> <span id="s53">And life was so wonderful; they served five meals a day, and Dr. Korczak and all the supervisors and all the counselors made sure that every child eats properly this.</span> <span id="s54">They actually stood over your head and made sure you had your meal, that you feel good, and went to school for – you see?</span> <span id="s55">And we were so respected at school, anybody that was from Korczak’s home.</span> <span id="s56">Every month we went to a summer camp, which actually my brother was entitled to go for two months, but he gave one month to me.</span> <span id="s57">He went one month, and I went one month.</span> <span id="s58">Children had to be seven years old in the first grade, and they were kept until they were fourteen.</span> <span id="s59">When they reach fourteen they received two suits, two pair of shoes, a room and a job.</span> <span id="s60">Out, somebody else took place.</span> <span id="s61">When my brother finished his terms, I was accepted and I went in for the last two years, I think.</span> <span id="s62">And my life was just, just, just wonderful there.</span> <span id="s63">And then in 1938, '39 or '40, unfortunately the war broke out and everything became like turmoil, with the bombardments of small towns and some children started to come into our orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">And Dr. Korczak just could not refuse anybody.</span> <span id="s65">Before there were only 107 children.</span> <span id="s66">There were 51 boys and 66 girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">01:07:00</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: I'm going to stop the you there a minute, because I want to ask you some questions about the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: But let's just go back a little bit before that.</span> <span id="s71">You had mentioned that there were children beating you up when you were a young boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Was this because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Only because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s75">Especially when religious classes took place.</span> <span id="s76">Jewish children 2 Boarding school (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s77">3 Later in the interviewee states that there were 56 girls in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s78">The latter number would appear to be correct, since 66 and 51 do not add up to 107.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">had to step out into the hallway for that hour.</span> <span id="s80">And when the religion class was over, all the boys just walked up and say “You killed Jesus,” and start to beat up on us.</span> <span id="s81">So since my mother had a candy store, I used to manage, for that day, to have some candies in pocket and bribe them, or a few pennies.</span> <span id="s82">But that was not the case always, so I always found an excuse to my mother when there was a religious class, I said I don't feel good, or there was a day off when the teacher is sick.</span> <span id="s83">I just didn't want to go to school because I couldn't bear being beaten up all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Now this was way before?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Way before the war; way before the war.</span> <span id="s86">Till I got into Dr. Korczak’s home.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Now, also were – I mean you lived in an area where there were a lot of gentiles.</span> <span id="s88">A: Um-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Did you have any good friends or nice neighbors who were not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: We had neighbors, but I could not have any Polish friends, they were just – I think it was the finger is always pointed the at me, “Zyd.</span> <span id="s91">Don't play him with him he is a zyd.”</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And did this change or get worse once the war began?</span> <span id="s93">01:08:45</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yes, it got worse when the war began.</span> <span id="s95">When the war began, for instance when the German walked into Warsaw they came in with trucks and handed out loaves of bread.</span> <span id="s96">So right away a line; and wherever it was a line, I stood in the line no matter what the reason was, because I knew I was going to get something.</span> <span id="s97">And if the Polish kids they pointed to me and said in German, “This man is a zyd.”</span> <span id="s98">So I had to run before I got beaten up.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Do you remember the day the war broke out?</span> <span id="s100">Do you remember what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: The war broke out when we came back from the summer campAnd I remember one of our neighbors came running to my mother and there was headline in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s102">"War started."</span> <span id="s103">And I say it in Polish; it said “wojna rozpoczeta,” in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: When –</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: A tenant that was friendly with my mother, she lived on the same floor where we lived, 4 September 1, 1939, war is declared when German troops cross over Polish frontier.</span> <span id="s106">Charles Messenger, The Chronological Atlas of World War Two (New York: Macmillan, 1989), 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">and she was friendly with my mother because my mother was the first one that got – how you call it when you, you put the laundry through to –</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: To wring it?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: To wring it.</span> <span id="s110">A salesman came and sold to my mother to pay one zloty a week to him.</span> <span id="s111">So this lady borrowed always from my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: And this was a non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: She was non-Jewish, and she was friendly because she could, you know, she was friendly with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: So you found out that the war broke out?</span> <span id="s115">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: And what next signs did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: The reaction was exciting because we didn't know about war.</span> <span id="s118">And matter of fact, the feeling of war existed prior to start of the war, like being in the camp; we had a big place where we played in sand, building airplanes, building boats, building different things.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">That summer we told everybody not to play, we are going to play war, like we made Polish Army and German Army.</span> <span id="s120">Me and other boy, we had a Polish army, and there was another boy by the name Mojzesz was the German Army.</span> <span id="s121">I was called Froim in the orphanage, I was also called MalyIcek.</span> <span id="s122">Icek is my brother, I'm the small Icek.</span> <span id="s123">So there was the army of Moses and the Army of Ariel and Froim – Ariel was the second general.</span> <span id="s124">And we prepared bunkers and all these things.</span> <span id="s125">And for bullets we would save chestnuts, and when the war broke out, we start throwing chestnuts.</span> <span id="s126">When we got hit three times, had to be carried out, so that was the feeling that naturally Poland lost, and Germany won.</span> <span id="s127">So then after the war – when the war started, naturally our building was one of the first to get burned down because they had announced that Solna number eight, where we have a room, is a point of refreshments for soldiers.</span> <span id="s128">A little bit later a bomb came down; an airplane was just cruising about, and they couldn't stop the fire or anything, and the building went down.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Where were you?</span> <span id="s130">01:12:20</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: We were in the apartment, and we ran out when the fire started.</span> <span id="s132">We ran out and just 5 children’s summer camp sponsored by Korczak’s orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">6 Small (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s134">crying, you know.</span> <span id="s135">We didn't have time to take any bedding or anything because it was full already.</span> <span id="s136">And then we marched off to one of my sister, which was married by then, she lived near the airport.</span> <span id="s137">We walked over there.</span> <span id="s138">And then couple days later, the they marched in the soldiers marched in.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Do you remember what you were thinking, or were you terrified?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Not terrified; kind of excited.</span> <span id="s141">Because the notion was that Jewish people and the German were getting along because, basically more or less understood the language, could communicate more or less.</span> <span id="s142">So we believed it wouldn't be too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: So you didn't have much information in terms of what was happening in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Not at all, not at all.</span> <span id="s145">Not interested, only to satisfy them, our hunger, because when the war broke out, right away everything was – all the stores were closed.</span> <span id="s146">There was no food available.</span> <span id="s147">And even in the orphanage, you know, it became rations like, you know.</span> <span id="s148">Food was available; Dr. Korczak saw to it that we get food, but – it appeared on the blackboard: Two slices of bread, or three slices of bread; as much as we can.</span> <span id="s149">And I will never forget, Dr. Korczak used to stand over us in good times.</span> <span id="s150">I remember good times and I remember bad times.</span> <span id="s151">In the good times he used to go behind the children and make sure they eat.</span> <span id="s152">And as a joke, if somebody was holding a piece of bread, he used to pull it out, grab it and put it in his mouth.</span> <span id="s153">Now I also remember when it appeared two slices each, also for Dr. Korczak two slices, but he never ate his two slices, he gave to another child.</span> <span id="s154">Every day he gave his bread to somebody else.</span> <span id="s155">And we stupid children, we took it.</span> <span id="s156">We never realize that the man grows thinner and thinner and thinner; that kind of man he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: So you hadn't heard anything about Kristallnacht or – A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: And the Polish community, were they generally supportive of what the – of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Oh, yes, they cooperated, and gave them all the information that they want.</span> <span id="s160">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s161">Back to the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: You went in there, you think probably around 1937, '38?</span> <span id="s164">A: '38 and '39, that's for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Tell me a little bit more details about your life in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s166">How it was organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">About some of the staff?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Well.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: If you want I can ask you a specific question.</span> <span id="s170">01:15:41</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Well, it was Dr. Korczak and there was Stefa Wilczynskashe was the head, and there was Mr. Aleksander Lewin – whom I met in Poland in 1988 – and there was Misza Wroblewski who were the staff.</span> <span id="s172">Strictly, I mean staff for the good of the child.</span> <span id="s173">Just see the child.</span> <span id="s174">We got in the morning when the alarm clock rang everybody had to go up, get up.</span> <span id="s175">If somebody overslept, they had to go to bed seven o’clock the next day.</span> <span id="s176">The beds had to be made.</span> <span id="s177">Everybody had to do their chores.</span> <span id="s178">Everybody had an assignment.</span> <span id="s179">You see, like my assignment was to wipe the tables, prepare the tables.</span> <span id="s180">And then we had a chance to change our assignments every second or third month.</span> <span id="s181">We had our court.</span> <span id="s182">We had a court run by children.</span> <span id="s183">It was run by children.</span> <span id="s184">If a child did something wrong to another child, you could sue him.</span> <span id="s185">And the judges were children.</span> <span id="s186">Even Dr. Korczak got sued by one child.</span> <span id="s187">He did something he put, I think he put a boy into a bottle of water, just as joke, and the boy didn't like it and he put him to court.</span> <span id="s188">And he received paragraph 100.</span> <span id="s189">Paragraph 100, it wasn't so terrible, but he didn't act properly.</span> <span id="s190">Since then he have the name setka – hundred.</span> <span id="s191">Setka means a hundred in Polish, so his name was setka.</span> <span id="s192">If any of Dr. Korczak’s is still alive, we ask how they call Dr. Korczak it was setka.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: What did that mean, paragraph 100?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Just paragraph 100 means, translated, did not do right.</span> <span id="s195">Paragraph 300 was receive for dishonesty.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: What were the – what was a typical punishment for one of these?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Well, if you accumulated certain paragraph you were deprived of something.</span> <span id="s198">Like a bicycle was given; and every child could ride that one bicycle at a certain time.</span> <span id="s199">But if during the year you accumulated 2,000, no bicycle.</span> <span id="s200">Okay.</span> <span id="s201">There were certain privileges taken away for getting too many paragraphs.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: How did you feel about this whole system?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Nice.</span> <span id="s204">It's involved.</span> <span id="s205">It's like a – it's like you were programmed to be good, you wanted to be good, you wanted not to have – see like one boy went – everybody had a little drawer in a big, big cupboard and you kept your things, you know, whether it's a comic book or 7 Stephania Wilczynska (1886-1942), head teacher and co-director of Korczak’s orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">some cards or chestnuts, we used to play a lot of chestnuts.</span> <span id="s207">And that one boy open up my drawer and steal some chestnuts.</span> <span id="s208">And, actually, I sue him and he received a paragraph 300 that was for dishonesty.</span> <span id="s209">Now one boy was an invalid.</span> <span id="s210">I remember very well his name was Alter (ph).</span> <span id="s211">He stole a pair of swimming trunks from somebody.</span> <span id="s212">He received paragraph 2,000.</span> <span id="s213">You know what that meant?</span> <span id="s214">He had to leave the home, dismissed.</span> <span id="s215">His mother in no way could afford that boy, but it was given by the court, by the judges and that nothing could be done.</span> <span id="s216">He was thrown out of the orphanage.</span> <span id="s217">So we knew, we children knew you can't mess around, you have to obey.</span> <span id="s218">We were put in four categories, category one, two, three and four.</span> <span id="s219">Category number one was neat, clean.</span> <span id="s220">When we used to go Saturday to visit our parents, one parent our relatives, whoever was there.</span> <span id="s221">We received little bag of cookies, and Mrs. Wilczynska stood up front make sure the shoes were shined, hands clean, you could go.</span> <span id="s222">Seven o’clock you had to be home, you didn't come home by seven o’clock you didn't go next Saturday.</span> <span id="s223">Now category one and two, if somebody – everything was donation food, rich people.</span> <span id="s224">People donated material.</span> <span id="s225">If a lot of material came in, category one or two received a new coat or a new suit.</span> <span id="s226">Category three and four already, you know, got something was a little bit used.</span> <span id="s227">So it gives us always the inspiration, you know, your bed should be made nice, you know, behave nice, clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Did the discipline seem strict or it seemed fair?</span> <span id="s229">01:20:30</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Not strict, not strict at all.</span> <span id="s231">I mean the punishment was normal, but you could live with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">You knew, don't do it unless you have a reason.</span> <span id="s233">Like, when we were in the summer camp, you were allowed twice a month two visitors.</span> <span id="s234">Now I remember one time when my brother was there, it was in the first month of the summer, I went, my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s235">So I figured my mothers, my sister were legally to visit my brother, and I, because I was part of it going to half time, I had the right to come.</span> <span id="s236">But it wasn't so.</span> <span id="s237">One girl was walking around, she saw three people and she wrote it down.</span> <span id="s238">Nothing.</span> <span id="s239">When my turn was there, I was not allowed any visitors.</span> <span id="s240">See, so you just know.</span> <span id="s241">The rules were made, you obey them.</span> <span id="s242">And everything went fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Everybody get along well?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Very much so, very much.</span> <span id="s245">There were no fights, everybody had a big brother when you step in.</span> <span id="s246">You had a big brother, like he took care of you and says if anybody is going to say something wrong to you or do something that you don't like, come and tell me, he told us.</span> <span id="s247">As a matter of fact, I had one big brother, his name was Sammy Gogol.</span> <span id="s248">This boy was gifted playing the harmonica.</span> <span id="s249">Never took a lesson in his life, but he could play anything you want, any opera, anything he could play.</span> <span id="s250">So he was my big brother.</span> <span id="s251">I enjoyed him very much.</span> <span id="s252">When I was – I mean, we lost contact with each other, you know.</span> <span id="s253">I didn't go to the orphanage.</span> <span id="s254">I walked in, I went out, I went in, I came back, nobody saw me, nobody asked me.</span> <span id="s255">I was torn apart.</span> <span id="s256">I didn't know whether to stay there or to go to my mother.</span> <span id="s257">Since I was a hustler, I used to know how to jump out of the ghettos.</span> <span id="s258">I was begging for food.</span> <span id="s259">So I brought – sometimes I brought something for the orphanage, and I wanted to see that my mother was – had something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: This was while you were –</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: While I was in the orphanage, but I was kind of – I took it upon myself, I saw that there is no more discipline, there is no more control, because instead of 107 children, there were at that time over 200.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: How come there was so many?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Because Dr. Korczak could not refuse anybody, you see.</span> <span id="s264">Q: This was the after the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s266">The gentleman I gave you the name before, David Kohl, his parents were shot, were killed.</span> <span id="s267">And somebody brought him there.</span> <span id="s268">How could he refuse him.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: This was after Germany had occupied –</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: If after the occupation, this is – I am speaking this was during the ghetto, all right.</span> <span id="s271">Q: So you wouldn't living in the orphanage any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">01:23:30</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Not on fully basis.</span> <span id="s274">When I felt like staying over, I stayed over.</span> <span id="s275">If not, nobody knew whether I'm coming or going.</span> <span id="s276">But if I brought a little bag with flour or a sack of potatoes or some coal, it was accepted.</span> <span id="s277">But they didn't ask me where were you yesterday, because, you know, a lot of people, even a lot of the counselors went to Russia, escaped.</span> <span id="s278">Only Dr. Korczak was there to the very end.</span> <span id="s279">So then naturally one morning I – one night I was out, I used to jump out of the night always where I couldn't be seen.</span> <span id="s280">And I came one morning and the house was empty.</span> <span id="s281">They were all taken, the children were taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: At the orphanage?</span> <span id="s283">A: At the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: I want to get about that, but let me just ask you a few more questions about the good days at the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">8 The Warsaw ghetto was established on October 2, 1940.</span> <span id="s286">Encyclopaedia Judaica Research Foundation, Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem: Encyclopaedia Judaica, corrected ed.)</span> <span id="s287">, s.v. “Warsaw.”</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Now, when you all had these jobs, did the girls have different jobs than the boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: No, no, no, they were, they were, they were jobs just to keep the house in order.</span> <span id="s291">Like peeling potatoes, helping with the dishes, putting up the cutlery on the tables, taking off, cut the bread, clean the windows.</span> <span id="s292">Sweep the bedrooms or sweep the dining room.</span> <span id="s293">So it was no difference.</span> <span id="s294">Some girls work in the sewing room, you know, putting on buttons and mending socks.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">01:25:70</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: They were basically treated the same?</span> <span id="s297">A: Same.</span> <span id="s298">Yes, same.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: And did you – what were the people on the staff, the counselors and all of that like?</span> <span id="s300">Was there usually a close relationship with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Not close, they were like – you know, how shall I say it, like teachers; supervising homework, and if somebody was not good enough, they helped out; they were like summer school.</span> <span id="s302">Like if you didn't have very good marks, they didn't force, but they suggested to take classes at the summer school.</span> <span id="s303">And they were helping you out, you know, just so you get better.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: And was this sort of divided men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: It was men and women equally.</span> <span id="s306">There was a teacher that used to teach us how to sing, there was a piano, whoever wanted to learn piano.</span> <span id="s307">I mean... Q. And you went to school outside of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: School was outside, yes.</span> <span id="s309">But if there was a parent meeting, one of the counselors from the orphanage went because they wanted to have the full picture of the child, of the behavior, if there was any problem between the teacher and the counselor of the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: But there wasn't a certain rule, by some of the women to be surrogate mothers to you, or</span></p> <p><span id="s311">–</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s313">We used to – we used to address them as “pani” or “pan” – means</span></p> <p><span id="s314">9 Miss/Misses (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s315">10 Mister (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Mr. or Mrs.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: I know that they also brought some cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Oh, yes, it was cultural activities, a lot of cultural activities.</span> <span id="s319">Q: What do you remember specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">01:28:50</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Playing theater, I took part, as a matter of fact, in one – I don't remember, I think Sleeping Beauty, I think Sleeping Beauty.</span> <span id="s322">That was my part just to say a word that when the boy slept and said, “oh, what a wonderful dream I had,” something like that.</span> <span id="s323">And my part was, “Oh, let's wake him up very fast, because he is going to sleep he is going to get cross, and he won't be able to go on the outing – you know – on the trip.”</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Tell me a little bit about Dr. Korczak?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Well, it was Dr. Korczak how should I describe him?</span> <span id="s326">Was he superman, he was, a king, he was.</span> <span id="s327">Just a good, good old grandpa with a face of an angel, with his hands, they were little, like pillows so soft to touch, and so lovable.</span> <span id="s328">When he came, he just, he just felt like get inside of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: How did he do all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: He had a habit of – if a child had a loose tooth, you know, he used to put his hands and somehow, without any pain, got the tooth out and give 50 cents to the child.</span> <span id="s331">And he collected all these teeth, and from the teeth of the children he build a little castle.</span> <span id="s332">How he did that all the time, is not to comprehend how he found time, but he had time for every child.</span> <span id="s333">Somehow he had time for every child.</span> <span id="s334">And he loved every child.</span> <span id="s335">No matter how, if a child came in from outside, if a desperate mother brought in a child that he was or was not accepted, the child could have been sick, full of pimples or whatever, Dr. Korczak took him in and kiss him right away.</span> <span id="s336">Whether he could accept him or could not, because, as I said, before the war was strict, 51 boys, 56 girls.</span> <span id="s337">One went out, another one could come in.</span> <span id="s338">But there was an application, a list very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Now, he was out trying to get money and supplies all the time, but he was – also you felt he was around a lot too?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: He was around, he was around a lot.</span> <span id="s341">Very, very, very much so.</span> <span id="s342">And all the supplies, all the donations were given by rich people before the war.</span> <span id="s343">And we produced for them nice place and concert.</span> <span id="s344">Like I say, somebody go play the harmonica, and there was another boy Jonas, number nine, he was a terrific violinist player, terrific.</span> <span id="s345">You know, we gave concert to this big – how you say digni…dignitary.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Dignitary?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Dignitaries, yes.</span> <span id="s348">And naturally they saw, they could see where there money is going.</span> <span id="s349">To 107 children very well behaved, you know, nice clean dressed.</span> <span id="s350">So they knew in that the money is going for a good purpose.</span> <span id="s351">And suddenly, during the ghetto, when there was not much available, he just went and begged you know, to the JointThere was this man, the head of the Warsaw ghetto, Czerniaków12I think.</span> <span id="s352">And Dr. Korczak used to manage to get always a couple sacks of potatoes, more than anybody, any other organization.</span> <span id="s353">We had our own horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s354">He had that capacity, the tongue, you know.</span> <span id="s355">And he was offered many time by the Polish underground to escape.</span> <span id="s356">He would not leave us.</span> <span id="s357">He would not.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">01:31:00</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: You said earlier that once you went to school, after you were part of the orphanage, you had a new respect?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Very new respect.</span> <span id="s361">Because they teaches us, the new student, the child of Dr. Janusz Korczak.</span> <span id="s362">Like there was – children got homework, okay?</span> <span id="s363">And the children had homework, so like she says, “For the next day or so you had to memorize page number so and so.”</span> <span id="s364">So certain children were reading, and they say, “Next, the student Baum, the child of Dr. Korczak.”</span> <span id="s365">I know everybody knew, so I read it, you know, and then was a different story.</span> <span id="s366">I don't know why, how.</span> <span id="s367">They knew that Korczak was like god.</span> <span id="s368">Because first of all, it was only Jewish person who had the program on Polish radio.</span> <span id="s369">Polish radio started, “Doctor, oh doctor.”</span> <span id="s370">Everything was children.</span> <span id="s371">He was – nothing was writing children’s’ books.</span> <span id="s372">So, Polish children knew him.</span> <span id="s373">Also he took care of Polish, he participated in other orphanages that had only Polish children, non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s374">He was everywhere, and we, we gratefully thankful we had plenty of him also.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So, when you were saying you got more respect, this was respect from non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: From non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s377">The beatings stopped, the beatings stopped.</span> <span id="s378">And then eventually I went to a school where it was more Jewish than non-Jewish, it was in the – more in the Jewish area.</span> <span id="s379">So, it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: But it was mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: It was mixed, yes, it was mixed.</span> <span id="s382">The teacher was Polish, but nice.</span> <span id="s383">01:32:55 11 American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">12 Adam Czerniaków (1880-1942), head of Warsaw Judenrat (Jewish Council).</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s386">Let's talk a little bit about the war now.</span> <span id="s387">When were you sent to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: When everybody else went the ghetto.</span> <span id="s389">When the ghetto started, we lived down in the – like I said, the shed of the coals.</span> <span id="s390">The owner, apparently he saw what's going on, he left the whole thing and give us his trailer apartment, it was like a trailer apartment.</span> <span id="s391">We lived there for a while.</span> <span id="s392">And when the ghetto started, we had to find somebody to exchange apartments.</span> <span id="s393">Like people that the area was designated for ghetto, and they were not Jewish, they had to find apartment outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s394">So we gave up our apartment, which was quite nice, in exchange for a small room like this, with an attic.</span> <span id="s395">And we crammed in, all of us, all six children.</span> <span id="s396">And one of my sister walked off to Russia.</span> <span id="s397">She went to Russia in 1941, just prior to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s398">She got married and went to Russia.</span> <span id="s399">To this day, I never heard from her.</span> <span id="s400">We had one postcard and that's it.</span> <span id="s401">We are still looking for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: So you were out of – you were officially old enough to be out of the orphanage at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Ah –</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: When the ghetto was formed?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: If there would be no war I would still have a year or two.</span> <span id="s406">But I was – I was such a hustler, because like even before the war, when daddy was dead already and there was no food, and mama couldn't support, I was able to go to work at the plant; sit a presser all day, and by the end of the day, we receive one – one you received one zloty, and one zloty brought one bread and a smoked fish.</span> <span id="s407">And when I brought it home there was seven o’clock, my oldest brother jumped to the ceiling, because it was breakfast.</span> <span id="s408">And I was about maybe nine, ten years old.</span> <span id="s409">And see my brother Joe was in the orphanage, and the rest of the family was hungry.</span> <span id="s410">So instead of spending the day in the orphanage where I could get my good meals, I went to work so I could get some cash to buy a bread and smoked fish and bring home.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: So you left the orphanage early, or you were in and out?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: In and out, I didn't leave it, you see, because I was torn apart.</span> <span id="s413">My mother and brother and sister were hungry, and I could get five meals there, so certain days I just didn't go.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Try to feed the family a little bit.</span> <span id="s416">Q: And you were the youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: The youngest, yes.</span> <span id="s418">The youngest and the hustler, always the hustler.</span> <span id="s419">Q: So in 1940 when the ghetto was formed—?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: You all moved in, and at that point you’re back with your family.</span> <span id="s422">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Your mom was – you’re not in the —?</span> <span id="s424">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: You weren't –</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yes, I was in the orphanage, I was in and out of Chlodna and Siennabut not officially full-term, because then there was no more – I mean there was no more such a control, and no more that they knew everybody is here.</span> <span id="s427">If you came, you came, you were welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">You were never sent away.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: So it became a little more chaotic?</span> <span id="s430">A: Right chaotic and sickness.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Do you remember the move, when the orphanage had to move into the ghetto; do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s433">We had the, we had the horse and the wagon, and there was Mr. John Zielinski, and we moved little by little, you know, and the kids helped as much as they could.</span> <span id="s434">And we moved to a school, but from the school we moved somewhere else, I just don't remember the street.</span> <span id="s435">We moved several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Did you – was that was that an upsetting –</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Very upsetting, because, sure, because the first orphanage home was a beautiful building, you know, and every child has his own beautiful bed, and every child has his own place in a big cupboard, and every child had his seat at a table in dining room, and, I mean, it was home.</span> <span id="s438">It was home.</span> <span id="s439">And over there we were we just cramped together; it was – it wasn't nice.</span> <span id="s440">But Dr. Korczak gave us aspiration and hope.</span> <span id="s441">You know, we just looked whatever he does, whatever he says.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">13 Chlodna and Sienna were streets within the confines of the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s443">Chlodna 33 was the location of Korczak’s orphanage after it was forced to relocate from the Krochmalna building.</span> <span id="s444">Janusz Korczak, The Warsaw Ghetto Memoirs of Janusz Korczak (Washington, DC: University Press of America, 1978), 64.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: For – how long was Dr. Korczak able to really maintain sort of the organization of the of the orphanage?</span> <span id="s446">Did everybody still have their responsibilities in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s447">Was he still able to bring you food?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Until the end.</span> <span id="s449">He was able to bring some, you know, he was able to until the end.</span> <span id="s450">His struggle was like survival, but not for him, but for the children.</span> <span id="s451">He virtually got out and begged.</span> <span id="s452">He begged for my children he begged, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Did you ever see him do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Oh, yes; his life deteriorating, you know.</span> <span id="s455">He just would not walk away.</span> <span id="s456">You know, he stood in front of that door with that Joint representative, he says, “Doctor, I cannot help you, I cannot do it.”</span> <span id="s457">But, he says, “But my children.”</span> <span id="s458">And he used to wear the Polish uniform.</span> <span id="s459">He refused to wear the Star of David.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s461">Why is that?</span> <span id="s462">01:38:30</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Because he served in the Polish Army.He was an officer.</span> <span id="s464">He refused.</span> <span id="s465">He was arrested once for not wearing it, but still refused to wear it.</span> <span id="s466">“But my children, but my children.”</span> <span id="s467">And he had a lot of support from non-Jewish organizations also.</span> <span id="s468">So we always had a little bit more than the people outside of the orphanage.</span> <span id="s469">But naturally not enough, because when you were hungry, you were hungry no matter how much you get.</span> <span id="s470">But this poor man, he was growing thinner and thinner and thinner, and he just ate very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Did you – at that time were you too young to think, “I wonder why he is getting so thin?”</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Who paid attention?</span> <span id="s473">You were so hungry and so eager we became like non-human any more.</span> <span id="s474">When you're hungry, it's just terrible.</span> <span id="s475">Now I think of it, why did I take that slice of bread that he gave me, I cannot forgive myself.</span> <span id="s476">I mean the guilt, you know….</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Where were you when the orphanage was evacuated?</span> <span id="s478">01:40:00</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: When the orphanage was evacuated15I remember I was there the day before, and then I went over and help my mother bring over the bread, and at night I spent, either I spent home, or I was out of the ghetto, because I managed, I figured out it's better at night to 14 Korczak enlisted in the Polish Army in 1919 and served as a military doctor.</span> <span id="s480">Falkowska, Maria, A Chronology of the Life, Activities and Works of Janusz Korczak (New York: Kosciuszko Foundation, 1980), 25.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">15 On August 6, 1942, Korczak, the orphanage staff, and some 200 children were sent to Treblinka concentration camp in Poland.</span> <span id="s482">A Chronology of the Life, Activities and Works of Janusz Korczak, 49-50.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">come out of the ghetto and be on the Aryan side, and wait until it gets dark again to come back, or earlier dawn.</span> <span id="s484">So I was out, and then I managed to get some food.</span> <span id="s485">I think there was some grains or whatever.</span> <span id="s486">I was begging.</span> <span id="s487">And I ran so happily, you know, to the orphanage.</span> <span id="s488">And while going there, a woman come and, “Oh God they took the children, my God they took the children, my God they took the children,” you know.</span> <span id="s489">She was crying, and I said, I – where, so pointed – she pointed to the Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s490">The Umschlagplatz means the station where the trains came.</span> <span id="s491">And I ran there, I wanted to go there to him, you know.</span> <span id="s492">The German “Get lost, you are not Jewish, get lost.”</span> <span id="s493">And I saw that he was, by the end he was kind of disputing with a soldier, I found out later that they had papers for him and a passport for him to go to freedom, and he wouldn't go.You know, he went to the train and went straight to Treblinka, and I was left alone, and now I figure they took away my last hope from me, what am I going to do without him?</span> <span id="s494">How am I going to survive without him?</span> <span id="s495">You know.</span> <span id="s496">So I went back to mother.</span> <span id="s497">I didn't know where to go, I just didn't know.</span> <span id="s498">So I went back to mother, and from there we struggled, one by one to go out of the ghetto and go to Plonsk, where my mother had a sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Okay, let me….</span> <span id="s500">Are you okay?</span> <span id="s501">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Do you want to take a second?</span> <span id="s503">A: I'm all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Can you tell me, what were some of the things that you saw and experienced?</span> <span id="s505">What was life like, not just for you, but for your family in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Well, hunger, starvation, sickness.</span> <span id="s507">I mean... Q: You were aware of this as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s509">I saw it on a daily basis.</span> <span id="s510">I virtually walked over corpse, there were corpses lying around every day, everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: What did you think when you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Callous.</span> <span id="s513">How to, how to find an extra piece of bread, maybe there is a broken down store where you could find something that you could take, trade or sell or whatever, because there was a market, you know, there was like a here you call it a flea market, that you had something you could go sell in exchange, like my sister had a nice red coat with an fur collar made of Alaskan seal, so she didn't see, my oldest brother stole it from her, went to 16 Reputedly, Korczak had been provided with papers for his release by CENTOS (Federation of Associations for the Care of Orphans in Poland).</span> <span id="s514">Betty Jean Lifton, The King of Children: A Biography of Janusz Korczak (New York: Schocken Books, 1989), 344.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">the market, sold it, and bought a bag of flour, brings home a bag of flour, very excited.</span> <span id="s516">And my mom cooks it, and it wasn't flour, it was plaster.</span> <span id="s517">These things were going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: As a kid, you were walking over a dead body, what – do you remember what you were thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Found it natural, I said, oh just another poor soul, another poor soul.</span> <span id="s520">Just make sure I'm not going to be in that position.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: And what was your mother doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Nothing, but just sitting there and waiting and completely frustrated, not knowing how to prepare, how to find some frozen potatoes or some potato pills, or something to feed these kids day by day.</span> <span id="s523">As a last resort, I remember one day she didn't have anything to sell any more, so she had golden crowns, pulled out the golden crowns.</span> <span id="s524">She went to a dentist and had them taken off for a few zlotys just so we could survive a couple days or so; she sold the golden caps.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Was there any school?</span> <span id="s526">A: No school.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Or studies?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: No.</span> <span id="s529">There might have been, but who had patience for that.</span> <span id="s530">It was just a daily way how to survive, how to get, how to get something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Were you aware of any activities, like cultural activities or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Not interested.</span> <span id="s533">I was not interested at all.</span> <span id="s534">I didn't want to go to school, I didn't want to participate in anything, only hustle.</span> <span id="s535">My best activities was jumping over the gate, run to the Polish market, buy a few loaves of bread, throw over.</span> <span id="s536">That gave me pride that I could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: How did you learn how to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: They say in Jewish, tzuristeaches you how to survive, how to survive.</span> <span id="s539">Q: Weren't you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: I was not, no.</span> <span id="s541">First of all, once I got through that Polish policeman I was fine, because I spoke good Polish, you know.</span> <span id="s542">And the farmers did not recognize me.</span> <span id="s543">I didn't deal with</span></p> <p><span id="s544">17 Troubles (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s545">any young – with any gang, so they didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s546">And once legitimately, I bought I paid them, because out of the ghetto you didn't need any rations, so you put down the money and they sold you, one loaf, two loaves.</span> <span id="s547">So I took about three or four and run in, if I threw them over several times, so by the end of the day was one bread profit.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: So tell me, how did you get to the Polish side?</span> <span id="s549">How did you do this?</span> <span id="s550">Did you have a system for getting out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">01:48:50</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: As I said, there was a fence.</span> <span id="s553">And there was spaces between the boards, so my mother used to put her hands like creating a step ladder and I stepped, stepped and jumped over, jumped over.</span> <span id="s554">Once I was on the other side, I was waiting for a car18because the cars were going slow from the court or to the court.</span> <span id="s555">Once I was on the other side, I was in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s556">And that was not the ghetto, that was the part that people were going to the courthouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: You said you went through the board or you went over?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Over the boards.</span> <span id="s559">She made like a stepladder for me, so I went.</span> <span id="s560">And the boards wasn't very high, especially on that street it wasn't very high.</span> <span id="s561">Luckily there was no wire fence or no cement blocks, just board, and it had a space where my mother could get her hands in there.</span> <span id="s562">And I used to step on her hands one by one and jumped over.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Between each of the boards, that's where she put her hand in a to make the ladder?</span> <span id="s564">A: Between the boards.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Between them, right?</span> <span id="s566">A: Between the boards.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: And how come the guards didn't see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Because they were quite – maybe 200 feet, on the corner of the street.</span> <span id="s569">And I – when I went out, I went in the middle of the block.</span> <span id="s570">And on the corner there was the police guard, just seeing that the cars going there.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Now, were there other kids doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Some of them did it, yes, quite a few did it.</span> <span id="s573">Some policemen looked away, and some were very nasty and tried to catch us, and we run fast.</span> <span id="s574">Sometimes they could catch us,</span></p> <p><span id="s575">18 Streetcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">sometimes they didn't.</span> <span id="s577">Once he got me.</span> <span id="s578">It was wintertime all the snow, and I couldn't run so fast.</span> <span id="s579">I fell down and he started hitting me with a club and took all the breads away from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: So you threw the bread over the fence?</span> <span id="s581">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And your mother was waiting for you on the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: She caught them and she could sell them immediately to the people that could afford.</span> <span id="s584">And I was waiting there for ten, fifteen minutes, and she pass me the money and I went on another trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: What was it like on the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: A new world.</span> <span id="s587">Restaurants, food available, everything.</span> <span id="s588">I was afraid to go there, first, first of all, I couldn't afford it.</span> <span id="s589">I was afraid to go to a restaurant because they could tell on me, because the way I was dressed, you know, in rags.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">01:49:25</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: What were the Polish kids on that side doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: There were no kids, because it was like commercial street, and mostly cars going into the court.</span> <span id="s593">So there were no houses.</span> <span id="s594">The only houses that were there in the ghetto on both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: What is your memory of the organization of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s596">The Jewish police, the Jewish Councils?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: I had nothing to do with the Councils, and the police, they were just standing at the post where the gates were to come in or out.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: But, in general, were the Jewish police nicer to the than the German police or?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: We had no contact with the German police, because first you had to – if you had the papers to go out of the ghetto, you had to present them to the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s600">The Jewish police presented them to the German police, and you could go.</span> <span id="s601">It was like a border.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: But you were afraid of the Jewish police as well?</span> <span id="s603">A: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s604">Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s605">It was authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">01:50:35</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: And it was just authority, or was there something special about these councils and the police?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: They had no guns and there was nothing special; there was authorities, and some of them played out the role the way they would be big heroes.</span> <span id="s609">If they didn't like something about you, they saw that you just coming in from the other side and you were successful to come through the German post, they took care, you know, if they wanted to let you through, if they didn't want to, they could arrest you or beat you up.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And they did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: They did that many times, yes, just to show authority.</span> <span id="s612">Q: You saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Oh yeah, just to show authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: What other functions did the Jewish Council and the Jewish police serve?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: I didn't see any council, but the Jewish police, I mean, this is the organized transport as I said, and groups of young boys to go to work that required to do some work for whatever the Germans wanted us to do.</span> <span id="s616">Like wintertime was most of all cleaning, snow shoveling for the whole day.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Did you or any of your brothers or sisters do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Me and my brothers we did it, yes, we had to do it.</span> <span id="s619">Not in Warsaw, but outside, everybody got a – you know, off the road there is that – what you call it, trench; it was full of snow, so we had to clean it out so the water would go in.</span> <span id="s620">So everybody that like five hundred feet, clean it out, and you could go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Was this outside the ghetto or inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Outside the ghetto, on the main highway.</span> <span id="s623">Q: So they would walk you outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: They walk us outside, and we used to do our work.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s626">So what happened next?</span> <span id="s627">You mentioned that you went to Plonsk; how?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yes but before I weren't were went to Plonsk.</span> <span id="s629">I told you that the orphanage was isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: So first, as I said my oldest brother went, and the other brother went, and then my mother went, and she was caught, she was brought back to Warsaw to the quarantine, and then again everybody started out.</span> <span id="s632">We had several cousins everyone of the children, one cousin took care, you know, and it was fine, I mean there was a bite to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: This was in Plonsk A: Plonsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: How did you get there?</span> <span id="s635">01:53:17</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Again, out of the ghetto, took a street car until the end of town and walk hundred kilometers.</span> <span id="s637">I mean it was a night and a day walk.</span> <span id="s638">Sometimes a horse and wagon go by, you used to jump it on it for a ride, like hitch hike.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: How much of you went at this time?</span> <span id="s640">A: By the end we were all over there, all.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s642">But how many went in this little convoy of a hundred miles together?</span> <span id="s643">A: No one together, everybody separate, one by one.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: So you didn't go with your mother?</span> <span id="s645">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: And what year do you think this was?</span> <span id="s647">A: '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: '41 because we were, we were there – I remember – the part of the summer, before '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Now, while in –</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Let me just ask you a question here, because I'm a little confused.</span> <span id="s652">I thought I had read that Korczak and the ghetto was evacuated in ‘42?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: In '42, right, August '42.</span> <span id="s654">Yeah, you're right.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: So does that mean that you were still, that maybe you went a little later?</span> <span id="s656">A: Could be, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: So, to Plonsk a little later?</span> <span id="s658">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Or did you go to Plonsk and come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: No, no, no, I didn't go back.</span> <span id="s661">It was right after they took the children we went to Plonsk.</span> <span id="s662">The dates, you know.</span> <span id="s663">So we went to Plonsk and then the ghetto was created in Plonsk, and then it became already food not so much available, because a lot of people came, a lot of people came from all over other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: And why did they go to Plonsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Because everybody had a sister or an uncle and it belonged to the – they call it – I don't know.</span> <span id="s666">There were a lot of Germans there in the area.</span> <span id="s667">And it belonged to – they call it the Third Reich.They call it a part of the Third Reich, and surrounded by farm lands, I mean rich.</span> <span id="s668">There was food.</span> <span id="s669">But so many people came there the food got less.</span> <span id="s670">So I try to find a way to make some money, so I used to buy in the ghetto cigarette paper, and went out of the ghetto and sold it to the farmers to make some money.</span> <span id="s671">And then I sold my two brothers.</span> <span id="s672">I didn't actually sell them, but I recommended to the farmers, if you need somebody to work for you just for food, is going to go.</span> <span id="s673">So I found a place for this one, and found a place for my oldest one; and then I look for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">01:56:07 While I was going, then I was also going to beg for food.</span> <span id="s675">I mean I went in and I says “If I can get something please?”</span> <span id="s676">One day a woman asked me, “A big boy like you shouldn't beg for food, he should become” – summertime you sent out the cows on a field, but somebody has to watch them that they don't go and eat the corn and the wheat, they should eat the grass – “A shepherd.”</span> <span id="s677">So I said, “Would you hire a Jewish boy?”</span> <span id="s678">She says, “My God, I would never believe your Jewish.</span> <span id="s679">But if your not gonna tell anybody, I won't tell anybody.”</span> <span id="s680">So, I make a deal with her, and I said, “I do it.</span> <span id="s681">By the end of the season you give me five…” it was by the meter then; I don’t know, five hundred pounds of potato and 80 deutschemark, and she set says, “You got it.”</span> <span id="s682">I went there, her son didn't know I'm Jewish, her daughter-in-law didn't know I'm Jewish, and there were a few boys 19 In 1939, Plonsk was annexed by the Germans along with the portion of Poland northwest of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s683">Wladyslaw Czaplinski and Tadeusz Ladogorski, The Historical Atlas of Poland (Warsaw: Panstwowe Przedsiebiorstwo Wyd.</span> <span id="s684">Kartograficznych, 1986), 50.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">– never knew I’m Jewish, and I stood there the whole season, the whole summer.</span> <span id="s686">By the end of the term, they had to give me their potatoes.</span> <span id="s687">And the I took the horse and the wagon.</span> <span id="s688">And at that time the Germans brought in together potatoes and all that, and put them in basements, you know, down, to bury them; I don't know for what.</span> <span id="s689">So every for farmer had to donate so much.</span> <span id="s690">So I drove in with the horse and wagon myself.</span> <span id="s691">And they told me here, here, you have to put it here.</span> <span id="s692">And I says yeah, yeah, yeah, and I went straight to the house where my mother and my cousin was.</span> <span id="s693">We unloaded it, but we never had time to consume it.</span> <span id="s694">You know.</span> <span id="s695">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Was this ghetto very organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: It was quite organized.</span> <span id="s698">But then, you had to be a residence, a resident, of that town.</span> <span id="s699">My oldest brother, who didn't survive, he used to go out with the daughter of the president of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s700">And they gave him an ID card that he is from here.</span> <span id="s701">One night they say everybody out in the field, all Jewish people out, out in the field; and they started to verify.</span> <span id="s702">Whoever had a resident card, the ID card could go home; whoever didn't have, about hundred brown uniform Germansthis way, one hundred this way, and everybody had their whip in the hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: I have to stop you.</span> <span id="s704">We're going to pick up.</span> <span id="s705">They need to change tapes.</span> <span id="s706">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">20 Nazi stormtroopers (Sturmabteilung or “SA”).</span> <span id="s708">Amy Hackett, ed., The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich (New York: Macmillan Publishing, 1991), s.v. “Sturmabteilung.”</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Tape # 2</span></p> <p><span id="s710">02:01:70</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: We’re in Plonsk…</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: As I said, whoever had the ID card as a resident from the city were allowed to go home.</span> <span id="s713">I resumed normal activity.</span> <span id="s714">Whoever didn't have, there were about a hundred of the Germans in the brown uniforms on each side, making like a gate.</span> <span id="s715">Everybody had a whip, if they had to cut down a branch just to have something in their hands.</span> <span id="s716">And whoever didn't have it had to pass them.</span> <span id="s717">And everyone had to hit while running through.</span> <span id="s718">My two brothers and one sister were extremely lucky, they were the first one of the victims.</span> <span id="s719">So one German took them and walked them through that terrible gate.</span> <span id="s720">So the ones that get beaten should know to where to run.</span> <span id="s721">My oldest sister, unfortunately, wasn't so lucky she was beaten very badly, and then came my turn.</span> <span id="s722">They told me I had to go there, so I go there.</span> <span id="s723">So I was running like a snake, you know, nobody could hit me.</span> <span id="s724">I escaped everyone.</span> <span id="s725">By the very end one was waiting for me and hit me right across the face here and split my lip right open.</span> <span id="s726">When it was all over, they put us in trucks and put us in a field surrounded with barbed wire, and kept there I think for a day or so.</span> <span id="s727">No water to wash up or no food, no nothing, and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: What about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: My mother was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s730">My mother, she was then remained in Warsaw?</span> <span id="s731">Q: But she went to Plonsk for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: She did not make it because she was arrested on the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s733">She went to prison and she went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s734">And she waited the for a chance to come to get some money or some goods for that person that smuggled the people out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s735">So, we were there, and then we were put on trucks, and we were driven to a place called Pomiechówek, which was a just a building, a big building, you know, with cement floor, and that's where we slept on the ground.</span> <span id="s736">No food, no water; waiting for a rain to come down with started to wash a little bit with the soap.</span> <span id="s737">Then the rain stopped.</span> <span id="s738">And eventually, after the third or fourth day, they brought in water in barrels of sour pickles.</span> <span id="s739">That water we drank, and then a little soup.</span> <span id="s740">And we were just kept there with, without saying anything to us or anything; we were just kept there.</span> <span id="s741">Guarded by Ukrainian soldiers which served the German Army.</span> <span id="s742">And I saw outside behind the gate, people from that town had relatives in that place, they used to come and brought a package.</span> <span id="s743">They called out the name and threw in a package, and the guards did not object.</span> <span id="s744">So I said to my sisters, you know what, why don't you go talk to them a little bit, flirt with them, distract them.</span> <span id="s745">They didn't know what I was about to do.</span> <span id="s746">When they went, I got down on my knees and dug a hole under the gate with my hands I dug a hole and crawled out, cleaned myself up, and stood up as if I were a visitor, you know.</span> <span id="s747">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s748">02:05:00</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Were you scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: No.</span> <span id="s751">And walked away, walked away; walked out on the highway with another boy.</span> <span id="s752">And I saw trucks of workers, I ask, “Where you going?”</span> <span id="s753">“Oh, we going to Plonsk.”</span> <span id="s754">I jumped on the truck and went to Plonsk.</span> <span id="s755">By then I was not afraid, I went straight to the gate to the Jewish policemen.</span> <span id="s756">“I am so and so, I am David.”</span> <span id="s757">David was my oldest brother, and the Jewish policeman was Moshe Niman (ph) who was friendly with my brother, you know.</span> <span id="s758">So I said, “I just escaped from Pomiechówek.”</span> <span id="s759">I went in, and in a minute I was surrounded, “Who is the hero who is the hero?</span> <span id="s760">How could you escape from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">What's going on there?”</span> <span id="s762">So I told them the story, and I go to my cousin.</span> <span id="s763">And by that time, I see my mother was there.</span> <span id="s764">She came from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s765">While we were all there.</span> <span id="s766">She came, oh, when she saw me, you know.</span> <span id="s767">And the rest of them apparently remained in this Pomiechówek a few week until they evacuate them back to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: About how long was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: I don't know, but it was quite a couple months I guess.</span> <span id="s770">They chased them on march back to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Let me stop you a moment.</span> <span id="s772">When you got out of this Pomiechówek?</span> <span id="s773">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Did you feel any, anything about leaving the rest of your brothers and sisters in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: If I feel any remorse, any guilt?</span> <span id="s776">Not really, no.</span> <span id="s777">It was – I felt that I'll be able to go there and get some food and bring to them.</span> <span id="s778">You see.</span> <span id="s779">I felt as a rescuer.</span> <span id="s780">You see like going to go to work.</span> <span id="s781">I figure I'll go, I'll get something and come back.</span> <span id="s782">Because being outside it didn't bother me, because I would appear as a resident of that town, it's legal there.</span> <span id="s783">And bringing a package was okay because they did not object.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: But, did you talk to people when they just thought you were Polish, and you told people you were just a Polish boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: When I was begging?</span> <span id="s786">02:07:30</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yeah, yeah, I did, “holy spirit, bless holy spirit,” [gestures sign of the cross] whatever you say, and “Can I ask for something?”</span> <span id="s789">They say “Why, why you begging you begging for something?”</span> <span id="s790">I say my, “Mother and father was killed in the war, you know, I am an orphan and I have nothing.”</span> <span id="s791">“What are you collecting?”</span> <span id="s792">I say, “Whatever you can, a little flour, a little barley, you know, some potatoes, a piece of bread.”</span> <span id="s793">So they gave me.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: You are how old now, about?</span> <span id="s795">Eighteen, 17?</span> <span id="s796">A: No…</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: You’re still very young?</span> <span id="s798">02:08:00</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Then it was– we are talking now from '26 to '40?</span> <span id="s800">Q: '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s802">From '26, '26 to '30 was 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Well, Korczak was ‘42, so that makes you 16?</span> <span id="s804">A: Sixteen, I was in camp already.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Okay, well Korczak –</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Well, I was about 14, 15 then, before I went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s807">15, but I was not developed because I'm hungry.</span> <span id="s808">So then my two brothers and two sisters, they were chased to Warsaw, and they told me they made a big fire so they couldn't go back.</span> <span id="s809">They were in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s810">Now, a postcard from, come from my two sisters to mother, “We are here.</span> <span id="s811">Icek is sick with typhus in a hospital, this one here.</span> <span id="s812">They have nothing to eat, they have no place to sleep.</span> <span id="s813">We are desperate, we are helpless, what are we going to do?”</span> <span id="s814">So, what is mother going to do?</span> <span id="s815">She takes off and walks to Warsaw to rescue the two girls and the two boys.</span> <span id="s816">By friends and so on, she found a little place where they can stay, they take him in.</span> <span id="s817">By that time, the girls came to Plonsk with that smuggler.</span> <span id="s818">The other brother, old, came, and he came.</span> <span id="s819">Then we were all in Plonsk already.</span> <span id="s820">And by that time, we were all in Plonsk, and during that time I sold my two brothers, you know, we spend like summer.</span> <span id="s821">And then the main evacuation started.</span> <span id="s822">Everybody, residents, non residents.</span> <span id="s823">Everybody transport, go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s824">So I think ours were the second transport that went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s825">My oldest brother remained because he was friendly with the president's daughter, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s826">If he would have come with us he might have been survived.</span> <span id="s827">So we went to Auschwitz, it was in the fall already.</span> <span id="s828">It was in the fall because I remember when we got dressed naked, the frost was sticking to my feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: You think this is '42ish?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: I think it's '42ish, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Okay, tell me a little bit about the trip to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: The trip to Auschwitz on the train, on a train me, my mother, my two sisters and my two brothers.</span> <span id="s833">Took about two on or three days, I think.</span> <span id="s834">No food, no water.</span> <span id="s835">I mean, the food – I mean we took a little bit of food with us, whatever we could, you know, and I was dressed in four suits, because there was a tailor down there, we didn't know where we are going he says take, take maybe we can sell, and – wherever we going, because it was resettling.</span> <span id="s836">We knew we were going to be resettled somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: What other things did you take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Take whatever we could carry, you know, suitcases, clothing, and what food we had.</span> <span id="s839">And I think they gave us some bread for the road, but water was – everybody was dying for water.</span> <span id="s840">So what my mother had, she had – she still had a very thin wedding ring.</span> <span id="s841">She gave it to a soldier so he could scoop up a little cup with snow for me, you know, she didn't – she couldn't take care of the others, but I was the youngest so he scooped up a little snow for the wedding ring.</span> <span id="s842">That was the last thing.</span> <span id="s843">And then early dawn one day we arrived on the ramp in Birkenauand he said, “Everybody out,” and we see the boys in the striped suits.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: So you were on this train, you had really no idea where you were going or what was in store?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: No, no idea no, resettling, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Was it at all frightening, or you didn't know?</span> <span id="s847">A: Didn't know, it wasn't even frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">02:12:20</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Because we were promised we were going to a better place.</span> <span id="s851">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s852">So we arrived there, and naturally everybody out, you know.</span> <span id="s853">And the boys with the striped uniform say “Everybody out, go walk this way, walk this way.”</span> <span id="s854">Helping people and trying to carry the luggages, I mean we had to leave our luggage, we had to leave.</span> <span id="s855">And I 21 The German Army occupied Plonsk on September 5, 1939.</span> <span id="s856">A closed ghetto was established in May 1941.</span> <span id="s857">The

id="s863">Eichmann23</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: How did you know that's who it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Later it I found out.</span> <span id="s866">I never knew, I never knew anybody, no.</span> <span id="s867">Q: Had you heard any stories yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: No, no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: You knew nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: No way.</span> <span id="s871">In Warsaw there was a rumor that the they sending people to, they call it a fry pan, you mean they put people in the room and the floor turns over, and they get murder, so they call it a frying pan because a frying pan you flip over.</span> <span id="s872">36 Never knew; nobody ever escape, never knew nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: So when you arrive and see these people in uniforms and Germans, what's going through your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">02:13:37</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: We just didn't know who these people are, and then they speak JewishI said my God, people speak Jewish here, what is this?</span> <span id="s876">It's a paradise.</span> <span id="s877">People from Eretz Israelmaybe, you know, or something, because they spoke Jewish, “come out, come out,” and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Didn't give any indication whatsoever.</span> <span id="s879">Then it's ordered “women left, men right” or vice versa, separate men and women.</span> <span id="s880">Then the women and children were taken away, don't know where.</span> <span id="s881">Then comes men, you know, and I stay with my two brothers, try to make myself nice and tall and he says you know, pointing to two brothers on one side and two on the other side.</span> <span id="s882">I go, what do I know.</span> <span id="s883">And I stand for a while and I look and – first thinking, I see on the other side my two brothers are, about 45 boys, nice strong, and I'm between all people and children.</span> <span id="s884">And my brothers indicating to me like that, from far away.</span> <span id="s885">And I couldn't find a moment because the soldiers are were marching forth and back and watching, you know.</span> <span id="s886">And once the soldier passed me by and I snucked over to my brother, and he put me between him and the other one, they kept me there.</span> <span id="s887">And in a few minutes they told us to jog.</span> <span id="s888">And then we see Auschwitz “Arbeit Macht Frei”26 into 23 Adolf Eichmann (1906-1962), Nazi official who played central role in the organizing and execution of the “Final

<p><span id="s892">26 Work Makes Free (German); infamous sign posted above the main entrance to Auschwitz concentration camp in the camp, and I was the youngest of the camp.</span> <span id="s893">And the part where I was, at that time they did not need any woman at the working camp.</span> <span id="s894">So all the woman were destroyed immediately, gas chambers, my mother, my sisters, and then the people where I was put, the older men and the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Now, did you know this, or did it take some time for you to find out about your mother and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Later, later I found out, because we were speaking with people that work – that work SonderkommandoSonderkommando means they were putting people in the oven.</span> <span id="s897">So some people had indirect contact and they said the transport from Plonsk came so, you know, women came to labor camp.</span> <span id="s898">So then we came to find out.</span> <span id="s899">So here we come into Auschwitz, and people, you know, they put us up in barracks, and the beds are made so nice and straight, and everybody is afraid that they would not be able to make the bed.</span> <span id="s900">That came existed from before, you know, and German criminals were then political and the beds was straw sacks, and everybody got two boards to make the edges so straight and the pillow and the blankets had a stripe, and it was like a one hundred beds and one stripe.</span> <span id="s901">So many of them were afraid because we are given orders and people start asking questions, and then I shot off my big mouth in Polish, “What's the matter with you, don't you understand what they talking to you.”</span> <span id="s902">And one guy heard me and he said, “Come over here little boy, where are you from?”</span> <span id="s903">I says, “I'm from Warsaw.”</span> <span id="s904">“Oh, I'm from Warsaw too.”</span> <span id="s905">It was a Polish guy who was the bookkeeper here.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">02:17:02 And then right away, “Here's a piece of bread, here's a bowl of soup,” and right away I'm a whole macherthere, you know.</span> <span id="s907">And I share it with my bothers, you know, and then they tell us to take off our clothes, it was frosty, completely naked, and the frost was – our feet were glued.</span> <span id="s908">And sent into the shower, shave the heads – the shower, and come out the other way, and we got striped clothes and we got our bowl.</span> <span id="s909">“This is your property.”</span> <span id="s910">Then we went for the numbers.</span> <span id="s911">They put the numbers, I talked to my brothers and I say, “We going to show you one day in the United States, I didn't even know United States exist.”</span> <span id="s912">So my brother got “630,” I got “631,” and my older brother, he curious, walked away, and we never saw him again.</span> <span id="s913">They counted out 50 people and took him away to coal mines to another camp, never saw him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: What were you thinking in all this process?</span> <span id="s915">02:18:00</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">27 Special commando (German); A commando of Jewish prisoners in the six extermination camp selected to work in the gas chambers and

thinking what's going on, we came to a camp, we are going to be kept, we are going to work, and until America will happen, something will be over.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: You thought this was just a labor camp, it wasn't going to be so bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Yes, I thought it was just a labor camp, and right away they took care of me, I didn't have to suffer any hunger, nobody was beating me up, you know, and we didn't have to work even, it was only – Auschwitz was only a passing.</span> <span id="s923">We were there about three days.</span> <span id="s924">Then we were walked off to Bunato another camp.</span> <span id="s925">We walk, and half the way, again we have to go into a place where they took our clothes and put it in the oven to disinfect it, to disinfect it, you know, and this was the dirty room and over there was the clean room.</span> <span id="s926">So, a part of the people walked from the – they went in the shower, and everything, they were waiting.</span> <span id="s927">And the people on this side wanted to know what's going on.</span> <span id="s928">So it was one of my cousins there, he says [draws forefinger across neck].</span> <span id="s929">I said “no, nice,” and I show him a sign that they are not killing us, you know, just shower and disinfect so we are nice and clean.</span> <span id="s930">And we went to Buna.</span> <span id="s931">We went to Buna and we went to a quarantine again.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">That was a camp quarantine.</span> <span id="s933">And again, I was the youngest, so they made me clean the block.</span> <span id="s934">It was a blockältester30the head of the block, of the barrack.</span> <span id="s935">And he had a little room for himself with a bookkeeper, so he told me, “You going to be like my maid.”</span> <span id="s936">You know, every day I had to dust and clean and clean, and clean and dust, and help, like keep the spoon in the pot, you know.</span> <span id="s937">Cut the bread, make rations, and hand out the soup, hand out the potatoes, and try to put a little bit aside, and every night I give to my brothers a little bit more.</span> <span id="s938">So in quarantine you had to be like a certain time, and then you walked out to labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: How long was the quarantine?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: I think a few weeks, about four weeks or so, you know.</span> <span id="s941">Q: Do you know what happened to your cousin or?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">02:20:35</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: I didn't see him any more.</span> <span id="s944">When the quarantine was finished, this brother Joe worked labor camp, and they asked me if I want to remain where I am or if I want to go to labor camp.</span> <span id="s945">I says sure I want to remain where I am, you know.</span> <span id="s946">So I found a piece of bread, some potatoes my brother used to come every night I used to give him something and others.</span> <span id="s947">And during that time a transport came, and my oldest brother, that remained in Plonsk, came also.</span> <span id="s948">When he came, so, I was begging him, “David, whatever you do, try not to drink the water here, because it's very contaminated.”</span> <span id="s949">But he was thirsty, from the way he was drinking, he wouldn't listen to me, and also an excellent tailor so he made the 29 Buna-Monowitz (Auschwitz III), subcamp of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">30 Block elder (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s951">hat for the blockältester, but one of these people brought typhus with him, they took the whole transport and send them back, and my brother had to go back to Birkenau with them.</span> <span id="s952">And while he was marching he met his brother and he said they are taking him back to Birkenau, we are not going to see each other any more.</span> <span id="s953">They took him to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s954">A few days later they brought another transport, again typhus, and then they took everybody already even the people that were the supervisors and me too, to Birkenau, and right away I run look for my brother there and he was already taken to crematorium.</span> <span id="s955">He was gassed because he was sick.</span> <span id="s956">I didn't see him.</span> <span id="s957">And then

quarantine?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: He was for the part that was required.</span> <span id="s963">Then he went to labor camp, but I had – they kept asking me, and asked me if I want to remain in the quarantine to do these little chores.</span> <span id="s964">I said “Of course, why not, I don't want to go to the hard labor.</span> <span id="s965">In here, what I do – I keep the place clean.”</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Let me ask you a question about Buna?</span> <span id="s967">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">02:22:40</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: In some of the reading that I've done, it said that one of the factories in Buna was making rubber.</span> <span id="s970">Do you know anything about that?</span> <span id="s971">Your brother said they were more

two at daytime, two at nighttime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">One transport came, apparently they knew what's going on.</span> <span id="s1013">When they came out of the train, it was during the night you could see the flames of the crematorium ten feet above the chimney.</span> <span id="s1014">People just put on their praying shawls, you know, and say the last prayer.</span> <span id="s1015">Apparently they knew.</span> <span id="s1016">It was such a chaos – chaos?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Chaotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">02:28:03</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: You have, you know, we got all so emotional, and people are screaming and crying, and even the German soldiers got afraid they shouldn't be all right.</span> <span id="s1020">“Go,” I say, “don't worry, don't worry, be fine.”</span> <span id="s1021">And this other woman, “Oh Mutelesoon you going to get, going to get a shower, going to put you in nice clean bed, don't worry, just move ahead, just go, just go.”</span> <span id="s1022">Here I walk over, and this young girl stays close to her mother, and I take her by the hand and I say, “You come and stay on the other hand.”</span> <span id="s1023">And she takes me by my chin in Jewish and says, “I'm 18 years old, I didn't love in my life yet.</span> <span id="s1024">Why do you take me to death already?</span> <span id="s1025">Why you take me to death?”</span> <span id="s1026">You know, like I would be the one.</span> <span id="s1027">I says “No, no, what you talking about?</span> <span id="s1028">You come with me you see, you'll be fine.</span> <span id="s1029">I put you among all these young people.”</span> <span id="s1030">I was able to save her, and she went through labor camp.</span> <span id="s1031">But apparently she got crazy and she got destroyed, because I was able to, to, to come into the women’s, come into the women's camp once in a while by exchanging with somebody else that was carrying the kettles with food.</span> <span id="s1032">So when somebody came into the camp with the food, I say you stay here today, I give them something and I took the food, and I wanted to see if she survived.</span> <span id="s1033">She survived a few days, but she got crazy.</span> <span id="s1034">This scene will remain with me for as long as I live.</span> <span id="s1035">I was not emotional then, but she put such a guilt trip on me, and she said, “Why do you hate me?</span> <span id="s1036">Why do you want me to die?”</span> <span id="s1037">she says, “I’m only 18.”</span> <span id="s1038">This was terrible.</span> <span id="s1039">And the Germans are running so much that when I thought they had no room in the gas chambers, it was so active, that before every crematorium the dug a big hole very, very big, and it was burning fire and they used to put the people on blocks break up alive, into the fires burn them alive, the Hungarian transports.That was already way before the allied started to approach.</span> <span id="s1040">And now, as I told you, my first miracle is when I escaped to go to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1041">The second miracle was when I came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1042">Here I am a worker now, and this SS woman is walking around always and looking and looking, and with her whip against her boots like that walking around like you know, proud and looking, looking taking numbers down, and she points at me to put my number down.</span> <span id="s1043">Because I was in Birkenau, I was not a Muslim 34 Mother – diminutive (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">35 May 9, 1944, SS Camp Senior Rudolf Höss orders five open crematoria pits dug near Auschwitz-Birkenau Crematoria V, in order to accommodate the overflow generated by the mass transport of Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s1045">Danuta Czech, Auschwitz Chronicle, 1939-1945 (New York: H.

blockältester knew why she takes my number down, they wouldn't tell me, but there was a request of sending out of Birkenau a few hundred people to another camp, to Stutthof, and he puts me there.</span> <span id="s1049">And then he told me, “She took your number, she wants your skin to make a bag or gloves or something,” and he sent me away.</span> <span id="s1050">And I escaped that, because they were making bags and gloves and lamp shades from our skins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: How did you know this, or did you know this at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: I didn't know at the time, but later when they evacuated the complete Birkenau, that blockältester came also, because blockältesters, you see, they were all my inmates, you see we were all run by inmates.</span> <span id="s1053">We got a barrack, you got a blockältester, and then you got a stubendienstsomebody to see that it's clean, you know, that the beds are made and all that.</span> <span id="s1054">When Birkenau was evacuated, then they took so many.But when the Allies – Russian were pushing, then they send us.</span> <span id="s1055">So, my first was Stutthof, from Birkenau of Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1057">I want to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: And he came also, and he told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: He told you how they were using the skins?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: He told me, “You know why I send you here?</span> <span id="s1061">You remember she wrote your name down.”</span> <span id="s1062">So I says, “Why, what is it?”</span> <span id="s1063">He says, “She wants to make a nice purse or gloves or a bag from you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Did anybody that you know actually see this happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: No, you know, they just took the boys, did whatever they had to do.</span> <span id="s1066">Who could see?</span> <span id="s1067">Q: But the prisoners –</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: No.</span> <span id="s1069">Like they were castrating Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s1070">Q: How did you know this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">36 Barracks duty (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">37 In mid-January 1945, the SS began evacuating the Auschwitz camps system – some 60,000 prisoners were sent on death march to concentration camps further west.</span> <span id="s1073">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Historical Atlas of the Holocaust (New York: Macmillan, 1996), 205.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">38 Numerous prisoners of Auschwitz were castrated as part of the sterilization experiments carried out by Dr. Horst Shumann and Prof. Carl Clauberg, among others.</span> <span id="s1075">Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, s.v. “medical experiments.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">02:33:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Because what's his name, Morris, Morris he was a cook.</span> <span id="s1078">He was a cook.</span> <span id="s1079">His testicles were taken out, because he was with me in a few camps.</span> <span id="s1080">So, I knew that he was taken, that he was taken, and then he said, “They put me to sleep, and whatever they did.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: And he was aware that there were other boys – A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: – that were in the same –</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Yes, yes, he was aware of that, because as a matter of fact I was friendly with him.</span> <span id="s1084">He was always a cook, and he always cook.</span> <span id="s1085">So after when we would send food from one camp to another camp, I was maybe in 15 of them, but I don't know the locations because they used to send boys to build air strips.</span> <span id="s1086">It means take big stones, break them up, make gravel, and then cover with cement.</span> <span id="s1087">And every camp had a little kitchen.</span> <span id="s1088">So, Morris was a chef – kitchen.</span> <span id="s1089">So, I remember one day as we were walking, walking through German village, I saw an apple on the ground.</span> <span id="s1090">I ran out and grabbed the apple and put it in my pocket.</span> <span id="s1091">I think I'm going to give it to Morris that night and bribed him, you know, he had all the soup and all the potatoes he needs – but an apple.</span> <span id="s1092">So, night at he came in to the barracks; I said, “Here Morris I have an apple for you.”</span> <span id="s1093">So, for several days he brought me baked potatoes.</span> <span id="s1094">Took raw potatoes and threw them in the fire.</span> <span id="s1095">And one day they needed boys to peel potatoes, and he took me.</span> <span id="s1096">One day the German took a truck and went with two boys to the village so the baker gave bread for the barrack, so he took me also.</span> <span id="s1097">So the German gave me whole loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1098">I ate it up at once, because I had a bad experience with my men that slept with me, because I was a terrific worker, I always told to my – you – always a group, that we slept on the same platform – try to avoid to get beaten up – “Do as much as you can.”</span> <span id="s1099">So, we work to please the contractor.</span> <span id="s1100">The contractor had to make so many trips with his truck with stones, could so he could make more money.</span> <span id="s1101">So I don't know at the time whether it was Christmas or something, he gave me like almost three quarter loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1102">So I figure, “I'm going to add a little bit to my every day rations.”</span> <span id="s1103">Because once I went to Birkenau I was in trouble: No connections, no nothing no food, nothing to organize.</span> <span id="s1104">So I depend on my strength and pleasing the civilian contractors, and they give me a nice piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1105">And then at night I who to go use the big –</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Latrine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Yeah, to urinate.</span> <span id="s1108">Two minutes I came back, the bread was gone.</span> <span id="s1109">He swallowed it so fast, he stole it from me.</span> <span id="s1110">So I said to myself, “Next time anything I get, I don’t save, in here it is the safest.”</span> <span id="s1111">And that poor man died in my eyes also, he didn't survive, Meir Bornstein (ph), he was French, from – French Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: After you left –</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1115">I want to stay a little bit longer.</span> <span id="s1116">You left – you stayed in the quarantine area longer?</span> <span id="s1117">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: And then, when you left, you went directly to Birkenau?</span> <span id="s1119">A: Birkenau, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: You were there fairly early.</span> <span id="s1121">Did you get involved in building anything, in – since a lot of the camp wasn't yet finished?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">02:36:53</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: The only thing that was built was the Gypsy camp.</span> <span id="s1124">An…another complete camp was added.</span> <span id="s1125">That was – Birkenau was D camp.</span> <span id="s1126">A, B, C, D, and then they were building Gypsy camp.</span> <span id="s1127">It was building it was just – yes, it was putting together barracks.</span> <span id="s1128">Putting together barracks that were prefabricated.</span> <span id="s1129">We didn't know for what.</span> <span id="s1130">It was prefabricated.</span> <span id="s1131">We put them together every day, you know, Kommando means Baukommando – building Kommando.</span> <span id="s1132">We used to go there and help put the barracks together.</span> <span id="s1133">There were natural German civilian foremen, you know, and some professionals.</span> <span id="s1134">It was very simple, a wooden barrack, no windows.</span> <span id="s1135">And some German inmates became blockältesters – blockältesters means elders of the block – and they were by themselves to build an office for them, like – I mean not an office, a separate room, a stubeand they built an oven, an oven made out of bricks throughout the length of the barrack, just so high to be heated with wood, and then it was finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: This was in a separate area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: In Birkenau, but another camp like, it was like camp A, B, C, D, D was where I was, the D Lager.</span> <span id="s1138">And then it was the Gypsy camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: So the Gypsy – did you know it was for Gypsies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: I don't know, but then a lot of Gypsies came, men and woman came together and they were kept there.</span> <span id="s1141">They kept there for a while, and overnight one night they were destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">39 Room (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">40 A separate block for Gypsy families was established on February 26, 1943, when the first large transport of Gypsies arrived in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1144">Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, s.v. “Gypsies.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Did you have any contact with the Gypsies?</span> <span id="s1146">A: No, just my first girlfriend was a Gypsy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: German, German Gypsies from Germany.</span> <span id="s1149">Q: You mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: In that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Because you were there fairly early, did you have a sense of the overall structure of Auschwitz Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Structure?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Well, I mean there were these different camps, and there were things going on in different places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: No, they were all the same.</span> <span id="s1157">Birkenau was practically the same, the same barracks, you know.</span> <span id="s1158">They all look the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: But in Birkenau was where the crematoria were?</span> <span id="s1160">A: Crematoria, yes.</span> <span id="s1161">We didn't get to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: You never saw the crematoria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: No, we didn't.</span> <span id="s1164">We saw the flames from a distance.</span> <span id="s1165">I could smell like Sunday – we didn't work, you know – or at night you go out, you saw the flames.</span> <span id="s1166">And the people they put in the oven, we couldn't get in touch with them also, because they were kept in a separate barrack, they called that Sonderkommando.</span> <span id="s1167">And every few months they used to put them in an oven and get new, until they make an uprise, this Sonderkommando.</span> <span id="s1168">They were to go up and got hold of some guns, but it was very fast made “hush, hush.”</span> <span id="s1169">41 October 7, 1944, Sonderkommando unit in Auschwitz-Birkenau Crematoria IV stage uprising which destroys crematoria facility – all

id="s1173">Or groups?</span> <span id="s1174">Anything like that, when they passed by you or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Well, when they were taken there were selections held, you know, selections held once in a while see who still has some meat on them, like everyone had to get naked outside you know, and MengeleDr.</span> <span id="s1176">Mengele came out, and you had to present yourself, either you were sent to the barrack or sent on the side.</span> <span id="s1177">The ones that sent on the side, they went to block number seven, seven, and they put a “L” on them here.</span> <span id="s1178">“L” means generally means “leiche” – in English would mean “corpse.”</span> <span id="s1179">They put in that block, and from then they put them in a truck and into the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: You went through these selections often?</span> <span id="s1181">A: Oh, yes, quiet often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: How often?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">02:41:15</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Oh, many times, every few months; but I managed to – once I got – another miracle I escaped.</span> <span id="s1185">Once I got pneumonia in Birkenau, and I went to hospital.</span> <span id="s1186">And there were two Jewish doctors from Kraków, and I remember they listen to me, and they made a picture of my lungs with little points, you know, they had no x-rays or anything, and they told me, “one thing will save you, you have to get some calcium.”</span> <span id="s1187">Calcium you could only get injections from somebody who worked in Kanada, and in Kanada they had a little room where all the trucks came in they kept them there separately.</span> <span id="s1188">So one of the men that I was friendly with got hold of calcium injections and put it in his rectum and brought it to me, and the doctors injected me, and I came out of it.</span> <span id="s1189">But during that time was a selection, it was selection, but they manage to hide me.</span> <span id="s1190">They confuse the number, somehow they confuse the number of the sick people minus less, minus one, and I got away.</span> <span id="s1191">And then I got better again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: What about the selections, you said you were in them every few months, but were they happening more often than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: When there were enough sick people when they couldn't go to work, there were quite often, I don't exactly know, we didn't know what the purpose was, he says everybody up, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: And was Mengele involved in all of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Indiana University Press, 1994), 239.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">42 Josef Mengele (1911-1978?)</span> <span id="s1197">, German doctor and SS officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: I have no idea, but I knew that he was the main doctor, because when I went – when I went and I was so sick with fever, I knew that one boy, one boy went or man, he had done something with his finger, you know, I don't know what he, just took a scissor and cut and cut and cut to the bone.</span> <span id="s1199">No injection or nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Were you aware of any of the medical experimentation that you read about now?</span> <span id="s1201">02:43:40</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: I saw – I don't know the experimentation, I saw one boy, there was a young boy running around in Auschwitz, it was a Polish boy, because once in a while they kept children – I didn't know the reason then, like they kept in Birkenau they kept two Rabbis two Greek Rabbis with beards, and used to allow them to pray in the shawls and made movies.</span> <span id="s1203">Now I know it was for propaganda, so this boy was running around.</span> <span id="s1204">All of a sudden I heard that the boy dropped dead.</span> <span id="s1205">So there was a barrack where they did the experiments and I looked through a little pea hole, it was like the door there was spaces, and I saw they were cutting him.</span> <span id="s1206">And I saw the they cut the scalp and pulled the skin over, I saw it, and there were – they took off the part of the scalp and I saw there was a big tumor on the brain, I saw it that with my own eyes, and I knew the reason they wanted to find out why he died.</span> <span id="s1207">But to come back to the – to the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Experimenting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Experimenting, I knew they going on, but I did not witness them because they were in all closed places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: How did you know they were going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: How I know they was going on, to tell you the truth, I didn't.</span> <span id="s1212">I just found out later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">During my being there I didn't know, I didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: When you were with this Kanada group, how come you had to leave there?</span> <span id="s1215">Did people have sort of a set time you were there?</span> <span id="s1216">Did you get privileges?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: No, no, no, no, how come I leave it was because eventually transport ceased, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">They stop coming, so they didn't need us any more, and then as the Allies start to approach, we were evacuated and took to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1219">Really it was a privilege to work there, to get to go there, an that Kommando was a big privilege because there was there was maybe 130 people, everybody was wanting to work there because you could wear any clothes you wanted, good shoes, good clean shirts, and there was – ladies were working there also, so everybody got somebody friendly, and every Friday this girl gave you a clean shirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Did you tell me how you were chosen to work there?</span> <span id="s1221">On that – in that…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: How I was chosen to work on that?</span> <span id="s1223">I think recommendation by the blockältester.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Recommendation that ask the Kapo– Zep, Zep (ph) was his name, “Why don't you take him.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: You started to mention Sunday, you said it was not a workday.</span> <span id="s1226">What happened on a typical Sunday?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: On a typical Sunday.</span> <span id="s1228">Q: Was it a day of rest?</span> <span id="s1229">02:46:50</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: It was a day of rest, it was a day of taking the lice off the clothes, sitting down and try to…</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: That's mostly what you did on Sundays?</span> <span id="s1232">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Do you – what do you remember any humor, any enjoyment, any activities in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: No, there were no humor because everybody was that hungry, you know, everybody was – I have death.</span> <span id="s1235">The own entertainment was the gates when you walked out or walked in, the music, the orchestra was playing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: What was it playing?</span> <span id="s1237">A: A march, march songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: The Germans would play the songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: No, it was inmates, everything was inmates it was a whole band.</span> <span id="s1240">Q: Did it sound nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: It sound pleasant, but who paid attention, because only as you walked by they were playing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Were there any concerts?</span> <span id="s1243">Was there nothing like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">43 Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor Kommando of prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Concert, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: But your brother said that there were – I thought he said there were sometimes music, there was sometimes soccer games?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: There was a boxing game, I remember there was a Polish guy I remember the name Czortek (ph), just for the, for the group of people for their entertainment – for the blockältesters.</span> <span id="s1248">But soccer games, I don't know of any soccer games.</span> <span id="s1249">Maybe in his camp, not in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: There was no special –</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: No, no soccer games.</span> <span id="s1252">The only activity Sunday activity was to witness how people got hanged or shot, because if somebody escaped they brought them back and they hung them and we had to witnessed that.</span> <span id="s1253">Everybody had to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: So you witnessed a lot of hangings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1256">And then I remember very vividly they caught 22 Polish people, nice huge guys, six footers, very, very well.</span> <span id="s1257">Apparently they were listening or operating some radio system.</span> <span id="s1258">They got caught and they put first 11, and then another 11, at very close range they shot them dead, and the whole camp had to watch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: At close range?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Close range, yes, to make sure that they don't miss.</span> <span id="s1261">And I understand that according to the law of – whether Geneva or general law – if somebody is being hanged and the cord breaks, the man can live.</span> <span id="s1262">And I saw they hang a man, twice it ripped, third time they shot him.</span> <span id="s1263">I don't know if it's true or not, the Geneva law, if you hang somebody and the cord breaks your life is granted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Now you say they have you seem to have pretty good relationships with the blockältesters, and you seem to be able to charm them or finesse them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Not really, not really.</span> <span id="s1266">First of all in Auschwitz because I open up my mouth and I was the landsman – somebody from Warsaw and I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s1267">And then so when I came to Birkenau, when I came to Birkenau there was one stubendienst – I mean one that took care of it – happened to be from the neighborhood Plonsk that was in the camp with my oldest brother, knew my oldest brother.</span> <span id="s1268">So I got used to him, you know, so I became friendly with him a little bit, and then he knew somebody else, and that's how you get into the little group where you get a little more, but the blockältester, they were already set up with their own group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: How did somebody get chosen to be one of them?</span> <span id="s1270">A: Stubendienst?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Or a block-elder?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Well blockältester were German inmates.</span> <span id="s1273">The Germans got better positions, and his helper – and the Lagerältester44you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Were they mostly pretty horrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s1276">Not really, not really.</span> <span id="s1277">Not really.</span> <span id="s1278">Q: Some of them were decent to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: They were decent, but they wanted respect and discipline because they had to answer to the higher authorities also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: But didn't they get points for treating you badly?</span> <span id="s1281">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">02:52:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Did you have strong relationships with a lot of the other inmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Not strong, but friendly, friendly we became like family, you know.</span> <span id="s1285">Like I go to my brothers, I was friendly with two brothers, the Brown brothers, you know, we would be looking out for one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Yeah, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Were there situations where you had to really just steal from each other and take care of yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Not from the immediate group, because there was no necessity, because everybody had a little bit, you know, and to steal from one another, there was nothing to steal from, unless the person was already in any minute he is dead, and the rations were given out, so another inmate is it near him and he got first to him and he took it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">44 Camp elder (German); prisoner functionary appointed by SS to serve as

prisoners who were treated better?</span> <span id="s1293">For example, prisoners of war who were in there, or German criminals who were put in the camps and were given better positions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: If I had any…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Any sort of reaction to them?</span> <span id="s1296">02:53:30</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Not really, because there were – they had their own gang again.</span> <span id="s1298">They had – they were stuck with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: They had power over you, didn't they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Oh, yes, they had power.</span> <span id="s1301">They could ask us shine my shoes, you know, “Here is this, here's a couple cigarettes or here's a piece of bread,” because they always had a little more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Wasn't that strange?</span> <span id="s1303">I mean, here they were in prison as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: It wasn't strange because he was, he was like the boss because he was before me.</span> <span id="s1305">He had the priorities, you know, and you were just newcomer, hey, so had you to wait until you [gestures rising up].</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Priority.</span> <span id="s1308">Was a priority.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Were you ever aware of efforts to either resist or sabotage the hierarchy, or the Germans in the efforts – any resistance in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: I know one thing, while I was in Buna, while I was in Buna a whole outfit of German soldiers in German uniforms were marched into the camp, the clothes taken away and put in striped clothes just like us.</span> <span id="s1311">And then we wondered why, and we found out that they refused to fulfill an obligation that was against their will, never knew what, what it was, but something they asked to do and they refused, about 40 of them came into camp.</span> <span id="s1312">So apparently that was a group that resisted their own people.</span> <span id="s1313">But the inmates, nobody resisted anything.</span> <span id="s1314">We were just afraid that nobody hits, us so we would got get beaten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Do you remember any specific advice you were given by people who had been there longer, or any advice that you would then give to new prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">02:55:55</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: My only advice is – was not to be hitten, and try the best not to get sick, because people used to grab anything they can, me too.</span> <span id="s1318">Found a bone, you know, from an animal, God knows where, that was in the in the later time, when I was hungry.</span> <span id="s1319">I used to burn it in the garbage and chew on it the whole day.</span> <span id="s1320">I had advice maybe you better go hungry and don't try to get sick.</span> <span id="s1321">And advice, who could give somebody advice, because it was a survival from day to day.</span> <span id="s1322">Somebody would say hey go over there, you could find something to eat or whatever.</span> <span id="s1323">It was just survival, there was – I mean, what could anybody tell anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Well, they might know where there might be some food?</span> <span id="s1325">A: They kept it for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Let's change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">03:01:15</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Do you remember, when you were in Birkenau, situations of real abuse by the people in authority?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Yes, I got, once I got badly abused.</span> <span id="s1331">Q: By whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: By the blockältester, by the blockältester.</span> <span id="s1333">I mean he had a complaint from outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Apparently I stood in line twice, they were giving out, when an extra piece of bread and cigarettes, something.</span> <span id="s1335">Sometimes they used to give out cigarettes for workers.</span> <span id="s1336">And my couple, my foreman, gave me a name of somebody that deceased the day before, because everybody – so first I went to my name, and then I went for the other guy, say I'm him, so I could get three four more cigarettes to exchange for bread.</span> <span id="s1337">So that there was a little boy that was working for the blockältester or whatever, he said, “He, he was here already.”</span> <span id="s1338">So, I start running, so I start running, and they caught me and they got my number.</span> <span id="s1339">So the in evening after the appellthe blockältester called out my number, and they hang me for 20 minutes by my hands like this.</span> <span id="s1340">And I developed a bad disk there, you know.</span> <span id="s1341">And while I was hanging they hit me on my whole body; it was pretty painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Were you screaming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Sure, I was crying.</span> <span id="s1344">But then again, I did it again where I got away, you know.</span> <span id="s1345">Q: Now you're – you also were working in other camps, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: The other camps after Birkenau was very, very hard work.</span> <span id="s1349">First of all, it was breaking up stones with a big sledge hammer into small pieces.</span> <span id="s1350">Once they were broken up, you had to load up trucks with them very fast.</span> <span id="s1351">And the trucks were driven to the air strips.</span> <span id="s1352">And after the trucks we walked toward the air strips and distributed the broken up little stones, gravel stones, nice evenly over the whole area, as much as was necessary, as a lot.</span> <span id="s1353">And then we waited, waited for the cement truck to come.</span> <span id="s1354">And we had to go in with the feet to the cement and were given big brooms to push the cement, even out.</span> <span id="s1355">That was very, very hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">45 roll call (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: And if you couldn't do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: You got beaten, you had to do it.</span> <span id="s1359">Q: Did you see beatings a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Yes, very much.</span> <span id="s1361">Very much because they didn’t believe.</span> <span id="s1362">I got beaten once again, we were building railroads and we had to carry on our shoulders the railroads.</span> <span id="s1363">If we got even people then the load even up.</span> <span id="s1364">Once, two – one from front of me one in back of me – were shorter than me, so the load fell on me, and I caved in, you know, and they wouldn't believe me.</span> <span id="s1365">And I was hit, hit over the head.</span> <span id="s1366">They thought that I'm playing games.</span> <span id="s1367">And I told them, the guys are shorter.</span> <span id="s1368">“Never mind, you verfluchte Jude,” It was a Belgian civilian worker that was not an inmate, he was just working for the German Kommando in that particular area, being paid, whatever, he bit me like anything, but things got – I got up, and next couple days they got little friendly with me because he saw I wore a coat.</span> <span id="s1369">I had a coat made of good material.</span> <span id="s1370">And inside the coat it was build in so much, and he wanted a hat – to made the hat, you know.</span> <span id="s1371">So, there were two French tailors.</span> <span id="s1372">He says you give them the material from inside, we going to cut it out, make a hat and get bread from him.</span> <span id="s1373">So we made a deal, three partners, two tailors and me.</span> <span id="s1374">I give them materials they sewed it and he got two loaves of bread and we split it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: You were building railroad tracks?</span> <span id="s1376">A: Railroad tracks also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Was this kind of activity going on throughout your whole time there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: No, it was air strips and railroad tracks, air strip, railroad tracks, what else was there, that was practically it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Now, was this earlier on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: No, that was that was already – I think it was the last, the last that was the beginning of '45, because I remember the air raids were coming, and that was our only relief, because it was near the woods where we built this air strips, and when the Allies were coming, we were ordered to run into the woods to hide.</span> <span id="s1381">When we run into the woods we used to grab the leaves, dried leaves from the trees, and we had the paper from the cement paper, and roll them up and we smoked just to relieve the hunger.</span> <span id="s1382">And the planes were coming so low, you held on to, and they were British, they were the Royal Air Force we could see.</span> <span id="s1383">We could almost see the pilot, they came down so low, because some German airplanes were sitting.</span> <span id="s1384">They just got them on the ground and destroyed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">46 Damn Jew (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">03:07:20</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: I don't want to get too far off yet, but since you are talking about it, when you saw or heard these air raids, did you think that there was some hope that you would be rescued?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: If there was some hope, I knew a war was going on, but whether they are going to succeed, whether we are going to be liberated, that doesn't come to our mind, that didn't come to our mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: The dream, we were so conditioned to it, that that's it, that's it, you know, that's it.</span> <span id="s1391">We had one wish, enough bread before we die, because we are prepared, we; I don't say me, I was never prepared for that.</span> <span id="s1392">Because whenever the boy ask me, “What do you think we going to survive all this?”</span> <span id="s1393">I says me yes, you, I don't know, swear to God.</span> <span id="s1394">I always had to positive attitude.</span> <span id="s1395">And then I couldn't picture any liberation, any, how do you start, I don't know where my mother is, I don't know where my brothers are, I'm all alone here.</span> <span id="s1396">I just didn't picture to resume a new life, what's it going to be, because I was kind of taken care of.</span> <span id="s1397">Okay, I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1398">I had to sleep in my clothes because I was afraid to take them off, wet or dry, you know.</span> <span id="s1399">And my feet were wet and cold all the time.</span> <span id="s1400">It was winter time, snow, but yet, I was programmed.</span> <span id="s1401">I got up in the morning got my little black coffee or a little piece of bread and I know lunch time came they brought the little thing, if I was lucky I got a little thick soup, if not I drink whatever I can.</span> <span id="s1402">And then I stood in front of the German, three, four feet away made a pity face, you know, while he was peeling his potatoes and throwing the peels, I used to run, grab the peels.</span> <span id="s1403">So, he throw me a potato sometimes, and sometimes then, just he did that [indicates grinding into ground] to the peels, nobody should get them.</span> <span id="s1404">But always try to find some sympathy someplace, you know – throw me a potato.</span> <span id="s1405">They were not allowed to do this, they were not allowed to.</span> <span id="s1406">But some of them had a heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Were there only things in the average day that come back to you that really stand out in your mind, the way you spent your days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Not really, all the same, all the same, just nothing to look forward to, you know, nothing to look forward to, just.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Why were these appells so difficult for people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Standing those many hours with the cold, just standing and waiting.</span> <span id="s1411">You got up in the morning, you wanted your little tea or whatever they gave you, you wanted it.</span> <span id="s1412">Sometimes you couldn't sleep through the night because you are so hungry.</span> <span id="s1413">In the morning they gave you the piece of bread with margarine and a little tea or coffee, whatever you wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">And they kept you hours and hours and hours, bad weather, rain, mud, you know.</span> <span id="s1415">There was one German in Birkenau called SchillingerHe was so bad, he was so bad.</span> <span id="s1416">Out of nowhere, he used to take people and he made us jump like a rabbit or roll over in the mud.</span> <span id="s1417">So much punishment, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1418">One day a transport came from Poland, they told the Polish Jews, “Whoever had papers to go to United States and missed the ship, now it's time, take all your valuables and you’re going.”</span> <span id="s1419">So people believed them.</span> <span id="s1420">And they brought them straight to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1421">And here goes this woman and this man, and he happened to be – the guy, Schillinger goes to this woman and man and have an argument with them.</span> <span id="s1422">“Why did you fool us?</span> <span id="s1423">You told us so and so, and you brought us.”</span> <span id="s1424">So this Schillinger slaps the man.</span> <span id="s1425">The woman grabs the gun and kills him, his own gun, and kills them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: He killed Schillinger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Yes, Schillinger.</span> <span id="s1428">That was Yom Kipper when we heard that Schillinger got killed.</span> <span id="s1429">I mean we prayed merciful to for God for taking him away from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: You didn't see this?</span> <span id="s1431">A: I didn't see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Were there reprisals?</span> <span id="s1433">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Was there sort of revenge by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Oh, they took them right away, everybody – the whole transport was gassed.</span> <span id="s1436">But this woman, you know, unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: You said when you first arrived you saw Eichmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: I found out later that is Eichmann, you know, that…[pointing].</span> <span id="s1439">Q: Did –</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: On the ramp and made the decision who lives who dies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">47 SS Staff Sergeant Josef Schillinger, successive appell leader and commander of outside squad for Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Auschwitz Chronicle, 1939-1945, 821.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">48 October 23, 1943, a transport of 1,800 Polish Jews bearing passports for Latin America, arrived via Bergen- Belsen concentration camp in Poland.</span> <span id="s1444">Apparently, these so-called “exchange Jews’ did not realize their destination and fate until arriving on the selection platform at Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1445">During the processing of the female prisoners, a woman grabbed Schillinger’s revolver, killed him and injured another SS officer.</span> <span id="s1446">A riot ensued and re-enforcement’s were called who eventually subdued the women and herded them into the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1447">Auschwitz Chronicle, 1939-1945, 513.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: What was he like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: Serious, you know.</span> <span id="s1450">Tall, dark and handsome.</span> <span id="s1451">He was a nice man and he looked like a respectful man.</span> <span id="s1452">He didn't speak, he didn't talk, just motion [pointing] with his hands, he didn't talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: So you walked out to these other places to work?</span> <span id="s1454">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Any particular experiences that stand out as you worked at all these other sites?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Well, we used to – there was a camp near Stuttgart we used to go to work every day, and we had to go to a village.</span> <span id="s1457">And very, very often, very often, German woman used to come out and holding something in there, and waited to get okay from the SS that was accompanying us, and they used to throw out bread, piece of bread in fronts of us, or in the middle, whoever could grab it, if the soldiers give the permission, otherwise they would turn return their goods.</span> <span id="s1458">Many of them they did allow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: I wonder why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Some had a heart, because the ones that watched us, they were not young soldiers, they were mens in the 60s, fathers, you know, so maybe they are – and just what – was not SS, there was the WehrmachtI don't even know the difference.</span> <span id="s1461">I mean the SS was the closest – the most supportive to Hitler, and the other one was just like reserve.</span> <span id="s1462">Were older men that could hardly carry their rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Do you think the people that you passed as you went through the villages had a clue what was going on inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: If they had a clue what's going on?</span> <span id="s1465">I don't know that they knew about the destruction, the gassing, the burning.</span> <span id="s1466">They knew that we are inmates to do labor work for them.</span> <span id="s1467">And when the they sad the way some of us look, and maybe some of the soldiers were talking to the wives, and the wives, you know, passed the word so they had idea that we are punished.</span> <span id="s1468">Whether we were Jews or not, we had no idea, because everybody wear the striped uniforms, because we were never in contact with them, no close contact with the civilian population.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Were you ever in any other camps for any length of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: No, all of us were only short, short because Allies – but the last, by the end, again I don't 49 General title of German armed forces from 1935 to 1945.</span> <span id="s1471">Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, s.v. “Wehrmacht.”</span> <span id="s1472">remember the date, we were brought into Dachau one night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Let's hold on one second and let me see if there's anything else we need to cover about Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1474">I don’t think so – pretty thorough.</span> <span id="s1475">Anything that stands out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: Not really, not too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: Other than the fact that you were there a long time, in Birkenau?</span> <span id="s1478">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: Three, four years?</span> <span id="s1480">A: [Nods “yes.”]</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: It must have been have seemed endless?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Not Birkenau, all the camps together.</span> <span id="s1483">Yes it was endless, it was endless.</span> <span id="s1484">And at the end of all these little camps, we were finally brought in, at night, to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s1486">A. I don't know why, it was – I guess it was the end of the trip for them, they had no place to get us any more, in Dachau we were we also were short time, few days, and then were sent on a march, you know, just walking, walking, day in and day out, and walking, walking, walking, walking and walking to nowhere.</span> <span id="s1487">And people were falling like flies, left and right, left and right, you know, didn't know what's going on, getting a piece of bread a day, for warm weather, whatever it is, walking and walking and walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: You were walking by people in villages?</span> <span id="s1489">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Did anyone see you as you were walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Yeah, people were seeing, we were passing little towns, just a mass of people walking, walking and these old soldiers going, you know, creeping.</span> <span id="s1492">And after, I don't know eight days or nine days walking, look back, the group gets smaller and smaller and smaller, and I don't even know how those people were taken away the ones that fell, you know.</span> <span id="s1493">All of a sudden one time they tell us, “sit down for a rest period,” and the German people eat whatever they get, and then we sit, and they tell us “Okay, up, up, up aufstehenup.”</span> <span id="s1494">And like it was a password, we refuse to go.</span> <span id="s1495">What's the use, you know, we refuse to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Then the Germans get mad, they thought that we are rebelling.</span> <span id="s1497">And they, they said, “Up, 50 get up, rise (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">up, rouf, rouf!”</span> <span id="s1499">I mean, up the hill, so big deal, we up the hill, then held his hands up, you know, face the trees and hands up, so we put our hands up.</span> <span id="s1500">And then, then one officer says like “genickschuss”52means aim at the neck, you know.</span> <span id="s1501">We hear the rifles, didn't bother anybody, and we stay and we stay, and we wait and we wait, then we hear one of the officers says, “My God, four kilometers are the Americans!”</span> <span id="s1502">And we hold our hands, and, you know, it hurts.</span> <span id="s1503">We look, look, look, no more German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1504">We run down the hill, and we hear the noise of tanks, tanks, tanks coming.</span> <span id="s1505">And we put our hands up, “Hey, hey, hey,” – didn't know, my God, liberated.</span> <span id="s1506">The other Jews start singing the “Hatikvah”and they tell, “Us let us go, let us go.”</span> <span id="s1507">– they spoke some German, the Americans –“Wir müssen gehen.”</span> <span id="s1508">So what do we know, we let them go, they pass us by.</span> <span id="s1509">And we all alone again, the German come back to take us.</span> <span id="s1510">To take us and march again and again and again and again, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">03:19:58</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: What was going on then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: The Germans just passed, they wouldn't take us, they wouldn't liberate us, they just passed by.</span> <span id="s1514">The Germans hid, they were hiding somewhere, the Americans passed by, the Germans came back.</span> <span id="s1515">But apparently the Germans were in the occupied territory.</span> <span id="s1516">We don't know.</span> <span id="s1517">Then they made us turn around, like back towards Dachau, but there was a camp they name Allach.</span> <span id="s1518">They put us in there, and I think we were there maybe a week or two.</span> <span id="s1519">And that's where I told you where the Germans took off the uniforms and became civilian, and they started to be awful nice to us, awful nice.</span> <span id="s1520">“Oh, we going to try to get you some barley, we are going to get some potatoes, we are going to get the soup a little thicker,” you know.</span> <span id="s1521">And you are men at the appell, you know, we were so all of a sudden we became so confused.</span> <span id="s1522">“Oh, you are men.</span> <span id="s1523">Please behave, you know, like don't make us punish you or hit you,” you know, because some became very disorganized, “what the heck is going on.”</span> <span id="s1524">A few weeks, and then all of a sudden, as I told you, the guards disappeared, you know, and again we don't know what's going on, and people go and break the gates.</span> <span id="s1525">I wasn't even – didn't even have the strength to pick up a piece of stick, I weighed about 90 pounds.</span> <span id="s1526">And all of a sudden some jeeps roll in with a, with a big truck with the red cross on there, you know, and some soldiers come out and shoot

id="s1528">Now I know, then I didn't understand, he says “yah, yah, yah,” and went off.</span> <span id="s1529">At that time I didn't bother looking at them, they wanted to make pictures, I say, “the hell with your pictures.”</span> <span id="s1530">and looked and looked, and go in the truck to look for some food and I find a package and I say, “My God I got chocolate.”</span> <span id="s1531">I

lined up and they’re serving beautiful white bread, and make pancakes, you know, and I start to talk to somebody.</span> <span id="s1539">There was one soldier he was speaking Russian it was American soldiers, and he says, “What's wrong with you?”</span> <span id="s1540">I say, “bubu, bolischmerzen.”</span> <span id="s1541">And he took me in the Jeep, and it wasn't far away and drove me in to a town called Mühldorf and put me in hospital – new, and I got good – you know, cleaned out and the surgeon gave me farina, milk and sugar every day.</span> <span id="s1542">And in two weeks I got [gestures to face] and I just walked out from the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">03:23:40</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: I just want to go back a little.</span> <span id="s1545">So when the Americans came?</span> <span id="s1546">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Yes; and I –.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Do you remember how they treated you?</span> <span id="s1550">Do you remember anything more about the scene?</span> <span id="s1551">Where you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Well, I just told you.</span> <span id="s1553">Didn't hate us at all.</span> <span id="s1554">They just came in as visitors, appeared to me like visitors, you know, they just came in looked around, spoke to some civilian, you know, and that's all.</span> <span id="s1555">And I – there, there was no treatment, didn't pay any attention to us, you know,</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: What did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Just made pictures, I don't know, I said, “What the hell is going on, who are these people?”</span> <span id="s1558">So they says we are free, or liberated – we are liberated.</span> <span id="s1559">People started to sing the “Hatikvah,” and I wanted to eat, didn't get anything for three days since the Germans left.</span> <span id="s1560">The night before we had the artilerske58 some people got killed in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: The night before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: The night before, the father and son got hit with shrapnels.</span> <span id="s1563">So when we they came in, they were looking around making pictures.</span> <span id="s1564">There was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Could you believe that you were free?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">55 “Boo-hoo” (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">56 Hurts (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">57 Pain (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">58 Artillery (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: I could believe because the, the how you call, it the guards were gone.</span> <span id="s1571">The guards were gone.</span> <span id="s1572">And some people broke the gates, the doors were open, the gates were open.</span> <span id="s1573">Some people got strong, they went in and out, and all of a sudden I see the inmates that were in my barracks sleeping next to me, came with – bring motorcycles in they were nice and strong motorcycles.</span> <span id="s1574">Apparently they robbed some people, you know, but I was too sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: What – do you know what happened to the German guards, did they just disappear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: They disappeared, yes, the Germans disappeared.</span> <span id="s1577">Some of the civilian remained to take care of us, just to play a role of repairing, and hoping that one of us would say a good word to the authorities, that they wouldn't imprison them or some prisoners, not to kill them, because prisoners take advantage later on Kapos and the blockältesters.</span> <span id="s1578">I know there was one blockältester in Birkenau that the Ukrainian put them, and they cut him with a saw, because he was a bastard, he was bad.</span> <span id="s1579">So prisoners, I mean inmates took revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">03:25:50</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Did you see this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: I didn't see this.</span> <span id="s1583">It was just talking, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Do you remember approximately the date of all this; the date when you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: The date of liberation, it was spring, April sometimes, I know springtime, it started to get warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: What – where did you go from the hospital?</span> <span id="s1587">You were in there a few months…</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: From the hospital, I walked out to a little town called Ampfing, and I met two boys, two Jewish boys, and I started talking to them, I just came out and “What are you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">What’s, what – where are you from?”</span> <span id="s1590">“They say, well, we are from here.”</span> <span id="s1591">And I said, “Where are you staying?”</span> <span id="s1592">“We are going to two sisters, farmers, you know, they took us in.</span> <span id="s1593">If you want you can come stay with us.”</span> <span id="s1594">So I went with them, and there were two old sisters.</span> <span id="s1595">They were so afraid that they thought that every survivor that comes in, they have to give up their life, you know.</span> <span id="s1596">So they took care of us, all three of us.</span> <span id="s1597">We stood there for several months.</span> <span id="s1598">And then in that particular town, there was a camp in the forest, a camp.</span> <span id="s1599">And they were making parts for airplanes.</span> <span id="s1600">So we used to go there and get little motors, electric motors.</span> <span id="s1601">We took the motors and went to a farmer in exchange for a cow or a calf, slaughtered and sold the meat to camps.</span> <span id="s1602">Camps were established already, UNRRA camps, but they didn't get enough to eat, so we started to be in business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">59 United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: You’re a hustler!</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: Yes, started a business.</span> <span id="s1606">Got a horse and wagon, and started the business.</span> <span id="s1607">Then when we got sick of the little town, we says we going to go to Munich, so we go with the horse and wagon to Munich, and we go, and had already a little idea.</span> <span id="s1608">And one of my partners had a landsman was an administrator in HIASyou know HIAS?</span> <span id="s1609">So I do it here and there, what can we do, and he says “Well, you go and find out an apartment where a Nazi used to live and you can have that apartment.”</span> <span id="s1610">So we found out that Nazi get a clearing order to clear in 24 hours, he had to not even take any bedding, nothing, leave everything as it is.</span> <span id="s1611">And we got a beautiful apartment.</span> <span id="s1612">So we took the horse and wagon back there, came up, moved into apartment, and start doing business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: Who arranged for this Nazi to leave, or you just marched in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: German – we didn't march in, no.</span> <span id="s1615">We asked around, “where do the Nazis live?”</span> <span id="s1616">and Germans used to say, “Nazi used to live here, Nazi used to live here.”</span> <span id="s1617">“You know his name?”</span> <span id="s1618">“Yes.”</span> <span id="s1619">So we talked the guy in the HIAS and he made an application and HIAS – the guy get an order, an eviction and had to give up the apartment.</span> <span id="s1620">And we moved in, and then whoever came from Poland moved in with us to stay, and it was like a transit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: What did you – at what point did you try to find out about your family, your brothers?</span> <span id="s1622">A: I was looking all the time, but I was under the impression that they perished.</span> <span id="s1623">However, this JoeJoe got liberated in Czechoslovakia, he remain in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1624">My older brother somehow wound up now to be in Belgium, you know, from German they took him to Belgium, and me I was in Munich.</span> <span id="s1625">I got organized, I got even a car, the first boy to get a car.</span> <span id="s1626">Nobody could even get a car, I got a car.</span> <span id="s1627">I registered the Palestinian embassy, and I used to drive around the doctor to the children in Palestine, I had the car, and the Rabbi used to drive around and do the weddings.</span> <span id="s1628">And then I started to get – I got acquainted with somebody who had a connection with a Belgia consulate, not knowing that had I had a brother in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1629">The Belgium consulate give a list of people that perished.</span> <span id="s1630">So the men told me for 200 dollars, if anybody wants to emigrate to Belgium, we are going to make him a paper and as that man who perished, going home.</span> <span id="s1631">So I got involved with that, you know, I made hundred dollars, he made hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s1632">“You want to go to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1633">Today your name is so and so, and you are going home legally with the picture.”</span> <span id="s1634">He went to Belgium and in Belgium the HIAS took over, and made them stay until whatever, didn't know that I have a brother in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1635">Then my brother comes from Belgium to Munich looking for me, he was on the street where I was, couldn't find me, goes back to Belgium, and somehow he got in contact with him – Czechoslovakian and Belgian and were writing to each other, and they crying over my 60 Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society (American).</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">61 Icek (Josef) Baum death, you know.</span> <span id="s1637">While I doing business in Munich, I see one man who got approximately the same number.</span> <span id="s1638">I say by the number we know the transport, you know, “Oh you from here, you must have been in Buna.”</span> <span id="s1639">I say “yes.”</span> <span id="s1640">“Do you know Icek Baum?”</span> <span id="s1641">He say, “Sure I know him.</span> <span id="s1642">He is in Friedlandto Czechoslovakia, I just came from there and here is the address.”</span> <span id="s1643">He gives me address, I write a letter, came back “unknown.”</span> <span id="s1644">The Czechs wouldn't let him out, they wanted him to remain there, they wanted him to become a citizen because he was working in electrical place.</span> <span id="s1645">To make the story short, my brother Joe didn't want to be Czechoslovakian, he wants to join his brother in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1646">To go to Belgium he has to go through Czechoslovakia and has to come to Germany, to the border.</span> <span id="s1647">In Germany they meet two girls.</span> <span id="s1648">They say, “Why don't you accompany us to,” – wherever they were—“to, in UNRRA camp.”</span> <span id="s1649">My brother says, “Okay I go.”</span> <span id="s1650">He goes then to Munich.</span> <span id="s1651">In Munich he meets the guy who told me about this.</span> <span id="s1652">“You know, you have a brother here in Munich.”</span> <span id="s1653">He says, “no way.”</span> <span id="s1654">So the whole night I couldn't stand it, and the morning he brings me to him, you know, after years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Then I start crying to him that the other one is dead.</span> <span id="s1656">He says, “No he is not dead, he is in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1657">Here's a picture.”</span> <span id="s1658">So right away I go with this – with him and make papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Now we go to Belgium, who wants to be in Munich.</span> <span id="s1660">So we make papers and I got suitcases.</span> <span id="s1661">And the brother from Belgium comes to Munich.</span> <span id="s1662">And then we all went to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1663">We stayed in Belgium for a while, and the war broke out in Israel.</span> <span id="s1664">We went to fight in 1948, me and the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: How did you get over there; was that easy?</span> <span id="s1666">A: To?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: To Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: To Palestine, my brother got smuggled in somehow.</span> <span id="s1669">And I went to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1670">From Marseilles, the United States donated a ship, a frigate, a war ship.</span> <span id="s1671">And they kept me from Israel again mobilized us in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1672">We walk on the ship prepared.</span> <span id="s1673">We went out on sea under a Panama flag from Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1674">And on the waters, a little Jewish fish boat came and passed the Jewish flag to us and we went into Haifa.</span> <span id="s1675">In Haifa put in the cannons right away and out to war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: So you went to Israel to fight for independence?</span> <span id="s1677">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Had you tried to get there legally before?</span> <span id="s1679">Had you try to immigrate there earlier?</span> <span id="s1680">03:33:50 62 Frýdlant, Czech Republic</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: No, no, no, I just went as a volunteer to fight.</span> <span id="s1682">Q: And the same with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: And did you meet with up I with him there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: Yes, I meet up with him there.</span> <span id="s1686">And then when the war ended, they had to liberate us because we were not aliyahyou know, at our request, because nobody wanted to be there; it was bad, there was no food, and I got married there and I couldn't find any occupation in the situation.</span> <span id="s1687">Since they had to let me out, I went back to Belgium, and I applied to come to the United States or Canada.</span> <span id="s1688">And in Belgium every day the police was chasing me, couldn't stay there, for a whole year.</span> <span id="s1689">And I wrote a letter to Queen Victoria telling her my situation, and nobody came to Belgium to let me stay in Belgium, give me permission to work for as long as I want.</span> <span id="s1690">At the same time, I got the permission – a permit that I was permitted to move to Canada.</span> <span id="s1691">So 1951, I emigrated to Canada, and lived in Canada for 15 years and still wanted to come to this beautiful country and finally succeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: You wrote a letter to Queen Victoria?</span> <span id="s1693">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: And somehow–</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: Explaining my situation.</span> <span id="s1696">Q: – it got through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1698">I explained I have no place to go.</span> <span id="s1699">I cannot back to Poland because of the persecution the survivors of such a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1700">And here I came to this wonderful country and I’m waiting to receive immigration papers.</span> <span id="s1701">And then this Mr. – what's his name in the jus…, the palais of justice– send the police after me every day, every day where I'm going to go, because I was not legal in Belgium, because I was an alien.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: How long were you in Israel?</span> <span id="s1703">A: About 14 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Was it exciting fighting for the…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">63 Immigrant to Israel (Hebrew).</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">64 palais de justice; law-courts (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: Sure it was it was exciting, sure.</span> <span id="s1708">Ben-Gurioncame on our ship.</span> <span id="s1709">I was a chef on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">I had always a spoon in the pot!</span> <span id="s1711">There was no food, it was very bad in Israel then, everything rations.</span> <span id="s1712">But for the soldiers, we got – and I cooked for them meals.</span> <span id="s1713">They loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: When you got into Haifa you were fighting on land?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Not in on land, the Israeli navy.</span> <span id="s1716">My brother was on land; I was in the navy, the Israeli navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: And you met were up with him in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Yes; I met him – I just visit him, just visiting.</span> <span id="s1719">When I came there, he had furlough 24 hours, so he spend time with me, and then he had to go back on his camp and I was on the ship.</span> <span id="s1720">He wanted to come on the ship too, but they never allowed two brothers in the same outfit because, God forbid, if something happens, at least one us should survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Did your brother stay in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: No, he came back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1723">He is older than Joe, he is in Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Now, one thing I didn't ask you about is, was religion ever important to you throughout all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: No.</span> <span id="s1726">Believed in God, prayed to God, but you know, I had a hard time – you I used to go to – mama used to send me to chederyou know cheder?</span> <span id="s1727">Jewish school, religious Jewish school where they had all the Rabbis?</span> <span id="s1728">But they used to beat up on the children.</span> <span id="s1729">If you didn't know something, "pow," or let defense down, and he hit.</span> <span id="s1730">So I didn't want to go, I just refused to go to that.</span> <span id="s1731">So Mama order – hired a tutor to come three times a week to the house and teach me Jewish, you know, how to pray and all that.</span> <span id="s1732">But, he wanted one zloty, like one dollar every week, and we didn't have it, so he didn't come.</span> <span id="s1733">So I never really learned.</span> <span id="s1734">I know a little bit.</span> <span id="s1735">Now I go to synagogue Friday, Saturday, just.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: How did you feel about being a Jew throughout all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: How I felt, I mean I wish – I used to wish I wasn't.</span> <span id="s1738">You know, like, “Why did God want me Jew?</span> <span id="s1739">Why did he want to punish me?</span> <span id="s1740">Why?</span> <span id="s1741">Look at all this.</span> <span id="s1742">Why I was unprivileged?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">03:38:20 65 David Ben-Gurion (1886-1973), Zionist leader and Israeli statesman, served as first prime minister of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. “Ben-Gurion, David.”</span> <span id="s1745">66 Orthodox primary school (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: You didn't necessarily look down on Jews, you just didn't like the position?</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: Yes, I wish I wasn't.</span> <span id="s1748">I was trying to deny it, but – I could deny it but I couldn't hide it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: When you look back at this long period, that you were really suffering, what do you think of that now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: Well, guilty, I mean why, why couldn't my mother have lived, why couldn't my beautiful three sisters have lived, my older brother, why?</span> <span id="s1751">And then again, I put it in the hands of God, he wanted me.</span> <span id="s1752">He wanted me to tell the story, although I'm still paying a high price for it.</span> <span id="s1753">It's haunting me constantly.</span> <span id="s1754">Especially that woman that took my number down.</span> <span id="s1755">I see her so often, “take his number.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: It seems throughout all of this there was some God?</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: And some sceneries that I have seen, like, for instance, in Plonsk, when they told the people to come out, out, out, so the woman tried to hide, and was hiding too, her child.</span> <span id="s1758">So this young, young soldier about 17 years old grabbed the child out of her hands, and she was screaming and he shot her right in the mouth and threw the child down.</span> <span id="s1759">You know, seeing all these sceneries just come back, come back to me, haunting me.</span> <span id="s1760">The evacuation, the train rides, especially the train ride to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1761">It wasn't an actual train, it was those little narrow on the narrow tracks, how you call this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: You were in cattle cars, weren’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Not cattle cars, there were narrow tracks and they were up and hanging in aisle like containers, with a little locomotive,67 and they were running during the night, and the whistle sounds in my ears so sad, you know, like a crying whistle.</span> <span id="s1764">And you going to nowhere, to nowhere.</span> <span id="s1765">And coming to the Dachau and the Germans with the dogs, you know, not where knowing the next what's going to be.</span> <span id="s1766">So I'm free, I'm not free.</span> <span id="s1767">Then I told you I liberated myself.</span> <span id="s1768">In 1988 the Polish authorities tried to find whoever was in Dr. Korczak home and made anniversary celebration of 75 years of existence of the house, the building is still there, you know, that they built.</span> <span id="s1769">So they got hold of me and my friend David, and there was another one, he moved to California, he would be a testimony.</span> <span id="s1770">So we went to Poland; we went to Poland, and we come to Poland and people, introduce one another, comes a gentleman and he says my name is Aleksander Lewin, but in orphanage they used to call me Szura, and if there would be a hole I would fall right in.</span> <span id="s1771">He was my Mr. Szura.</span> <span id="s1772">He was the one that was like my father next to Dr. Korczak, you know, used to help me with my homework, come to my school, and we I mean we hugged and kissed.</span> <span id="s1773">He didn't recognize but I show him my picture.</span> <span id="s1774">It was – then we go into to the home and I look, and the feeling over came, came over me like the best to describe it like 67 Schmalspurbahn (narrow-gauge railway).</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">you have your famous toy, your famous doll, they take it away from you, they give it back but it's broken, you know.</span> <span id="s1776">Like everybody – that commode, everybody had, with the little drawers where your toys were it's gone.</span> <span id="s1777">Everything is different.</span> <span id="s1778">But one thing, they assign a seat to me, you know, to sit down, and they assign me the same seat at the same table where I was when I was a child, you know, not knowingly.</span> <span

immigrated to Israel and to Australia and to Brazil, they also came.</span> <span id="s1782">So I was the youngest, and I remembered the most of Dr. Korczak, you know, so my stories were….</span> <span id="s1783">And they took us on tours to different camps.</span> <span id="s1784">And then me and David hired a private chauffeur with a car and says I want to go a Auschwitz; I want to go to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1785">We had to have the courage, you know.</span> <span id="s1786">So drive to Auschwitz, and naturally I walk in, now my memory comes.</span> <span id="s1787">When I came to Auschwitz I was forced in.</span> <span id="s1788">And this thing, you know, the railroad crossing that long thing was closed shut, electric wire, no way out.</span> <span id="s1789">Here I walk in because I want to walk in.</span> <span id="s1790">And I know on the other side is a guy waiting with a Mercedes for me, and I walk out.</span> <span id="s1791">I'm liberated.</span> <span id="s1792">That's why I say I didn't feel liberated when the Allies came.</span> <span id="s1793">I walked in my free will and I walked out.</span> <span id="s1794">And since then I feel liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: You never felt got liberated since – A: No, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: Sort of just trapped with the memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: I was just then, as I say, I came in and took over like a landlord buys a building and the tenants were there.</span> <span id="s1798">They came and they were there; the territory was occupied and we were there.</span> <span id="s1799">But there was no provision for us, you know, like I would understand they came in with doctors or, or Red Cross, you know, medication or some food, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Anything else you want to add?</span> <span id="s1802">A: Well, that's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">03:45:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: My pleasure.</span></p></body></html>
