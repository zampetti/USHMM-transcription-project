KESSELMAN</span></p> <p><span id="s12">July 19, 1989</span></p> <p><span id="s13">MK: ...we started a soccer team for survivors...about 35 years ago...just to get the survivors together, to see how we could help each other, because we needed- because none of us made big pay in those days.</span> <span id="s14">We had a hard time getting by, but we struggled.</span> <span id="s15">But none of us went on welfare, I can assure you of that, if you ask.</span> <span id="s16">Not for the reasons that welfare was then offered, but even then if it would be offered, we wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s17">We were told for one reason not to do it because it might hurt the Jewish immigration...the HIAS or the Jewish Agency did help people, there’s no question about it...I know ourselves, we were very much helped with medical, because part of the days we came here, I worked in a place, I made sixty cents an hour, and my wife bore a child right as we came here, and the Jewish Agency gave us card for Beth Israel Hospital, not knowing who’s paying for it.</span> <span id="s18">Not that we didn’t get any less service, or less attention, that anybody did pay...this was my second son, my first born was born in Germany, and they were very helpful to us, and thank G-d there was two weeks we got some help from the Jewish Agency, I don’t know, I think we got $19- those two weeks...Jewish Family Service...in Boston.</span> <span id="s19">I remember it like today.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">WH: How come you remember it so well?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">MK: Because it still sticks in my throat until today.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">WH: That you had to take anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">MK: ...I’ll tell you what I said to my wife.</span> <span id="s24">I had to go up every week for the $19 and I said, if I have to go up one more week, I hope I’ll break both my legs.</span> <span id="s25">I only went twice, because it was very undignified, I come from a different background, and the few questions I was asked, maybe I didn’t understand that they had to ask them, but it was very degrading...the third week I went to work.</span> <span id="s26">And I went to work for less money than they gave me.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">WH: ...you came by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">RK: Yes...Marin Jumper?</span> <span id="s29">...June 23, 1949...landed in New York...it was a military boat...</span></p> <p><span id="s30">WH: Where did you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">MK: We met in Germany.</span> <span id="s32">After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">RK: I was in Auschwitz and I was liberated in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s34">And Morris came with other boys to look in Bergen-Belsen where to find a friend, or maybe somebody from the family, and I met him through somebody who went to school with me...</span></p> <p><span id="s35">WH: ...when you look today, 1989, it lasted.</span> <span id="s36">How come marriages that were made under stress after terrible things that people went through, do you have any thought about why so many of them lasted so long?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">MK: ...we came out, we didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s38">And we struggled.</span> <span id="s39">Love is only good for a short time.</span> <span id="s40">When you cannot survive and have a family, and have children, and you don’t have much money, it start getting on your nerve, from either side.</span> <span id="s41">But, love is what marriage is, a work of art.</span> <span id="s42">And you try, and you get better, and you get better and you get better because we didn’t have any place to go.</span> <span id="s43">We had to make it work.</span> <span id="s44">And we came out from a background a little difference than today.</span> <span id="s45">And we cared for each other.</span> <span id="s46">WE had some arguments.</span> <span id="s47">I think we had arguments mostly because of the children, because, I worked very hard all my life (inaudible).</span> <span id="s48">I’ll give you an example.</span> <span id="s49">We took out a life insurance policy for our first two sons, I told you, gave our sons an endowment.</span> <span id="s50">It was 50 cents a week.</span> <span id="s51">I cancelled it three times.</span> <span id="s52">Didn’t have the 50 cents.</span> <span id="s53">I took a subway for ten cents, and I had to take a 5 cents transfer, and I walked two miles because 7 cents was a bread!</span> <span id="s54">I only earned $16 a week.</span> <span id="s55">SO we struggled, and we struggled and we tried for the better.</span> <span id="s56">The difference between today’s children, they come out from a better supplied economy, easier life, and they get educated on both, which is a wonderful thing, and they have a way out.</span> <span id="s57">And, they don’t want to struggle.</span> <span id="s58">You take two children, from one house and the other house, which have everything supplied by them, by the parents, then they go out- they have to give up maybe half of their things what they had before, to start all over again.</span> <span id="s59">If the parents do not help, they are in trouble.</span> <span id="s60">And I don’t think most of them want to struggle.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">RK: Another thing is, let’s say that a couple came from Europe, they had nothing, they had nobody to help them.</span> <span id="s62">The woman couldn’t go to work, she had little children.</span> <span id="s63">She had no education.</span> <span id="s64">Even if their marriage didn’t go so well for them, where would the woman go?</span> <span id="s65">She wouldn’t go and ask for help from the government, so she had to stay and struggle.</span> <span id="s66">She went to work, the woman worked, the man worked, they tried to make it.</span> <span id="s67">Some marriages made, were not made in heaven,.</span> <span id="s68">Some of our friends, they made the best of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">WH: Do you think that there was something in the experience of the survivors that made them say that when there would be difficult times, you would say, “Well, compared to what I went through during the war, this is nothing!”</span></p> <p><span id="s70">MK: Oh, sure!</span> <span id="s71">Many times we said it to ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">RK: This everybody says.</span> <span id="s73">That’s in everybody’s back of the mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">WH: ...what had you heard about America before you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">RK: That in America the Jews had more freedom, and it’s a land- everybody thought it’s a land of Milk and Honey.</span> <span id="s76">(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s77">WH: Did you think of going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">MK: We were on the way to go to Israel...</span></p> <p><span id="s79">WH: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">MK: 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: And you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">RK: December 1926.</span> <span id="s83">We are 19 days apart...and we got married because of (wanting to go to Israel) that.</span> <span id="s84">We thought, we’ll get married and then we’ll go (to Israel)...and my cousin wrote to me that ‘it’s very bad now, if you can go to America, here’s an address, we have a cousin in America near Boston, cousin Ethel, write to her, and I will write to her, and maybe she’ll bring you to America, because you survived such a terrible war, you’re the only survivor from the whole family, and- you can always come to Israel.</span> <span id="s85">Try to go to America.’</span> <span id="s86">So, in the meantime, we still wanted to go.</span> <span id="s87">I was pregnant with my son, and they wouldn’t take me because I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s88">They refused me to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">MK: This is the second time.</span> <span id="s90">You dropped out when the first time when we went to Bergen-Belsen, and we got our stuff, and when we came there, the story changed, because he (Rita’s cousin) told me that we gotta go for six months to a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s91">And then, we could get a certificate for her, and we’ll go to Israel, and this,- so they got me a little upset because he got me down on the wrong pretenses.</span> <span id="s92">I was not ready to go to a kibbutz after the camp.</span> <span id="s93">And I said to Rita, let’s pack up and go back to Stuttgart...</span></p> <p><span id="s94">RK: In the meantime, my cousin wrote to me from America, ‘Don’t go any place.</span> <span id="s95">I want you to come here.’</span></p> <p><span id="s96">WH: ...how long did you stay in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">RK: A girl-friend that came and picked us up from the boat...her uncle was an actor and...President of the Jewish theater...and then put us on the train, I had already my son, a year old on the boat...and my cousin picked us up here in Boston from the train and took us to their farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">MK: ...earlier...I had used a different name...in hopes of getting to America...(in case I had relatives here by that name)...</span></p> <p><span id="s99">WH: ...what was your name (originally)?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">MK: Ziedenfeld</span></p> <p><span id="s101">WH: Did you meet anybody here whose name was Ziedenfeld?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">MK: No...but the way I found my family was through the newspapers, The Forward...</span></p> <p><span id="s103">WH: When you were in...Birkenau...how long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">MK: Twenty three months...she (Rita) was there before me.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">WH: So, when you came here, you were on the farm for 7,8 months, but you didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">MK: It was a coincidence why it was 7 months.</span> <span id="s107">I didn’t like it the first day...I had no other place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">RK: ...we didn’t speak the language, we didn’t know what to do!</span> <span id="s109">...then I was pregnant with my second son and there was no place for us on the farm...and my cousin didn’t like another baby coming, so we didn’t have it so easy on the farm so we had a (survivor) friend in Boston...and they told us to come...and they took Morris to Jewish Family Service and that’s how he got a job...</span></p> <p><span id="s110">WH: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">MK: Three...one ten years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">WH: When you came here, what were the people like?</span> <span id="s113">The Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">RK: The Americans, we were very disappointed...so we came to my cousins, people came.</span> <span id="s115">He had a big family.</span> <span id="s116">She was my cousin, but he had a big family here and they used to come to the farm, cousins, children, and aunts and uncles, to see the ‘greener’ that came from Europe.</span> <span id="s117">And they came, and they asked us, ‘Nu?</span> <span id="s118">How do you like it here?’</span> <span id="s119">And I said, ‘I like it very much,’ in Yiddish, and they said to us, ‘Do you know how lucky you are?</span> <span id="s120">When we came here, we were boarders, or we had to take in boarders, and we didn’t have anything, and you came to this country and you live in a beautiful home,’- which their house, had no heat, I had to go down to eat in my cousin’s house downstairs and she had to cook for me, and she was tired of that.</span> <span id="s121">And he worked day and night...and they paid us $10 a week...and the people came, they said to us, ‘Why did you come to America?</span> <span id="s122">You’re two young people.</span> <span id="s123">You should go to Israel!’</span> <span id="s124">Every week I went through the same thing.</span> <span id="s125">Every week.</span> <span id="s126">So one time I said to somebody, ‘You know, if we would go to Israel, Morris and I, we would be a burden to the country.</span> <span id="s127">But we don’t understand that there are young people, young Jewish people in America, if they would come to Israel, it would be a great help to Israel to go!</span> <span id="s128">And someday maybe we’ll go.’</span> <span id="s129">So they told me, ‘Now’ they know ‘why we survived because I have a big mouth.’</span></p> <p><span id="s130">MK: Or, some of them ask us, ‘how many diamonds we brought with us.’</span></p> <p><span id="s131">WH: They had the impression that all the survivors were rich?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">RK: Yah...that we came with diamonds.</span> <span id="s133">You know what the impression was?</span> <span id="s134">That we survived because we did something...we took away, we were maybe working with the Germans, and that’s why we survived.</span> <span id="s135">That was the impressions.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">MK: I don’t know if all Jewish people think like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">RK: Not all, but this was impressions.</span> <span id="s138">Even now, I went to speak to a Temple.</span> <span id="s139">I seldom speak in Temples because Temples don’t invite survivors to come and speak.</span> <span id="s140">But lately people know about me and it became now that I’m asked to speak to everyone.</span> <span id="s141">So, this was two years ago, I go to speak to a Temple, and the lady that invited me to go heard about me.</span> <span id="s142">And I said, ‘ You know something?</span> <span id="s143">I don’t really like to speak in Temples to older people, this was an older group, Senior Citizens.</span> <span id="s144">Because I’ll upset them, and they’re going to find out such horrible things, I tell it just like it is.’</span> <span id="s145">And I said, ‘I’m afraid I’ll hurt them.</span> <span id="s146">What can you accomplish today by telling them exactly what happened.’</span> <span id="s147">And the lady begged me to come, and I said, ‘Okay.’</span> <span id="s148">So I go to Temple, and they had lunch first, and I go to the bathroom, and a lady, a Jewish lady follows me.</span> <span id="s149">Polish, must have been 65 maybe.</span> <span id="s150">She looked very well.</span> <span id="s151">A nice preserved woman.</span> <span id="s152">And she said to me, ‘Oh!</span> <span id="s153">I want to talk to you!’</span> <span id="s154">I said, ‘Yes, can I help you?’</span> <span id="s155">She said, ‘I wanted to ask you something.</span> <span id="s156">Do you think that the people are going to believe you?’</span> <span id="s157">I opened my eyes, and I said, ‘I don’t understand.’</span> <span id="s158">She said, ‘I don’t know if the people are going to believe you.’</span> <span id="s159">So, and I thought for a minute and I said to her, ‘Do you believe me?’</span> <span id="s160">She said, ‘I don’t know.’</span> <span id="s161">I said, ‘I’ll tell you what.</span> <span id="s162">If- Ina- will wait for me, let me speak first.’</span> <span id="s163">I didn’t want to get upset with her, because before I speak, you know it’s a very emotional thing to do, I said, ‘I’ll tell you what.</span> <span id="s164">When I get through speaking, you come over to me and tell me if you believe me.’</span> <span id="s165">But while I was speaking, there was so many people that couldn’t take it, they got up, they said they cannot take it, ‘I’m sorry,’ they cried and they walked out.</span> <span id="s166">But the majority stayed, and they came over, and they talked to me.</span> <span id="s167">But this lady, I watched the lady, got up and walked out.</span> <span id="s168">She was too embarrassed to come over and say something.</span> <span id="s169">And when she said to me, ‘I don’t know if I’m going to believe you,’ I said, ‘Why?’</span> <span id="s170">And she said, ‘When you ‘greenies’ came to America, you were different.</span> <span id="s171">We were different people than you.</span> <span id="s172">That’s why we didn’t take to you,’ she said.</span> <span id="s173">‘You were different.</span> <span id="s174">You come from a different background.’</span> <span id="s175">This was a Jewish lady saying these things to me.</span> <span id="s176">So, in the beginning, we had a tough time.</span> <span id="s177">People didn’t take to us...people didn’t associate with the ‘greeners.’</span> <span id="s178">The ‘greeners’ weren’t good enough.</span> <span id="s179">That’s how we felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">WH: Is that in part what led you to found this organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">MK: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">RK: The organization we found, because- we couldn’t mingle among the Americans because they didn’t want us.</span> <span id="s183">And, you need friends.</span> <span id="s184">You need people.</span> <span id="s185">So we found survivors.</span> <span id="s186">We used to get together, we didn’t have family, we used to make holidays together, we used to go to each other houses, and the kids used to play together, and we used to talk.</span> <span id="s187">Otherwise you could go crazy.</span> <span id="s188">We had no friends.</span> <span id="s189">We had nobody.</span> <span id="s190">So you listen for survivors...</span></p> <p><span id="s191">WH: Did it matter where they came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">RK: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">WH: ...when you started the organization...in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">RK: ...about 38 years ago...</span></p> <p><span id="s195">MK: ...we supported a soccer team...we played...not against Americans...against (survivors) there were a lot of nationalities.</span> <span id="s196">Greeks, Polish...we had $5,00 dues...</span></p> <p><span id="s197">WH: Did you have a meeting place?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">MK: We met in a temple, in a place, wherever we could meet, we rented or we got it for nothing.</span> <span id="s199">A dance we had...and we never made money...we met about 4 times a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">WH: How many people joined?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">RK: In the beginning, maybe 100.</span> <span id="s202">(She shows WH literature).</span></p> <p><span id="s203">MK: ...we have a Board of 15 people...and present day, we still charge $15 membership- because we don’t feel like making money, we don’t have a hole...we have got a little more involved political...if somebody came to speak, which is against us, we would demonstrate it as a group, and we influence some local politicians because we always said we had more people in our organization than there is, and we all grouped together in those days on that particular (inaudible) End of Tape #1, Side 1 Tape #1, Side 2</span></p> <p><span id="s204">WH: ...what was the name of the organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">MK: The American Jewish Holocaust Survivors of Greater Boston...in the beginning it was called the New American.</span> <span id="s206">And I took the new vote- when I became President...I thought it was time to take the word ‘New’ out after 35 years...</span></p> <p><span id="s207">WH: ...(Look through fundraising invitations...and their wedding invitation- in Germany...and pictures...and articles, ‘Kesselman’s Watch President Reagan’s visit to Bitburg in their Sharon home.)</span> <span id="s208">Benjamin Meed- are you in any way affiliated with his organization...American Gathering?</span> <span id="s209">...how are you affiliated?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">RK: He’s National Vice-President.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">MK: ...when I became President, Ben called me- and invited me down to New York, and...told me what they do, and what they’re trying to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">RK: Six years ago, I started to speak, here in Sharon, and a teacher told me that her dream is to go to Israel to learn the right way to teach the children Yad Vashem...and she told me two groups went already, and that’s her dream to do.</span> <span id="s213">And I decided when I came home that we should help her go, that this so important.</span> <span id="s214">I gathered 20 people, and we made a cocktail party in my son’s house and we raised the money for her to go to Israel and she went.</span> <span id="s215">But that year , we get a call from Ben Meed, and he said to Morris, he’s sending a group of people to Israel, and he needs support.</span> <span id="s216">So Morris says, ‘Wait a minute, my wife is sending somebody.’</span> <span id="s217">...we didn’t know...so we told him next year we’re going to help him.</span> <span id="s218">So then we became very close to him, and we helping with the teachers.</span> <span id="s219">So we’re picking the teachers from here, and we send him money and we send him teachers...</span></p> <p><span id="s220">MK: We’d rather not pick Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s221">RK: They are doing a fantastic job...they are marvelous!</span> <span id="s222">...(Shows more articles, pictures)...</span></p> <p><span id="s223">WH: Would you say that the survivors here in the Boston area, would you say that they are more involved than the average American Jew, with synagogues, and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">RK: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">WH: But I see that they are involved in your organization, are those that are involved with your organization, are they also involved with the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">MK: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">WH: How come?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">RK: They send the children through the synagogue-.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">MK: ...the majority in the cities are not involved and I don’t think they were even involved like they were Bar Mitzvahs...I don’t know what the reason is behind it.</span> <span id="s230">Because, you know, a lot of people didn’t believe when they came out from the camps, most of them didn’t believe, I didn’t believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">WH: Were you brought up in an observant family?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">MK: I was brought up in a very Orthodox family.</span> <span id="s233">Very Orthodox.</span> <span id="s234">Hassidish.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">WH: And you?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">RK: I was brought up in a –well, in my area, everybody went to the Temple, and everybody went to Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s237">And I was brought up- we weren’t rich people, but education was very important to us.</span> <span id="s238">I went to a private school.</span> <span id="s239">I went to yeshiva, Bais Yaacov.</span> <span id="s240">(His family was more religious than we were).</span></p> <p><span id="s241">WH: After the war, a lot of survivors said, even the ones that are Orthodox say that they find it very hard to really believe in anything after everything that happened because they can’t understand how this could happen to them</span></p> <p><span id="s242">MK: This was the case with me...after the war I really didn’t believe in anything.</span> <span id="s243">I went through Italy, and Germany, and finally I banged around until I got- and I didn’t follow it in Germany.</span> <span id="s244">I didn’t go to Temple.</span> <span id="s245">I didn’t fight it, but I didn’t believe in it.</span> <span id="s246">And it bothered me that the Orthodox movement came after the war, the first thing where they came to help us, and they brought a ton of it- with siddurim and we sort of laughed it off.</span> <span id="s247">They keep saying, that, ‘There must be something in it, because you survived!’</span> <span id="s248">I said, ‘What about the ones who didn’t?’</span> <span id="s249">They said, ‘They didn’t know, they didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s250">But you survived, and we gotta believe in G-d, and we got to carry on.’</span> <span id="s251">And until we married, and came to this country, and I remember an incident when my oldest son was 4 years old, he was too young to go into kindergarten, and we didn’t have enough money to send him to private kindergarten...what I’m saying to you is, I said to my wife, ‘What do we got to lose?’</span> <span id="s252">So we put him in the Yeshiva...and he came home to me Friday night and he said to me ‘Dad, you shouldn’t shut the switch off.’</span> <span id="s253">The lights, Friday night, my little one, four years old, when I switched the switch off...</span></p> <p><span id="s254">WH: Who told him?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">MK: The Yeshiva...in Boston...the he started, four years old...and I said to my wife, ‘Take him out!’</span> <span id="s256">...</span></p> <p><span id="s257">WH: So you took him out?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">MK: Eventually, the next year, yeh.</span> <span id="s259">But the following thing is, it came the High Holidays, my wife says to me, ‘You going to Temple?’</span> <span id="s260">I says, ‘No’ She says, ‘Do you mind if I go?’</span> <span id="s261">I said, ‘Of course, go ahead!’</span> <span id="s262">So she went and I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s263">But you know, the kids- I had three sons, and I had to come down to earth.</span> <span id="s264">I mean, I had to give them an education...and we belonged to the Temple.</span> <span id="s265">But when we came to this town, we got very, very much involved...in Temple Israel...a Conservative...</span></p> <p><span id="s266">WH: You wouldn’t belong to a Reform Temple?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">MK: No, I don’t believe in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">WH: ...how about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">RK: ...I always believed in G-d.</span> <span id="s270">Even in camp.</span> <span id="s271">And when I came out, I started to go to shul right away, I- we joined the Temple.</span> <span id="s272">He didn’t want to go, so sometimes I left him with the babies and I went when they were little and then later he started to go with me.</span> <span id="s273">But it took him a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">MK: Very much.</span> <span id="s275">A long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">WH: But what about the question of all the people who died, how do you feel about that?</span> <span id="s277">How do you deal with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">RK: How do I feel about that?</span> <span id="s279">It’s a very tough thing to deal with.</span> <span id="s280">You live with that.</span> <span id="s281">You know, you don’t wake up in the morning and you think about it all the time...</span></p> <p><span id="s282">WH: ...you’re a member of the Council...I was in Washington two weeks ago, and I passed by the empty place, you know, where the foundation is.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">MK: I’m kind of disappointed a little bit...took much longer than it started, than it’s suppose to.</span> <span id="s284">A lot of money is spent, and we got already a hole in the ground...I was the original start of this thing.</span> <span id="s285">And that’s what I’m saying, I’m kind of disappointed because a lot of money- was spent because of the ways, and so on...the fact is, that we had the first dinner in the State House in Boston (inaudible) a very big fund raiser, we raised over a million and a half dollars.</span> <span id="s286">We had 22 pledges of $50,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">WH: Did you also go to that bond dinner in Miami honoring Ben Meed?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">MK: Yes.</span> <span id="s289">This is the reason why they got awarded the plaque.</span> <span id="s290">See the plaque?</span> <span id="s291">This plaque was given to us.</span> <span id="s292">What happened, we organized bond drives for the United States.</span> <span id="s293">We had a bond drive in the South.</span> <span id="s294">I have a picture here with him...I was one of the honorees on that dinner too.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">WH: When you were working, after you came back from the farm, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">MK: I never had a profession, so I went to the HIAS...they asked me what profession I had, I said, ‘I have no profession.’</span> <span id="s297">They asked me, ‘What profession was your father?’</span> <span id="s298">I said, ‘He was in textile.’</span> <span id="s299">So they send me to a factory where they were making textiles in Chelsea.</span> <span id="s300">And I went and got a job for forty cents an hour.</span> <span id="s301">When I left that factory, I was Superintendent, nine years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">WH: How did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">MK: Hard work.</span> <span id="s304">Smart.</span> <span id="s305">I wasn’t afraid.</span> <span id="s306">Hours didn’t mean nothing.</span> <span id="s307">But I became a Supervisor after 9 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">WH: Are you a person who takes risks, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">MK: Not risk, but I’m not afraid of doing anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">WH: Do you think you got that as a result in part of your experience?</span> <span id="s311">Or do you think that you had that before you came into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">MK: Always in the camp, I always said, ‘I’m going to survive!’</span> <span id="s313">Never give up my-.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">WH: How come you never gave up?</span> <span id="s315">You had brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">MK: I had a brother and a sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">WH: Did they make it?</span> <span id="s318">Did your parents make it?</span> <span id="s319">–Did you know already during the war that they weren’t going to make it?</span> <span id="s320">Did you hear about what-.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">MK: I know my mother died in the ghetto...</span></p> <p><span id="s322">WH: Did you think in terms of surviving in order to- when you were thinking of surviving, did you think that after the war, ‘I’m going to get together with my family,’ did you hope that they were still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">MK: No.</span> <span id="s324">I knew my family was-.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">WH: So, what made you, what gave you the ambition to-.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">MK: I never gave up life!</span> <span id="s327">I said, ‘How long can it go on?’</span> <span id="s328">I’m saying to you, I always said to me,- I said to myself- that if I ever gonna die, I’m going to die in a place of work, never in camp.’</span></p> <p><span id="s329">WH: What do you mean you’re gonna die in a place of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">MK: Because when you stayed back in camp, and didn’t go to work, you gave up life, and the next day they probably took away your coat, or your shirt, and you became a mess.</span> <span id="s331">Did I know that I’m gonna survive?</span> <span id="s332">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s333">Didn’t know from one day to the next.</span> <span id="s334">But I never gave up.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">WH: Can you figure out where that strength comes from?</span> <span id="s336">...when you were a kid, for example...were you the tough guy in the class?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">MK: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">RK: I want to tell where my strength came from.</span> <span id="s339">When I was in the ghetto, I was at the time 14 years old.</span> <span id="s340">And when they give out the rations, a piece of bread, and a little soup, and I saw that my mother used to take a piece of bread, break it into four, we were four children.</span> <span id="s341">And give a little extra to every child.</span> <span id="s342">And I saw its going on for days, and I didn’t know where the bread comes from.</span> <span id="s343">And one day I was watching her.</span> <span id="s344">She didn’t see, but she turned around and she broke the bread, and she gave us the bread.</span> <span id="s345">And I started, ‘Mommy’ And she- shows me quiet.</span> <span id="s346">She took me outside.</span> <span id="s347">And she started to cry, and she said to me, ‘Rita, please don’t say anything.</span> <span id="s348">Rita-la, please don’t!’</span> <span id="s349">She says, ‘Please don’t say anything, you’re so young,’ at the time she was 39 years old, ‘you’re so young, maybe one of you will survive.</span> <span id="s350">You’ll be able to tell maybe the world what’s happening to us.’</span> <span id="s351">And all through the time in camp, when I was seeing people dying all over around me.</span> <span id="s352">Dead bodies wherever we went.</span> <span id="s353">And I was thinking, I’ll be probably next.</span> <span id="s354">And maybe I’ll survive and carry on my mother’s dream, that wish, and that was- I always thought about it.</span> <span id="s355">And now when I go to the schools and I talk, one girl wants to know, in a Catholic High School...’Do I believe in G-d?’</span> <span id="s356">And I said, ‘Yes, I do’.</span> <span id="s357">And she said, ‘If I would be you, I wouldn’t want to live.</span> <span id="s358">If all my family was killed in the Holocaust, I wouldn’t want to be around.</span> <span id="s359">All my friends, all my family.’</span> <span id="s360">And I said to her, ‘G-d works in mysterious ways.</span> <span id="s361">When the plane was flying above the camps, American planes, and were praying to G-d that they should put atom bombs, and destroy the crematoriums, and us, and put us out of our misery.</span> <span id="s362">And it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s363">But if it would happen, nobody would be here to tell the story.</span> <span id="s364">So, when I think of my mother’s dream, and here I go to schools now, I reach thousands of young people, teachers, educators, and I feel that I’m glad I survived.’</span></p> <p><span id="s365">WH: You’re glad you survived because of a sense of- that you have a message to give them.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">RK: That’s one thing, and the second thing is, when we get together on the holidays, (inaudible) my family is now important people.</span> <span id="s367">I was the only survivor.</span> <span id="s368">And now I have a beautiful family, with sons, (inaudible) six grandchildren, and Hitler didn’t live to kill us all.</span> <span id="s369">We survived in spite.</span> <span id="s370">And I feel like from a little seedling, a tree is growing, and branches are going to grow.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">MK: It is a victory.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">RK: It’s a victory, - that’s right.</span> <span id="s373">So I’m glad I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">MK: But you know, in camp, we didn’t know if we’re going to live, but we always hoped that maybe one of us would get out to tell the world what’s going on- but we always hoped.</span> <span id="s375">Maybe one of us will get out and tell the world, like they don’t even know nothing, and they knew all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">WH: Do you think that it could happen here?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">RK: It could happen again...(inaudible).</span> <span id="s378">I don’t think it will happen, because...(inaudible) so many schools now, are being taught about the Holocaust...I have here thousands of letters---teachers in some schools (unable to translate) write individual letters to speaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">WH: You, personally, got thousands of letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">MK: Oh, from schools!</span></p> <p><span id="s381">WH: Thousands.</span> <span id="s382">How many times have you spoken?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">RK: I speak sometimes 2, 3 times a week, all through the school year.</span> <span id="s384">(inaudible) I spoke in every college in Boston.</span> <span id="s385">At Harvard, in Brandeis...</span></p> <p><span id="s386">WH: When you go, what is the main message that you want to leave them with?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">RK: - not to be prejudiced.</span> <span id="s388">And not to hate.</span> <span id="s389">Because I show them what hatred can accomplish.</span> <span id="s390">And not to follow.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">WH: Who are you talking to?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">RK: High Schools, colleges, inter-faith groups, people.</span> <span id="s393">I start with 8th grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">WH: What got you started on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">RK: I was called 6 years ago.</span> <span id="s396">I teacher called from Sharon Junior High.</span> <span id="s397">And she said she’s teaching the Holocaust---and she’s looking for a survivor...would I be willing to come and speak...and I said, ‘My dream was to tell my story.</span> <span id="s398">But when I came to this country, and I wanted to tell my story, nobody wanted to listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">MK: Jews didn’t want to listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">RK: People used to tell me, ‘It’s enough already!’</span> <span id="s401">Jewish people.</span> <span id="s402">I couldn’t speak English that time.</span> <span id="s403">‘It’s enough already, you’re here, forget about it!’</span> <span id="s404">...(inaudible) so I told her , ‘I never spoke to a group, but I would like to try.’</span> <span id="s405">And I came, and I spoke, and she was crying, the whole class was crying.</span> <span id="s406">All the children.</span> <span id="s407">And she came over, after I was done.</span> <span id="s408">And she put her arms around me.</span> <span id="s409">And she says, ‘I don’t ever call anybody else again.</span> <span id="s410">I had other people from different camps, but I never heard the story like I heard from you.’</span> <span id="s411">And since then, she’s using me.</span> <span id="s412">She gave my name.</span> <span id="s413">Everybody- you know she gives my name to people...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">WH: ...you were a Superintendent by the time you left that business...and what happened after that?</span> <span id="s415">You start your own business?</span> <span id="s416">What kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">MK: Textiles...manufacturers of elastic, and non-elastic metal fabric webbing.</span> <span id="s418">Underwear for brassieres and girdles...</span></p> <p><span id="s419">RK: (Shows letters from children ages 14, 15 to WH).</span></p> <p><span id="s420">WH: ‘Dear Mrs. Kesselman, (this is dated 1/20/88) I would like to sincerely thank you for sharing your tragic story with us’...’If only more people would share their stories like you, we could prevent another Holocaust from happening.</span> <span id="s421">If we are the future, we better learn from mistakes in the past.</span> <span id="s422">Children today don’t realize how lucky we are to live in a free country.</span> <span id="s423">We don’t realize that another Hitler could come along and start this all over again.</span> <span id="s424">It’s hard to imagine, that as only a child you were put to work inside the camps, to drag a dead body into a pit would be like a living a nightmare for any child.</span> <span id="s425">A loss of parents at the age of 14 must have been terrible.</span> <span id="s426">Losing your brothers and friends too.</span> <span id="s427">It would be unbearable.</span> <span id="s428">It’s hard to believe, but it obviously happened.</span> <span id="s429">I hope one day that people will come to realize that hate is wrong.</span> <span id="s430">All the innocent Jews being killed for no reason, makes no sense.</span> <span id="s431">The Holocaust is fading away into history now, and if we don’t learn from it, it will be another fear in the future.</span> <span id="s432">Thank you again for your story.</span> <span id="s433">I know now what it was really like to go through the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s434">Most Sincerely, Noreen Flannery’- not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">RK: ...some write to me that they are suicidal and since they listen to my story, they’ll never complain again...some write to me, ‘You are my hero.’</span></p> <p><span id="s436">MK: We hope someday to donate the letters to the Washington Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">WH: ...in your business...you have an office in New York also...I would imagine you have sales in the millions of dollars...</span></p> <p><span id="s438">MK: Yah.</span> <span id="s439">In the millions.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">WH: ...many of the survivors that I talk to have real estate.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">MK: And in Boston the same case.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">WH: Is it the same with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">MK: Not on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">WH: How come you don’t?</span></p> <p><span

friend who was a licensed plumber.</span> <span id="s449">And he came to me and he said, ‘Look Morris, if you come with me we’ll buy a building and I’ll do all the work.</span> <span id="s450">But I just want you with me.</span> <span id="s451">And I went out and bought a building.</span> <span id="s452">18 apartments.</span> <span id="s453">In Brighton, in Boston.</span> <span id="s454">I came

we lived in Winthrop, you gonna go to Pawtucket and if something breaks, you gonna run at night to fix it?</span> <span id="s457">...’ and we backed out.</span> <span id="s458">Not that I’m sorry, but if I wouldn’t be in a business, I would have wanted to go into real estate.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">End of Tape #1, Side 2 Tape #2, Side 1</span></p> <p><span id="s460">WH: ...there are certain survivors who didn’t do too well...</span></p> <p><span id="s461">MK: Well, in Boston, if you ask people to go into business enterprise, very few went into a business enterprise...most became tailors, cleaning stores, it depends on location.</span> <span id="s462">I think in New York, Detroit, Chicago, a lot of big cities, a lot of survivors went into big business.</span> <span id="s463">I don’t think that the opportunity was in Boston.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">WH: Do you see anything in common with those survivors who did something in America, who did very well, whom you’ll meet from other communities?</span> <span id="s465">Was there some personality trait that they had in common, or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">MK: No.</span> <span id="s467">Not in a personality trait...an organization or a common cause brings us together...</span></p> <p><span id="s468">WH: But for you to come here with $5,00 in your pocket, to wind up having a company of this size, by now, that doesn’t happen by accident.</span> <span id="s469">It’s not luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">MK: No, no.</span> <span id="s471">I worked day and night.</span> <span id="s472">I had to prove myself.</span> <span id="s473">I proved myself.</span> <span id="s474">When I came here, the Korean War broke out, I would have been drafted.</span> <span id="s475">But I worked for a company that had government orders.</span> <span id="s476">We made straps for parachuting, for tanks and all that...and I was the only Jewish guy among 400 non-Jewish in that company, in the factory.</span> <span id="s477">The management was Jewish.</span> <span id="s478">And when I was given machines, I couldn’t speak any English, I didn’t have any friends, so when I came to work, I stood the 8 hours and worked.</span> <span id="s479">And it was piece work.</span> <span id="s480">And I was hungry, I wanted the money...and they timed me, and they timed the others, and everybody came over and congratulate me.</span> <span id="s481">And I’m the highest piece worker in the mill.</span> <span id="s482">I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s483">I worked!</span> <span id="s484">I don’t think

since he did not include his last name or address.</span> <span id="s829">It looks like his name is Scott Rose.</span> <span id="s830">I hope you will be able to assist me in this matter.</span> <span id="s831">Once again, thank you for your warm words of introduction.</span> <span id="s832">I feel very comfortable speaking in your school.</span> <span id="s833">I always have such an interested

sad story.</span> <span id="s847">I am Jewish, and I am glad that I didn’t live in those tragic times.</span> <span id="s848">I still can’t believe how Hitler could have done those bad acts.</span> <span id="s849">There were’- and if Jewish students can’t believe!</span> <span id="s850">There were- things such as, eating your frozen urine, that you wouldn’t do in normal life, but you did to live.</span> <span id="s851">It would seem hard to tell your story, but you did it quite well.</span> <span id="s852">I think telling us about the tragic things that happened back then, will make us more aware not to hurt other people, no matter how different we are.’</span></p> <p><span id="s853">RK: All the letters tell me that they learn from me more than they watch movies.</span></p> <p><span
