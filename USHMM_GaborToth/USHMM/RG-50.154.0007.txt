Anya Brodman, June 8, 1988
Q: Today is Wednesday, June 8, 1988 and I am at the home of Mrs. Anya Brodman, in Sarasota, Florida. Mrs. Brodman has kindly consented to share with us her memories and experiences during the Holocaust years. I want to thank you, Mrs. Brodman, for being willing to do this. I know that this is an emotional strain on you. Uh. Before we get into the Holocaust years, I think it would be helpful if you would talk a bit about your early years- your childhood – how many brothers and sisters you had . . . what your parents did for a living . . .where you were born and raised . . .
A: Yes. I was six months old when my parents brought me from Russia, Poltava, Ukraina. You know, where the Swedish war was, and then my father, from the beginning I don’t know what he was doing, but later on, he had a factory, and my mother was a mother . . .
Q: Your father had a factory? What kind of factory? What did you make in his factory?
A: Stockings. Stocking. What else? And, then, when I grew up, I attended the gymnasium.
Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?
A: Oh yes. I had a sister Yetta, which was very begofted . . means. . . how do you call it . . very talented in music, and she was very good and she was playing and everything and my father was very happy. Then, my mother took sick all of a sudden, I was about 17, finished gymnasium, and the doctor was very liberal – Dr. Aberzersky . . .very liberal man . . .very liberal . . and I was reading . . my later father ordered for me the “Medicinisher Velt” which was a magazine about medicine, because I always wanted to be professional. And, so I was reading the “Medicinisher Velt” and he came over to me. “What are you doing with the? Playing with sicknesses?” I said, “Oh, that’s my hopes that some day . . but how could I, I am Jewish.” He wasn’t. “I am Jewish and I am a woman” “And was numerous classes . . can’t get it” “You just tell me everything you told me, and go to the Dean,” I said, “How will I go to the Dean.” He said, “Just go to the Dean. Go in the morning.”
Q: What year was this, do you remember?
A: No, I don’t. No chronology.
Q: What year were you born?
A: I was born in 1918.
Q: And, what year . . how old were you when this event occurred?
A: This was . . I was 18 years old. I had just finished gymnasium.
Q: This was 1926 then.
A: Probably, probably.
Q: You were still living in Vilna?
A: No. Yes. In Vilna, of course, in Vilna. So, when I . . so I decided to listen to him. I like to listen, especially to such friends of the Jews. A very nice person. I went, and the butler didn’t want to let me in. I said, “But, I will not go away. Then I’ll wait until the Dean will go out, and I will go after him. I don’t feel that this is proper.” He heard what I was talking about. . .
Q: This was the Dean of the Medical School?
A: Yes, University of Medicine. Stephan the Terrible. Stephan the Terrible was once King, Polish King, and he said, “Let this young lady in.” and, I told him the same what I told Dr. Aberzersky. When I finished, I said, “Can I have hopes?” And he said, in Polish, “Nuzuny dashenza?” “the people alive should never lose hope.” And, I went out.
Q: That’s a good piece of advice.
R: Yah. Yah. When I went out and not long, my father, my late father heard that I am admitted to Medicine.
Q: Let me go back a little bit, please. Uh. When you were growing up, were your parents religious people? Did they practice Judaism in your home?
A: No. I . . . My father . . My later father . . My mother’s father . . .I mean . . home was very religious.
Q: Your mother kept kosher?
A: No, no. My father’s in Ukraine, in Russia.
Q: So, your father’s family was religious.
A: My mother’s . . . yah. My father’s family came from a rabbi. A rabbi for father . . but he wasn’t. he loved Jewish music. I know . . . he knew very well the Jewish history, everything fine, but I . . .I had something different form my grandfather, because I said, “Oh, Father, today is Friday. Make. . and he had a very nice voice . . “So, you know . . traditional. .
Q: Did you go to religious school when you were growing up?
A: No. No. But, I had a good teacher who didn’t know one word of Russian, and I spoke only Russian, you know, when I was very young, about 8,9. He used to live in my father’s home so we Have been all laughing from him,
Q: You had been what?
A: Laughing. Me and my sister. Because, he didn’t know how to pronounce one word in Russian, and we didn’t know another one.
Q: What kind of a public school did you go to?
A: I didn’t go to a public school. Gymnasium is not a public school. Gymnasium is a school – when you finish gymnasium, it is like here, college. Not the complete college, but I remember when my daughter used to study, for being in college, she knew . . everything what I learned in gymnasium. So, I don’t know how to tell you what it is.
Q: So, it was like a private school?
A: Yes, private school. Yes, private school.
Q: And you graduated with the equivalent of a high school degree from there?
A: Yes, that’s right. All the way through college. Not medicine. Medicine was very bad. Very hard.
Q: Growing up, did you experience much anti-Semitism?
A: You see, it was a lot. It was a lot of anti-Semitism because we had beautiful girls . . .beautiful girls . . and it was a certain party . . not a party . . I don’t know how you call this . . .organization . . from the anti-Semites, call the Endec, and they used to have on their hands something, and went out when the students used to go to school - - grabbed the faces . . beautiful faces . . really the most beautiful, beautiful girls.
Q: They would, like, scar their faces for life?
A: That’s right. No, I don’t know it was . . not for life . . but I don’t know what they did. The parents . . their parents . . took them away from this school. My father used to be always on the phone, “Don’t go out. You know what goes on . . Tell Yettaska she should not got out also.” You see, he always protected us. Because we knew it was a lot of anti-Semitism, and always from the students.
Q: So, what’s was your father’s reaction when you got admitted to Medical School?
R: Oh, you know know. The telephone didn’t stop. This was a miracle. My father – he was very proud . . was very proud. And, I don’t trust one Christian person. I don’t. I had a best friend, she was beautiful. She just was built like a statue, beautiful and she denied the love of the parents and married on of the Endec. When the Germans came to run by, you know, so he brought her after a couple of weeks . . he brought her to “Toor Vach.” This was . . . how you call it . . from the Ghetto. Toor Vach is like the door to the Ghetto. We have to separate that . . that ghetto . . and I don’t know what he said, but she was shot on his eyes. And, Like this. Nobody had been in the windows to look what goes on here. And so . . killed her. And her father was so striked with grief, and not talk about it.
Q: Griefstricken.
A: Griefstricken, you know. He . . before it happened to him . . before it happened to him . . do you know something from the Jewish religion . . when somebody dies. . . it calls – to cut “cria”? he cut his clothing, you know that. It is . . Anyway, but when she was shot, he got a heart attack, right after this, and . . and he was not alive. Her name was Zablubofska. Beautiful girl. Beautiful girl. Intelligent, you know. When she studies, sometimes, I used to go also. I wanted to tell her . . study, study, study. When I was in medicine school but, I used to go when it was law . . lessons of law, yah. I loved it, how she spoke, and she . . .
Q: So, how many years of medical school?
A: Three and a half years.
Q: What happened then to interrupt it?
A: What do you mean? We didn’t have to . . Well, the war – we didn’t have the right to . . . it was the war.
Q: I want you to explain . . some people are listening to the tape. . .
A: You have no Jewish people . . .Even they had the star, the yellow star, the right to go, like people are going all around . . in the middle . . but to go to school – to attend te school – there was no question about it . . .

I couldn’t listen any more, but I remember everything what she said. But she mixes stuff up.) let me tell you, this Mr. Edmund, what I told you brought me, and he said the first man in my story, he stole from the hauptmann for whom he was working, a pair of glasses, I should mask myself. He put a puchle, something like this, I should be a hunchback and he did whatever he could for me, and I think that he was not alive today. (male voice: anyway, he came to the hotel, what’s his name?) Edmund? (male voice: no the judge.) oh, then we are going back?

A: No. not right away. (male voice: not the first time . . he come once for nothing) it was said that if somebody will escape then then, this who knew us. . .this will be killed. And, I said, I will never do this to Edmund. And, I did not go. You see, he went back the first time. He came twice.
Q: He went back to the camp?
A: (male voice: no, he went back to Vilna when he came once. ) and I said that I am not going. He said to me, “What do you think? Maybe his hands are full of blood of your parents and sister and brother, and you, what is the matter with you? (male voice: she was afraid he will be killed. ) I was afraid, and I never prayed for good or bad.
Q: That’s a nice expression. I like that.
A: (Male voice: after a few months later, he came again because they were supposed to shave the hair). I’ll tell you how it was. They put on all the Jewish girls, your beautiful girls. . .
Q: This was in the camp?
A: In the camp. You see, with long hair, all kinds of hair, and undressed. And everybody who was, I don’t know what, a super, he put on a white coat and pretend to be doctors. One bulled the breasts from another. The one scooped the hair from . . Oh, my God, my God, what we went through.
Q: Very humiliating.
A: Anyway, we had been worse than cattle. It was a sign in Vilna for killing a Jew and a dog – no punishment.
Q: There was no punishment for killing a Jew or a dog.
A: Or a dog or a Jew, the same – no punishment. It would be a good thing. What else? Today I have (male voice: let me help you.) Help me.

We’ll make all, in all the cities, but give me your hand, and you will walk with me.”
Q: To do what?
A: To let know, to let the whole world know what they did to us.

Anyway, to make a long story short, finally, with troubles and troubles, she started screaming to them, “This is my child, and how dare you . . “ And she spoke to the child all kinds of words, but she didn’t realize. She didn’t answer nothing.
Q: How old was she?
R: A year maybe, already. About a year. So, they went, and they said they are coming back. If I would listen to him, if I wouldn’t use my own judgment. I should jump to him, I wouldn’t be here. Because I don’t. anyway, to make a long story short, they went away, and right away he went down and bought a paper. And, in the paper was announcement, to the Germans, they need a putz frau who cleans, and this and this and this. And, I went, and I told them . . (male voice: so you went to Riga.) Riga, that’s right.
Q: So you took a job as a housekeeper.
A: Not keeper. To clean the floors, to clean the dust out. A putzfrau, cleaning. Anyway, then, what did I want to say . . then I came and I went right away to this . . Each German had a Geliebte.

A: Yes, there was plenty of little rooms and everything (Male voice: Later you rented) Later on I knew that one Russian woman, and I speak very well Russian – I know Russian, anyway. That she would gladly take me to help me. I said, “I’ll give you money when I’ll get it, but I haven’t got it now.” Come on, And I was . . when I used to finish the job, I was happy to be in a different atmosphere. You know, for a long time, knowing very well German, I couldn’t hear one word German. I, right away, saw pictures of this bitter man with the black, with the black (male voice: finish with one). Huh?

Q: it must have been a little easier to do that then to be cleaning.
A: Yes. It was later, but I almost paid with my life for that. And, I was working there and I got . . I was very undernourished and some of the Germans gave me cod liver oil to drink and something soups and something to eat, and whatever he could – he . . one or another who cooked, used to bring . . and I started blooming. You know. With the food. So the Oberschutz, doctor said he wants to go out with me. And this started my troubles. I finished very bad and was arrested to the Gestapo, you know. I was. . I feel . .

I was afraid that this is the end of my life. Anyway, but what can I do? But, I didn’t . . but they gave me a little cell. In the morning, I’ll go to the district attorney. So,
Q: Did they tell you why they took you away?
A: No. they took me away . . that’s the end.
Q: They didn’t have to tell you?
A: No, they didn’t have to tell me. All night I was knocking on the door, knocking in the door from the cell, but nobody came there. Five o’clock came. “wait another hour and you’ll go to the District Attorney.” So, came the hour and they brought me to the District Attorney. I decided not to answer him what he is asking me. I said, “Ich nicht Deutsch” that’s not an expression in German, “Ich nicht Deutch” I said, “Ich nicht Deutch” I have to describe you the room. The room was very big, very long. In each corner sat one District Attorney. One dog. In all corners, four. On one wall was a big board, you know, on what you could write, and it was a big . . how you call it ( male voice: whip) a big whip, full still with blood, from the people who had been beaten. And I said to him . . he asked me, “you are a student? And this, and that, and this . . “ and anyway, I said, “Ich nicht Deutch” everything was noticed by one man who sat, I was here, he was up there, and he came over. “Was is loes?” What happened? He said, “Which language do you speak? I said, “Polish” and he was a Pole. I said, “Polish. I attended Polish University and I speak Polish.” So, he came and he said, and I talked to him – mind district attorney doesn’t understand a word. But I said, “this is a private affair” (male voice: private dispute) not dispute: no. Privately I paid for this, because I didn’t want to go out with him. I said, “I have a husband, and I don’t want to go nowhere and I don’t know where my baby, and I don’t know nothing. I have no desire. He asked me several times until he sent me this Gestapo to pick me up. Anyway, you know he . .
Q: So picking you up was like a punishment for not going out with him?
A: No, to arrest me. Let me tell you. So, I told . . I was in Gestapo and I am already in this room what I describe you. A long room with four in each corner, one of the attorneys . . not attorneys . . Gestapo men. The persecutors, yes . . the persecutors. And the board with the big words, and a little whip full of blood, and I found out that just one girl had been taken away what she confessed, and she is all ready for being killed. No, I am very cheerful, but I don’t know from where, I was screaming, “I don’t speak German. I don’t know German. I never learned. I never know.” And this man from the corner listened. He didn’t listen, paid attention to his victim, because he had also a victim. Everybody had victim. He listened to his victim. He came over to us, and he said, “Was it loes? What happened?” I said, this is personal. A personal affair. It is personal. He said, you know, now is lunch time. You could imagine how many hours I was there. Lunch time. It was eleven. And, he said, you go, I give you a guard. Take you to the cellar, and after lunch you will come back. When I was in the cellar – I didn’t sleep the whole night – and I closed my eyes and I see we had in Poland a famous rabbi, a famous rabbi, Rubenstein. He is supposed to be . . his children were Rabbi Rubinstein, and I dreamt that he told me, “Don’t worry, my child, don’t worry, my child, you and your child will got to America.
