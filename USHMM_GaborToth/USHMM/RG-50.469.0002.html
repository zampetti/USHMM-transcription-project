<span id="s126">So in my class, even there was a few, we were only three, four kids in class.</span> <span id="s127">But at same age you see.</span> <span id="s128">That was possible.</span> <span

said...</span></p> <p><span id="s142">But to continue, after the 13th of March 1938 my, we looked out the window by the day of the „Einmarsch“ and we lived in a section of Leoben were there were most of the Jewish stores and a lot of Jewish residences in the same street.</span> <span id="s143">We lived across the street of our store and we were told.</span> <span id="s144">.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: And this was with street?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: „Kaerntnerstrasse“.</span> <span id="s147">Our store was Kaerntnerstrasse 15, we lived across the street and we were told that when the Jewish when the Germans march in, in order for them to know which are Jewish windows, the gentiles who lived there, they should put a candle on the window, a lit candle but the Jews are not allowed to put a lit candle.</span> <span id="s148">This way the knew exactly where the Jews lived, because there was no candle.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: The city, the town, the „Buergermeister“.</span> <span id="s150">Of course.</span> <span id="s151">Who else.</span> <span id="s152">They turned immediately.</span> <span id="s153">They were friends one day, the next day they were Nazis, you know they showed their Antisemitism, that was brewing in them, now they had a chance to come out with it and to please the new regime.</span> <span id="s154">Next door to our store was a „Konditorei“, candy store and I was a very good customer there, I love sweets, and one of the salesgirls were one of my classmates in school and they day after Hitler.</span> <span id="s155">You know I didn’t realize how bad things are, I went in and I wanted to buy myself some ice-cream or whatever.</span> <span id="s156">So she said to me: „Sorry we do not sell to Jews.</span> <span id="s157">“ I said: „Wilma“, I said „how could that be.</span> <span id="s158">You know me.</span> <span id="s159">Yesterday you sold me something and we went to school 8 years together“.</span> <span id="s160">She said.</span> <span id="s161">„I am sorry, I can not sell you.</span> <span id="s162">No Jews allowed in here.</span> <span id="s163">“ So this was the first blow on my head.</span> <span id="s164">When I came home, I said: „What’s going on ?</span> <span id="s165">I can not understand.</span> <span id="s166">“ So this was the beginning.</span> <span id="s167">Anyway.</span> <span id="s168">Two days after Hitler invaded Austria, my father went down, he opened the store and all of a sudden two SA-man came and the stud in front of my fathers door, on the entrance, one on each side.</span> <span id="s169">And they wouldn’t let any customers in.</span> <span id="s170">If a customer wanted to come in they said: „You can not go in there.</span> <span id="s171">This is a Jewish store.</span> <span id="s172">Do not buy from the Jew.</span> <span id="s173">And they went away.</span> <span id="s174">So my mother, when she came downstairs from our house with a shopping bag to go shopping.</span> <span id="s175">She wanted to walk into our store, so they said: „Don’t go in there this a Jewish store.</span> <span id="s176">You can not buy there.</span> <span id="s177">So my mother said: „I am sorry to say, but I am the owner of that store.</span> <span id="s178">“ So one guy said: „Shut up, you dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s179">“ So, when you, what’s gonna be.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Where this SA-man from Leoben...</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: SA-man in uniform, Leoben, ja Leobner boys absolutely.</span> <span id="s182">There was an illegal.</span> <span id="s183">You know there were a plenty of illegal Nazis for a long time.</span> <span id="s184">They didn’t walk around in uniform, bur we all knew.</span> <span id="s185">we sort of had a feeling which, one for a long time was an illegal Nazi.</span> <span id="s186">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Where there Nazi riots before the Anschluss in Leoben?</span> <span id="s188">1936, 1937</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: There was a putsch in Vienna.</span> <span id="s190">I think it was in 1934.</span> <span id="s191">I think it was, when Dollfuss was assassinated and at that day there was a rumor going around, that they will do something to the Jews in Leoben.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: That early.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Personally you mean?</span> <span id="s196">Not by name, but we knew more or less.</span> <span id="s197">a lot of them were students from the university.</span> <span id="s198">a lot of them and from „Gymnasium“.</span> <span id="s199">Gymnasiasten they were Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: And from the „Burschenschaften“</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Yes from the „Burschenschaften“.</span> <span id="s202">Yes.</span> <span id="s203">And to go on with my story.</span> <span id="s204">After the, you know, after few days, they said.</span> <span id="s205">Two SS-man come to my fathers store and they said: „Herr Gewing your store has to be „arisiert.</span> <span id="s206">“ And if you know somebody, who wants to take over your store, as long as he is an Aryan.</span> <span id="s207">And if not we will bring you somebody to take over.</span> <span id="s208">“ So my father, who did not know what to do, so there was another Jewish store who had an employee, who worked there for many years, we knew him and he knew my father and he came to our store.</span> <span id="s209">And he said to my father: „Herr Gewing, I want to be your „Arisierer“.</span> <span id="s210">I want to arisier your store.</span> <span id="s211">I will be good to you don’t worry.</span> <span id="s212">I will make an Aryan store and I will pay you monthly so and so much for the merchandise and whatever is coming to.</span> <span id="s213">I will not steel your store from you.</span> <span id="s214">“ So my father, my parents were very happy that this wonderful young man, you know spoke to him like this and the other Jewish people were envious.</span> <span id="s215">„Oh, Herr Gewing has such luck.</span> <span id="s216">“ I think his name was Herr Strauss.</span> <span id="s217">„He is going to take over and he will pay him“.</span> <span id="s218">He didn’t pay once.</span> <span id="s219">My father turned over the keys to him and the store.</span> <span id="s220">And he said next month I am going to send you a check.</span> <span id="s221">Not once.</span> <span id="s222">And there was nobody to complaint to.</span> <span id="s223">Who we are going to complain to?</span> <span id="s224">You understand?</span> <span id="s225">He saw his opportunity to steel, to take over Herr Gewings store for free.</span> <span id="s226">So we stayed in Leoben.</span> <span id="s227">Then of course, we had to get out so my parents make arrangements to move to Vienna.</span> <span id="s228">And we gave away a lot of our things from the apartment, you know.</span> <span id="s229">Who ever bought something, hardly paid ever anything, you know.</span> <span id="s230">And we just went without, I think my mother bought some dishes and linens and silverware and we moved to Vienna at the end of August 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes, that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s232">There were some, that were very sympathetic.</span> <span id="s233">Some of the older ones.</span> <span id="s234">The said: „Herr Gewing don’t run away.</span> <span id="s235">Das kann sich nicht halten.</span> <span id="s236">That cannot be for a long time.</span> <span id="s237">Don’t run away we want you here, stay here.</span> <span id="s238">And then there were some like my girlfriend from school, that ignored us and insulted us and treated us with Antisemitic tortured in many ways, you understand.</span> <span id="s239">So there was a mixed feelings amongst them.</span> <span id="s240">I used to have a wonderful tutor.</span> <span id="s241">He was.</span> <span id="s242">I needed help in math and in English, I took of English.</span> <span id="s243">so my mother hired him, when I was maybe 14 years old to come to the house to teach me, to tutor me.</span> <span id="s244">So he was a wonderful, he was also a student on university and he studied in England for a while, very educated young man.</span> <span id="s245">And he was very kind and very Gentleman in every way.</span> <span id="s246">A few days after Hitler marched in, I saw him in a SS-uniform, in the black uniform of an SS-man, but he greeted me: „Heil Hitler, Fraeulein“ You know, just the same, but he was an SS-man all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s247">So don’t you think he was illegal, when he was already in the SS a few days after, he probably belonged to them God knows how long.</span> <span id="s248">He didn’t show his anti-Semitism, and he accepted this job, he probably needed a few „Schillings“ too.</span> <span id="s249">But there were mixed, you know mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Sorry, I have to change....</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Side B:</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: How was the reaction of your Jewish friends, of other Jewish families of what happened after the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s253">Was it immediately clear...</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: When did that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: 1938.</span> <span id="s256">1939, beginning of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: No this particular boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Oh that boat that was returned?</span> <span id="s259">I was already in America that time.</span> <span id="s260">Probably the end of 1938, beginning of 1939.</span> <span id="s261">You know, who would know this much better this particular thing, my friend Fanny, because she was one of this boats and she seemed to remember about our girlfriend Milly how she was on this ship that was turned around and send back.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: And your brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: My brothers.</span> <span id="s264">One brother came together with me to America in December 1938.</span> <span id="s265">We were able to leave Vienna December the 7th 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes, and I waited for the Visa to come through and the American consulate called us beginning of December or November, you know, to come for a medical examination to come to America.</span> <span id="s267">And we came on a Dutch boat, on Holland-American Line.</span> <span id="s268">We left Vienna on the 7th of December 1938.</span> <span id="s269">My late brother, my late nephew, my uncle and I. All the three of us all together.</span> <span id="s270">My parents remained in Vienna, they waited to get entry papers to go to England.</span> <span id="s271">Because one of my brothers, who was a doctor of chemistry was in Ireland, in Northern Ireland.</span> <span id="s272">It belongs to England.</span> <span id="s273">And he was able to send papers for my parents to Vienna to bring them over to London.</span> <span id="s274">In London, being they were both born in Poland, they belonged to he Polish quota, and that was a very full quota and it took a long time for them to come here.</span> <span id="s275">And they were for about a year in London, they went through the Blitzkrieg, they were bombed, they were interned in England, because they had German passports, because by that time they left Vienna, you know , the passports, Austria was part of Germany, so English people threaten them as the would be enemies and the interned them as German citizens.</span> <span id="s276">So my poor parents went through this on the top of Hitler, they had to be interned in England for a little while for several month which killed my father, he was a diabetic, he was sick than he ever was and somehow they survived that and then a year later they came hear and my father died soon after that.</span> <span id="s277">And.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: So your family was reunited hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yes we were reunited after a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: And what happened to your apartment in Leoben?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Somebody took it over.</span> <span id="s282">Who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Your tried to sell the furniture?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Where did you live?</span> <span id="s285">In which street?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Leopoldsgasse 22 in Vienna</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Can you remember the name of this Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: The name of this Jewish family was „Vortrefflich“.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: And how was the situation in Vienna compared with Leoben?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Well.</span> <span id="s291">We were always in danger.</span> <span id="s292">That’s when the took the women to scrub the sidewalks.</span> <span id="s293">The did this in Leoben already too.</span> <span id="s294">They took some of the Jewish women, two of them, they made them to put on their best clothing.</span> <span id="s295">They wrote „Jude“ in red paint on the sidewalk and they took this two wonderful Jewish women.</span> <span id="s296">And they said „get down on your knees and scrub this off.</span> <span id="s297">“ And they had do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: That happened in Leoben right after the Anschluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yeah, in Leoben.</span> <span id="s300">Yes.</span> <span id="s301">So they took Jewish people from Leoben to Auschwitz to Dachau.</span> <span id="s302">My oldest brother was a short while in Dachau, before he went to Israel.</span> <span id="s303">They took several Jewish young man to Dachau and somehow, this was in the beginning, you know, when the could prove they would have a place to go to, not to remain in Austria.</span> <span id="s304">That they had „Ausreisevisum“, then after a few weeks, a couple of month, they let them out.</span> <span id="s305">So my oldest brother Simon, amongst some of the other young man were taken to Dachau and because he was able to prove that he and his wife was able to go to Palestine on such and such date, and he also hat pull some Austrian gentile man who knew him well and who intervened for him also and he got out and some of the other young man got out, because they were able to prove that the go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: He was.</span> <span id="s307">.</span> <span id="s308">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s309">He was arrested in Leoben?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s311">Yes, he was one of the Leobner.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: When did it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Probably in 38 still or beginning of 39.</span> <span id="s314">To tell you the truth, this I am not sure about.</span> <span id="s315">But I know a bunch of them were taken, a few of them.</span> <span id="s316">I think Fanny’s father was one of them or one of her brothers.</span> <span id="s317">They were taken together with my brother to Dachau.</span> <span id="s318">And a lot, this poor lady who was scrubbing the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s319">She and her wonderful son were taken to Auschwitz and a couple, they lived opposite us, he and his wife and twin children, little girls, were taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s320">And from that small Jewish community there was a large percentage, who could not survive.</span> <span id="s321">Were perished one way or the other through the Nazis.</span> <span id="s322">And, to leave not anything important out.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Can you remember the „Reichskristallnacht“ in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s325">Kristallnacht, two young SA-man came to your apartment.</span> <span id="s326">My mother had in her suitcase linens and in the top of the linens she had some silver-cutlery, knifes and forks and spoons, that she brought from Leoben, and she was hiding them in an European pillowcase that had little buttons around it.</span> <span id="s327">Are you familiar, with the European pillowcase of these days?</span> <span id="s328">The pillowcase had buttons.</span> <span id="s329">Maybe not at your time but in my time.</span> <span id="s330">So my mother had this all buttoned up needly, so the SA-man came and they wanted to take, rob, what ever they could from the Jews.</span> <span id="s331">„What do you have in this suitcase?</span> <span id="s332">“ And my mother said, linens, so he opens it up and picks up this pillow case you know with this silver in it.</span> <span id="s333">So instead of open up each little button, six or eight little buttons, you know, because this European pillowcases were large, not like the little ones hear.</span> <span id="s334">So he didn’t want to open up this little buttons.</span> <span id="s335">So he took a bayonet and he slit it open and by doing so, he was in hurry, he cut his hand by accident, he cut through his hand and he was bleeding, he got scared and he grabbed another pillowcase and rubbed it around and the two of them ran probably to the nearest hospital, or the nearest doctor and they didn’t take anything.</span> <span id="s336">So my late father was a very religious man and he said „God saved us, because in this house is a „Saferthora“ which is.</span> <span id="s337">The „Saferthora“ is the book of Jewish laws and our landlord was a very religious man, very few Jewish families had there „Saferthora“ this is only something, that lays in the temple.</span> <span id="s338">But this man had one.</span> <span id="s339">And my father said, because of the „Saferthora“ we were saved.</span> <span id="s340">So this was „Kristallnacht“.</span> <span id="s341">This was in November, wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s342">That was the experience of the „Kristallnacht“.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">But thank god, we were spared.</span> <span id="s344">And then, after we left.</span> <span id="s345">I remember when my brother, my nephew and I went to the train.</span> <span id="s346">My parents came to the „Suedbahnhof“.</span> <span id="s347">I think it was the „Suedbahnhof“ in Vienna to see us off.</span> <span id="s348">We didn’t know that we will see each other again.</span> <span id="s349">It was a heard breaking... And soon after this.</span> <span id="s350">In order for us to go to America we had to go to Rotterdam through Germany.</span> <span id="s351">And in Rotterdam a Jewish organization picked us up, and took us to huge building near the piers were the boots are.</span> <span id="s352">And the put us up, you know like the sailors sleep there, you know, but we were glad that we had a roof over our heads.</span> <span id="s353">We were a day or two in Rotterdam, we looked around we felt free.</span> <span id="s354">and then we came to America.</span> <span id="s355">11 days on the boot on the „Veendam“, „Veendam“ was the name of the boot.</span> <span id="s356">And our aunt and uncle took us in very lovingly.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Can you remember the journey?</span> <span id="s358">Were there other refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: It was a pleasant journey.</span> <span id="s360">We paid for our own.</span> <span id="s361">It was not a refugee-boot.</span> <span id="s362">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s363">It was a regular „Holland-America-Line“ boot and we were treated very well and we paid for our journey you know.</span> <span id="s364">It was, you know the trip was good.</span> <span id="s365">My brother got sick, seasick you know.</span> <span id="s366">But it was a normal see-journey.</span> <span id="s367">Good food and one steward on the boot said: „You better eat and enjoy the food , who knows what you gonna through in America until, you know, gonna establish yourself.</span> <span id="s368">It’s not gonna be easy for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Were there other refugees also?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: There was German family, German Jewish family was there.</span> <span id="s371">Yes.</span> <span id="s372">Mother, father and a boy.</span> <span id="s373">And maybe there wee others, but we only got acquainted with that one family.</span> <span id="s374">I guess we set on the same table.</span> <span id="s375">But we.....What I gonna to say.</span> <span id="s376">Yes.</span> <span id="s377">And then life for us in America, in the beginning, you know, my aunt and uncle kept us for a while, you know, put us up.</span> <span id="s378">And then we had to start looking around to make a living.</span> <span id="s379">And at that time, beginning of 1939, America was still the end of a depression.</span> <span id="s380">There were very few jobs to be had.</span> <span id="s381">So, I found a job in a distant cousins factory as a sawing machine operator.</span> <span id="s382">And I learned how to do it and I stayed there for five years.</span> <span id="s383">And my brother couldn’t find anything in New York.</span> <span id="s384">He went to the HIAS, which is a Jewish organization, asked them to send him away from New York into a smaller town.</span> <span id="s385">They sent him to Pennsylvania, in a small town and they got him a job in a furniture store.</span> <span id="s386">Were he had to do all the minor labor.</span> <span id="s387">But somehow he made a salary and he lived ,he was a bachelor.</span> <span id="s388">And my nephew, he was only 17 at that time.</span> <span id="s389">He had a job in the same factory, were I worked as a sawing machine operator.</span> <span id="s390">She gave him a job as a bundleboy.</span> <span id="s391">Which means he had to carry the fabrics to the operators, who sawed them.</span> <span id="s392">He made a few dollars.</span> <span id="s393">And he took a little furnished room in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s394">And I took a little furnished room in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s395">You understand.</span> <span id="s396">So this is how we to get started to get back on our feeds.</span> <span id="s397">And to have a roof over our heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Were you supported at the beginning...</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: No.</span> <span id="s400">At that time there were no organizations to support.</span> <span id="s401">Maybe we didn’t go, maybe we didn’t now about it.</span> <span id="s402">But you see my aunt and uncle, who wrote the Affidavits.</span> <span id="s403">You see.</span> <span id="s404">When they send us Affidavits, they had to sign, that we will not be a burden to anybody.</span> <span id="s405">And this is how we had to carry it out too.</span> <span id="s406">As long we were able to make a few dollars and at that time we were able to buy in cafeteria a meal for 35 cents.</span> <span id="s407">My first salary was 10 dollars a week, they took 10 cents social security, they deducted so my take home pay was 9,90 and I lived.</span> <span id="s408">I survived.</span> <span id="s409">And then a few months later they gave me an increase of a dollar.</span> <span id="s410">And this is how we survived.</span> <span id="s411">We were not afraid to work.</span> <span id="s412">This is how we survived.</span> <span id="s413">But</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: And then your parents came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: And did you lived together, did you moved together?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: In the beginning, yes.</span> <span id="s418">We took an apartment together in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s419">My nephew lived with us.</span> <span id="s420">And then eventually my brother, who lived in Philadelphia, no in Newcastle, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s421">He wanted to live near the parents and near us and so he came back.</span> <span id="s422">And by that time the war already had started and during the war people found jobs.</span> <span id="s423">He started to work for „Gimbles department store“ until he retired at the age of 65.</span> <span id="s424">All these years he was a salesman.</span> <span id="s425">But what Hitler did to us, was something, you know, no matter how we today, we live a normal life, and everything, but they can’t take this out of our system what we went through.</span> <span id="s426">This can never be erased.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Did you visit Austria after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Never.</span> <span id="s429">There is nobody left there, that I want to see.</span> <span id="s430">I mean it is beautiful country.</span> <span id="s431">I grew up in the Alps, you know „oesterreichische Alpen“ beautiful.</span> <span id="s432">I wouldn’t mind seeing it all this, you know.</span> <span id="s433">But a cousin of mine who lives in San Francisco was there a couple of years ago.</span> <span id="s434">And he brought his son, who was born here in the United States, to show him were he was born in Leoben.</span> <span id="s435">So they went to the „Kaerntnerstrasse“, his fathers store was also on the „Kaerntnerstrasse“ next to my fathers store.</span> <span id="s436">And he was standing in the front of the building and a couple, a middle age couple passed by.</span> <span id="s437">And they stopped, and because they stud there looking for something.</span> <span id="s438">So my cousin asked this man and women: „do you life in Leoben for many years.</span> <span id="s439">“ And he said: „I was born here.</span> <span id="s440">“ He said: „Do you remember a family, they had a store here, there name was Gewing?</span> <span id="s441">There was a houseware store Gewing and next to, there was a clothing store Gewing.</span> <span id="s442">“ „Oh, the name is very familiar, very familiar, said he.</span> <span id="s443">So the wife said: „Come.</span> <span id="s444">Let’s go.</span> <span id="s445">“ She didn’t let him talk.</span> <span id="s446">She didn’t want him to tell.</span> <span id="s447">She didn’t want to remember.</span> <span id="s448">But they remembered.</span> <span id="s449">As I said, Mr..</span> <span id="s450">Kloesch, the memory of this terrible tragedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Did you meet some other refugees from Leoben hear in New York, besides of your nephew.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s453">Yes.</span> <span id="s454">There was a lovely

elderly.</span> <span id="s457">But her husband and her mother lived in New York, we were in touch with them.</span> <span id="s458">They survived Leoben.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: And your acquaintance in New York at the beginning.</span> <span id="s460">Were the mostly refugees from Europe or native born Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Mostly Americans.</span> <span id="s462">There wasn’t much time to be together with friends.</span> <span id="s463">Work, you know.</span> <span id="s464">But most of them, and thank god, I had nice relatives.</span> <span id="s465">American-born cousins and my uncle and aunt were very nice to me and my family.</span> <span id="s466">Very warm.</span> <span id="s467">One thing, my uncle, when I came here and I told my uncle what went on, what they did to us.</span> <span id="s468">Many years latter he said to me: „You know Herta.</span> <span id="s469">When you told us this terrible things, that they did to you and to other Jewish families.</span> <span id="s470">I couldn’t even believe it.</span> <span id="s471">How this „gemuetliche Oesterreicher“ could do such things.</span> <span id="s472">The music loving „Oesterreicher“.</span> <span id="s473">the cultured people.</span> <span id="s474">How they could turn in such monsters.</span> <span id="s475">But know I have to apologize to you, because now I know more as before.</span> <span id="s476">“ When they started to show on the news.</span> <span id="s477">He said: „Now I realized, now I know that you had told me the truth.</span> <span id="s478">“ People, you now, it was hard for them to believe.</span> <span id="s479">When my uncle came to visit us, he was here many years, and he came to Leoben and I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s480">I appeared in the theater as three or four year old in the „Graefin Marrizza“ on stage.</span> <span id="s481">„Oh what a wonderful culture loving little town.</span> <span id="s482">“ They changed like

<span id="s725">You know, what I mean.</span> <span id="s726">But all that changed.</span> <span id="s727">There was another thing we always used to have a sleep in maid.</span> <span id="s728">I grew up with a housekeeper, who lived with us.</span> <span id="s729">She, and when Hitler came, they were not allowed to work for Jews anymore.</span> <span id="s730">So very tearfully, she left us,

the Jews, that she was deprived of, because of the Hitler.</span> <span id="s736">So she was really also a victim in that way, you know.</span> <span id="s737">And not just she, but other people also
