Yes now you know how old I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q. I guess the best place to start is with family history You don't have to be that specific but how far back can you trace your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A. Well I don't have any accurate records-that's a project my sister has, she now resides in Israel - but I can certainly account for a Great Grandfather who lived in Germany, and my hunch is that my Great-Great Grandfather lived there too, so at least 3 or 4 generations back.</span> <span id="s16">On my father's side and on my father's mother's side maybe even longer than that so that for my mother's side I'm not so sure...I mentioned to you earlier that her maiden name was Von Gelder, which sounds to me German, like Smith or Rosenberg A lot of Jews have the name Von Gelder, and my hunch is that those are migrants from Spartan backgrounds somewhere along the line, and Italy perhaps, but I don't know .</span> <span id="s17">.</span> <span id="s18">I don't have much history since the...</span></p> <p><span id="s19">03-12 Q. And as far as the settlement in Germany in the Frankfurt area itself-they were settled in the Frankfurt area?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A. No not really .</span> <span id="s21">.</span> <span id="s22">they come from an area around Darmstadt, in the... .</span> <span id="s23">what's it called Bachstrasse, which is a region that is mountainous, I can't remember the name of the mountain I would have to look at a German map to identify that.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q. And what brought your parents to Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A. My father found work, there, so he migrated there, got married there, my sister and I were born Eventually the work dissipated itself, because with the rise of the Nazi regime the owners of that business realized that would not be a good future for them so they kind of liquidated, and my father drifted into Jewish communal service and became the religious head of a very small community right at the outskirts of Frankfurt, where he was the teacher of religion...he was the ritual slaughterer for as long as the Nazis permitted him to slaughter.</span> <span id="s26">He was the Chazau, or the leader, and religious questions came his way, he was able to answer of course he referred to Rabbinic authority to whom he was responsible.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q. Could we stop for just a moment because I am going to keep coughing and I'm going to drown you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A. All I see on this stupid tape is my face and it's terrible...it's boring...</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q. Well were going to splice it together with some other things...</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A. With what?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q.</span> <span id="s32">Other newsreel footage.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">05-32 A. Oh, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q.</span> <span id="s35">So we were saying your father became a functionary of the Jewish community and this was in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A. No this was in a suburb, called Berghan, known originally as Berghan-Enkheim; now they are separate communities; at one time I guess they were one.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q.</span> <span id="s38">But it was quite close to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A. Yes it was close, close enough for me to go to school there every morning, to go to Frankfurt to school as a youngster of 10,11 or 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q. And you went to a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A. Well I started out of course in the regular public school...of course you probably know the German school system...at the age of 10...um...6th grade, somewhere around there, you can go, you declare whether you want to continue the public school and complete that and become an apprentice to a trade, or if you want to go towards a higher education, at which point you have to go to a kind of program that is more college oriented.</span> <span id="s42">I opted for a Jewish school that was college oriented, which was the school Sam Saint Raphael, in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s43">Both my sister and I attended that, and I still remember the way I was accepted : I walked into the classroom and had to give the usual greeting in that particular public school, which was "Heil Hitler, Ein Lieben".</span> <span id="s44">I said that and I think it was the last time I ever had to say Heil Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q.</span> <span id="s46">You were 7 or 8 years old when Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A. 1933.</span> <span id="s48">.</span> <span id="s49">from 1926...you can figure out the math...</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q. And do you recall the time...the January, February, March period when the Nazis first assumed power?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">08-03 A. My recollections are of course of a lot of the flags...the swastikas and the white circle appearing...more and more people in uniform being on the street, some of them young people...maybe even as a youngster I could have been a bit jealous that I couldn't join the elite group of people who seemed to get all the privileges, etc.</span> <span id="s52">I learned that as a Jew I wasn't going to be very welcome that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q.</span> <span id="s54">Did you experience any anti-Semitism in those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A. Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q. Do you recall anything in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A. I remember walking down the street many times when there were people my age, some slightly older, some slightly younger, who were members of the Hitler youth, who were behind me, and I would not walk in a straight line knowing full well that they would be throwing stones and I would hope that the stones wouldn't hit me.</span> <span id="s58">I recall one time I outran the best athlete in the school...lt wasn't because I was particularly agile...it was the adrenaline that drove me that I was able to outrun him.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q.</span> <span id="s60">Did your family think of leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A. Yes...yes...my father had 2 brothers and 1 sister here in the U.S. for a good many years, and they had sent the opportunity to come to America.</span> <span id="s62">We had a very low quota number and we were hoping to be smuggled out until the quota number came up...of course things turned out a little differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q. Your father, you mentioned, was in WWI and had won a declaration.</span> <span id="s64">Did that have any impact on him as far as wanting to stay or leave...ln other words did he consider himself quite German or...</span></p> <p><span id="s65">10-23 A. To my father being Jewish, being an orthodox Jew was much more important than being German.</span> <span id="s66">I don't remember any such nationalistic pride...no not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q.</span> <span id="s68">In the years that you went to the Raphael Hirsh School, this was also in Frankfurt</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A.</span> <span id="s70">That was in Frankfurt, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q.</span> <span id="s72">As far as going to and from school was there ever any anti-Semitism ?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A. Occasionally, yes there was harassment...</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q.</span> <span id="s75">But nothing as far as a violent or traumatic incident as far as you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A. Uh, no.</span> <span id="s77">As a matter of fact it didn't help to tell the parents because they couldn't do much about it because if they complained it would get worse, and that was felt by the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q. Do you recall anything of the events leading up to the Crystal Night, the assignation of Von Rath, and so on?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A. Not really.</span> <span id="s80">There were a lot of assemblies in school where you would then sing the national German songs etc. etc. and they felt uncomfortable; even if you wanted to be part of the crowd you knew you weren't part of the crowd and so that was uncomfortable...to hear Hitler speak on the radio was difficult to assimilate because of the manner in which he spoke.</span> <span id="s81">It may have been quite wonderful for the German people, but certainly, as far as I was concerned it had a king of grating sound on my ears.</span> <span id="s82">He was constantly shouting...it was a high pitch.</span> <span id="s83">In retrospect it was not a pleasant experience to me at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q. And do you recall him speaking about the, Jews...how his speech...</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A.</span> <span id="s86">You would hear statements made by him that were of course slanderous against the Jews, and you became very aware that this was the kind of regime that you had a fear...and the fear was that they could take your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">12-57 Q.</span> <span id="s88">As far as Crystal night, what do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A.</span> <span id="s90">If I remember correctly Crystal night was on a Thursday night.</span> <span id="s91">The morning of that day the local policeman, sheriff, whatever he was called, came and told my father that he was to be placed under what was called "protective arrest."</span> <span id="s92">We had no idea what that all was about and the ones that were home were...l suppose there was no school that day because um, my father was taken and teachers were taken so my mother and my sister and I were in the home.</span> <span id="s93">Towards evening we heard rocks being thrown against the synagogue...we lived in the building that belonged to the community that you might want to call a Parish building for lack of a better term, and the synagogue was across the yard and we heard the...crowds and crowds of people men and women- stomping outside and throwing rocks, breaking windows, breaking the locks.</span> <span id="s94">Eventually we heard axes breaking the furniture and a whole bunch of noises that probably reflected destructive types of activities.</span> <span id="s95">There were some people that stomped into the house and into the kitchen while we were huddled on the second floor, and asked if we had any weapons or any jewelry and maybe even silver, and my mother answered those things.</span> <span id="s96">My sister and I didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s97">I kind of feared that this was the end and I probably recited the Shmah a million times out loud...eventually out of emotional exhaustion I fell asleep while they were breaking up the synagogue piece by piece next door.</span> <span id="s98">Then of course waking up in the morning we came outside and in the yard were strewn all of the Torah scrolls, all spread out and I had felt badly because perhaps I could have saved a Torah scroll that was in the schoolroom right downstairs from us.</span> <span id="s99">Who knows had I done this what might have happened to the family had it been discovered but nevertheless that was my thinking.</span> <span id="s100">And then we left Berghan and went to Frankfurt...took a train to Anspach where my grandparents were.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q. And did you look in the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A. No I was scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q. Was the synagogue set on fire?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A. No they couldn't set it on fire because it was for villagers and therefore they couldn't fire it.</span> <span id="s105">That's why they systematically chopped it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q.</span> <span id="s107">Did you recognize any of the people that were doing this, any of the people that came to you while you were huddled under the chair?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A. I don't think that any of the villagers came to the house.</span> <span id="s109">I may have recognized some voices but we know that villagers were involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">16-48 Q. Was there anyone that tried to help you that night or the following day, any non-Jewish neighbors who came to help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A. I wish my parents were alive.</span> <span id="s112">They might be able to answer that better.</span> <span id="s113">To my recollection I don't believe so, but that doesn't mean it wasn't so.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q. And then you left the suburb?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q. And you went to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A.</span> <span id="s118">We went to my Grandparents, my father's parents, who I mentioned lived in Anspach.</span> <span id="s119">My Grandfather had the same kind of position my father had.</span> <span id="s120">There the synagogue was attached to the home and there everything was cleaned out and taken in a heap to a very large garden and burned.</span> <span id="s121">So all the books were taken away, all the Torah scrolls, all the furnishings...it was more or less a bare room.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q. And that also they did not set that on fire?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A. No they were not allowed to.</span> <span id="s124">The villagers, there were no villagers involved in the activities and they said you cannot set it on fire because you would set us on fire and we cannot permit you to do that.</span> <span id="s125">Neither were they powerful enough to be able to drive those who came in as outsiders to have this anti-Jewish action.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q. Subsequent to Crystal Night, did you go to school eventually</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A. Yes yes.</span> <span id="s128">.</span> <span id="s129">l don't know how much after, but when we heard that school was back in session.</span> <span id="s130">My sister and I lived in the orphanage and stayed there until we left for England Sept, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q. And in the post Crystal Night time was there an increase or change in anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A. Oh I know I was more scared because of the experience, but whether there were any incidents that I personally experienced, I don't have a memory of that Kind of vague... I probably blocked a lot of that period...it's hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">19-18 Q. Your family you said had a low quota over to the U.S.</span> <span id="s134">Why didn't they get out before?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A.</span> <span id="s136">It wasn't our turn yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q.</span> <span id="s138">So you had to wait your turn?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A.</span> <span id="s140">You have to wait your turn.</span> <span id="s141">We probably would have gotten out before had we remained in Germany because it was so low and it was "soon, soon, soon" and so we didn't make any move.</span> <span id="s142">The moves were made because my mother became uneasy when there was a lot of discussion, around Sept., prior to Sept. 1, 1939 when first Hitler gets on the radio and then Chamberlain got on the radio, "there's not going to be more, there's not going to be more," and my mother said in typical feminine fashion if they're talking about peace then they mean war so let's get out of here and since we had the opportunity through friends, to have a through visa to England, which we didn't want to take advantage of because we didn't want our relatives in America to have to deal with the finances; we decided the last minute to go...indeed it was the last civilian plane out of Germany prior to Hitler's invasion of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q.</span> <span id="s144">So this was in the morning of Sept. 1, 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A. 3 a.m. I'm sorry, it was supposed to be a 3 a.m. Lufthansa but instead it was a 3:15 KLM Royal Dutch Air Force.</span> <span id="s146">We arrived in Amsterdam at 6 in the morning, over the loudspeaker it said, "we don't know if you can continue your flight to Brighton, Hitler has just invaded Poland."</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q. Going back to your father.</span> <span id="s148">He was taken into custody on Crystal Night?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">21-p32 Q.</span> <span id="s151">What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A. Well eventually he was shipped to Buchenwald and somehow it got through to our family that people who were arrested were taken to a place called a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s153">And perhaps we might have even gotten a postcard from him or there were a couple of postcards...I don't remember what time period this happened but... he was there for 4 weeks...and the reason that he was able to get out is very interesting.</span> <span id="s154">I mentioned that my father was a soldier on the front line in WWI.</span> <span id="s155">When Hitler came to power, since he was also in WWI, he wanted to reward all of these staunch German soldiers who fought on the front lines during that particular war.</span> <span id="s156">Therefore he gave them a ribbon to wear as a sign of honor to sew on their suits and in order to make it legitimate he issued a certificate with a signature.</span> <span id="s157">Well my father, being that he followed orders, he put that ribbon on every suit and wherever he was, he had that certificate with him.</span> <span id="s158">So when it came to the time when Buchenwald became overcrowded with Jews - at that time they did not yet know what the final solution would be, thank God-but they needed some orderly method of getting rid of this overcrowded condition, and they decided that the first group of people to be free was the soldiers who had fought in WWI and had a certificate to prove it.</span> <span id="s159">So he came out.</span> <span id="s160">We were staying with our grandparents ...it must have been before we went back to school.</span> <span id="s161">I suppose I didn't want to believe it was my father.</span> <span id="s162">His beard was shaven, and even though not all of his hair had been cut...it had one hair cut but not the second, the one that bald them completely...and I couldn't believe it was my father.</span> <span id="s163">I thought it was a Nazi spy sent into our home, until Friday night he sat down at the dinner table and as his habit he leaned over like this covering the fat part of the face, at which point I began to recognize that indeed it was he.</span> <span id="s164">It was kind of a scary memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">24-06 Q.</span> <span id="s166">Did he ever speak of his experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A. No.</span> <span id="s168">I heard from others about the way he defended, many times, members of his congregation at the expense of being beaten.</span> <span id="s169">He did the same thing for a second cousin who has the same name really as my father and who now resides in Israel.</span> <span id="s170">Who is not well anymore.</span> <span id="s171">But who had been a political prisoner because he said something derogatory about the Nazis, from 1933 or 1934 on, and there was some contact there.</span> <span id="s172">But he never spoke about his concentration camp experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q.</span> <span id="s174">How long did it take for him to get back or at least to part with his old self or his old...</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A. Well let's see...memory here is very vague because we were at one place basically and they were elsewhere.</span> <span id="s176">I don't even know what my father did from the time he was in the concentration camps to the time he left for Germany, simply we were in school, especially during the week.</span> <span id="s177">Maybe we got together weekends.</span> <span id="s178">I know that there was a plan for Bar Mitzvah of course, my Bar Mitzvah was coming up, and he had to go back to the congregation and bear it because all the people there knew it was my Bar Mitzvah and even walked out to celebrate at the orphanage...but I don't recall all of the things that he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q. And so your Bar Mitzvah was held...?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A.</span> <span id="s181">In the orphanage in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q. And do you recall, as far as the outside world, the impact of what was going on outside, as far as your Bar Mitzvah ceremony.</span> <span id="s183">Anything about it...or was it just because it was in a Jewish institution it was celebrated?</span> <span id="s184">It was just a fairly normal Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">26-35 A. Well I think I regretted not being back in the old synagogue where I grew up, which was much prettier than the one in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s186">I think I missed all of that.</span> <span id="s187">I have the feeling that the ceremony would have been much more lavish with many more people participating.</span> <span id="s188">My grandparents were already in this country at that time and so that part of the family did not come.</span> <span id="s189">There were other parts from my mother's family that would have come.</span> <span id="s190">There were lots and lots of changes.</span> <span id="s191">I'm sure even, to be materialistic for a moment, that the presents I received would have been of a different character than had there not been a Nazi period being around.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q.</span> <span id="s193">Once you left, and when you went to England it was your mother, father, sister and yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A. And my Aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q. And an Aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A. My father's oldest sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q.</span> <span id="s198">How long did you remain in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A. For exactly half a year-6 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q. And then your relatives were able to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A. No.</span> <span id="s202">Then our quota number caught up with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q. And you came to Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q.</span> <span id="s206">The other relatives who were left in Germany...what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">28-28 A.</span> <span id="s208">There were some relatives of my natural mother who ended up here.</span> <span id="s209">Some ended up in South America.I have a cousin there in Buenos Aires.</span> <span id="s210">And the rest I don't know.</span> <span id="s211">There were family members I mentioned who came to Israel.</span> <span id="s212">There were, on my father's side, many who came to the U.S. prior to this period.</span> <span id="s213">There is an Aunt of mine who remained behind with her whole family, and our hunch is that they perished in the concentration camps, because after that we lost all trace of them.</span> <span id="s214">So that's the closest relative, I believe that we lost.</span> <span id="s215">My Stepmother's family...her parents died before this and her one brother went to Australia and the other ended up in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q. And as far as trying to summarize what Crystal Night meant to your family, your immediate family...the impact of Crystal Night?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A. Well my own.</span> <span id="s218">.</span> <span id="s219">I can only speak for myself.</span> <span id="s220">I can't speak for my parents who are no longer alive, nor can I speak for my sister who is not here.</span> <span id="s221">For me it meant that whatever anger and security there might have been growing up in the house and living in a close knit family and having a feeling of belonging .</span> <span id="s222">.</span> <span id="s223">that was all gone and it was a question of how soon do we leave.</span> <span id="s224">I remember maybe a few days after my Bar Mitzvah, some people in the orphanage came to me-the youngsters ran their own services-and said would I be willing to read the Torah 6-8 weeks later, so they could give me enough time to prepare and I said I would be more than willing but I'm not sure I will be here; it was that particular weak beam...how did I know...I didn't know but we knew it was no longer a place to stay.</span> <span id="s225">It was a question of time How soon can we get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">31-00 Q. And in terms of looking back at the Holocaust in general, is there a way to describe where Crystal Night fits into your point of view?</span> <span id="s227">When you think about that in terms of the general European Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A.</span> <span id="s229">It perhaps was the very first public, almost unified expression of the German people that they were willing to go along with Hitler's plan which was against the Jews in this instant.</span> <span id="s230">Whatever other plans he had I'm sure there were other manifestations of that feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q.</span> <span id="s232">But you have the very distinct impression that despite the fact that there were those who held back, or did not participate enthusiastically, that Crystal night was a nationwide mobilization of hate?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A.</span> <span id="s234">At least enough that those who wanted to counter it weren't strong enough to do anything about it.</span> <span id="s235">That is, there was no safe place in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q.</span> <span id="s237">One last question.</span> <span id="s238">Something we were speaking about before you mentioned that you returned to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">32-25 A. Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q. And to the site of your home...the synagogue wasn't there.</span> <span id="s241">Could you describe your feelings at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A. On one hand it was sad because part of my childhood was no longer in existence; in some other way perhaps I was happy that it wasn't there anymore...in the sense of...they don't deserve to have a synagogue here...than to have any Jewish life after what was done without too much objection.</span> <span id="s243">So those were the kinds of feelings.</span> <span id="s244">It was sad to be in a place where I had enjoyed childhood and all the mischievousness of children and their playing...their good times and bad times because that's just no there anymore.</span> <span id="s245">I don't know what would have happened if I had lived in a nice free country and then to go back 40 years later to where I grew up...what those feelings would be because I have no way to compare them.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q. Yes, well I thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A. Well I hope I've been helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q. Yes you have, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">USHMM Archives RG-50.031*0015 PAGE 9</span></p></body></html>
