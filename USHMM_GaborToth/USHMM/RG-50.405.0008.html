Snyderman, (Let me begin by asking you your earliest memories growing up in Odessa.</span> <span id="s13">You told me that your father was wounded in the war, what do you remember of your father?)</span> <span id="s14">I have very small memories because, maybe from 195556 he begins to use medicine and was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s15">But I remember that he was a very kind man.</span> <span id="s16">This is maybe mostly what I remember his kindness.</span> <span id="s17">That's all, because five, six years, it's not enough age (to have a clear memory.)</span> <span id="s18">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">(What were his injuries?</span> <span id="s20">Do you remember how he got them, in what battles?)</span> <span id="s21">He never spoke about this when he was healthy.</span> <span id="s22">But after he got sick it was impossible to speak with him about things like this.</span> <span id="s23">I remember in some war fighting he received a piece of metal in the leg.</span> <span id="s24">He was not so wounded, but his nervous system was affected not at this moment, but a lot of years after he came back.</span> <span id="s25">His health was worse and worse every day.</span> <span id="s26">Maybe this began when I was five.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">(So for awhile was he able to work after the war?)</span> <span id="s28">Yeah, he worked all the time before this moment when he needed some medical help.</span> <span id="s29">And after this his condition became worse and worse.</span> <span id="s30">And he went to the hospital and after that, sometimes my mother took him back, but his condition became worse and it was impossible to live with him.</span> <span id="s31">We lived in the worst conditions unbelievably the worst maybe for usual American people it's unbelievable that we lived in basement without any kind of utilities.</span> <span id="s32">Only water.</span> <span id="s33">Without gas.</span> <span id="s34">We had a fire, and we cooked in the fire.</span> <span id="s35">(You built a fire with sticks?)</span> <span id="s36">Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">I remember that maybe, before 1966, we haven't a gas stove, and I all times am preparing some coal or wood for winter.</span> <span id="s38">This was my duty at home from very early childhood.</span> <span id="s39">My mother received a very small salary and we tried to survive on this very small salary.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">(What kind of work did your father and mother do?)</span> <span id="s41">My mother worked in the medical clinic like a janitor.</span> <span id="s42">She was completely without any kind of education.</span> <span id="s43">She couldn't write.</span> <span id="s44">She could only read that's all her education.</span> <span id="s45">(She did not benefit from the Revolution, did she?</span> <span id="s46">Why was that?</span> <span id="s47">Was her family property owners or storekeepers?</span> <span id="s48">Why was she denied an education?</span> <span id="s49">Or was she denied an education?)</span> <span id="s50">I think this is wrong understanding, that Revolution opened the doors for all Jewish to... because Jewish have a lot of circle in the USSR low circle who live in this village, in the pale, in the settlement.</span> <span id="s51">Most people who live in this pale, they remain at this level.</span> <span id="s52">(What was the Russian word for a pale settlement?)</span> <span id="s53">Mestechko.</span> <span id="s54">And a big group of Jews didn't receive any kind of education.</span> <span id="s55">But some Jews did receive education.</span> <span id="s56">This is because a lot of Jews came to the towns before the Revolution, during and after.</span> <span id="s57">Only these people could receive some education.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Do you know that after the Revolution, in any kind of school, colleges, or university, people could go if they grow up in the very [easy] settlements without any property, but some of Jews have some small property it's not exactly property, but from view of Revolution, this was like the father of my wife.</span> <span id="s59">He tried a lot of times to go to the institute, and twice he hadn't permission because his father had a small store, and this was the reason.</span> <span id="s60">Eventually he came to the institute and he finished.</span> <span id="s61">But it's not all Jews.</span> <span id="s62">Jews were shared by many different circles.</span> <span id="s63">There are Jews who were in higher level, intellectual, who represent most famous of Russian culture, writers, whatever, but it's not only Jews, it's some circle.</span> <span id="s64">Unfortunately my mother didn't belong to this... Not unfortunately, this is like fate.</span> <span id="s65">We can't choose or change.</span> <span id="s66">We can only live, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">(You lived in these very hard conditions even for Russia.</span> <span id="s68">You remember your earliest memories growing up in a basement with an open fire.)</span> <span id="s69">A wet basement.</span> <span id="s70">(You mean the walls were dripping?)</span> <span id="s71">Yes.</span> <span id="s72">Yes.</span> <span id="s73">(Did you have a bed?)</span> <span id="s74">Yes, I had a bed.</span> <span id="s75">Sometimes some relatives, not often, but sometimes they helped my mother.</span> <span id="s76">Relatives of my father didn't help with anything, but mother's brother helped.</span> <span id="s77">(How did he help with money?)</span> <span id="s78">Sometimes with money, sometimes with coal in the winter, because it's not easy to get coal.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">(Did you have enough to eat?)</span> <span id="s80">This is very interesting.</span> <span id="s81">At this time, 1950s, beginning of '60s, there was more easy with food than now, because Krushchev began his reforms, and it was not too bad in comparison.</span> <span id="s82">(So even though your actual home was a pitiful place, you weren't hungry.</span> <span id="s83">You had decent food.)</span> <span id="s84">Not sometimes, but not all the time.</span> <span id="s85">Sometimes we had enough food, but not all the time.</span> <span id="s86">Usually we had food... (What did you eat, for example?</span> <span id="s87">What would your supper be?)</span> <span id="s88">That's very difficult.</span> <span id="s89">In the summer, tomatoes, fresh tomatoes.</span> <span id="s90">My mother very often trying to put them... because I begin and can't stop.</span> <span id="s91">I eat, eat, eat.</span> <span id="s92">She needs to share for all times.</span> <span id="s93">I liked sugar.</span> <span id="s94">This is hard for Americans to understand, maybe.</span> <span id="s95">I can eat a box of sugar.</span> <span id="s96">(You mean eat it straight, by the spoonful?)</span> <span id="s97">No, no.</span> <span id="s98">Because we usually eat pieces of sugar, hard sugar.</span> <span id="s99">(Cubes of sugar.)</span> <span id="s100">Yes.</span> <span id="s101">(What was the main food that you survived on?</span> <span id="s102">Bread?</span> <span id="s103">Meat?</span> <span id="s104">Chicken?)</span> <span id="s105">Sometimes we had chicken.</span> <span id="s106">Usually on a big holiday, New Year, First May, Seventh of November, my mother would try to make fish and a lot of other Jewish specific... (She made Jewish foods?</span> <span id="s107">We call it the gefilte fish.</span> <span id="s108">She made that?)</span> <span id="s109">Yeah.</span> <span id="s110">(She had the utensils.</span> <span id="s111">She could grind up the fish?)</span> <span id="s112">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s113">I remember usually on all big holidays under the window we have, how is this called, what is this called (a ledge), we haven't refrigerating at this time.</span> <span id="s114">And she put usually all this stuff under the window (so it would stay cool).</span> <span id="s115">Yes.</span> <span id="s116">This is a picture in my eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">(Every day she had to bring food home to eat so it wouldn't spoil?)</span> <span id="s118">Not every day, but often.</span> <span id="s119">We lived I don't know how in American it's called flea market, bazaar, because this is very fresh, and at this time it wasn't too expensive.</span> <span id="s120">And she sometimes would get things at the market.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">(So it sounds as if you weren't deprived of a healthy childhood.</span> <span id="s122">Were you sick often?)</span> <span id="s123">It's interesting.</span> <span id="s124">Now I understand that this childhood was with some difficulty, but I never felt this.</span> <span id="s125">I grew up how usual children do.</span> <span id="s126">I went to sports.</span> <span id="s127">I studied in school the same as other people from families who had books.</span> <span id="s128">This is something strange, I don't know.</span> <span id="s129">But I had interest and began to read very early.</span> <span id="s130">In my house there never were books, but somebody gave them to me.</span> <span id="s131">My interest grew up maybe under the influence from somebody on the outside, I don't know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">(Your friends people who like to read books?</span> <span id="s133">I see you're a serious reader.</span> <span id="s134">You have Nabokov in Russian, and we read Nabokov in English here.)</span> <span id="s135">No, Nabokov had two periods.</span> <span id="s136">The first period he wrote all his books in Russian.</span> <span id="s137">After he came here he wrote in English.</span> <span id="s138">But he translated all of it himself into Russian from English.</span> <span id="s139">(So you're telling me that someone influenced you early on to be interested in books, to learn to read, and it wasn't so much your mother, because your mother was working at what we call subsistence level, barely survival level, barely able to feed the two of you, and so this is a remarkable story.</span> <span id="s140">Did you stay healthy living in this damp basement, or were you sick sometimes?)</span> <span id="s141">I think I was sick how usual kids are.</span> <span id="s142">Not more, not less.</span> <span id="s143">I don't know how in this country, but in this time in my country, all kids have certain kinds of childhood sicknesses five, six, seven.</span> <span id="s144">And all kids, maybe a little more, a little less.</span> <span id="s145">And I had no more, no less.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">(Were your friends Jewish?)</span> <span id="s147">In my childhood?</span> <span id="s148">(Yes.)</span> <span id="s149">It was a big mix.</span> <span id="s150">Do you understand, some Jews born in certain Jewish mentality.</span> <span id="s151">In this mentality you can see in the face, in the customs.</span> <span id="s152">This is not easy to understand.</span> <span id="s153">(You're not telling me there's a Jewish stereotype?)</span> <span id="s154">No.</span> <span id="s155">There's some kind of Jews who are born, and they receive maybe from birth, and maybe from surroundings, they receive some Russian mentality.</span> <span id="s156">And they don't look like real Jews in understanding around people.</span> <span id="s157">These kind of people had less conflict with their surroundings.</span> <span id="s158">(They fit in with the others.)</span> <span id="s159">Yeah.</span> <span id="s160">Because I know that in my class there were maybe three, four Jews.</span> <span id="s161">But in my class there weren't antisemitic relations.</span> <span id="s162">On the whole, basically.</span> <span id="s163">Sometimes, yes, but on the whole, I had happiness in this case.</span> <span id="s164">This really depends on parents.</span> <span id="s165">If parents have antisemitic feelings, they go to their kids, and their kids do the same way.</span> <span id="s166">My sisterinlaw, she received a portion of this kind of relation.</span> <span id="s167">But I had another way.</span> <span id="s168">I had a lot of friends who were Jews and Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">(I remember Rita telling me her sister had suffered from antisemitism.)</span> <span id="s170">Yes.</span> <span id="s171">But do you understand?</span> <span id="s172">Her sister was very certain kind of exactly Jewish sterotype.</span> <span id="s173">Not only face, but in some understanding.</span> <span id="s174">(Something about her you could identify as Jewish, her looks, but something about her behavior...) No, it's not only a matter of looks, but of behavior.</span> <span id="s175">This is not exactly Jewish, but in the understanding of people around, they have a complex about bad things that Jewish people had.</span> <span id="s176">(It wasn't just because she looked Jewish, but because people identifed her as Jewish, and they had these bad feelings, and she became a target?</span> <span id="s177">She became the victim?)</span> <span id="s178">She became a victim, but her behavior was a little bit, how to explain... (Did she provoke them?)</span> <span id="s179">Yeah.</span> <span id="s180">(How did she provoke them?)</span> <span id="s181">I can't explain.</span> <span id="s182">This is very psychological thing.</span> <span id="s183">She didn't like company.</span> <span id="s184">She didn't like to share.</span> <span id="s185">We have different kinds of psychology.</span> <span id="s186">She was very close to her parents.</span> <span id="s187">(She was a little bit...) Selfish.</span> <span id="s188">(Spoiled by her parents?)</span> <span id="s189">No.</span> <span id="s190">I mean, she wasn't very kind, wasn't very open.</span> <span id="s191">(She was shy.</span> <span id="s192">She was bashful.</span> <span id="s193">She was timid.)</span> <span id="s194">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s195">(So they saw her as a victim.)</span> <span id="s196">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">(And in your case, you were obviously outgoing and you participated in sports, so you were one of the guys?)</span> <span id="s198">Yes.</span> <span id="s199">(When did you realize you were Jewish?)</span> <span id="s200">[laughs] I know my mother is exactly Jewish and she... Maybe in the street when I first heard the word do you know the Russian word zhid?</span> <span id="s201">(Yes.)</span> <span id="s202">When I heard somebody call me.</span> <span id="s203">But in my life, it's not often.</span> <span id="s204">Maybe my life is a bad example for this, but I didn't hear this often, but sometimes I did.</span> <span id="s205">(So when you heard that word, was it against you, or was it against someone else?)</span> <span id="s206">Against me.</span> <span id="s207">I heard this word very often in my whole life; when I became older and had a lot of trips through the USSR.</span> <span id="s208">It was maybe most towns in the USSR because my work was specifically with my sports.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">(So in childhood, it didn't make a lot of difference that you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s210">You didn't feel apart from the others.)</span> <span id="s211">Not exactly.</span> <span id="s212">Sometimes somebody would give me the understanding that I am Jewish, and I never forget about this.</span> <span id="s213">But in my case, this was a little bit easier in comparison with other Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s214">I grew up between the years... Do you know in old Odessa people, house build up letter "P" and they all have yard between them.</span> <span id="s215">And people who live in one yard, they know each other very good.</span> <span id="s216">They live together.</span> <span id="s217">They visit each other.</span> <span id="s218">It's peacful, a mix.</span> <span id="s219">And when you grow up in this world, you begin the same, a little bit.</span> <span id="s220">You can't refuse any kind of influence from the outside.</span> <span id="s221">And I have some conflict about this.</span> <span id="s222">But it's not regular.</span> <span id="s223">It sometimes happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">(You're an unusual person, because you're a thinking person, and you're a person who reads deep things, and yet, at the same time, you could be one of the same guys.)</span> <span id="s225">This is not so unusual in Russia.</span> <span id="s226">In Russia... This is very difficult, how many percent Jewish people or nonJewish people.</span> <span id="s227">A lot of people begin to read very early.</span> <span id="s228">It's not unusual, I don't think.</span> <span id="s229">(Still, when did you take up the sport of boxing?)</span> <span id="s230">Maybe 1963.</span> <span id="s231">(So you were thirteen years old.</span> <span id="s232">By this time were you still living in the basement?)</span> <span id="s233">We were living in the basement before my marriage.</span> <span id="s234">(You remained there until you got married?)</span> <span id="s235">Yes.</span> <span id="s236">(Was it still a wet place...) Yes.</span> <span id="s237">Because my mother received a new flat, in this moment when I was in the mountains.</span> <span id="s238">Rita was not my wife, she was my fiance.</span> <span id="s239">And she came to my mother to see her.</span> <span id="s240">She saw that my mother take some clothes, no furniture, because everything was so bad that there was nothing to take.</span> <span id="s241">And this was in 1978, three months before our marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">(Let's go back to age 13.</span> <span id="s243">What made you choose boxing?)</span> <span id="s244">In Odessa it was very popular.</span> <span id="s245">Before boxing I went to the pool.</span> <span id="s246">Sport in Russia in this time was very easy.</span> <span id="s247">Without any money, if you have some potential, they will go for you any teacher, because they need good sportsmen.</span> <span id="s248">And eventually they give the possibility to become student, because without sport for me it was impossible.</span> <span id="s249">(So because you were a good athelete, you got some scholarships?)</span> <span id="s250">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">It was some different way for Jews to go to the institute.</span> <span id="s252">To receive education, there were some ways.</span> <span id="s253">The first way is for very talented kids.</span> <span id="s254">But besides talent, you have something more.</span> <span id="s255">In Russian this is called svjazy.</span> <span id="s256">Good relations, somebody who has power.</span> <span id="s257">(Connections.)</span> <span id="s258">Yes.</span> <span id="s259">This is one way.</span> <span id="s260">You should call it "talented plus connections", because only talented, this is very difficult, because every institute has 2% or 3% Jews.</span> <span id="s261">In this 2% are people who have connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">(Now in Odessa the population of Jews to nonJews was much higher than 2%, wasn't it?)</span> <span id="s263">Yeah.</span> <span id="s264">(What was the percentage?)</span> <span id="s265">I can't count it.</span> <span id="s266">No less than 15%, because Odessa was one of the most Jewish towns in the USSR.</span> <span id="s267">(So you were in contests and did well in boxing.</span> <span id="s268">That was your major sport?)</span> <span id="s269">Yeah.</span> <span id="s270">After this I changed.</span> <span id="s271">I was champion of USSR between students.</span> <span id="s272">(In boxing.)</span> <span id="s273">This was my last, before I finished.</span> <span id="s274">(You were the USSR Student Champion of Boxing.)</span> <span id="s275">Yes.</span> <span id="s276">(That's a major thing!)</span> <span id="s277">I know.</span> <span id="s278">(So you competed only with other Russian students?)</span> <span id="s279">All students in the USSR.</span> <span id="s280">But this was when I came to the institute and maybe in my second year of institute.</span> <span id="s281">(So you were eighteen, nineteen years old?)</span> <span id="s282">No, twentytwo.</span> <span id="s283">It was 1972.</span> <span id="s284">I became a student in 1971.</span> <span id="s285">(1971?</span> <span id="s286">You were twentyone?</span> <span id="s287">What happened from the time you finished high school?)</span> <span id="s288">I didn't go how people usually do after eight grades.</span> <span id="s289">After eight, you go to ninth and receieve a complete education in the school, like high school in America.</span> <span id="s290">I had to go to work after eighth grade.</span> <span id="s291">And I went to work, but not successfully.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">(What kind of work did you try?)</span> <span id="s293">I worked in a factory.</span> <span id="s294">(What kind?)</span> <span id="s295">Build machine factory.</span> <span id="s296">This was hard work.</span> <span id="s297">(How old were you?)</span> <span id="s298">Fifteen.</span> <span id="s299">This work was with the heavy parts of metal.</span> <span id="s300">By the way, this was my first work with big antisemitism, because I worked between very lowlevel people.</span> <span id="s301">Some of them had been in prison.</span> <span id="s302">I did have some difficulties and problems, but most of all, it wasn't my field.</span> <span id="s303">I never had success in this field.</span> <span id="s304">I never liked the machines.</span> <span id="s305">(Was it noisy?)</span> <span id="s306">Noisy, but it was completely not my field.</span> <span id="s307">(Was it like assembly line work?)</span> <span id="s308">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s309">But it wasn't a line, because in Russia, only in big factories are there lines.</span> <span id="s310">We have some teams... Sometimes it required some competition because it's not too easy.</span> <span id="s311">But I didn't like this and didn't have any success, and after two years I changed my work.</span> <span id="s312">More easy work.</span> <span id="s313">I went to the seaport.</span> <span id="s314">In Russia, sport clubs have differences for people who work on the sea, this is one club, and I trained in this sport club, and they gave me the possibility to work in the seaport.</span> <span id="s315">This was easy work less money, but I can have good training and a lot of free time.</span> <span id="s316">This was for me some rest.</span> <span id="s317">Two years I worked in the factory, and two years in the seaport.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">(Can you describe what you were doing there?)</span> <span id="s319">We made a plan for the port.</span> <span id="s320">The port has a different way for ships when they came from the ocean, from different countries.</span> <span id="s321">We had a special machine for deepest, how do you call it... [depth finder], maybe ten meters, fifteen meters.</span> <span id="s322">We made measurements of all this port and after this we made a special map for this.</span> <span id="s323">(So how did you do that?</span> <span id="s324">You went out in boats and dropped lines?)</span> <span id="s325">Yeah.</span> <span id="s326">At first we went out on boats.</span> <span id="s327">It was a more interesting job.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">(There did you experience any antisemitism?)</span> <span id="s329">No.</span> <span id="s330">My first big experience was in childhood, but not hard.</span> <span id="s331">But in my first job when I should work between the people who are completely Russian.</span> <span id="s332">(How old were these people?)</span> <span id="s333">Very different from twenty to sixty.</span> <span id="s334">(So you were the baby?)</span> <span id="s335">Yeah.</span> <span id="s336">I was the baby.</span> <span id="s337">I want to say that I made some mistakes, too.</span> <span id="s338">Because, you know, when you're very young and you receive some more knowledge than they, and sometimes you correct somebody.</span> <span id="s339">People don't like this.</span> <span id="s340">(So maybe you stepped over the line where you can get away with something...) Sometimes I give them understanding (that you're smarter...) Yeah.</span> <span id="s341">Sometimes, not often, because I haven't experience with psychology, with people, with relations, and all young people have this.</span> <span id="s342">When they grow up, you want to show yourself older than usually.</span> <span id="s343">Sometimes I provoked them.</span> <span id="s344">There were some fights between me and ... (Fist fighting?)</span> <span id="s345">Yes.</span> <span id="s346">(One against one?)</span> <span id="s347">Usually.</span> <span id="s348">Fortunately.</span> <span id="s349">(How did you do?)</span> <span id="s350">Somebody helped us.</span> <span id="s351">Eventually it was peaceful.</span> <span id="s352">(So they broke it up before it became serious?)</span> <span id="s353">Yes.</span> <span id="s354">(You said it was antisemitic, though, and at the same time you're telling me that you provoked it by being a little too smart?)</span> <span id="s355">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s356">These are two parts that go together.</span> <span id="s357">When you didn't give somebody a reason, you're antisemitic, but if you're antisemitic, you should have some reason, Jews, that's all.</span> <span id="s358">And they're at all times trying to find this.</span> <span id="s359">Sometimes we give them this provocation.</span> <span id="s360">But most times they find it themselves, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">(So after awhile things calmed down and you were able to work there, and you just didn't like the work itself, or did the antisemitism remain a problem?)</span> <span id="s362">It's like appearance and disappearance.</span> <span id="s363">People at all times feel something negative.</span> <span id="s364">When they felt good, we went together and drank vodka.</span> <span id="s365">First thing they taught me was to drink vodka, and you couldn't refuse, because you lived with them together.</span> <span id="s366">If you refused, you provoked them further.</span> <span id="s367">"You don't like us!"</span> <span id="s368">You understand this?</span> <span id="s369">And I drank with them.</span> <span id="s370">They taught me and I was a good student in this case.</span> <span id="s371">(So in other words, sometimes it was bad, at other times it was Okay and you were one of the guys again.)</span> <span id="s372">No, but systematically, they give me the understanding that I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s373">In this group.</span> <span id="s374">When I change my surroundings a little bit...</span></p> <p><span id="s375">(How many fights did you actually have while you were working at that factory?)</span> <span id="s376">Five, seven.</span> <span id="s377">Not too much.</span> <span id="s378">(With different people each time?)</span> <span id="s379">Yes.</span> <span id="s380">Different people.</span> <span id="s381">But one of them was two.</span> <span id="s382">He hated me very much.</span> <span id="s383">He was after prison, and maybe he...</span></p> <p><span id="s384">(You worked at the seaport.</span> <span id="s385">That was better, but you decided to go back to school.)</span> <span id="s386">No, I continued my education in the Russian system of evening education.</span> <span id="s387">In the beginning of the '60s, this was, by the way, a very good way for Jews, because something changed in the system of education, and people who went to the institute after having two or three years work experience they could get education easily.</span> <span id="s388">And a lot of Jews come from school, go to work, at first.</span> <span id="s389">First they go this way.</span> <span id="s390">But after three, four, five years, this is all changing in Russia.</span> <span id="s391">Eventually that change goes down.</span> <span id="s392">(You're saying that change didn't last?)</span> <span id="s393">Yeah.</span> <span id="s394">When I went to the evening school, there's a lot of changes and it's not....</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Before, this was a very good education in evening school.</span> <span id="s396">But when I came to the evening school, I can receive good education, because the teacher was very good.</span> <span id="s397">Usually students didn't go to the class.</span> <span id="s398">Usually there were five, six persons per class.</span> <span id="s399">Twenty people in the class, but usually, average number of students was six, seven.</span> <span id="s400">And if I want, I could receive highest education.</span> <span id="s401">But unfortunately I was too young and had too hard a training in sport club, and I didn't go to school regularly, and unfortunately, I didn't have any success in the evening school.</span> <span id="s402">But some level I received.</span> <span id="s403">And I hoped that I could use this level for continued education.</span> <span id="s404">But for Jews, this wasn't enough, because Jews usually prepare years after the continued education maybe twice more.</span> <span id="s405">The system was that Jews should prepare twice better.</span> <span id="s406">(Twice as well as the others.)</span> <span id="s407">Yes.</span> <span id="s408">(And you didn't do that.)</span> <span id="s409">I didn't do that, because I was young.</span> <span id="s410">My mother worked.</span> <span id="s411">We hadn't usual relations how you have in a usual family.</span> <span id="s412">I was very free.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">(Your mother trusted that you knew what you were doing.)</span> <span id="s414">Maybe she had another way, because she was so busy, so tired.</span> <span id="s415">(Was she cheerful, or was she sad all the time?)</span> <span id="s416">Interesting question.</span> <span id="s417">(She had to visit your father in the hospital until 1969, so...) We shared.</span> <span id="s418">One week I went, one week she went.</span> <span id="s419">Fifteen years maybe from first grade I begin to without her.</span> <span id="s420">(When you went to your father, did he talk with you?</span> <span id="s421">He tried to guide you somewhat?)</span> <span id="s422">He talked with me.</span> <span id="s423">But his condition was very changeable, and once he talks, and once he doesn't understand anything.</span> <span id="s424">(But was he able to understand what was going on in your life?</span> <span id="s425">Did you tell him about your work in the factory, etc.) Yeah.</span> <span id="s426">But, you understand, he had a certain condition.</span> <span id="s427">It was very changeable.</span> <span id="s428">(So his emotional condition was not stable.)</span> <span id="s429">Not emotional, his understanding condition.</span> <span id="s430">(His mind was failing.)</span> <span id="s431">Yes.</span> <span id="s432">(Was that from the medicines they gave him, or what?)</span> <span id="s433">This kind of sickness, I think in Russia, couldn't, not only in Russia, but in the world, too.</span> <span id="s434">(What would you call it?)</span> <span id="s435">Schizophrenia.</span> <span id="s436">But this is not the right word.</span> <span id="s437">(But he had a mental illness.</span> <span id="s438">That's what we would call that.)</span> <span id="s439">Yeah.</span> <span id="s440">I think that in the world is this sickness.</span> <span id="s441">(And it came on in the later years of his life?)</span> <span id="s442">In 1955.</span> <span id="s443">(He was thirtyfive years old.)</span> <span id="s444">Yeah.</span> <span id="s445">And when we spoke with some doctors, they said that maybe he had problems with job.</span> <span id="s446">He had problems with his job before I was born, and after.</span> <span id="s447">(What do you mean?)</span> <span id="s448">He had some conflict with his boss.</span> <span id="s449">I remember two reasons, when we spoke with the doctors some from the past, and some from present job.</span> <span id="s450">(Something about how he was treated by the boss there made it worse?)</span> <span id="s451">Yes.</span> <span id="s452">(The chief was not understanding of him.)</span> <span id="s453">You know, some conflicts it's very difficult to understand who is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">(How did you get into the Insitute of Food Technology?)</span> <span id="s455">It's very interesting, a full adventure.</span> <span id="s456">This institute had a very big boss of this kind of sport.</span> <span id="s457">He collected every good kid for this institute.</span> <span id="s458">Maybe in America it's the same way at a university that has a good team... He proposed this to me and some of my friends.</span> <span id="s459">I tried twice.</span> <span id="s460">The first year he helped us, but not enough.</span> <span id="s461">The difficulty was that I'm Jewish, and I'm not enough prepared.</span> <span id="s462">Maybe if I was not Jewish, it was enough.</span> <span id="s463">But these two factors were too much for one person.</span> <span id="s464">And the first year his help was not enough.</span> <span id="s465">And the next year I went to another town, received a proposal from Kiev, but he met me and gave me a guarantee, and this year it was Okay, and I became a student.</span> <span id="s466">(What year was that?)</span> <span id="s467">This was at age twenty, twenty one.</span> <span id="s468">1971.</span> <span id="s469">(So you started school and your sport...) I started school and continued my sport.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">(So it was the same kind of competition anyway?)</span> <span id="s471">Yeah, not that I began from the beginning.</span> <span id="s472">(I understand that, but at the institute, don't they have a special coach for you there?)</span> <span id="s473">No, a little bit.</span> <span id="s474">(Where were you getting your coaching?</span> <span id="s475">Where were you training?)</span> <span id="s476">In different clubs, not exactly in one.</span> <span id="s477">Because we have a lot of training outside, in another town, with the team of the Republic, with the team of the USSR.</span> <span id="s478">A lot of different training.</span> <span id="s479">(The institute doesn't have its own gymnasium?)</span> <span id="s480">Yeah.</span> <span id="s481">(Was there someone to train you there also?)</span> <span id="s482">Yeah, but this is the man who helped us.</span> <span id="s483">On the whole he was more a manager than a trainer.</span> <span id="s484">(So he arranged boxing tours?)</span> <span id="s485">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">(So where did you go?)</span> <span id="s487">All towns.</span> <span id="s488">[laughs] I began to travel in 1966, at age sixteen.</span> <span id="s489">(While you were still at the factory...) All ages in sports share.</span> <span id="s490">Young and junior.</span> <span id="s491">For junior, anybody have any interest, and I was for myself.</span> <span id="s492">Only if I receive a big result when I'm a junior, I may receive some scholarship.</span> <span id="s493">But while a junior I didn't receive any big results.</span> <span id="s494">(But you were still a pretty good boxer.</span> <span id="s495">Maybe one of the reasons they wanted to fight with you was to see how they were with you?)</span> <span id="s496">No, no.</span> <span id="s497">In the street there are other rules than in the ring.</span> <span id="s498">Completely opposite.</span> <span id="s499">I was a very specific boxer, always with head.</span> <span id="s500">Some sportsmen have a big force, and some only for reaction, for understanding, not good fighting, really.</span> <span id="s501">But I had some good feeling.</span> <span id="s502">(You had a strategy.)</span> <span id="s503">Yeah.</span> <span id="s504">This was some of my personality in sports.</span> <span id="s505">In the street it's completely unhealthy, my strategy, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">(So you started travelling at the age of 16.</span> <span id="s507">Where did you go?)</span> <span id="s508">Most towns in the USSR: Moscow, Kiev, Leningrad, Riga, Talinn, Krasnoyarsk anywhere.</span> <span id="s509">(Were you learning things from travelling?</span> <span id="s510">Were you getting a better idea of life in the Soviet Union because of your travels?)</span> <span id="s511">No, we grew up in a certain system, and this system from birth is trying to keep us inside.</span> <span id="s512">Only maybe in 1974, some new books, some new people, I received some new ideas about... Too late.</span> <span id="s513">My understanding about the socialist system came to me very late.</span> <span id="s514">I don't know why, because my first friend who went from Russia to America this was in 1972 this is one of the first to emigrate from Russia.</span> <span id="s515">This is called the "first wave" of emigration.</span> <span id="s516">I didn't understand this.</span> <span id="s517">(It puzzled you that someone would want to emigrate.)</span> <span id="s518">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">(Because you felt that you were part of a good system.)</span> <span id="s520">No, I saw a lot of things that I didn't agree with.</span> <span id="s521">And this guy, my friend, he told me that after two, three, five years, eventually you become to this understanding.</span> <span id="s522">(Was this a Jewish friend?)</span> <span id="s523">Yes.</span> <span id="s524">A very talented mathemetician.</span> <span id="s525">I remember now, he may be a highlevel scientist because he was very talented.</span> <span id="s526">By the way, I think now he tried to get into Moscow University.</span> <span id="s527">He went through all the exams, and they stopped it here.</span> <span id="s528">(They wouldn't allow him.)</span> <span id="s529">Yes.</span> <span id="s530">And he went to Novosibirsk, an academic town, and he received there a very interesting education.</span> <span id="s531">He didn't finish, because his family was going to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">I, only very late, understood where I lived.</span> <span id="s533">Very late.</span> <span id="s534">In Tashkent I met very interesting people, most of whom are now in Israel.</span> <span id="s535">One of them was my sponsor when I arrived in Chicago.</span> <span id="s536">Many people know about him because he organized a big company for helping Irina Ratushinskaya.</span> <span id="s537">He was her big friend.</span> <span id="s538">And he arrived and after half a year somebody told him that she was in prison, and he organized a big complaint.</span> <span id="s539">One of these friends in Tashkent who very influenced me about Russian system, not Russian, the Soviet system.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">(Although you're seeing places and meeting people, it hasn't dawned on you that you're going to turn against this system altogether, that you're not going to be content here.</span> <span id="s541">By the time you won the student medal, what was your thinking then?</span> <span id="s542">This is 1972, right?</span> <span id="s543">That has to be a special kind of experience.</span> <span id="s544">Had you already changed your thinking about socialism?</span> <span id="s545">What has happened?)</span> <span id="s546">No, about socialism, my understanding changed a little bit later, when I began to be introduced to people with more knowledge.</span> <span id="s547">Do you know that between people in Russia there's a lot of fear?</span> <span id="s548">And people who know a lot about the Soviet socialist system never speak with you openly, because this is very dangerous, because any Soviet person could call the KGB and so forth.</span> <span id="s549">This is not easy to meet people who introduce you with something opposite than you usually saw around.</span> <span id="s550">But I changed my sport.</span> <span id="s551">I began climbing after boxing.</span> <span id="s552">Boxing wasn't enough for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">(Once you got the championship...) I became a champion and turned to opposite side and go into climbing.</span> <span id="s554">(Mountain climbing?)</span> <span id="s555">Yeah.</span> <span id="s556">And for five years I spent time in the mountains.</span> <span id="s557">I worked in the mountains.</span> <span id="s558">And once I met some very interesting people from Leningrad, very intellectual people.</span> <span id="s559">Our meeting in the mountains and our friendship gave the possibility of them to share their knowledge about books, about people.</span> <span id="s560">This was the beginning.</span> <span id="s561">And after this, my next step was when I met the people in Tashkent.</span> <span id="s562">This is a big Jewish colony.</span> <span id="s563">This is second and last in my growing about social systems.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">* * * * * JCC Women's Auxiliary Oral History Project Second Interview with Alex Blinstein DATE: March 19, 1991</span></p> <p><span id="s565">INTERVIEWER: Elaine Snyderman (When we left off last time, Alex was going to tell me how he became interested in philosophy, and it came about through a friend he met mountain climbing.)</span> <span id="s566">Yeah, it's right.</span> <span id="s567">(You went on this trip for the first time with a group of students?)</span> <span id="s568">No, this is a little bit a different case.</span> <span id="s569">I came to the mountain camp and after this we were invited to the tour camp.</span> <span id="s570">This is a little different because in the mountain climbing camp there are only climbers, and in the tour camp this is usually people who are not only climbing, but walking and looking.</span> <span id="s571">In this camp there were a lot of instructors from different towns, from Leningrad.</span> <span id="s572">(So tourists came to this camp?)</span> <span id="s573">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">But the instructors were interesting people who a little bit opened my eyes about the Soviet system, about political questions.</span> <span id="s575">Because before, I understood that there was something wrong, but I was not sure what was wrong.</span> <span id="s576">And these people who have big life experience and knowledge about the political system, they first opened my eyes, my mind about this, and from this moment to I began to have more deeper interest in the Soviet system.</span> <span id="s577">I began to find some books which usually ordinary people can't find.</span> <span id="s578">It was sort of risky because a lot of people received prison sentences for having these books.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">(How old were you?)</span> <span id="s580">I was twentythree, twentyfour.</span> <span id="s581">It's enough, because usually people in Russia came to an understanding of the system more quickly and earlier, but maybe unfortunately, or maybe not, maybe it's good because when you don't understand exactly what's happening in the country where you live maybe it's better because maybe then you'll understand more deeply what a crazy system your life is in... (Is this about 1974?)</span> <span id="s582">1975.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">(Who are these instructors?)</span> <span id="s584">One of them was a teacher from Leningrad University.</span> <span id="s585">I don't remember his name because this is... (What did he teach?)</span> <span id="s586">This is not exactly teaching because I was educated enough for discussing, for conversation.</span> <span id="s587">A lot of books I was reading.</span> <span id="s588">When we first met each other we spent maybe six, seven... This is a Russian custom, maybe Americans won't understand this, but people introduce each other and they sit down and talk maybe six, seven hours.</span> <span id="s589">(Do you have a meal or drink together?)</span> <span id="s590">Small meal, drink, conversation.</span> <span id="s591">This is a very usual Russian custom.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">(Tea or vodka?)</span> <span id="s593">It doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s594">I think not a lot of drink.</span> <span id="s595">(So your heads were clear while you were drinking?)</span> <span id="s596">[laughs] Usually it's... it's not so important.</span> <span id="s597">After this guy, another guy came from Leningrad too.</span> <span id="s598">One of them was a film producer and very interesting.</span> <span id="s599">He spent a lot of time abroad.</span> <span id="s600">For me this is all in one month.</span> <span id="s601">I graduated institute, and after institute I came to the climbing camp for a month.</span> <span id="s602">And two months I spent working in this camp.</span> <span id="s603">(Working?)</span> <span id="s604">Yes, actually working because the chairman of this tourist camp very much appreciated people from the climbing camp and so they would employ them and pay them not a big salary because we have food and a room.</span> <span id="s605">But this was a very good job for me.</span> <span id="s606">In the beginning I wanted to continue this work.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">But unfortunately there was another side to this work.</span> <span id="s608">In certain places it's Kabarda, Kabardins [a people inhabiting the CaucasusSK], and there's no good relations between Kabardins and the people all around.</span> <span id="s609">Because during Stalin's time people were captured and brought to another side of the country... Do you know that during and after the Second World War Stalin took a lot of nations and put them from one place to another place?</span> <span id="s610">This is Tatar, not Kabardins.</span> <span id="s611">This is a republic of two nations Kabardins and Bulkartsy.</span> <span id="s612">Bulkartsy were captured and taken to another place, and only many years ago they could come back.</span> <span id="s613">They hate all Russians.</span> <span id="s614">And in this atmosphere it's very difficult to survive.</span> <span id="s615">I decided it's better to go home and try to use my diploma.</span> <span id="s616">But this summer in this camp gave me a lot of things, and played a big role in my understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">(Was part of it what you were reading?)</span> <span id="s618">Before I read a lot, but not this kind of book because you can't find it unless you're trying to find them, because they did not lie in the store.</span> <span id="s619">In the store, by the way, any kind of good book is not there, because in Russia good books are always popular and all people try and get them.</span> <span id="s620">But after this... (Give me a name of a book, or an author or two...) I began Solzhenitsyn, First Circle, I began some philosophy, Nietzsche, Freud.</span> <span id="s621">Some were members of the Communist Party who survived the War and went abroad, and after this wrote memoirs about growing up in the Communist Party from the beginning of the century to 1930.</span> <span id="s622">It was very interesting, because it was the first information about the Party.</span> <span id="s623">This was a very strong book.</span> <span id="s624">I can't remember his name... (When you think of it, tell me...) After this summer I returned to Odessa and for a long time I couldn't find a job, because in Odessa at this time a lot of people went to America, to Israel.</span> <span id="s625">All the bosses of factories or any kind of organization see from the Bureau of the Communist Party receive scandal for every Jew who went to Israel or America.</span> <span id="s626">And eventually it was very difficult to find a job, not because I am exactly a Jew, but they are afraid to take me because they don't know he takes me and after twothree months I should go.</span> <span id="s627">And maybe six months I was without a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Eventually, I had a very good job, and I worked twelve years in a big design institute.</span> <span id="s629">In this institute I receive a lot of information because this was people with high level education, and a lot of them were very interesting and I had very good relations at this institute.</span> <span id="s630">These twelve years... a lot of people, fifty, sixty percent were Jews in this design institute.</span> <span id="s631">This is sometimes the usual picture in a town like Odessa.</span> <span id="s632">In a design institute there will be a lot of Jews because they usually try and receive a good education.</span> <span id="s633">They don't try to go to some factory plant.</span> <span id="s634">They usually try this.</span> <span id="s635">Most of them eventually became very professional guys and had highlevel professional skills.</span> <span id="s636">A lot of them are here now and found good jobs too.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">(So you thought you were in a good place?)</span> <span id="s638">Yes, with my history, for me, because it matters that I went to this institute too, that I was going to the department that needed a young man without a family who could move to any town for information about designing.</span> <span id="s639">This is only one of many and they take me.</span> <span id="s640">This is not the first time, this is three months before they decide to take me or not.</span> <span id="s641">And eventually they take me and I grow up with regard to salary and position.</span> <span id="s642">Eventually I went from Odessa in one of the high positions in this institute...</span></p> <p><span id="s643">(You remained there a long time?)</span> <span id="s644">Twelve years.</span> <span id="s645">My wife worked there fourteen years.</span> <span id="s646">She came after high school and she studied in the evening class in the institute.</span> <span id="s647">I came after institute because I had the possibility to have the day class.</span> <span id="s648">In this institute a lot of people received information because the most important thing in the work between these people is a lot of information going between.</span> <span id="s649">Most of them hear the Voice of America and Radio Liberty, stations with more free information.</span> <span id="s650">On one of my trips, after half a year, I was in Tashkent and I was introduced to a group of people who became my very close friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">One of them met me here and was my sponsor.</span> <span id="s652">Yefim Godler.</span> <span id="s653">[?]</span> <span id="s654">Usually people know him because he is a very public person... (An activist?)</span> <span id="s655">Yes.</span> <span id="s656">(A dissident?)</span> <span id="s657">Yes.</span> <span id="s658">(So he made a name for himself in this country or after he came here?)</span> <span id="s659">No, after he came here he found out about his friend, the poet who received five years in prison... (Irina Ratushinskaya...) Yes.</span> <span id="s660">He organized a big committee to liberate her and maybe four or five years fought for this with Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.</span> <span id="s661">I met with him and his friend who now one year have gone to Israel.</span> <span id="s662">He's Jewish but a Russian poet.</span> <span id="s663">Igor Darsky.</span> <span id="s664">Igor and Misha Darsky, they're brothers.</span> <span id="s665">It was very interesting to meet them and I was very lucky to share with them a lot of time because maybe seven, eight times a year I was in Tashkent.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">(This was all tied in with your design work?</span> <span id="s667">It was the same company Rita worked for.)</span> <span id="s668">Yes.</span> <span id="s669">(Was this refrigeration?)</span> <span id="s670">Rita worked in the refrigeration department, and I worked for a place where they would build a factory, and a lot of things would be needed while they built this factory, trains, water, canals, energy, power supply.</span> <span id="s671">In America, maybe this is very difficult too, when some firm wants to build something, a lot of agreements have to be made with different governmental departments, environment protection inspection, like this.</span> <span id="s672">And after my trip I bring all materials to my institute and representatives from my department, we have a meeting and discuss what needs to be done, and decide how to build it.</span> <span id="s673">This is called "their information".</span> <span id="s674">Because when engineers should design something, from zero he designs, but from zero he needs a lot of information, plan maps, different kinds, a lot of agreements, maybe hundreds and hundreds, inspections.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">(So you helped to gather this material.)</span> <span id="s676">Yeah, I looked for this material and brought it to the institute and we discussed it.</span> <span id="s677">This isn't only one trip, this continues years and years, while they build this plant this continues too because a lot of information becomes old and we need new, so this is a big job.</span> <span id="s678">Because they all exist in Odessa, and the plant exists here, so all the time fresh information...</span></p> <p><span id="s679">(So while you're doing your job, you're really getting another education in the world you're meeting interesting people.</span> <span id="s680">You're traveling.</span> <span id="s681">You're still getting wise in the ways of the world...) Yeah, this is, by the way, by now it's difficult because twelve years, and one month in Odessa, and second month in ... this is a specific life with all the time in planes, trains, hotels.</span> <span id="s682">In Russia it's very difficult to get tickets.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">(And you're still living with your mother?)</span> <span id="s684">Maybe, just a moment, one and a half years.</span> <span id="s685">Then I met Rita and we got married.</span> <span id="s686">My mother at this moment when we got engaged, at this moment she received an apartment.</span> <span id="s687">She waited for this apartment twentyfive or thirty years.</span> <span id="s688">She received the apartment and we lived maybe twothree years together with my mother.</span> <span id="s689">When Rita became pregnant, it was too far from town, and we replaced the apartment of her parents.</span> <span id="s690">My mother remained... This is by the way very interesting that this apartment is not better than what she has now at "Grandma's House" on Broadway and ... This is subsidized here in Chicago.</span> <span id="s691">But the apartment she received in Russia was smaller, but was one room, second room, kitchen.</span> <span id="s692">This is not convenient.</span> <span id="s693">(So this is a step down for her?)</span> <span id="s694">I'm not saying it's a step down, but she doesn't like it... (Because it's an open floor plan rather than divided up...) These are some American differences.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">(Did she and Rita get along when they met?</span> <span id="s696">Were they comfortable with each other?)</span> <span id="s697">It's not an easy question.</span> <span id="s698">I don't think you could find the couple for whom it's easy with the relatives, you know this is life... Older people have some difficulties, and young people don't always understand this.</span> <span id="s699">In America maybe it's softer this conflict between... (I don't think so...) From the surface it looks more so, but I think it's human beings, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">(You said, and so did Rita, that when you first met each other you right away knew you were in love...) Exactly me.</span> <span id="s701">(She was engaged to be married...) Yeah, but there was some interruption and I met her.</span> <span id="s702">It was in November.</span> <span id="s703">I had a good relationship with her supervisor, and her supervisor, a woman, she told me... I explained my interest and she said that she's engaged.</span> <span id="s704">So I turned away.</span> <span id="s705">But after half a year, there was some holiday at a discotheque at this institute, and I remember this date, this is February 27, because from this day we decided the whole question.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">(So you were at what we would call an office party, and you were still interested in her.</span> <span id="s707">Had you conversed during your meetings on the job?)</span> <span id="s708">I wasn't often at work because I traveled so much.</span> <span id="s709">(So you saw something that you liked?)</span> <span id="s710">Yeah.</span> <span id="s711">It was maybe four months before this party, we had some conversations, but not serious ones.</span> <span id="s712">In Russian this is called perekur.</span> <span id="s713">[Smoke break].</span></p> <p><span id="s714">(What do you think it was that you liked about her?</span> <span id="s715">You hadn't had much contact, and you knew she was engaged?</span> <span id="s716">What was it?)</span> <span id="s717">She was very open and I feel that she is a very altruistic person, and I don't think in my life I've met such altruistic person.</span> <span id="s718">(So she was giving and kind...) She was by the way... [pictures]... after tenth class she came to work... Unfortunately I don't have enough English words to explain.</span> <span id="s719">She was friendly and open.</span> <span id="s720">I appreciate this kind of human openness and altruism.</span> <span id="s721">(So at this party were you dancing?)</span> <span id="s722">Yeah, something like this, and this evening I should go to the train and go to another town.</span> <span id="s723">(And something made you tell her how you felt about her?)</span> <span id="s724">How to explain... It was like falling in love this evening, we both know about it without any explanation.</span> <span id="s725">(She explained it the same way.)</span> <span id="s726">The same way?</span> <span id="s727">It's like a movie.</span> <span id="s728">A new film, one part she explains, and one part he explains, and they give opposite explanations of their life together.</span> <span id="s729">(This is different.</span> <span id="s730">It's such a romantic story, forgive me for invading your privacy...) After twelve years it's not privacy, because after twelve years there's a lot of bad and good.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">(She told me that it wasn't long after you got married that you had the idea to emigrate?)</span> <span id="s732">I have some ideas about emigration, first, when my very good friend, he now lives in Montreal, we were in Montreal last September... He had a very big influence on me... no, it was when we were married, no, before, I was influenced.</span> <span id="s733">But I remember exactly it was some anniversary of the climbing club, a big concert, some Russian bard, you know this?</span> <span id="s734">who plays his own songs, like Vysotsky who wrote the music and accompanied himself and sings.</span> <span id="s735">(You use the word "bard"?)</span> <span id="s736">Yes.</span> <span id="s737">(They're like folk singers...) Maybe this is more clear.</span> <span id="s738">I remember a big turnover of my feelings when I was in this singing and all the people I spent time with in the mountains, and I changed my mind.</span> <span id="s739">(So he was singing songs about...) It was the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s740">(So these aren't political songs....) No, no, this is about climbing, about friendship, about love.</span> <span id="s741">Because political songs are okay.</span> <span id="s742">Second, this was in 1979, I was married, and my very close friends began to think about going to Montreal.</span> <span id="s743">And we began preparing some documents, and exactly at this moment all the ways of going OVIR, the application for going, all this was broken for ten years, and only in 1987, at the end of 1987 and beginning of 1988 this was all restored and people received the possibility to emigrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">(Rita remembers that you couldn't get permission to leave from her grandfather...) Yeah, this was one of the dangerous things because Rita's grandfather was a Communist, he fought in the civil wars.</span> <span id="s745">(The Revolution?)</span> <span id="s746">I think after.</span> <span id="s747">Usually we don't exactly believe him because he was too old and the times were changing a lot through Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev.</span> <span id="s748">It's very difficult to believe these people, because one period changes their way of understanding for surviving.</span> <span id="s749">But he was an old Communist and had a personal pension, that's twice the usual pension sometimes it's five times more when you had a big position in the Party apparatus, but he wasn't in a high position, but he was very proud.</span> <span id="s750">I think it's because he took a very short view.</span> <span id="s751">He was too old.</span> <span id="s752">But it was one of the things we feared when we first went in.</span> <span id="s753">We thought that we wouldn't tell him and he wouldn't know about it, but eventually it was all interrupted.</span> <span id="s754">Only when Gorbachev opened this question, exactly in this moment, without any waiting, because we had the experience of waiting, exactly when it opened up we began.</span> <span id="s755">Of course we had waiting after we got our invitation because it took time to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">(Do you remember when you first heard about the Chernobyl nuclear disaster?)</span> <span id="s757">We knew about this.</span> <span id="s758">(How far is Odessa from that place?)</span> <span id="s759">It's too far but not enough for safety.</span> <span id="s760">I'm afraid for the looks in our kids maybe... Exactly on this day we were outside in nature with our friends.</span> <span id="s761">It was a very sunny day and unusually warm.</span> <span id="s762">Only after this I remembered this day.</span> <span id="s763">And now I fear maybe some... but I think that we weren't too serious to this because you always try to think better when things are worse.</span> <span id="s764">(You didn't want to worry about it....) Right.</span> <span id="s765">(But your children were very young, and that's probably the first thing parents think about...) We weren't too close to this.</span> <span id="s766">[look at map] It's very bad for Kiev.</span> <span id="s767">Kiev is very close.</span> <span id="s768">(What's the distance?)</span> <span id="s769">Between Kiev and Chernobyl is 100 miles.</span> <span id="s770">For us it's maybe 300400 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">(So there was no immediate danger?)</span> <span id="s772">No, no.</span> <span id="s773">We could speculate about this maybe.</span> <span id="s774">(So when you heard about it, was it first from the papers, or some other source?)</span> <span id="s775">I think that official information came maybe two days after this catastrophe.</span> <span id="s776">(In Odessa you heard it sooner than people who lived near the disaster...) No, I think after two days... (But the accident was on April 26, and people have said that on May Day they didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s777">There were all the outdoor things.</span> <span id="s778">So if you heard about it before May Day, either it was not official, or they told the people who lived further away that there was no danger...) I'm afraid to make a mistake because it's difficult now to restore exactly.</span> <span id="s779">In this time it's the beginning of the information revolution, and so many magazines, etc., every day this is like twice, four times more, every day.</span> <span id="s780">And this information is very difficult to remember.</span> <span id="s781">Because it was the first time of glasnos.</span> <span id="s782">By the way, every month changed about information.</span> <span id="s783">In the beginning they said one thing, next another.</span> <span id="s784">This is together (the trouble?</span> <span id="s785">mw) with glasnost.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">(Were you worried about the environment, such as the food you were getting?)</span> <span id="s787">We worried not about the environment at first, but about surviving.</span> <span id="s788">Because when it became glasnost, antiSemitism showed its face officially.</span> <span id="s789">(Officially?)</span> <span id="s790">Yeah, officially, because he who fights with antiSemitism, before you can't find information.</span> <span id="s791">AntiSemitism you could find, but fighting against it was very different.</span> <span id="s792">But now fighting about it, there is this source of information too.</span> <span id="s793">This grows very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">(What evidence was there of antiSemitism?)</span> <span id="s795">First of all, this is the beginning of Pamjat', and second, maybe the greatest source, was the Russian Union of Writers.</span> <span id="s796">Russian, because there's the Soviet Union of Writers.</span> <span id="s797">Because art has unions this is the idea of Stalin, that all people should organize because he understood that this role of art, of books, movies, is for the people, and that it should be under his control.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">In 1930 all the Union of Writers, Actors, Painters, all kinds of artists made unions.</span> <span id="s799">The Soviet Union of Writers come from different republics the Armenian Union, Ukrainian, etc.</span> <span id="s800">And the most antiSemitic became the Russian.</span> <span id="s801">And two magazines, Molodaya Gvardia [Young Guard], and Nash Sovremennik [Our Contemporary].</span> <span id="s802">These two magazines began publishing antiSemitic material, and at this moment I realize that this glasnost is going in very interesting directions.</span> <span id="s803">(So these magazines were publishing anti- Semitic statements?)</span> <span id="s804">Not only antiSemitic statements, but novels, big novels.</span> <span id="s805">Vasily Belov.</span> <span id="s806">I very much appreciated him before.</span> <span id="s807">He wrote one book, the first official antiSemitic book was published.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">(We read last year about a meeting of writers where the group of Pamjat' people broke in...) That's when we were still here.</span> <span id="s809">(What year was that?)</span> <span id="s810">I think it happened in 1988, maybe 1989.</span> <span id="s811">But after this happened, a lot of things, they killed a very interesting man, Aleksandr Mann'.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">He was a very famous priest.</span> <span id="s813">He was Jewish, but his mother was very close to Christianity.</span> <span id="s814">(He was born a Jew, but his mother was a Christian?)</span> <span id="s815">Yes, his mother was Jewish too, but he took the Christian religion.</span> <span id="s816">But he had a very interesting position an ecumenist, who wants to destroy walls between different kinds of Christianity, and between Christianity and Judaism too.</span> <span id="s817">He published a lot of interesting books abroad, before glasnost.</span> <span id="s818">And the KGB tried a lot of times to get him out of the country.</span> <span id="s819">(He published abroad?)</span> <span id="s820">Yes.</span> <span id="s821">He was, by the way, like a spirit father.</span> <span id="s822">If you go to the Christian church you have a spirit father... (You mean like a priest?)</span> <span id="s823">No.</span> <span id="s824">You believe God, and someone prays for you, like your father, he takes care of you for your spirit.</span> <span id="s825">(A spiritual father...) He was a very famous man because he was a spiritual father for Solzhenitsyn, for a lot of very high level people in the intelligentsia.</span> <span id="s826">(He inspired them and they came to him for guidance?)</span> <span id="s827">Yes.</span> <span id="s828">Not only Russians, but a lot of Jews came to him, writers, Russian poet Jews, Jew by birth but Russian poets.</span> <span id="s829">Most Jews wrote in Russian.</span> <span id="s830">You could appreciate Jewishness, but your readers are people who speak Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">(What happened to this man?)</span> <span id="s832">They killed him.</span> <span id="s833">(How?)</span> <span id="s834">They killed him very symbolically, this is a very old Russian style of killing.</span> <span id="s835">They break the wood... (An axe?)</span> <span id="s836">Yes, an axe, but there is more ritual.</span> <span id="s837">He didn't die exactly in this moment.</span> <span id="s838">He gets to his house and dies in the arms of his wife.</span> <span id="s839">Maybe oneandahalf years ago this happened.</span> <span id="s840">(Was this published in our press?)</span> <span id="s841">In the Chicago Tribune I've read a lot about him.</span> <span id="s842">We order the best Russian newspaper from Paris, New Russian Word from New York, and Russian Mind from Paris, and these give a lot of information about his life and his books.</span> <span id="s843">(How old was he?)</span> <span id="s844">Maybe fiftytwo.</span> <span id="s845">He now became very popular and to lecture on TV about Christianity, and this is one of the reasons they killed him.</span> <span id="s846">(You think it was Pamjat'?</span> <span id="s847">Yeah, but not only.</span> <span id="s848">KGB, the Party, they're together.</span> <span id="s849">I think this is all together.</span> <span id="s850">In Russia nothing could happen without this.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">(It's a little like Trotsky's death isn't it?)</span> <span id="s852">Trotsky was killed with an alpinist... you know, for climbing.</span> <span id="s853">You know he had a good guy around.</span> <span id="s854">And he came around and Trotsky believed him and they were going to walk to the mountains.</span> <span id="s855">This is basically the same, but a little of this ritualistic symbolism.</span> <span id="s856">A lot of famous people have asked Gorbachev about an investigation and he said Okay, but there's no investigation.</span> <span id="s857">And after this two or three guys were killed who published independent newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">(So when you were getting ready to leave, these were not issues for you because they took place later... Or you were just fearful because you knew that Pamjat' was active and there was going to be a certain amount of anarchy, was that it?)</span> <span id="s859">Yeah, at that moment I realized it's very dangerous to remain here with kids.</span> <span id="s860">I was right, because every day it was worse and worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">(Let's try to summarize some things... What was the worst time for you in Russia?)</span> <span id="s862">That's a very difficult question.</span> <span id="s863">Maybe before I came to the institute, maybe my childhood because when you have only mother, for boys this is not enough.</span> <span id="s864">Anybody couldn't help and show you and share some experience and give good advice at certain times, and I think I lost a lot of this before seventeen or twenty years old, because a lot of forces are going into survival not growing or intellectual things, but for surviving.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Only after this, a little bit later... In the Russian school system the first four years you have one teacher.</span> <span id="s866">And he or she teaches all subjects, and I had very bad luck and this teacher was antiSemitic.</span> <span id="s867">She completely didn't like me.</span> <span id="s868">She punished my day by day.</span> <span id="s869">I would stand behind the room until three, four, five o'clock.</span> <span id="s870">Every week she would call for my mother.</span> <span id="s871">In Russia the best mark is five.</span> <span id="s872">I have all times only ones or twos.</span> <span id="s873">When I came to the five class, and now I had good luck and a very intelligent literature and language teacher, and he was Jewish, and he gave me a lot of things and he saved me.</span> <span id="s874">Because maybe this continued the first four years, and my mother, only after four years understood what happened.</span> <span id="s875">After the first quarter she received a letter from the Board that your son is such a good student, because for four years she received only bad things.</span> <span id="s876">From age seven to age eleven.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">(So this teacher became your 'spiritual father' didn't he?)</span> <span id="s878">A little bit, but I was too young, and a lot of forces were going into surviving.</span> <span id="s879">I chopped the wood for the stove after school.</span> <span id="s880">We lived in the basement without anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">(What was the best time?)</span> <span id="s882">The best time was exactly the five years in the institute.</span> <span id="s883">This was freedom material freedom and intellectual freedom.</span> <span id="s884">Material because... I think American students couldn't be so happy because there are a lot of things around that he or she needs without any question.</span> <span id="s885">There were mountain trips, without money.</span> <span id="s886">Life without money, that's like life in Communism.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">(When you left home you took your pictures, what else did you take?</span> <span id="s888">Any things, books, family treasures?)</span> <span id="s889">Unfortunately, our baggage was so limited and our financial ability was small, so we should sell our big library because we needed money for tickets.</span> <span id="s890">We took our pictures from our life, and I took letters I had received.</span> <span id="s891">(Trophies from boxing?)</span> <span id="s892">No, because they so often changed apartments, four times we moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">(You didn't serve in the army did you?)</span> <span id="s894">In the Russian system if you're in the institute, you go to the army reserves and you receive Officer status.</span> <span id="s895">I have one picture from kindergarten.</span> <span id="s896">Then in the institute.</span> <span id="s897">(In the reserves did you feel you were treated like everyone else?)</span> <span id="s898">You come with everyone as a group from the institute, so it was Okay.</span> <span id="s899">It's like vacation.</span> <span id="s900">(The naval reserves?)</span> <span id="s901">Yeah, but it was more specific, chemistry naval.</span> <span id="s902">It was very easy.</span> <span id="s903">A very good place for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">(You came here.</span> <span id="s905">Did you have a hard time in your travels or did it go smoothly?)</span> <span id="s906">We had very good luck.</span> <span id="s907">In Vienna we had an unbelievable place.</span> <span id="s908">I don't know why, we lived in the center of the city in a very old family hotel.</span> <span id="s909">They built a museum of this family.</span> <span id="s910">We invited our friends.</span> <span id="s911">There were old rooms and old furniture.</span> <span id="s912">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s913">It's a wonderful memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">(During the hardships with Rita... did you mean in Russia or America?)</span> <span id="s915">Both places.</span> <span id="s916">(What were the disappointments when you came here?)</span> <span id="s917">In America I can be only disappointed with myself.</span> <span id="s918">I haven't enough professional skills.</span> <span id="s919">This is only one disappointment.</span> <span id="s920">In America it all depends on your skills, your education.</span> <span id="s921">My skill was very specific, I never prepared to go here.</span> <span id="s922">So my life here is a little stronger than people who... But I haven't any disappointments.</span> <span id="s923">(Are you in a position where you can get a better position here?)</span> <span id="s924">I can't use my skills here at all.</span> <span id="s925">It's interesting work, etc.</span> <span id="s926">A lot of work in America is specific work that you couldn't use in other countries.</span> <span id="s927">Unfortunately I'm forty with two kids, and it's not easy to change the profession.</span> <span id="s928">But maybe I go to some course and take something.</span> <span id="s929">But it is too late for me.</span> <span id="s930">This is not even a disappointment.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">(Are you working as an engineer?)</span> <span id="s932">No, Rita is working as a designer.</span> <span id="s933">I'm working as a lab technician.</span> <span id="s934">(So this is beneath your training, it doesn't challenge your abilities?)</span> <span id="s935">But I'm glad I can work and bring home a salary so far.</span> <span id="s936">But this is work, not too bad in relations with people.</span> <span id="s937">I have a good friend there.</span> <span id="s938">He now lives with my English teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">(With your difficulties, what has kept your family strong and together?</span> <span id="s940">I know in the USSR there's a high divorce rate?)</span> <span id="s941">I don't think the USSR has a higher level than in America.</span> <span id="s942">I think it's an unexplainable question, a thousand books have been written about marriage.</span> <span id="s943">I began to think that marriage is something unexplainable, it's like faith.</span> <span id="s944">You should believe or not believe.</span> <span id="s945">For Jews, I think it is that the family survives for the kids.</span> <span id="s946">If there's some conflict they go round it and forget about it.</span> <span id="s947">I think.</span> <span id="s948">But I can't explain because I think that family life
