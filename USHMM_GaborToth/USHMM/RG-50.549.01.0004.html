22, 1995PRIVATE</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: I would like to start with where you were born, and when, and what your name was at birth, and what your name is now?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Okay, that's easy enough.</span> <span id="s20">I was born in Czechoslovakia in 1937.</span> <span id="s21">My name was Renata Goodman, and today I'm Irene Hizme.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: You did not stay very long in the town that you born in, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Right.</span> <span id="s24">I guess about three or four years, and I have a twin brother by the name of Rene.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Where did you go after you left your birth town?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: We went with my mother to Razenstadt (ph).</span> <span id="s27">We were sent there and I think we were there -- I don't really recall how long, but in 1943 we were sent to Auschwitz from Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: I would like to go back just a little bit to clear -- you went to Prague first, and lived there for a little while, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s30">I think we lived in Prague.</span> <span id="s31">We were born in the outskirts of Prague in a place called Tetraslifkanov(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Could you give me a sense of your family a little bit?</span> <span id="s33">You mentioned a brother.</span> <span id="s34">Do you have other siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: No, but there was a father, and my mother and Rene and I and my memories are not very vivid, but we lived in an apartment, upstairs, because I remember because I used to watch the street and there was a trolley, and it had the number 22 on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Do you remember whether your brother and you were close?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s38">We were each other's friends, playmates.</span> <span id="s39">We always played together.</span> <span id="s40">I don't remember ever socializing with any other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Did you know that you were twins?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s43">Just that we belonged to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Do you recall your parents at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Not very clearly.</span> <span id="s46">I just recall moments of things we sometimes did together, and I remember we used to go to the park together with my dad and my mom.</span> <span id="s47">But my dad was -- one night there was a big commotion and some men came in and they took him away, and I just remember my mother was crying and we also were crying.</span> <span id="s48">It just was a terrible memory for me, and we never saw him again after that.</span> <span id="s49">My mother, I remember in particular, she used to play a game with us at night -- at least I'm the one that wanted to play this game.</span> <span id="s50">I wanted her to set us up, hand positions and to think that we could sleep that way the whole night.</span> <span id="s51">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: The memory of your father being taken away, was that the earliest memory that you now know had to do with the Nazi occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: I'm not sure if that's -- I don't think I knew it had to do with anything.</span> <span id="s54">To me life was the way it was.</span> <span id="s55">I always -- there was a feeling that my parents were not happy.</span> <span id="s56">There was something going on, but of course I didn't know.</span> <span id="s57">I didn't feel anything.</span> <span id="s58">I didn't understand about my father being taken away, and I don't think my mother really explained it to us.</span> <span id="s59">I think we always felt that he was going to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Do you remember soldiers taking him, or is it just a memory of him being taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: It was some men.</span> <span id="s62">I don't know if they were soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Do you recall anything in particular about that night, anything more?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Not really, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: When you went to Theresienstadt, what do you remember getting there?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well, I remember that we went on this train and it was quite nice, I thought.</span> <span id="s67">Then we were just in a new place.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: You were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: I was together, Rene and I and my mother, and I don't have a clue to what we did during the day.</span> <span id="s70">My memories of Theresienstadt are really very vague except again, just for moments here and there.</span> <span id="s71">I remember cobblestone roads.</span> <span id="s72">I remember watching carts with dead bodies, but it didn't mean anything to me.</span> <span id="s73">I didn't understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s74">I was with Rene, and I was with my mother and so it was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: You don't remember any kind of activity that you did there?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: I really can't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: You do remember music from there sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes, there was music, concerts, sitting in an audience and watching some kind of presentation.</span> <span id="s79">Yes, I remember that.</span> <span id="s80">I think that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: You had to go on a train again?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes, that was when -- it was December '43 and it was a very cold night.</span> <span id="s83">It was snowing and there was snow on the ground and I remember it seemed like we had a long walk, a very long way to get to the train.</span> <span id="s84">We were walking with my mom who was carrying a suitcase and she said we were moving.</span> <span id="s85">But I remember that on this walk it was a lot of people.</span> <span id="s86">It was not just us and there were soldiers and there were dogs barking and every once in a while there would be a gun shot, and I think people were dropping-- falling down to the ground.</span> <span id="s87">I don't really think I understood that they were killed or that they were dead.</span> <span id="s88">I didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s89">I know I didn't want to walk.</span> <span id="s90">I just wanted to stop and sit down, I was so tired.</span> <span id="s91">My mother just kind of pushed me on and said you must come.</span> <span id="s92">You must be still and just walk.</span> <span id="s93">The next thing I knew we were on this very crowded train.</span> <span id="s94">It was not like the train we had taken to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s95">It was just standing room and you were squeezed very tight.</span> <span id="s96">People were crying and moaning.</span> <span id="s97">It was awful.</span> <span id="s98">People had to -- I don't recall having any food.</span> <span id="s99">I remember we were hungry and it was so tight you really had hardly room to breath and I was little so all I can remember is legs.</span> <span id="s100">I was scared.</span> <span id="s101">Even though Renee was there and my mother, but I remember being scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Do you have any sense of how long -- how much time was spent on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No.</span> <span id="s104">It seemed very long, but I don't know what the ride really is even today.</span> <span id="s105">I've never asked anybody how long is it from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, but it seemed endless.</span> <span id="s106">When we finally -- when the train finally stopped and we got out, and we walked again for a while to this big barn like structure, whatever and it had bunk beds in it.</span> <span id="s107">It had a stove like thing down the center and that was our new home.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: What happened when you got off the train, do you remember in more detail what the procedure was?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Not too much actually.</span> <span id="s110">I just know my mom was holding on to us, and we just followed her and many other people.</span> <span id="s111">We were all going to the same place obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Do you remember getting tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: It's a very vague -- very vague.</span> <span id="s114">I wish I could recall it better.</span> <span id="s115">I do vaguely remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: What are your memories then of this place of Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s117">What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Well, --.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Did you stay together at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: In the beginning we were together and it was also with many other Czech families.</span> <span id="s121">I just remember it was just very sad.</span> <span id="s122">I used to see people get hit.</span> <span id="s123">I know we were hungry almost all the time, and it was cold.</span> <span id="s124">There were soldiers and I really didn't understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s125">We had to stand in line waiting for things and every once in a while my mom took us.</span> <span id="s126">We went to the hospital for the doctor to look at us and I remember the very first time, especially because Rene -- I always felt he was a crybaby and I was afraid that he was going to cry, and I knew that if he cried something terrible might happen to him.</span> <span id="s127">I went first and to be examined and I was -- I didn't utter a sound.</span> <span id="s128">The whole time I kept hoping that Rene was going to be good too, because I didn't want anything to happen to him.</span> <span id="s129">So, we went with our mother.</span> <span id="s130">I also -- before we came to Auschwitz I remember there was one time where I remember we sat with our mother and we were being photographed, and I remember that particular moment.</span> <span id="s131">As it turns out we subsequently learned those were actually propaganda photographs that were sent out, and I have the picture today of Rene, my mother and I in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: What was it about that moment that makes you remember?</span> <span id="s133">Is there anything particular about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Well, we were kind of like on stage.</span> <span id="s135">I think they kept saying smile, but we really didn't feel much like it, but what I remember was being like close to my mother, feeling her coat and just the closeness of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: But you could not stay together for very long?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: No, at some point -- I know now it was six months afterwards we were separated from our mother.</span> <span id="s138">I remember it as being physically really taken from her, and I definitely remember a scream from her and I remember her getting hit by a soldier or some person and I just remember really -- it was very, very sad.</span> <span id="s139">I just somehow knew I'd never see her again.</span> <span id="s140">Well, in fact that is what happened because the entire lager was killed that night, and also not only was I separated from my mom, but then Rene and I were also separated because we were -- though we were twins, we were of the opposite sex, so they didn't keep twins of the opposite sex together.</span> <span id="s141">So, Rene was put in with twin boys, and I went in with the twin girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Did you know where he was?</span> <span id="s143">Were you aware of him being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I think throughout the whole time that I was in Auschwitz, I always felt in my heart that Rene was okay.</span> <span id="s145">I had a vague idea where he was.</span> <span id="s146">It was from my bunk it was a little over to the right near some chimneys or something, and in fact he really was there.</span> <span id="s147">That's how I remember it.</span> <span id="s148">There was once some kind of a fire and I was terribly scared that Rene's bunk may be caught up in that, but luckily he wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did you see him sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, I don't recall that I saw him, although Rene says that he did once catch a glimpse of me, so, it's possible that I saw him too, but it didn't quite register for me.</span> <span id="s151">But somehow I always knew at some point no matter what this was, and I didn't understand what any of this was, that we'd somehow be together again.</span> <span id="s152">You asked earlier about memories of Auschwitz and I guess most of them are really quite bad and I don't like speaking of them very much and I haven't spoken about some at all and I might never because I can't.</span> <span id="s153">But Auschwitz, the things that I remember very clearly is having to stand for hours for roll call, and I remember that I was one of the youngest and I was little and I always tried to hide behind somebody else, somebody taller so that I would not be seen.</span> <span id="s154">I think this was my mode of operation, is to be invisible and you can't get into trouble.</span> <span id="s155">I used to get a piece of bread, usually int he morning, with some black stuff to drink and I remember that I would always, since I was always -- maybe it was in the afternoon -- because I was always hungriest in the morning so I thought it would be really clever for me to try to save this piece of bread so I would have it the next day and of course it usually was gone and I didn't understand it but now in retrospect I think the rats and mice at Auschwitz must have loved me.</span> <span id="s156">They knew who to come to.</span> <span id="s157">I remember standing in line, humiliated standing outside in the cold naked waiting to get into the showers and also terribly scared because somehow I knew that you didn't always come out of the shower.</span> <span id="s158">I didn't know quite what happened, but I knew you didn't always come back.</span> <span id="s159">I'm amazed at my, I guess call it chutzpa, because I had a locket on my neck, a gold locket from my mom and I was determined to hang on to this and of course if they had seen it, I don't know what would happened to me, but I took it off my neck and held on to in my hand and somehow got passed the guard.</span> <span id="s160">I think what happened is in the showers it finally dropped out of my hand.</span> <span id="s161">But there was a little bit of me that said I got away -- I saved my locket.</span> <span id="s162">I remember once that I actually hid among dead bodies and I don't know exactly what was going on but I thought if I really lay still and make believe I was dead I would somehow escape whatever was happening.</span> <span id="s163">There was always this cloud of smoke in Auschwitz and there was always this smell that after a while I heard comments you know they're burning people.</span> <span id="s164">It's flesh burning.</span> <span id="s165">I don't think I still understood exactly.</span> <span id="s166">I said, you know, it couldn't be.</span> <span id="s167">I think my most horrendous memories are those of Doctor Mengala and the hospital and I seemed to be a favorite candidate.</span> <span id="s168">I don't know why but I remember getting injections and I remember having some little surgeries here and there, and things with electrical wires.</span> <span id="s169">I spent a lot of time in the hospital.</span> <span id="s170">I was pretty sick very often, but somehow I held on because I knew that Rene needed me.</span> <span id="s171">I had to get by.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: How did you know it was Doctor Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Oh, I don't really think I really knew.</span> <span id="s174">I think I know that today.</span> <span id="s175">It was just a doctor.</span> <span id="s176">It just seemed like he was in charge.</span> <span id="s177">I mean to me he was like in charge of everything, next to God.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: You were alone there from your family, but did you relate to other women?</span> <span id="s179">Do you remember women of different ages?</span> <span id="s180">What was the relationship between you and the others you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Unfortunately I think I really for whatever reason, I had no relationship with anybody.</span> <span id="s182">I was a very quiet child, very introverted.</span> <span id="s183">I was scared.</span> <span id="s184">I didn't mingle.</span> <span id="s185">It didn't seem like there were any children my age.</span> <span id="s186">They were a little bit older, and I somehow didn't belong and so I found myself just being kind of an observer.</span> <span id="s187">I watched a lot and I always again tried to make myself invisible.</span> <span id="s188">Always get behind somebody tall, behind a bunk, behind whatever.</span> <span id="s189">One very, very sad experience for me was one night when I had to actually go to the latrines and somehow I got so totally disoriented that I just could not remember where my bunk was and I remember trying to just -- I remember it was almost dawn and I knew that if they found me I'd be in real trouble so I tried to just get into anybody's bunk and maybe it was the people or the times but I was just being pushed away and being told this is not your place.</span> <span id="s190">This is not your place, but finally there was one woman and I don't know who she is, she finally said -- just grabbed me and let me come in with her.</span> <span id="s191">It was very sad.</span> <span id="s192">I missed my mom a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: So, you did not have an experience that other women have had of women taking care of each other a little bit in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s195">I also know that twin girls also had camaraderie because they had their siblings.</span> <span id="s196">But I think my overwhelming sense was just loneliness.</span> <span id="s197">I felt that I was just alone, always all alone and didn't belong anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: How did you get through those days?</span> <span id="s199">Did you talk to yourself?</span> <span id="s200">You had to do something?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Well, I think I day-dreamed a little about -- I don't know exactly about what.</span> <span id="s202">I think I used to remember that I had a doll and I had trains and the toys I used to have, little building blocks.</span> <span id="s203">I remembered my mom and I used to remember the walks in the park with my parents.</span> <span id="s204">I think that's how I got through.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Were you ever beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Not that I -- no.</span> <span id="s207">No, but I did witness other people being beaten, and I witnessed people being shot and people running into the electric wire, fences, but no, I tried to keep out of trouble.</span> <span id="s208">I had a sense that I had to be really good and listen and obey and I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What happened when finally liberation came and the Red Army came?</span> <span id="s210">Do you remember that particular day?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Well, what I remember is that there was a difference.</span> <span id="s212">Suddenly there was a difference in the camp.</span> <span id="s213">I don't think that I understood that it was liberation day because I don't think I understood that we were at war.</span> <span id="s214">To me, I guess I always hated that the saddest thing is that I really thought that what I had in Auschwitz was the way everybody lived.</span> <span id="s215">This was life, but there was a change, a definite change.</span> <span id="s216">There was a lot of scurrying about.</span> <span id="s217">Things weren't as strict.</span> <span id="s218">There seemed to be -- there was no order suddenly.</span> <span id="s219">There was just no order, and at that time I was extremely sick and I was lying on the ground.</span> <span id="s220">I could not move.</span> <span id="s221">I think if another week had passed I probably would have been dead, and I just remembered that a Polish woman picked me up and she piggy-back carried me all the way to her home in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s222">That's what happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: So you were very weak then, very sick, then when they came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Right, and I saw people running here and there and there was some kind of shouting.</span> <span id="s225">It seemed there was a little almost joy like something good happened, but I couldn't move.</span> <span id="s226">So, I was just wondering what was going to happen to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: So, this woman carried you to her home and that's where you stayed for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes, she lived right in the town proper of Auschwitz and I was very sick.</span> <span id="s229">I remember being in bed.</span> <span id="s230">I remember -- it must have been a doctor who came to see me and I remember these hot glasses on my back.</span> <span id="s231">A lot of that, and eventually I guess I got better because I got enrolled in school.</span> <span id="s232">I started going to school and I went to church.</span> <span id="s233">I knew that she was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s234">I also somehow knew that I was Jewish, but Jewish was not good, and so I wanted very much to be catholic.</span> <span id="s235">That was fine with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: How did you communicate with her?</span> <span id="s237">She was Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: I think I very quickly learned how to speak Polish because I had no trouble in school.</span> <span id="s239">I had no trouble in church.</span> <span id="s240">I understood everything.</span> <span id="s241">So, maybe as a child it was easy for me to pick up the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: How did you communicate in the camps?</span> <span id="s243">Did you understand people there?</span> <span id="s244">What languages do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: I have to be honest, I don't think I spoke to anybody, but I understood everything that was being said because I think that I did speak German.</span> <span id="s246">My dad and mom were originally from Germany and they fled to Czechoslovakia and that's where we were born, but I believe we spoke German, because I still understand some German today, so that's probably true.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Can you describe a little bit the new life that you had there at this house?</span> <span id="s248">What was it like?</span> <span id="s249">Did she have other children?</span> <span id="s250">Did she want to know what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Actually in retrospect now it was probably very peculiar.</span> <span id="s252">No, she did not want to know anything.</span> <span id="s253">She had no other children.</span> <span id="s254">There was a man who would come and be there every once in a while, but I don't know exactly what he was to her or not to her.</span> <span id="s255">I had a very strict regiment that I had to follow.</span> <span id="s256">I had to take care of bunny rabbits and sometimes she served these bunny rabbits and I didn't want to eat them but I had to because if I didn't I would get hit.</span> <span id="s257">She was very strict.</span> <span id="s258">When she enrolled me in school, she knew exactly how long it should take me to walk home from school, and if I was home two minutes late, I'd get hit.</span> <span id="s259">With all of this, it was certainly better than Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s260">I did get food.</span> <span id="s261">The bathroom was outside in the yard.</span> <span id="s262">I had to clean the floors, set the table, and do various other chores.</span> <span id="s263">I don't think she ever hugged me or kissed me.</span> <span id="s264">In the summer time she had some family living outside of the city and we would make this very long journey.</span> <span id="s265">It seemed like a couple of hours worth, to a farm, and there there were some children, and all I can remember is that they made fun of my number and nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s266">I cried.</span> <span id="s267">I cried because I wanted to be catholic and they were telling me I wasn't.</span> <span id="s268">I surprising did very well at school.</span> <span id="s269">But it was not -- there was no love in the home, but she obviously -- she fed me, she clothed me and she expected certain things from me.</span> <span id="s270">The gentleman who frequented the house at times-- I didn't understand then, but I think he had a drinking problem, and if I was in the way of his temper then I got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: He would hit you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s273">I think I must have been with her for at least a year, perhaps a little longer, because I remember Christmas, and I remember her telling me if I was very, very good I would may be get a present from Santa who was going to come out of the sky.</span> <span id="s274">Of course I believed her and I stayed up all night looking for this Santa who never came, and so I decided I must be really bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Did you get a present?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: No.</span> <span id="s277">I did get a cookie from somebody, a gingerbread cookie.</span> <span id="s278">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Did you eat it or did you save it?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No, I saved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So, nobody during that time--, you stayed there for about two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: I don't think it was that long.</span> <span id="s283">A little over a year I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Nobody ever asked you what happened and when the children made fun of you, what did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: They were saying something about me being Jewish and that I was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s286">I really didn't understand.</span> <span id="s287">It so happened that at the time that I was with this woman, the Russians had occupied this town and almost diagonally across from her is where the Russian soldiers were living, or maybe it was an embassy.</span> <span id="s288">And I do remember that she used to send me to there with some kind of packages, which I really don't know what any of this was, but I have to say that the Russian soldiers were very nice and very loving, and I liked going there.</span> <span id="s289">The other thing that is very hard for me to talk about even now is one of the things that she used to take me -- we used to go back to Auschwitz and we would sift through the remains, ashes and look for gold teeth.</span> <span id="s290">She used to give me a sieve and I had to with a spoon or whatever had to pile it up and shake it and of course I had to find at least one piece of gold otherwise I was going to get it.</span> <span id="s291">So, I had to be a busy little beaver there, but the feeling that I knew that what I was doing was something so not right.</span> <span id="s292">I felt like I was -- even though I was young and didn't understand, I felt like I was touching something that shouldn't be touched and that this was not right.</span> <span id="s293">But we went looking for gold.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Do you have any nice memories of that lady, anything that has to do with warmth?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Well, I have to say, and this might sound strange, but I loved going to church because it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s296">The windows, the statues, the music.</span> <span id="s297">I only wanted to know when I was ever going to get called up for the -- to get that little wafer that looked so wonderful.</span> <span id="s298">But I never got it, I never got called up, but I loved going to church.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: So, you wanted to be catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s301">Then one fine day, I didn't know at that time, but now I know that it was Vahasala (ph), a Jewish organization, and there were other children in Polish homes and they were rescuing them, and one fine day I found myself, I was told that I was going that I had to leave and that I was going to go someplace else.</span> <span id="s302">It probably will sound bizarre but I was actually sad that I was leaving.</span> <span id="s303">Not that it was wonderful, but it was the only home I had and it was certainly better than Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s304">I wound up in an orphanage, a Jewish orphanage and there I met a girl, a few years older than I, and she kind of became my mother figure.</span> <span id="s305">Her name is Miriam and we are friends to this day, and she is the only person I spoke to for about two years.</span> <span id="s306">I never spoke to anybody.</span> <span id="s307">I hated this place.</span> <span id="s308">It was Jewish.</span> <span id="s309">It was not organized.</span> <span id="s310">It was sloppy, not neat, nothing ever was on time.</span> <span id="s311">I remember looking out the window with Miriam -- she also was not too happy-- and we kept thinking how we could escape as we were holding our rosary beads, how we could escape from this Jewish place and get back into the church.</span> <span id="s312">I was just really very unhappy, very unhappy.</span> <span id="s313">I wanted to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: But Miriam was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yes, Miriam was Jewish, but she was like me.</span> <span id="s316">She was also indoctrinated at that point.</span> <span id="s317">We thought we were doing our rosaries and saying our little things and --.</span> <span id="s318">Then we were moved again, and this time we went to France to another orphanage and there were a lot of children at this place.</span> <span id="s319">It was somewhat better because I guess there were more children and not so many adults.</span> <span id="s320">But, again, I felt out of place for some reason.</span> <span id="s321">I would listen as many of the children relate their tales of what happened to them and how they got to be here, and many of them were hidden by catholic or non Jewish families.</span> <span id="s322">Some of them still had relatives and parents and were just waiting to be reunited.</span> <span id="s323">Some had hidden with the partisans in the woods, and some had been housed I think actually by ministers and clergy.</span> <span id="s324">I was the only child with a number.</span> <span id="s325">In fact, I was the only child from a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s326">So, when I heard all the stories that were being told, I said, they're never going to believe where I was and I never spoke about it.</span> <span id="s327">I never spoke about it.</span> <span id="s328">Nobody asked me.</span> <span id="s329">The adults didn't ask and I only spoke to Miriam.</span> <span id="s330">I was Miss Goody Two Shoes.</span> <span id="s331">I had to be the best at everything.</span> <span id="s332">We had lessons and classes and I was the top student.</span> <span id="s333">I did everything well, to perfection.</span> <span id="s334">It was sickening.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Why did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: I think I wanted attention and I think I thought if I was the best I'd get more attention some how.</span> <span id="s337">It was to the point where when the entire -- all the children were vaccinated and that really hurt and every body was in bed the next day.</span> <span id="s338">Not me, I was up early, I was bringing breakfast to everything.</span> <span id="s339">Not that my arm didn't hurt.</span> <span id="s340">It hurt just as much.</span> <span id="s341">I had the same fever everybody else did, but no,I had to show that I was above this.</span> <span id="s342">An injection wasn't going to get me down.</span> <span id="s343">I remember when a lot of us when we got there we had these sores on our bodies, I think scabies or whatever and we had to every day go and get medication to put on this stuff.</span> <span id="s344">Sometimes the children would wince and cry, but not me.</span> <span id="s345">Miss Perfect here never cried.</span> <span id="s346">I needed nothing.</span> <span id="s347">But I was crying the whole time inside.</span> <span id="s348">I was so lonely.</span> <span id="s349">I just desperately wanted somebody just to hug me, just to hug me, and I didn't know how to go about getting somebody to do that.</span> <span id="s350">But Miriam became sort of my surrogate mother.</span> <span id="s351">She used to do my hair.</span> <span id="s352">I had these long curls and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Did you tell anybody that you had a brother?</span> <span id="s354">Did you tell the woman in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Her name was Mrs. Mucha and no I never told her and no I never --</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Did you tell Miriam?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: I think I might have told Miriam and I guess in the search after this I did find an aunt in England.</span> <span id="s360">I was not searching but who ever was doing this who actually is my mother's sister and she was in England with her husband and a son, a young son, about my age, and she was asked if she wanted to take me.</span> <span id="s361">I guess it was a hard time for her because she said no, things weren't good and she already had a son and a husband and she didn't think she could handle another child.</span> <span id="s362">She knew we were twins so --.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Before I ask you the question about Rene you said that you had long, long curls.</span> <span id="s364">Did you like yourself at all then?</span> <span id="s365">Was it important to you to look nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: It seemed to have been important in some way.</span> <span id="s367">I don't know if I liked myself.</span> <span id="s368">I think I thought I was bad.</span> <span id="s369">I must have been bad because all these terrible things had happened to me.</span> <span id="s370">If I had been good, none of this could have happened to me.</span> <span id="s371">I guess a little childish reasoning there.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: So, what happened after?</span> <span id="s373">You and Miriam did not go together?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: No.</span> <span id="s375">What happened was, as I said, some children they found homes for.</span> <span id="s376">Some were actually blessed enough to be reunited with family, and then a lot of them were sent to Israel.</span> <span id="s377">It was the beginnings of Aliat Israel, and Miriam was slated for that, and I thought I would be as well because I wanted to go with her.</span> <span id="s378">But I was told by this gentleman who used to come to visit us at Fluebane that he was going to take me to America.</span> <span id="s379">Lucky me.</span> <span id="s380">I didn't want to go to America.</span> <span id="s381">I wanted to go with Miriam.</span> <span id="s382">She was the only person who I felt close to and so this very nice gentleman said to me, well it will only be for a little bit and we'll bring you right back.</span> <span id="s383">I believed him.</span> <span id="s384">The next thing I knew was I was together with another little boy who was selected from another orphanage.</span> <span id="s385">We were on this big airplane on the way to America.</span> <span id="s386">Nobody explained about a plane.</span> <span id="s387">We had -- they sent a young woman with us who spoke only French.</span> <span id="s388">The boy spoke only French.</span> <span id="s389">I spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s390">Didn't understand a word of French, barely.</span> <span id="s391">I mean I know that we were in France, but we always, the children we spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s392">I thought a thousand times this plane was going to blow up.</span> <span id="s393">I had no idea what a plane even was, but we did finally land.</span> <span id="s394">Then, it turned out there was a lot of commotion about us.</span> <span id="s395">Subsequently, I learned that we were chosen to raise money for the war orphans of Europe by this organization called Rescue Children, and I guess we were quite successful because they did raise quite a bit of money.</span> <span id="s396">We stayed at hotels and I saw white bread.</span> <span id="s397">I saw things that were totally magical to me.</span> <span id="s398">We were taken to this store, this Sax Fifth Avenue, or Barnwitz, I don't remember -- floors and floors of -- I could not believe my eyes.</span> <span id="s399">They bought us things and they gave us things.</span> <span id="s400">It was unbelievable, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s401">But I have to be honest, I only wanted to go back and be with Miriam and go to Israel and all these extraneous things, the teddy bears, the dolls, the chocolate didn't mean anything to me, even though it was exciting.</span> <span id="s402">When it came time to ask well when am I going back, this very nice gentleman said to me, we're not sending you back.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s405">I was very, very upset.</span> <span id="s406">There was a very loving and caring family by whom I stayed.</span> <span id="s407">It was a temporary arrangement.</span> <span id="s408">I thought I was staying permanently however.</span> <span id="s409">She had a son and she was pregnant and gave birth to a daughter, I think, around that time, and I thought that this was going to be my home.</span> <span id="s410">They sent me to school, and I quickly learned English and Hebrew.</span> <span id="s411">I don't know how, but within -- well, I just first started school with them, but then it turned out --</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: You thought that you would stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: I thought, but it seemed that it was really just a temporary arrangement and they were trying to place me.</span> <span id="s414">There was a family that was interested in me, but they wanted to try me out.</span> <span id="s415">So, I was invited to spend shobot with them, and they had a little girl that was about a year younger than me and a boy.</span> <span id="s416">He must have been about four or five years younger than me.</span> <span id="s417">I spent Shobot there and I was very uncomfortable the whole time.</span> <span id="s418">They thought that I would be a good playmate for their daughter.</span> <span id="s419">There was only one problem.</span> <span id="s420">I didn't know how to play.</span> <span id="s421">I had never played.</span> <span id="s422">She had lots of games, lots of dolls.</span> <span id="s423">I really didn't know what to do with this stuff and I was again, I was very introverted, very quiet, not at all talkative, not at all bubbly.</span> <span id="s424">It just happens that the little boy also came with me for that Shobot and he was exactly the opposite of me.</span> <span id="s425">He was extraverted, bubbly, cute, a child anybody would want.</span> <span id="s426">So, when they brought us back, I guess they must have told these people that well, I didn't quite work out, but they'd be very interested in the little boy.</span> <span id="s427">So, that is what in fact happened.</span> <span id="s428">So the search was on to find me a home and I think at that time, I did tell Eva Best, who was the woman, that I had a twin brother.</span> <span id="s429">Her husband, who was at that time the director of Rescue Children, started making inquiries.</span> <span id="s430">They also found a wonderful, wonderful family who had originally wanted to adopt a boy and were thinking that they were going to get Charlie who when they were told that the home they thought was for me didn't quite work out, would they be interested in a girl.</span> <span id="s431">It seems now that she has a twin brother, would they be interested.</span> <span id="s432">So, this was more than they ever anticipated or expected, but they said certainly.</span> <span id="s433">We'll be happy to take them.</span> <span id="s434">And they did come to see me and they had seen me and they knew that I was introverted and shy.</span> <span id="s435">I never said hello to them.</span> <span id="s436">I never looked at them.</span> <span id="s437">It didn't matter.</span> <span id="s438">They were up to the challenge.</span> <span id="s439">So, very shortly after that, Eva Best took me over to Mr. and Mrs. Myer Slatkin who eventually adopted me and Rene, but that's a whole story, but I was not happy in the beginning because again, I felt like I had been given away again.</span> <span id="s440">This was the Polish woman.</span> <span id="s441">It was the orphanage in Prague, it was the orphanage in France and now it was this woman.</span> <span id="s442">It seemed like nobody really wanted me and I only wanted to keep going back to Eva Best and I know that my mom though, she tried real hard.</span> <span id="s443">She bought me things.</span> <span id="s444">She tried to get me involved in going shopping and things, but I only wanted to go back to Eva Best.</span> <span id="s445">It took quite a long time before I got really used to being with them.</span> <span id="s446">I continued in the same school, and they were exceptionally loving to me.</span> <span id="s447">I started in the third grade in I think December and I think by March and April I was in fifth grade with children my age.</span> <span id="s448">To the credit of my mom who worked really hard with me on English.</span> <span id="s449">Hebrew I was on my own because she didn't know Hebrew, but I seemed to have done well.</span> <span id="s450">In fact, I excelled at Hebrew and they had a lot of patience.</span> <span id="s451">Slowly, slowly, I realized that this was going to be my home, and when they heard that I had a brother they right away got busy looking for him and they spared absolutely no expense and believe me, lucky they had it, but they spent thousands of dollars to find Rene and to be finally able to get him here.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">But the one thing all through this is nobody ever asked me "What happened to you?"</span> <span id="s453">Nobody ever asked.</span> <span id="s454">Nobody ever wanted to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: What time was that now?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: This was -- we're about 1948, December '47, 1948 January, with the Slotkins now.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: What kind of school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: It was a private school, a Yushiva, an Orthodox Jewish school.</span> <span id="s459">It followed the traditions of what I had learned in Fluebane, because that was also run by an Orthodox group.</span> <span id="s460">I felt that I had a great need to excel and I did.</span> <span id="s461">I graduated at the top of the class and won a scholarship in eighth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: You just talked about the great need to excel that you even got a scholarship.</span> <span id="s465">Where do you think that great need came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: I think because I felt really that I must have been bad to have so many horrible things happen to me that I wanted to prove to my new parents that I was worth adopting and that they could be proud of me, that I could be good.</span> <span id="s467">I think that was my need.</span> <span id="s468">Of course, I have to say that perhaps it wasn't so hard to excel at school because I came from a very European kind of view of education where everything was very strict.</span> <span id="s469">You never spoke back to the teacher.</span> <span id="s470">You wouldn't dare show up without your assignment completed.</span> <span id="s471">Here I noticed that children just yelled things out in class and even spoke among themselves while the teacher was giving the lesson.</span> <span id="s472">I thought they were going to get killed but I saw the teacher just said "be quiet," and nothing terrible was happening.</span> <span id="s473">A lot of times they came to school and they didn't have the homework and I just could not relate to this.</span> <span id="s474">I thought something just terrible, terrible would happen if I came without my homework or if I spoke out of turn.</span> <span id="s475">So, I really, really could not understand the American system.</span> <span id="s476">It was very hard for me.</span> <span id="s477">I felt very outside all the time.</span> <span id="s478">I never kind of quite got into the fun of the activities at school.</span> <span id="s479">I always had a certain sadness and memories that just kept haunting me.</span> <span id="s480">It didn't help that nobody ever asked me anything or wanted to even know.</span> <span id="s481">Even at school and though I'm quite sure that all the teachers were perfectly aware that I was their one and only Holocaust student, a survivor student.</span> <span id="s482">No teacher ever befriended me especially or tried to help me especially.</span> <span id="s483">They just kind of let me be.</span> <span id="s484">But then again, now I'm thinking about it, I was very, very shy and very introverted and maybe they thought it was better to just let me be.</span> <span id="s485">My mother helped me a great deal with the English.</span> <span id="s486">She worked with me constantly because she was a teacher and she had a great deal of patience.</span> <span id="s487">Hebrew I was on my own.</span> <span id="s488">As great as I had all the material things I could wish for, and I seemingly fit in very well with the crowd.</span> <span id="s489">I was in the right crowd.</span> <span id="s490">I was among the most popular.</span> <span id="s491">I was in the right clique, but it was never right for me because nobody -- I had a lot of problems inside that I didn't know how to deal with and it seemed nobody else knew either at that time.</span> <span id="s492">Also, I got the feeling that if I ever spoke about prewar things, somehow my parents didn't like that.</span> <span id="s493">They wanted me to forget and just accept this as a new life, as a new start and just go on from there and forget everything from the past.</span> <span id="s494">I had a lot of trouble with this because I very often had dreams and flashbacks and I had nobody to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: What kind of flashbacks came particularly strong or what are the recurring memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: I was terribly afraid of electrical things, a lightening storm, or anything.</span> <span id="s497">I mean if my mom said plug in the radio, it was like "do I have to, couldn't Debbie do that?"</span> <span id="s498">I don't know why, but I got this huge anxiety attack when anything electrical came into play.</span> <span id="s499">I know there was a shower in the house and I never wanted to take a shower.</span> <span id="s500">I always wanted only to take a bath.</span> <span id="s501">That seemed better somehow because no matter how hard I tried, everytime I took a shower I could not help but remember waiting in line and how humiliating it was and how cold and how scared I was.</span> <span id="s502">I was afraid I would die.</span> <span id="s503">Train rides.</span> <span id="s504">It's a big treat for child.</span> <span id="s505">Let's go to New York.</span> <span id="s506">We'll go through the tunnel.</span> <span id="s507">Wow.</span> <span id="s508">I had to make believe this was a real thrill but when I got on the train all I could think of was it's a journey into oblivion.</span> <span id="s509">I just wanted to get off, and I couldn't say it.</span> <span id="s510">I had to say, "oh, I love this.</span> <span id="s511">This is great.</span> <span id="s512">"So, it was really very difficult.</span> <span id="s513">I only liked stale bread.</span> <span id="s514">My mother only served fresh stuff.</span> <span id="s515">I would always leave things out.</span> <span id="s516">I'd save them for later so they would get stale.</span> <span id="s517">Bizarre.</span> <span id="s518">She didn't understand.</span> <span id="s519">She didn't have a clue, and I felt strange.</span> <span id="s520">I really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Did people see your tattoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Well, I was so totally ashamed of my tattoo because I felt that this was a mark of some sort that I had committed some great grievance sin for which I had been adequately punished, but I certainly didn't want anybody to know that I was in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s523">I mean that was like, my God, I would sooner die than have someone know.</span> <span id="s524">So, my mom was very understanding about this.</span> <span id="s525">In the winter I only wore long sleeved things and then in the summer she bought all these pancake powders and started mixing them to match my skin.</span> <span id="s526">Every morning she'd get this waterproof stuff and she'd mix the color to be exactly right and we'd feather it and powder it and I thought it was really quite good, but in all honesty, anybody who had any eyes would have seen that there was something on my arm that I was covering, but no one ever asked.</span> <span id="s527">In fact, it's strange, I remember over hearing a teacher in my school.</span> <span id="s528">Somebody who came to teach after I was already there and somebody must have been saying "See her, she's the little girl that came from the concentration camps" and this person in total ignorance and I heard this said "It couldn't be.</span> <span id="s529">No children survived the concentration camps."</span> <span id="s530">So, blotto me out totally.</span> <span id="s531">I had no -- they had no psychologists.</span> <span id="s532">My parents never thought of it.</span> <span id="s533">I was in desperate need.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Do you remember the first time you felt really at home there.</span> <span id="s535">Was there anything in particular that made you feel, now I can trust the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: I think it was a very gradual -- I know they overwhelmed me with presents in the beginning.</span> <span id="s537">I got this doll -- in fact I still have her.</span> <span id="s538">She's probably a treasure.</span> <span id="s539">It's a honey bunch doll.</span> <span id="s540">Dick Tracy, whatever, and a carriage.</span> <span id="s541">I was the envy of everybody.</span> <span id="s542">I was overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s543">I think the trust came little by little because I saw how my mom always worked with me on my school things.</span> <span id="s544">Whenever I needed anything for school, she would take me, anything at all.</span> <span id="s545">When I saw how they were trying to unite me with Rene, I think that's when I knew that these people really care.</span> <span id="s546">Again, it didn't feel like my real mother and father, but I guess as close as I could come to that.</span> <span id="s547">It happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: What had happened to Rene in the meantime and how did you get reunited?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Well, Rene was at Auschwitz when the Red Army came, and he did go on that march whatever.</span> <span id="s550">Somehow there was a Doctor Kilina who liked Rene alot and he took him home, back to Czechoslovakia and Rene became part of his family, kind of.</span> <span id="s551">Sometime thereafter, this Doctor Kilina had to flee because the communists had already taken over Czechoslovakia and someone had something about him.</span> <span id="s552">Anyway, it was necessary for him to escape to Israel.</span> <span id="s553">So, he had to leave Rene, and it really broke his heart because Rene talks with great love for this man.</span> <span id="s554">He knew how to reach a little boy who had been through trauma.</span> <span id="s555">He knew just what this little boy needed.</span> <span id="s556">He needed a bicycle, you know.</span> <span id="s557">It broke his heart, but he gave Rene into the care of his sister.</span> <span id="s558">In the meantime, Rescue Children was trying to locate Rene.</span> <span id="s559">I don't know what enroutes they were or were not making but when I came to America to raise all this money, Life Magazine had done a complete story about me.</span> <span id="s560">It seemed when Doctor Kilina got to Israel, he happened to pick up that Life Magazine issue, saw my name, Irene Goodman, and it clicked for him.</span> <span id="s561">That must be Rene's twin sister.</span> <span id="s562">And that's really how he called and that's how we found out where Rene was.</span> <span id="s563">Of course that was wonderful because then I started writing to Rene and my parents really did -- it was very hard to get him out from behind the Iron Curtain.</span> <span id="s564">He had to go to Switzerland to a boarding school for a while, but Rene loved it because he learned how to ski.</span> <span id="s565">He really was just up in the mountains and he had a great time there.</span> <span id="s566">Then I think he had to go to Germany for while, but anyway, make a very long arduous path with lots of politicians helping, lots of money passing hands and the help of a most unique individual, and I'm going to name him, Mr. Maurice Enwright who saved hundreds of children, all just out of the kindness of his heart.</span> <span id="s567">People just paid his expenses and he brought children back.</span> <span id="s568">He spent a lot of time with Rene and finally came the day when he came to America.</span> <span id="s569">That was quite a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: How was it when you two met again?</span> <span id="s571">You hadn't seen each other for --?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Since 1945, and this was now 1950.</span> <span id="s573">When I was told he was coming I was very excited, very excited, but I didn't know how I was going to speak to him because you see I was now speaking English.</span> <span id="s574">I had forgotten my Polish, not totally yet, but practically because I was still in correspondence with my friend Miriam, and he spoke Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">He was learning English in this school in Switzerland but -- so I was a little apprehensive and I wasn't quite sure, and with all this build up and everything when we finally saw each other it was like we just stared at each other.</span> <span id="s576">It's not like we ran towards each other.</span> <span id="s577">We just looked at each other and I thought, gee I'm much bigger than him.</span> <span id="s578">He seemed kind of small next to me.</span> <span id="s579">I guess that's what happens when a girl is twelve and a boy is twelve, because he very quickly out distanced me the following year.</span> <span id="s580">But, there was a feeling that we completed some kind of a journey.</span> <span id="s581">Something came to completion and I remember thinking that my real parents would be happy to see that we are together.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">It wasn't until the next day that we actually started to talk a little.</span> <span id="s583">It was not fireworks or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Did you have somebody now to talk to about your experience or did you not talk to Rene much about it either?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: It would seem that perhaps we would talk about this, but somehow I think the atmosphere in the house was again, to forget.</span> <span id="s586">This is a new life, this is America.</span> <span id="s587">So, that even Rene and I, I only remember one conversation with him and it didn't have anything to do with the time in Auschwitz or in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s588">It had to do with a memory I had of long ago of him getting bitten by a bee when we were children.</span> <span id="s589">That led us to talking about some of the toys we had and going to the park.</span> <span id="s590">We only had this conversation once, and in fact, Rene and I were not terribly close.</span> <span id="s591">Again, Rene was more extroverted and more social and not as interested in studies and more into fun.</span> <span id="s592">So, we were very opposite and again unfortunately I excelled at school and Rene didn't, so my parents were constantly holding me up as an example.</span> <span id="s593">A terrible thing to do to any children.</span> <span id="s594">So, in a sense Rene resented me a little but what happened was the less he did what he should have been doing, the more I felt I had to make up.</span> <span id="s595">So, I had to be not only super smart, but super duper extraordinary smart.</span> <span id="s596">I had to excel at everything.</span> <span id="s597">So, Rene was more into social things and I was more into being very studious and quiet, but I'm sure it just came out in different ways for me and Rene, because he certainly had bad memories that he needed to deal with, and for me I sublimated myself in my studies and excelling.</span> <span id="s598">By the time I graduated high school I was the salutatorian of the class.</span> <span id="s599">I was the editor of the year book.</span> <span id="s600">I was the captain of the cheerleading squad.</span> <span id="s601">I was on the basketball team.</span> <span id="s602">You name it, I did it.</span> <span id="s603">I joined the crowd.</span> <span id="s604">I knew how to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Was it difficult for you to trust anybody except maybe your parents or to trust the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s607">Yes, I always felt that whatever I had, it could all be gone tomorrow.</span> <span id="s608">I never felt that it would be ongoing and that I could be lucky enough to really have a good life.</span> <span id="s609">So, I was a very serious young girl and teen.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Did you date at all?</span> <span id="s611">Being a good American girl in some ways --?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I'll say I started dating later than my girlfriends.</span> <span id="s613">I was not interested in dating.</span> <span id="s614">I don't think I knew how to form relationships like that.</span> <span id="s615">It was very difficult for me.</span> <span id="s616">I didn't start dating until I was well into college, probably close to my senior year.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: You mentioned earlier that your name in Life Magazine article was Irene Goodman.</span> <span id="s618">How did the change -- you were born --?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Renatta Goodman.</span> <span id="s620">Well, I think the Polish lady took a few liberties with my name.</span> <span id="s621">I guess she didn't care for Renatta and name me Iranka, which I guess is a Polish name.</span> <span id="s622">When I came to America, again, nobody really asked me what my name was or wasn't.</span> <span id="s623">In France I was known as Iranka, but I knew that I was Renatta but nobody really asked me there either.</span> <span id="s624">I guess here in America my parents just made it American and decided Irene.</span> <span id="s625">They said Irene, I probably nodded my head and was Irene.</span> <span id="s626">To compound this, now I remember I also had a Hebrew name, Rifca, which I found out from my aunt.</span> <span id="s627">When I was enrolled in this school and the teacher asked me what my name was I said it was Rifca and he said to me, well, I have two other Rifcas in this class.</span> <span id="s628">It's going to be too confusing for me to have a third one, so I think we'll call you Esther.</span> <span id="s629">That's exactly how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: So you did not have a history that was validated?</span> <span id="s631">You did not have a name that was validated?</span> <span id="s632">Who were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s634">I was this Esther Irene, whoever that was and that was somebody who needed to excel for my parents, to make them happy that they had adopted me.</span> <span id="s635">That was the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: What did you major in in terms of education?</span> <span id="s637">What kind of profession did you pursue?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: It may seem odd but I had always wanted to be a doctor, even though the thought of going to a doctor is a nightmare, for me, or anything to do with being sick is not acceptable and hospitals are totally out of the question for me.</span> <span id="s639">But I wanted to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s640">I found when I started college and even in high school I was very good at the sciences.</span> <span id="s641">I enjoyed them.</span> <span id="s642">I liked math, which was a terrible thing because all girls were supposed to be stupid in math at that time, and that didn't gain me much popularity.</span> <span id="s643">I mean I even still liked math when I was in college so I minored in it and minored in physics and majored in chemistry.</span> <span id="s644">I didn't go on to be a doctor because the home that I was raised in, being a very traditional orthodox Jewish home and you know "orthodox Jewish girls didn't go to medical school."</span> <span id="s645">They got married, they had children and they became teachers.</span> <span id="s646">They became teachers.</span> <span id="s647">I knew I didn't want to be a teacher, so I became a biochemist and I did research, chemistry.</span> <span id="s648">I worked for Cornell Medical College and Albert Einstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Did you teach at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: I did teach also after a while.</span> <span id="s651">In high school I taught biology and chemistry and physics.</span> <span id="s652">I did teach, although I said I'd never teach, I did.</span> <span id="s653">That was actually a horror for me because now I actually had to demonstrate things to the children and here we went with electrical things.</span> <span id="s654">But I got smart.</span> <span id="s655">I asked for volunteers to plug in things and push the switches and do the things.</span> <span id="s656">I've gotten over that now that I'm passed 50, but it was a long time.</span> <span id="s657">Housework, doing the vacuuming or plugging in anything for years and years would bring on major anxiety attacks, which I didn't understand.</span> <span id="s658">Now I understand that it was just anxiety attacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: When did you begin to talk about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Actually not until 1985.</span> <span id="s661">My husband knew that I was a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s662">My children knew.</span> <span id="s663">It was becoming a little bit more okay to be a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s664">People were finally interested.</span> <span id="s665">Then Benjamin Meade has started this whole big group and there was the very first Holocaust reunion and I thought I might even go to it.</span> <span id="s666">I was pretty excited about it but I don't know if I might have mentioned it to somebody casually that I'm a Holocaust survivor and they just kind of looked at me and said, "you're too young, it couldn't be."</span> <span id="s667">They negated my whole thing and what could you remember and what could you possibly remember you were so little.</span> <span id="s668">So, I didn't go to the reunion and I felt very -- I didn't feel like I really belonged there either.</span> <span id="s669">It's kind of a strange thing.</span> <span id="s670">My whole life is trying to find where I belong and here I didn't even feel welcome with other Holocaust survivors because they somehow belittled my experience.</span> <span id="s671">Kind of felt I couldn't remember much and how terrible could it have been.</span> <span id="s672">Needless to say, they were so ignorant because they didn't have a clue as to what the Mengele twins had undergone.</span> <span id="s673">It wasn't until 1985 when there was actually an organization of twins that came about because of the first Holocaust gathering in '83 in Washington where Eva Core a twin went, and she started searching for other twins, because she too didn't feel comfortable with the other Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s674">We didn't have anything in common somehow.</span> <span id="s675">And so, when she called to tell me that she is a twin and we are having a reunion in Israel in January and I said "there were other twins besides Rene and me who survived Auschwitz."</span> <span id="s676">For sure I thought that Rene and I were the only ones.</span> <span id="s677">Absolutely, the only children to survive.</span> <span id="s678">She started telling me no, there are a hundred and some odd all over the world and this I said, I remember I called Rene in June and said "We have to go to this.</span> <span id="s679">We have to."</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: So, you decided to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: No, Eva was -- everybody was going to Auschwitz first and then on to Israel to hold this mock trial of Mengele, but Rene and I felt that we just -- going to Auschwitz was a little too much.</span> <span id="s682">We told Eva we'd meet her in Israel, and that's what we in fact did.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">I was amazed to see so many twins.</span> <span id="s684">I was hoping that I would recognize somebody.</span> <span id="s685">I was hoping somebody might recognize me, but it just didn't happen for me.</span> <span id="s686">Rene was luckier.</span> <span id="s687">He did find twins who remembered him very specifically and in some way that's bizarre, but it kind of validated that he was really there, and yes what you think happened, happened.</span> <span id="s688">But I wasn't getting any validation for me and I still felt like well, if none of them recognize me, where was I. Was I in a different place?</span> <span id="s689">Was I in the hospital so much, or was I just so extremely quiet.</span> <span id="s690">Eva -- it seemed like a lot of the other twins remembered each other.</span> <span id="s691">I was only three or four years younger and I don't know if that made the big difference or whether I was just so quiet and kept so to myself that nobody just ever noticed me.</span> <span id="s692">Because I really truly did not speak to anybody.</span> <span id="s693">I remember that.</span> <span id="s694">I spoke to no one.</span> <span id="s695">So, for me the trip, though I saw the twins and when I heard some of their stories, oh yeah, I remember that.</span> <span id="s696">It confirmed some things for me but I didn't feel totally validated because I didn't find anybody who really knew me until I met these older twins from Australia.</span> <span id="s697">They were originally from Czechoslovakia also and they had been to Theresienstadt and I don't know if they said it to make me feel good, which is probably what it was, but they thought that vaguely they had remembered me from the hospital.</span> <span id="s698">They had worked as nurses in the hospital and they thought they remembered a little girl with long, blondish hair.</span> <span id="s699">Well, there probably weren't too many because heads were shaved in Auschwitz, except the twins.</span> <span id="s700">My head was never shaved so I always had this long hair.</span> <span id="s701">Then there was another woman, Ruth Elias, a horrendous story, but she was also from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s702">She was on the same transport with us to Auschwitz and she thought that she remembered me from the Czech lager.</span> <span id="s703">So, I had to be satisfied with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Was that the experience that made you do more research?</span> <span id="s705">Did you ever try to find out what really happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Never before.</span> <span id="s707">I never read Holocaust books.</span> <span id="s708">I did in late 1970s attend some lectures by Elli Resell, but now I felt I needed to find out more and I did start looking and asking questions and I guess doing major research on what really happened.</span> <span id="s709">I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s710">I was able to find out a lot.</span> <span id="s711">I found out that there are very good records at the Polish Museum in Auschwitz and I was able to get documentation about me and experiments on me and when.</span> <span id="s712">While we were in Israel for this reunion, we also managed to find our transport stubs on what seats we had to Auschwitz with my mom and Rene and actually found a thing that said that my mom had died in Auschwitz at this kibbutz where they housed all the Czech documentation.</span> <span id="s713">I don't recall the name.</span> <span id="s714">We didn't find anything about my father there, but I found out just this passed year actually since having been to the Holocaust Museum, I found out a great deal about my dad and even got a picture from the Auschwitz Museum of him in his prisoner's garb.</span> <span id="s715">I can't tell you what that was like.</span> <span id="s716">Because I have a great many photographs and I could see from when he was healthy and everything was good and to see what he looked like now in Auschwitz was really a shock.</span> <span id="s717">Also, we learned that he was killed as a prisoner and I can only hope that he didn't have too many days there and that he didn't suffer.</span> <span id="s718">But I'm now continually looking, I discovered this great book The Chronicles of Auschwitz and I'm in there.</span> <span id="s719">My number, everything, so I'm pretty well documented and so is Rene.</span> <span id="s720">My dad is in there too.</span> <span id="s721">I'd like to -- I don't know enough about my mother except for what we found at that kibbutz that she died in Auschwitz, but I'm like on a search to find out more what happened after we were separated.</span> <span id="s722">I don't know if I'll succeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: You just mentioned your number again, would you tell us the number?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: It's 70917.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: You also said that you learned more about what was done to you.</span> <span id="s726">Do you know what was done?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Well, again I'm not 100 percent sure.</span> <span id="s728">It does show that I did have some kind of blood work up.</span> <span id="s729">I had some kind of injections.</span> <span id="s730">I don't think I ever got all my documents.</span> <span id="s731">It was just what they had.</span> <span id="s732">I don't really know what was done to me, but it couldn't have been good.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: I would like to go to your family, this family now.</span> <span id="s734">When did you and how did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: I actually met him on a blind date and that's how we met.</span> <span id="s736">This is my second marriage.</span> <span id="s737">I don't speak about this too much.</span> <span id="s738">I was married once before, for a very short time and my oldest girl is from that marriage.</span> <span id="s739">Unfortunately I was married to a wife abuser.</span> <span id="s740">I wouldn't have been able to get out of the marriage.</span> <span id="s741">I probably felt I deserved to be treated this way except something about having a baby.</span> <span id="s742">I said I in my heart knew I could never subject a child to this kind of an atmosphere and that's what really gave me the strength and also a very good friend and neighbor who helped me through this very trying time.</span> <span id="s743">And then of course my parents -- I was ashamed to tell my parents, so we had this charade for about six months.</span> <span id="s744">I felt I would be disappointing them somehow that I had failed at my marriage but I finally owned up to it and of course they came and collected me.</span> <span id="s745">They didn't like him anyway.</span> <span id="s746">Again, I married perhaps not for the right reasons.</span> <span id="s747">I still felt very alone.</span> <span id="s748">Most of my friends were getting married and I wanted to have a family of my own.</span> <span id="s749">I felt I had nothing and this man had had a bad marriage, he had a son, and what could be better?</span> <span id="s750">I could be a mom to this 13 year old.</span> <span id="s751">I was 22.</span> <span id="s752">What did I know.</span> <span id="s753">It seems nothing.</span> <span id="s754">So, part of me also staying in this marriage was for the son's sake because I tried to smooth things over because he was pretty strict with his son also.</span> <span id="s755">I saw there was nothing I could really do that would change and I needed to get out for my own child and so I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: How long were you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: I think six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: And then you met --?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Then I met Sammy on a blind date.</span> <span id="s760">I don't know if I was in the marriage frame of mind because I was beginning to see that I had a lot of things going on that were not resolved.</span> <span id="s761">I had trouble with relationships and I wasn't trusting and of course I was a little scared of men too.</span> <span id="s762">I didn't have the best image of men after the doctors in Auschwitz either so, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s763">Sammy was just so sweet.</span> <span id="s764">I married Sammy because he was kind.</span> <span id="s765">That was his outstanding quality and it's nothing against him if things had been different, I don't think Sammy would have been the kind of person I would have married, but I married him because I knew he would be good to me and he wouldn't hit me and he was kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: You did not really talk to him about how you felt about your problems either?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: How did you live with that?</span> <span id="s769">Were there nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Yes, nightmares.</span> <span id="s771">He used to wake me up.</span> <span id="s772">He'd always ask me what's the matter and I'd say "Nothing, just a little nightmare."</span> <span id="s773">I did not talk about it.</span> <span id="s774">Just before I married Sammy we were living with my parents and my daughter Lori and Lori had noticed my number and she was about six or seven at the time and she asked me what that was and I started telling her that I had been in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s775">I wasn't going into details and my mother overheard me and she says, "You don't need to be telling her this."</span> <span id="s776">So, again, I just didn't know what to say.</span> <span id="s777">I said, "Mom I'm not telling her anything, but you know how can I not explain to her the number on my arm?"</span> <span id="s778">But, my mother said you don't have to tell her anything.</span> <span id="s779">So, I think Lori knew after that that I had survived but she never asked me anything.</span> <span id="s780">I never volunteered anything else.</span> <span id="s781">Part of it was my own thing was that I didn't want to lay this heavy burden.</span> <span id="s782">I wanted my kids to have a childhood.</span> <span id="s783">I wanted them to have everything that I didn't and that's probably why I also remarried.</span> <span id="s784">I wanted Lori to have a father.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: When did you ever do something for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s787">I don't know, I don't have an answer.</span> <span id="s788">I'm still the person who feels she needs to do for others, even though at this point in my life where I have this MS and I don't get out that much, one of the highlights of my week is visiting sick patients at the hospital and trying to bring cheer to terminal patients who are suffering with cancer.</span> <span id="s789">The only time -- I guess that's the answer to your answer.</span> <span id="s790">I do something for myself by helping out people.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Is the MS, do you know whether or not that is in any way connected or might have been connected to things that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Well, it can be definitely acknowledged because they really don't know that much about MS, but my neurologist said that certainly whatever happened to me predisposed me to an illness so that it wound up being MS. But certainly all those injections and the circumstances of my childhood could certainly lay the ground work for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Did you ever go back to Czechoslovakia or did you ever visit Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: I've never been back to Czechoslovakia or Poland, but I did visit Germany as I found out not too long ago that my father has a sister who lives in Dresden.</span> <span id="s795">I was fortunate in having a wonderful, wonderful girlfriend who said, "Come on.</span> <span id="s796">I'll take you.</span> <span id="s797">I'll treat you the trip and I'll go with you and we'll do it together."</span> <span id="s798">So, we did.</span> <span id="s799">That was -- I think it was in 1987 or 1988 when I made the trip and I met my aunt and her daughter.</span> <span id="s800">My first cousin, and I can't describe in words the moment that we saw eachother.</span> <span id="s801">This was truly something that they never thought they'd ever see me.</span> <span id="s802">They knew all about me.</span> <span id="s803">They knew about Rene.</span> <span id="s804">My parents had been in touch with them when we were born and sent many, many photographs to my aunt.</span> <span id="s805">So, it was a dream kind of come true.</span> <span id="s806">I never thought I'd be able to go to Dresden.</span> <span id="s807">It was still before the Wall came down, and we spent four or five days with my aunt and cousin and my aunt told me lots of stories that she remembered and she showed me the many, many photographs and letters that my father had written to her from Prague.</span> <span id="s808">She even gave me the letters, and at the end of the trip she gave me all these precious, precious photographs and it was like getting a life.</span> <span id="s809">It was my life and she gave it to me.</span> <span id="s810">She gave me a knick knack, a little music box that used to belong to my father and so it's very special.</span> <span id="s811">It was also very special because I feel that I don't think we'll ever see each other again, but we are in correspondence.</span> <span id="s812">She just sent me beautiful embroidered tablecloths.</span> <span id="s813">It's wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Did you get a sense whether or not people in East Germany at that time knew that much about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Interestingly enough, I think they knew hardly anything.</span> <span id="s816">My aunt, though she knew of the suffering, after all she did live through the Dresden bombing which killed my grandparents, she did not have any idea of what was happening and what happened to us in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s817">She speaks German and we used an interpreter, a young woman in her late 30s who was absolutely astounded at the things I was saying.</span> <span id="s818">She had no idea, not a clue, that this is what had happened.</span> <span id="s819">It was very sobering and kind of upsetting to me to see the such a trauma was going unacknowledged.</span> <span id="s820">People knew very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Things have changed in that respect in America a little bit in the late '70s and early '80s?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Yes, people did start talking about it and there was some recognition and we had Holocaust Memorial Day and a lot of literature has come out, but there are always those who say what do we need this for and I always say, look at the world today.</span> <span id="s823">You shouldn't ask why you need to learn.</span> <span id="s824">Look at this world today.</span> <span id="s825">Look where we are.</span> <span id="s826">We haven't yet learned.</span> <span id="s827">We haven't learned not to hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: You started speaking publicly or in schools about that.</span> <span id="s829">Tell me a little bit about the reasons for doing that and what it was like to do that after so many decades of not speaking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: It was extremely difficult for me when I came back from Israel and there was quite a bit of publicity in magazines and New York Times on which we appeared.</span> <span id="s831">I had friends who had known me many, many years who are totally astounded, shocked.</span> <span id="s832">They could not believe that I was a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s833">They said "You're so American."</span> <span id="s834">I took that as a compliment of sorts, but I also as Rene and I started talking and June started talking and started telling my children and Sam a little bit.</span> <span id="s835">I realized that I have an obligation, that I had an obligation to my parents, if not to anybody else, to speak about this.</span> <span id="s836">I suddenly found myself talking to schools, synagogues, appearing on TV, appearing in books and talking.</span> <span id="s837">I also had the very good fortune to after the trip to Israel to make connection with a Doctor Kestenberg who saw me professionally and also as a friend and encouraged me to write poetry or talk about it and that has helped me greatly.</span> <span id="s838">I don't often talk, maybe two or three times a year because that saying it gets easier as you keep doing it, it isn't at all true with this.</span> <span id="s839">Somehow, it's harder.</span> <span id="s840">Every time I give a talk or give an interview I get pushed back into that time and it takes me weeks to get out of the depression.</span> <span id="s841">I don't know why, whether it's because I'm older and I'm beginning to see that I'm at the end of my life rather than at the beginning or whether I feel so hopeless about the world because of the way it's going, feeling that all that's happened that somehow there was such an evil unleashed in Auschwitz that it's lingering to this day.</span> <span id="s842">We haven't learned or been able to rise above it.</span> <span id="s843">It was something not of this world happened there and it continues.</span> <span id="s844">It continues, where I don't know.</span> <span id="s845">It's hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Do you still think that you are being hurt now, differently, understood differently than all your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: I know my mom even though she's gone now but when I first started speaking she never came to anything.</span> <span id="s848">She never watched any of the TV shows.</span> <span id="s849">She could never look at the books.</span> <span id="s850">In a way I wanted her to.</span> <span id="s851">I wanted her to be a little proud of me, not that I'd rather have done something else greater, but this is what I have.</span> <span id="s852">I'm trying to make -- to do something for humanity with it.</span> <span id="s853">If I can just touch one person to kind of give over the message that we're all people and we all have feelings and we shouldn't hate.</span> <span id="s854">You don't have to agree with me.</span> <span id="s855">We don't have to be the same religion but we can respect each other.</span> <span id="s856">We don't even have to like each other if that's too difficult, but there's a sanctity to human life which we've totally lost sight of and my friends understand me better today, but even today I'm still very much that little girl who's scared of authority.</span> <span id="s857">Policemen terrify me.</span> <span id="s858">I'm still very much that little Holocaust kid who's there in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Are you still trying to deal with everything yourself then, or have you ever seen a therapist or have you asked your family to help you in a different way?</span> <span id="s860">Have you ever reached out?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s862">As I said, Doctor Kestenberg has seen me professionally as a therapist and that's been helpful to me.</span> <span id="s863">I think speaking with my brother -- we've gotten very, very close.</span> <span id="s864">We're almost inseparable.</span> <span id="s865">It's too bad we live such a distance.</span> <span id="s866">My children, it's still hard to talk to them but I think they're very interested.</span> <span id="s867">They always want to look at the pictures.</span> <span id="s868">They always want to know what's the latest thing and what did I find out.</span> <span id="s869">They come to my lectures.</span> <span id="s870">They come to the TV things even though they don't want to be part of this.</span> <span id="s871">But it's hard for their kids too, because even though in my attempt all my life to protect them from this, I guess I was a little bizarre.</span> <span id="s872">I mean, I was a strange mother.</span> <span id="s873">Let's go back to the stale bread.</span> <span id="s874">They laughed me out of the house all the time with that, but my values seem to be somewhat different.</span> <span id="s875">So, I think they saw some crying and things that they didn't understand.</span> <span id="s876">At a joyous thing you'd find me crying because I'm saying "My mom and dad aren't here."</span> <span id="s877">And what would life have been like, and I wish my parents could know my kids.</span> <span id="s878">Would they finally be proud of me.</span> <span id="s879">It's hard.</span> <span id="s880">I think my kids have somehow subliminarily absorbed some of my hurt even though I tried desperately to protect them and not be an overprotective mother.</span> <span id="s881">I deliberately leaned back the other way.</span> <span id="s882">"Yeah, you can cross the street, okay."</span> <span id="s883">I'm joking about that, but I really tried to be -- I was always reading these child rearing books from Doctor Spock to everybody.</span> <span id="s884">I wanted to be sure that I was not making them nuts with my worries and fears.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Can you describe for me a little bit this home here?</span> <span id="s888">What feelings do you have?</span> <span id="s889">What makes it home for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Well, I never thought about that.</span> <span id="s891">Well, my children would make it home for me, but my older daughter is now married and my younger one about to get married in Israel.</span> <span id="s892">So, I miss them a great deal but I have photos everywhere.</span> <span id="s893">I think what makes this home for me is the fact that I have finally gotten my hands on some memorabilia from my early childhood and I have a vast collection of pictures of myself with Rene and my parents and just looking at them I can piece together the kind of life we must have had and the kind of life my parents tried to provide for us.</span> <span id="s894">It looks like we were very happy children, so I think my parents did a really good job.</span> <span id="s895">In some ways, maybe their love and their strength helped both of us survive somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: You do have MS now.</span> <span id="s897">What is it like for you to live with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: In a word it's a horror.</span> <span id="s899">The worst thing about having MS is that I've actually had to go to a doctor and I actually have to go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s900">I actually need therapy.</span> <span id="s901">I have to keep dealing with these medical people which for me is a nightmare.</span> <span id="s902">It's my own trauma.</span> <span id="s903">I never wanted to go to doctors, and don't like them much.</span> <span id="s904">I try to stay out of hospitals.</span> <span id="s905">But I've had to come to terms with the fact that this illness I do need the therapy and I do need a doctor's supervision of medication and I can really say is that somehow I've been blessed I don't know whether by my parents who are gone, but I've been blessed with a neurologist who is so sensitive to my needs and understands my hang up with doctors and is so gentle and just kind of try to point me in the right direction and never pushes.</span> <span id="s906">He is actually not just my doctor anymore, he's just become one of my very best friends.</span> <span id="s907">So, that's turned out okay.</span> <span id="s908">But I still, when he says "Go to the lab for blood work."</span> <span id="s909">I say "Do I have to?</span> <span id="s910">I really don't want to.</span> <span id="s911">Can we do it next month?"</span> <span id="s912">And he says, "Okay, we'll wait."</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Is there any distinction by the way between your feelings about female or male doctors because it seems that male doctors --?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Actually my neurologist is a male doctor.</span> <span id="s915">I've always tried to find myself a female doctor very unsuccessfully, so that's where I am.</span> <span id="s916">The other thing I hate about MS besides the medical side of it, is that I'm no different than any other MS person.</span> <span id="s917">It's robbed me of my independence and my need to excel and be independent and do for others and this really curtails that a lot.</span> <span id="s918">I find that I need to depend on people, which is very hard for me because I've never found that I really could depend on people and I do have now some wonderful friends that I can depend on but I'm still in the end and I try not to ask too much from anybody because I fell I'll overstep my requests and it will be hard to do things for me all the time so very often I just suffer it out myself.</span> <span id="s919">I still feel alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: So this particular illness has in a way is doing the same thing to you that your experience in the Holocaust has done for you, has it?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s922">And it's also society and the way they react to someone who's not well.</span> <span id="s923">That doesn't help.</span> <span id="s924">Although I try to educate them and joke a lot with them.</span> <span id="s925">I keep telling people that just because I'm in a wheel chair doesn't mean that I don't have a brain.</span> <span id="s926">You don't have to talk slowly to me and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s927">Just kind of, when you think about it, it's sad that this has to be said in the year 1995.</span> <span id="s928">You'd think we'd be more educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: We have talked about the impact of the Holocaust on your life and also this interview, but if I were to ask you to think and describe in one capsule, how do you feel that experience has really shaped your life, what would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: That's really a hard question.</span> <span id="s931">I can only really say that no matter how hard I try, everything in my life always leads back to the Holocaust and Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s932">It's just always, always there beneath everything.</span> <span id="s933">Perhaps, it has made me in a strange kind of way I think I'm strong because of it.</span> <span id="s934">People always tell me, "Oh, you're so strong."</span> <span id="s935">I don't know if I'm strong but I feel I have an endurance that's beyond the average.</span> <span id="s936">I can tolerate more things.</span> <span id="s937">I have more patience.</span> <span id="s938">I appreciate things more because I always know how elusive they can be and how very quickly things could change.</span> <span id="s939">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: For so many years your memories were denied, now that you're working on that much more in a positive way and also trying to work through it in therapy and so on, do you feel that some memories are safer to be buried to be gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s942">I've talked about a lot things and I talk with my therapist about a great many memories and things, but there is -- I find there is some kind of a line.</span> <span id="s943">There are certain things I don't want to even try to put to words because I can't.</span> <span id="s944">I can't and I don't want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Have you seen those movies that came out -- there was a great debate in the Jewish community too, anyway, do you think that experience can be expressed adequately in popular films or how do you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: I think it's a two sided thing.</span> <span id="s947">It's important to do it.</span> <span id="s948">A lot of people will not read the books and not attend the lectures and a lot of people need to have things -- movies that are popular.</span> <span id="s949">I think it's always watered down, and somehow it takes away from it.</span> <span id="s950">I'm not even expressing it properly but it was so horrible and so awesome and so out of this world that you can dilute it and make it into a popular film, it just loses.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Is there anything that you would like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: I have a lot to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: There are some memorabilia from your life here on the sofa and it would be nice if maybe you could say something about them maybe one after another.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: This is Life Magazine from November 1947 and it is an article about me and another little boy who came from Europe to help raise funds for the European war orphans and we're pictured sitting on a step of some sort and behind us are all these clothes that have been bought for us.</span> <span id="s955">More clothes than we've ever seen in our life.</span> <span id="s956">I'm sitting -- I have long curls.</span> <span id="s957">I always say that's probably why they chose me to be this so-called poster child.</span> <span id="s958">I notice that I'm wearing a plaid dress which was one of the best dresses in the orphanage and that is the only dress I came with.</span> <span id="s959">In the orphanage we wore the same clothing every single day and then for the sabbath we would get a new pretty little dress and then back into our old -- it would get washed and we'd get it back again on Sunday.</span> <span id="s960">We didn't have designer jeans or I have to have a blue sweater today or a red sweater tomorrow.</span> <span id="s961">We had what we had.</span> <span id="s962">I see about five outfits for me with a coat and a hat and Charlie also.</span> <span id="s963">We each had a -- I'm holding on to a pink teddy bear and Charlie is holding on to a very nice gray elephant.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: And that is the article that Doctor Kilina saw and recognized you?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Right.</span> <span id="s966">He recognized the name Irene Goodman.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Now which one has the letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: The letter is in that one.</span> <span id="s969">On occasion packages would come to the orphanage from America with clothing and shoes and always Mr. Tenzer would bring us Barton's candy and gum which we kids just could not get enough of.</span> <span id="s970">One day a shipment came and there was this beautiful red sandals and I had been wearing brown shoes and this plain dress.</span> <span id="s971">We wore the same clothing every single day except for Shobot and I really wanted those red shoes desperately.</span> <span id="s972">So, when we got to trying them on the shoes were really tight on me but I said "They feel great.</span> <span id="s973">They're perfect.</span> <span id="s974">I love them."</span> <span id="s975">I got them.</span> <span id="s976">The next day we were on an outing near Paris and we went on this long walk and I'm walking in my red sandals and before very long I can barely walk because I've got blisters and sores and my feet are bleeding.</span> <span id="s977">The shoes don't fit me.</span> <span id="s978">The shoes don't fit and the counselor who was with us noticed and looked at my feet and said "Why did you say that they fit?"</span> <span id="s979">"I wanted red shoes and they were the only red shoes."</span> <span id="s980">I hated my brown shoes.</span> <span id="s981">The out shot of the story was they took the red shoes away from me, but they had to buy me shoes and I got the white, white sandals.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: So there was a little bit of vanity there?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Here's the letter you sent Rene.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Actually, these are two letters that I wrote to Rene after we found him.</span> <span id="s986">I could read them.</span> <span id="s987">They're kind of funny.</span> <span id="s988">This is written March 5, 1950.</span> <span id="s989">"Dear Rene.</span> <span id="s990">I thought you had lots of fun.</span> <span id="s991">I had lots of fun in school.</span> <span id="s992">We saw a play about Esther and (in Hebrew.)</span> <span id="s993">Today, I'm going ice skating with my friend."</span> <span id="s994">I've drawn a picture of an ice skate.</span> <span id="s995">"Love and kisses, Irene."</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: What's the date on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: March 5, 1950.</span> <span id="s998">Now, another letter, but it's not dated.</span> <span id="s999">It's probably around the same time.</span> <span id="s1000">"Dear Rene, I received your letter and I'm glad that you are well and enjoyed your trip to the Tatra mountains.</span> <span id="s1001">I live near the ocean and soon we will go bathing every day.</span> <span id="s1002">My school and piano keep me very busy.</span> <span id="s1003">I'm learning how to ride a bicycle.</span> <span id="s1004">Dear Rene, I hope you will be together soon with me.</span> <span id="s1005">Lot's of love and kisses from all of us.</span> <span id="s1006">Your loving sister, Irene."</span> <span id="s1007">The English is not so great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: This is another --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: This is a little hand-operated music box with an angel at the top on a tree with birds.</span> <span id="s1010">It belongs to my father and my aunt in Dresden gave it to me when I visited her, and it plays this song in German.</span> <span id="s1011">"All the Birds are Here Again."</span> <span id="s1012">That little angel on top has a mandolin and it turns around as the music is playing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: I forgot to ask you one question.</span> <span id="s1014">Do you have any hobbies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Yes, I love calligraphy.</span> <span id="s1016">It's just the love of my life.</span> <span id="s1017">I discovered -- well, I've always loved letters but I wasn't aware of the so-called "art of calligraphy" until about 1978.</span> <span id="s1018">But, if I look at some of my notebooks from years back I can see even grade school I was making these fancy letters and always printing neatly, taking great pride in my writing.</span> <span id="s1019">Then, I discovered calligraphy.</span> <span id="s1020">I used to do it -- I thought I was getting fairly good at it and then this MS came along and kind of cut my career, but I love it so much that I continue doing it with my shaky hand by using weights.</span> <span id="s1021">I use a mouse stick as well and I look like a person from outer space when I do it but it really brings me a great deal of joy.</span> <span id="s1022">I love making pictures out of words.</span> <span id="s1023">I do it especially for friends.</span> <span id="s1024">I love making cards and I make my neurologist a calendar every year on his birthday and he's got an office full of my work hanging on the walls.</span> <span id="s1025">You don't see the work now.</span> <span id="s1026">It's all behind the sofa because we've recently papered here, so everything came down.</span> <span id="s1027">I think if not for my calligraphy I would lose my sanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: You have also done poetry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1030">And I also -- a well kept secret, I do poetry.</span> <span id="s1031">I started it because Doctor Kestenberg has suggested to me that I write.</span> <span id="s1032">When I brought her the first poem she said you should really do this.</span> <span id="s1033">You really have a knack and every time I've done something she has made sure it has gotten into a journal, into a book, into a something.</span> <span id="s1034">I don't feel I have the talent.</span> <span id="s1035">I think they're just poems, but she likes them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Would you be willing to share one or two?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: So, these are one or two poems that you have written?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Yes, and most of my poems are really a reflection of how I felt as a child because that's how I understood things around me.</span> <span id="s1040">This particular poem was written -- it was about Rene, my mother and I are going from Theresienstadt and we're on this march to the train that's going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1041">"The long column painfully marches on a journey to the end surrounded by the darkness black with terror yet untold.</span> <span id="s1042">Silence shattered by rifle fire, dogs ferociously bark, bodies falling to the ground eventually lie still.</span> <span id="s1043">The snow so white upon the field is muddy slush beneath my feet.</span> <span id="s1044">Icy chill invades my bones, fingers aflame with searing pain, weariness engulfs me.</span> <span id="s1045">Mother quickly prods me on.</span> <span id="s1046">I hold back my tears and silently march on."</span> <span
