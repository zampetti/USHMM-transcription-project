There were 40 people in the small room that served as their hiding place.</span> <span id="s48">People in warsaw ghetto basically worked in a factory making brushes for the</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Supposedly you were needed if you had a factory button on, but when the Germans came in they would take anyone.</span> <span id="s51">Ny sister got sick and the doctor said that she needed to live in the country and get out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s52">She got sicker every day and the only way to get out of the ghetto was on a truck taking out merchandise from the factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">1:12:02 To get out you had to go by a gate with a check point.</span> <span id="s54">Her sister was on a truck and father gave her id papers saying that she was Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">1:13:05 Before the ghetto, my father arranged for his business to be taken over by a Christian customer, and he taught this man the business.</span> <span id="s56">The customer wanted to help my father out.</span> <span id="s57">I got letters from mom up until the Russian war.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">1:14:05 Mom had good chance of surviving.</span> <span id="s59">Customer loved children and helped them out a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">1:15:20 The customer was a devout catholic and spent he days in the orphanage helping out.</span> <span id="s61">This orphanage was very self supporting.</span> <span id="s62">My sister went to the convent and liked it there and my father was relieved.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">1:16:40 My sister, Helen, was 16 yrs.</span> <span id="s64">old and at this age children would be sent out to jobs in the area.</span> <span id="s65">My sister was put in charge of the nursery and was improving daily.</span> <span id="s66">Times worse and worse daily in the Ghetto for me but I didn't want to leave my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">1:18:00 In 1943, when I was 17, I left the Ghetto out the same way as my sister.</span> <span id="s68">I was in charge of children a little bit older than my sister's group.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">1:19:00 Story of 12 yr.</span> <span id="s70">old girl who got out after her father had been shot in the street by the Germans.</span> <span id="s71">She went to the convent as well.</span> <span id="s72">Stayed in convent until the spring of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">1:20:00 Since we were without ID's, the sisters made us leave after they found out that the Gestapo was looking for Jewish children in convents.</span> <span id="s74">We went to the house of the man who took over my father's business, but his wife was scared, so he turned to a friend and he said that he would let them staying an extra room for American gold coins.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">1:21:10 We stayed in one room until Fall 1944, the Polish uprising.</span> <span id="s76">In September I saw out of the window barricades</span></p> <p><span id="s77">everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">1:22:05 I was told that the Germans had left the area, but then they dropped bombs on the area and leveled the town.</span> <span id="s79">I felt free and walked around.</span> <span id="s80">You could only walk in one direction in the town because of the barricades and the road ended by the trains and we found out that we were going to be used as slave laborers.</span> <span id="s81">I had no where to go and had no ID.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">1:23:20 By train we went into Germany and into a camp where we were later segregated for work.</span> <span id="s83">There were 15,000 prisoners there.</span> <span id="s84">I met a man there who was sympathetic for us and he brought food for us at night.</span> <span id="s85">He came one time and gave them advice that in the morning people will be called out of the barracks to go to an underground munitions factory.</span> <span id="s86">He advised us that we should stay in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">1:24:45 We did stay inside.</span> <span id="s88">The next day they called us out and sent us to do domestic work in a restaurant where we had</span></p> <p><span id="s89">good conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">1:26:00 We would get the coal to heat up the restaurant from across the street.</span> <span id="s91">This work was ok for me to do, but not for the 12 yr old girl.</span> <span id="s92">I talked to those in charge of us and they let the girl do whatever she wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">1:27:15 Little girl was happy and they were very close.</span> <span id="s94">Her hair was long, brown, and kinky, this scared me because it would give her Jewish identity away.</span> <span id="s95">So, I would buy her some bleach for her hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">1:28:10 The bleach burned her hair and made her suffer, but her hair was blond.</span> <span id="s97">I worked in the kitchen until April of 1945.</span> <span id="s98">Next day bomb raids in the city.</span> <span id="s99">Everyone was moved to another city and the planes did the same there.</span> <span id="s100">I came out of the shelter one day and heard english being spoken and I introduced myself to a Jewish American soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">1:30:00 The soldier asked me about me family and he let me stay where the soldiers were.</span> <span id="s102">He got out a prayer book, but I couldn't read the Hebrew or speak Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">1:31:05 I was in shock and he took care of us.</span> <span id="s104">We communicated in English and slowly the Jewish came back.</span> <span id="s105">And then he took us to a camp "Dora".</span></p> <p><span id="s106">1:32:02 The camp was for displaced persons after the war.</span> <span id="s107">We went to the Polish section.</span> <span id="s108">(During the war it was a concentration camp where underground they were making bombers) There was a hospital there and I wanted to work</span></p> <p><span id="s109">there.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">1:33:11 I segregated papers for them.</span> <span id="s111">I saw a group of people come up to the hospital, among them was my husband to be.</span> <span id="s112">He was helping to prepare for the Nuremberg trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">1:34:10 He invited me to a barrack to a get together.</span> <span id="s114">I was still ambivalent about being Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">1:35:10 He told me about a train going to France.</span> <span id="s116">And we went on to Paris and got a room in a house for displaced persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">1:36:15 I got a job with a Polish family, helping them sew.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">The arrangement was good.</span> <span id="s119">I wrote a letter to the girl's aunt in Palestine and told her about their situation.</span> <span id="s120">The aunt wrote back that the little girl must come to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">1:37:10 The little girl could have been smuggled in and was taken to Palestine, although it was a difficult trip for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">The parting was sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">1:39:10 In 1948 she was taken into the Israeli army and fought in the war of Independence.</span> <span id="s124">My mother was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">When I was in Paris I wrote the Jewish community in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">1:40:00 My sister was working at this office.</span> <span id="s127">I got a letter from her and we corresponded a lot.</span> <span id="s128">I then got married and</span></p> <p><span id="s129">moved to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">1:41:10 I then found out that my mother was out of Russia.</span> <span id="s131">My mother was not allowed to go back to Warsaw because of the living conditions.</span> <span id="s132">But she did one day go there to look through the lists of people to find relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">1:42:05 My mother was reunited with my sister.</span> <span id="s134">I have a picture from 1941 of my sister and I and we had sent it to my mother when she was in Siberia and she still had it when they</span></p> <p><span id="s135">were reunited.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">1:43:10 I heard of Truman's quota of displaced persons to come to the US and we took advantage of this and came to America in the summer of 1946.</span> <span id="s137">My mother stayed in Poland until 1947.</span> <span id="s138">My mother and some of her children went to Israel and made their home there.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">1:45:00 My mother came to US a few times; her heart was very much with America because some of her family would come to US every so often before war time.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">1:46:20 My mother's family, in the early 20's, moved to America, but she was married and stayed on in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">1:47:33 Her family was doing very well in Poland and the children were able to go to private schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">1:48:05 In 1939 my mother wanted to go to the world's fair in the US, this would have been the first time in 2022 years that she would have been able to see her mother, then the war broke out.</span> <span id="s143">When my mother came to the US after the war she met a lot of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">1:49:20 A great reunion in the US with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">1:50:00 The uprising was in April 1943, I left in January and my father had left the Ghetto in the trucks carrying merchandise.</span> <span id="s146">I met him in his office.</span> <span id="s147">He gave me a handkerchief of his to remember him by.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">1:51:20 My father's biggest wish was to be able to save his children, and he was able to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">1:52:00 My father went back into the Ghetto to save the little girl's mother and no one really knows what might have happened to him.</span> <span id="s150">He was killed somehow.</span> <span id="s151">The little girl's mother was sent to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">1:53:15 My father died in 1943.</span> <span id="s153">We could see the flames from the ghetto in the convent and we were very sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">1:54:15 We told the mother superior that we were Jewish and that we were scared for our father in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s155">The mother superior said that she wished she could have known this before, perhaps she could have let our father be a night watchman.</span> <span id="s156">Our father gave us a lot of money in gold coins we gave it to the mother superior to hide for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">1:55:00 After the war the sisters gave the money back to my sister.</span> <span id="s158">They wrote to me.</span> <span id="s159">The sisters never betrayed us.</span> <span id="s160">The customer who had taken care of us earlier was a kind man and truly wanted to help us in any way possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">1:56:10 After the war when my mother came back and knew that he had the money, he was no where to be found.</span> <span id="s162">The man respected and loved my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">1:57:20 My only wish is that my father had never left Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">We would have had a chance to survive as a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">1:58:01 I wish that we had never gone back to Warsaw and would have kept my father.</span> <span id="s166">I am thankful that my mother survived.</span> <span id="s167">My mother had a tree that lived as long as she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">1:59:08 In the last two years of my mother's life I went to Israel 4 or 5 times to take care of my her.</span></p> <p><span
