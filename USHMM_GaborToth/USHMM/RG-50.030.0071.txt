Q: The Hungarians now had taken over your town. Tell me about the stores, about the business stores.
A: Okay, Romania, okay? The Iron Guard, Iron Guard was taking over slowly everything. Plus, there come a law that all Jewish family should turn in, some such and such a some day, two pairs or two pairs of shoes, three pairs of underhose, hats, and everything. This was prescribed that for families what you -- they -- should turn in to the Iron Guard main office. When you complain they vicious, they take you and beat you. And it was very -- that was the terrible situation, okay? I mean, everybody start to complain. If you have not home what they asking for, you go -- when you have money, you go to buy brand new things and to turn over to the Iron Guard. This was where the starting, okay? After the -- in one day, I was doing very much sport. I like very much the sport -- up to date, I like. And one day I was going home from a sport club, about nine o'clock in the evening. And because the Iron Guard was patrolling the streets, everybody was afraid you do not fell in their hands. And I was going home from the sport club, and I was stopped from a, a, a patrol, Iron Guard patrol.
They was in civil with, with arms, with pistols and arms. But in civil -- not in uniform. Only they had a green banderole -- band on their hand. And they asked me who I am. I told my name. From my name, they don't know that I am a Jew or that I am not a Jew. And they ask me -- not ask me for my identity card. And they asked me for identity card only when take me in the, the, the main station from the Iron Guard. And asked me, "You are a Jew, or not a Jew?" I am afraid to tell that I am not a Jew, because later or early maybe they find out that was – small world for me. I told, "I am a Jew." "Okay, you come with us." And they have already collected about five, six people between this -- pregnant woman, too. And they take in the main office, or the main headquarters, from the Iron Guards, what was in a park, in a park in Arad, in my home town. And we are waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting. I heard crying. They start to take. Because they separated everything, everybody, okay? And this lady, who was pregnant, I heard that she was crying. She's beat, beat up absolutely -- they beat 'til blood is coming out from her. She's a pregnant woman. And we heard this, that there’s crying, and heard voices, very strange voices from everywhere, from all the rooms.
Was a dark room in the basement. After that, they call me by name. They take me in a room. They told me, "Take out your pants." Okay? And they take a wire stick and start to beat me. Beat me, and beat me, and beat me. Then they told me, "Okay, turn down." And they start to beat me. Finally, when they finish -- when they were tired out already, they put me near the door. Near the door, and with the leg kicked me out from the door, and I fell on the street.
I'm sure I cannot pick up -- that pick up, and I can't not get up from this terrible what happening to me. And, fortunately, come a guy who was, belonged to the Iron Guard, but was living in same house when I was living. And he saw me, and he pick up me. And he told me, "I will take home. Do not happen again to you, to the hold somebody again on the street. I will take you home." And he take me home. And I can't not sleep two weeks, only on my belly. I was terrible painful. I have terrible -- all my back was terrible looking. And after two weeks, I start to be slowly, slowly, I start to be okay. I think this was a very nice introduction from the Iron Guard, and start, how start the, the Hitlerism take over. And later come a law. In 1940, and there come a law. In 1938, I was in the army until 1939.
01:13:55
Q: Tell me about the army. What was your life like?
A: The army was not antisemitism. Absolutely nothing, in my time. In 1938, what I incorporated in the army. Everybody who's finished high schools, or I mean higher schools, should make only one year army. Other people, was not only the primary schools, was laws schools -- was making two years army, two and a half years army. After one year, we should have liberated in '39. We are not liberated because there start the Hitlerism -- I mean, the Hitlerism start to come to, very close to Romania. Czechoslovakia was occupied, and Hungary partial, and -- in army, was not problem because we are Jew. In this time -- in '38, '39 -- was no problem. Absolutely, there no problem with this. Even we had in army Jewish officers and Jewish doctors, and was no problem. Absolutely no problem. In '41, after the was the Iron Guard, and Antonescuwas the President -- Prime Minister and the President -- of Romania. There come a law that not allow anymore to the Jewish people to be in the army. To -- every Jewish should be taken out from the army. Okay, we don't know what, what they mean this. We are happy first time that we are not, should not go in the army, should not go in the war or something like this. But later,come a law again that, that every Jewish -- youngsters from 18 'til 55 years old -- should go in a works camp. Should go in a works camp. “Ah, should go in a works camp. What we can do? We cannot do anything against the government.” But what will happen in a works camp, we don't know. What work we should do, we don't know either. In July 1941, come a order, it was publisized in the newspaper and everybody get the paper that should go in -- in our hometown was a fortress, started from Maria Theresa,remaining -- also Hungarian. And should go in this fortress, to be ready to go to work somewhere. That mean we should take clotheses and everything to go 4 Ion Antonescu (1882-1946), Romanian General 5 Empress of the Habsburg Empire and Queen of Hungary between 1740 and 1780.
to work. To change their clothes, everything, okay? And everybody, in day what was indicated, we go there. Some with parents, some with wives, some with husband, with children, who has children. But nobody was allowed to enter into the fortress, only outside. And everybody was -- the wives was, the mothers was crying. "What will happen with my husband?" "What will happen with my child?" "What with," or something like this. So everybody was crying, crying. Was a terrible situation. I mean, we were inside. This was in the morning. We stayed there 'til evening -- evening, 'til evening. They make a list, everybody where should go. Which camp should go. They're many, many camps, okay? I was reportized (ph) or put in a camp to Sighisoara. Sighisoara -- this was about 300 miles from my home town -- to work in a railway station in Sighisoara, to excavate or to demolished a mountain to make room for the new new line for the -- because the German has not enough line to pass over the station, enough fast. That mean we should make more lines, that they should come more fast in fast over to go to the Russian border to, to Russia. And we start to work; I start to work as a miner. As a miner, my -- with a very primitive situation. We should make holes in rock with a about three, two meter -- I don't know, about six feet, seven feet long steel stick. With this, we should make hole in rock. And after the, they put it dynamite in this rock and explode it. Explosion, okay? And all the stone what should come out, this should be transported from there because everything -- all the line was full with small stones and big stones, and all the people was working in this, to build a new line. We were working there 'til wintertime.

Q: What was it like? What, what was the working conditions like at Sighisoara?
A: The working condition: We are living in a -- we are living – they put us in a unfinished school building. They have, this building has no windows. They have no doors. The wind is blowing over everywhere when was raining, was everywhere, okay? It was terrible situation. And we were sleeping on the floor. Yeah, on the floor. This was the situation. We, our food was -- I don't know how I tell you. You can eat it. You can eat it. You can eat it. Why?
Because the Jewish Community was sent money and food. The Jewish Community from our city was sending food and money to buy – not we should buy, they should buy it, okay? The camp should buy food for us, and to make better the life. A little better. A little bit better, okay? And they allow the parents to send packages. They allowed this, yes. But the works condition was terrible because was very heavy work, very difficult work. Was terrible. My, my best friend was die there, because when was exploding, what make the blasting, this, the rocks, one rock come in his head. And he die immediately there.

Finding some professional people, because they need in the camp. And in different places. And I has never was working in electric field. And I hand up my hand, I told, "I am a electrician." I have no idea about electricity. I am afraid about electricity up to date. I told I am electrician. Maybe I, maybe I can get some better job, or some more easy, to make my life more easy.

And we left to Israel from -- and we stay in Israel seven years, and after seven years, my -- we decided that we come into America. That this was same thing a cause why we come America, because we were living in Jerusalem. This was the Six Day War.
And you know, when Jerusalem was occupied, was liberated or was survive until the last few days. Jerusalem. And we stay in basement three days and three nights. And was terrible. Very close to where we are living in Jerusalem, in KeeryatShemonah (ph) in Jerusalem, very close to us was the Jordanian border. And we know from the papers, from the radio, from everywhere, that they give knife, give that small children. "When you can go over this border, where you find a Jew you should kill them." And I survive, my wife was surviving; and we told -- we have then our daughter. And we told we don't want to happen to my daughter what happen to us. My wife get a contract in Boston, the Children's Hospital, for two years. And thus we come in this way in America. I have a very nice apartment in Jerusalem, but we not sold. We keep open. We keep open. We not thought that we stay here for every, all the times here in America; maybe one day we go back. So I not sold my apartment, my sheekoon.And later, we sold it because I was thinking, I lost my pension in Romania. By that I mean when we left Romania, I lost my pension. Every day I am not younger, I am older. I left Israel. My wife can go back, because she was working by the Kupat-Holim. And there the Kupat-Holim was still open her job. I lost my job, because start already the Russian immigration and they not keep open the jobs. They hire people. You know, they want replace the people. I lost my pension in Romania, I lost my pension in Israel. I don't want to lose anymore; that mean I can't not go back.

A: No, the Russian doesn't liberate it. Was the Romanian in our hometown.
Q: Okay, let's go back a little. Tell us what happened, There's an incident that happened after the Romanians had liberated your town.
A: Okay, when after was liberated, I come home in September. After I arrive home in September in my hometown, in Arad, in one night the Hungarian Army enter in Arad. And they stay about one weeks in our hometown -- I mean, in Arad. And they start to do, start to finished, maybe, in the fortress a gas chamber for the local Jewish people. Then from Arad Jewish people, we are 30,000 people in Arad. And we heard this from some Christian people, that they're doing this. This was not confirmed by nobody, okay? Because nobody see this, because nobody can enter in the fortress. And we know, and all the Jewish people know that; we are very, very afraid and scary that will take us in this gas chamber and exterminate us. Because it's not take too long time to exterminate the people; it go very fast. And I heard this, and I told to my parents, "I escape for four years from the camp, and then I home. I don't want in the last days," because the Russian was approaching very close to our hometown. Very close. They was very close already. "And I don't want to perish now, to die now. And because you are elderly people, I was leaving." He told me, "Okay, we will hide you somewhere where are Christian landlord." And take care about my parents. And I left home. And in our city is the Mures River. And on other side of the Mures River was the fortress. On this side, was already Hungarian Army. And I was going to some Christian people that knowed us, was very good friend for me. And I can hide from there, I can stay that it's happen something. Until the Russian Army will enter maybe, and occupy this territory. And I was going, going, going in my way until the river, okay? I was meet there Hungarian soldiers. They put cable down near the river, because they want to, to blast the bridges between the city and between the fortress. Was one railway bridge, and two regular bridge for the cars and people, okay? Passed there. And I asked this Hungarian soldier, "What you are doing?" And he told me, "We put now down this cable to blow up the bridges." He not ask me that I am a Jew, or "What you are doing?" Nothing. This was my luck. I was scary, and I was trembling maybe they ask me something. They not ask me anything, because that already, they told me they are very busy because the Russian Army is very close. Very close to Arad. And I am asking, "Where is the Russian Army now?" You know? "Because you tell that you are very busy, and rush, rush, rush." And he saw me on his hand, his hand, that "We are -- around the city is already the Russian Army." He told me, the stupid guy. How can you tell already to somebody, to a private citizen, something as this?
This stupid Hungarian soldier. And I was happy that I heard this. And he was right -- in a couple of minutes later when I escaped from them, and I go on my way to my friends. And couple of minutes, all the bridges was blow up. And the Russian Army enter in two days after this, in two days, in Arad, and occupy Arad. They take out the Hungarian Army from our city; and so the Jewish people from, in our hometown escape from the gas chamber.
Q: Thank you very much.
A: You're welcome.
