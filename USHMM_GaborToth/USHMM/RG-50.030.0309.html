Tell me a little bit about what you remember about growing up in Zagreb, your family --</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A. I was an only child.</span> <span id="s17">I had a set of grandparents, my mother's parents.</span> <span id="s18">My mother, my father and I lived in the same house.</span> <span id="s19">My father was a merchant, my grandfather was also a merchant: textiles.</span> <span id="s20">My grandfather had the store in the house, in the building.</span> <span id="s21">My father's store was in the city but not far from home.</span> <span id="s22">We had a very nice apartment.</span> <span id="s23">We also had a maid and a cook and (laughing) a laundress.</span> <span id="s24">So we were pretty well-to-do.</span> <span id="s25">I went to a Hebrew private school for four years, I think it was four years, yes.</span> <span id="s26">And then I went to the gymnasium, the public school, till I was about sixteen.</span> <span id="s27">And that's when the trouble started.</span> <span id="s28">And I still went for about half a year to Catholic school for domestic whatever they were going to teach us but I wasn't there long because we had to leave our house at a certain time and I couldn't go to school any more, that was the end of my education.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q. I just want to get some of the Jewish community in Zagreb and whether you were integrated with Catholics, or whether you went to the gymnasium with that --</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A.</span> <span id="s31">That was public school, jah.</span> <span id="s32">The first four years was private school, the rest was public school.</span> <span id="s33">It was a public high school and I graduated from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q. Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A.</span> <span id="s36">We were conservative, ------.</span> <span id="s37">We went to synagogue every Friday and Saturday.</span> <span id="s38">We observed all the holidays but it wasn't the way the Orthodox because there weren't any.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q.</span> <span id="s40">Did you have Catholic friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A. Yes I did.</span> <span id="s42">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q.</span> <span id="s44">Did you sense any anti-semitism before the War?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q.</span> <span id="s46">In my German teacher.</span> <span id="s47">She resented the fact that I spoke German before she ever did, and I spoke German and she always corrected me.</span> <span id="s48">I said, "Lady, I knew first before you did" and that rubbed her the wrong way, because she learned it in school, it wasn't her mother tongue; my German was my mother tongue.</span> <span id="s49">And with the Yugoslav teachers, they didn't like me too much either because they were my mother's teachers, so I preferred the ideas they were my teachers and her teachers at the same time and they remembered my mother and they remembered me.</span> <span id="s50">But I don't know, it was just the feeling that they didn't like me; I don't know for what reason.</span> <span id="s51">The German teacher I know for sure she didn't care one way or the other.</span> <span id="s52">If I said one way, she would pronounce it the other way and she just got always my case because I the French teacher and the Hebrew teacher and lots of teachers different nationalities -- not nationalities, really, different points of view they had about different things.</span> <span id="s53">But there wasn't anything that you had to fear or that you had to be upset about.</span> <span id="s54">Maybe --------- to realize, I don't think there was any anti-semitism at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q.</span> <span id="s56">You didn't know it could come out agai.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q.</span> <span id="s59">In the Jewish community in Zagreb were there political organizations, youth organizations, Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q. Yes.</span> <span id="s61">I belonged to Makabe (ph) gymnastics for as long as I can remember, from the day I could walk till the day we left.</span> <span id="s62">Gymnatics.</span> <span id="s63">I took fencing and gymnastics.</span> <span id="s64">I enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q. Were your parents involved in any of thee things?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A. Not really, no.</span> <span id="s67">They were busy with the business and Mother was busy raising me, so there was not so much involvement.</span> <span id="s68">In the synagogue; that's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q.</span> <span id="s70">So you mentioned that things started to change.</span> <span id="s71">What happened, and when, about?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A.</span> <span id="s73">You mean about when the War came to the city?</span> <span id="s74">Well, we were thrown out of our house Thursday before the Good Friday 1941.</span> <span id="s75">The Germans came in and they told us to leave within hours with just our clothes ------ and that was the last we'd seen of our house, of our possessions of anything else.</span> <span id="s76">So that was it.</span> <span id="s77">And from that day on we started to go into hiding.</span> <span id="s78">So we hid in the city from April through the following January.</span> <span id="s79">We hid with friends but we had to be on the lookout -- every time somebody rang the doorbell you had to go hide because we didn't know who was coming to get us.</span> <span id="s80">But the Germans that took over our house used it for a prison.</span> <span id="s81">That was the main object to do.</span> <span id="s82">A prison, and my grandfather had a fine cellar and they used that to kill people; to lock them up and eventually kill them.</span> <span id="s83">I don't remember any other soldiers going, they were in the city but they just had to pick on the house.</span> <span id="s84">It was conveniently located and they figured big enough to provide them and there were about four stories high.</span> <span id="s85">There were four tenants on each floor.</span> <span id="s86">There was a factory on the main floor and there was a store on the ground floor.</span> <span id="s87">So they needed the place, they took it, they didn't ask.</span> <span id="s88">So that was the beginning of the end and so they started chasing us around.</span> <span id="s89">You couldn't go out in the streets because you were afraid that somebody might catch you.</span> <span id="s90">They tried to catch my father several times to take him away.</span> <span id="s91">Sometimes they took him and retained him for a few hour and they released him again.</span> <span id="s92">Just plain harassing.</span> <span id="s93">Went on for months and months in this time.</span> <span id="s94">Finally we had some friends in Lublyana, they helped us to get out of Zagreb.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q. Before you left Zagreb, who was the family you were hiding at perhaps, in Zagreb?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A.</span> <span id="s97">They were cousins of my mother's.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q.</span> <span id="s99">So they were also Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A. Oh yes.</span> <span id="s101">I still can't figure out why they weren't after them.</span> <span id="s102">They just happened to be after us or whatever possessed them to do it but they hid with some relatives.</span> <span id="s103">I guess they were hiding too, more or less, you know -- you were sneaking around at night to go out if you wanted to go.</span> <span id="s104">If not, you just stayed in and hoped for the best that nobody was going to catch up with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q.</span> <span id="s106">What about you?</span> <span id="s107">Did you stay in most of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A. Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q.</span> <span id="s110">What was going on in the streets?</span> <span id="s111">I mean, were there suddenly a lot of restrictions on the Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s113">We had to wear a star.</span> <span id="s114">Want to see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q.</span> <span id="s116">You have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q.</span> <span id="s119">After this.</span> <span id="s120">What other kinds of restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A. Well, jah, we didn't go out much, so we didn't run into too much problems.</span> <span id="s122">But if you did go out and didn't wear a star and they caught up with you, then you might have been in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q. Was there ----- presence in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A. I really don't remember.</span> <span id="s125">I mean, from that day on my mind just got kind of blank because I saw the soldiers when they came to get the house and we should get out, but then afterwards I can't remember what happened with the soldiers and I hung around in the house, more or less, not to be seen or heard of.</span> <span id="s126">My father had a German passport, so maybe it gave him a little bit of protection.</span> <span id="s127">From the year that we came to Yugoslavia till we left, he was always a persona non grata for some reason or another, because they only gave him six months of staying time and then he had to go to the police and sign up again six more months, and that went on from 1922 to 1942; for 20 years.</span> <span id="s128">He never became a citizen and he had to go every six months and tell them why he's still there.</span> <span id="s129">But then he got a German passport and that somehow helped us.</span> <span id="s130">I was little but we were stateless at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q.</span> <span id="s132">The people who kicked you out of your house were Croatians, military.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A. No, Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q. And prior to that you didn't feel any retrictions in Jewish, between '40 and 41.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q. Do you remember your family talking about what their plans were, what you were going to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A. Oh yes, we had plans and they were firm plans, too.</span> <span id="s138">We were going to South America, to Uruguay, Montevideo.</span> <span id="s139">We had passports and papers, everything made out in 1939.</span> <span id="s140">And we were going to Motevideo and my parents were going to start like a catering business.</span> <span id="s141">But then when the visas came up, my mother and I we could travel, my father was not allowed to leave the country.</span> <span id="s142">So we stayed behind and we didn't go.</span> <span id="s143">We had everything packed.</span> <span id="s144">I remember the suitcases, everything was packed for South America.</span> <span id="s145">Never got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q.</span> <span id="s147">Why were you going to go to South America?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A. I don't know.</span> <span id="s149">My father one day decided he was going [tape glitch, loss of a phrase] for some reason or other said "Let's look at the map" and he put his finger on it and he says, "Montevideo, Urugay," and that's where we were going to go.</span> <span id="s150">Had the papers ready and the suitcases packed and the clothes for South America and everything.</span> <span id="s151">And we remained there because my mother said she wasn't going to leave him behind.</span> <span id="s152">So she left him behind -- he left us behind when he came to America!</span> <span id="s153">(she laughs) He just wanted to go away, I guess.</span> <span id="s154">Or he had a feeling, he had premonition because he had relatives in Vienna and they were already being chased around, so they came to America or they had to go somewhere else.</span> <span id="s155">So that was 1939 but it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q. Were you aware of refugees from Germany or Austria coming into Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s158">I had a cousin who was in Dachau in 1939 and he escaped Dachau and came to Yugoslavia and he was living with my grandmother for about six months or so.</span> <span id="s159">And he took his life.</span> <span id="s160">And a month before he was going to go to America, he had a sister that worked in Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City and she sent papers for him and he was completely devastated.</span> <span id="s161">I still don't know how he managed to get out of it but he did, but he was completely [she trails off] I had that uncle that was in the army and he ran way from the army too.</span> <span id="s162">He came back but they went to Italy before us so didn't see him again for many years.</span> <span id="s163">Was my mother's brother.</span> <span id="s164">But the cousin, that really shook me up, because he was only, like, fifteen or sixteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q.</span> <span id="s166">But you had information on what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A. Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s168">But I was never told because I was too young to realize what but I knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s169">They wouldn't even tell me that he killed himself, they hushed it up, they were afraid if they would catch us because we were harboring a fugitive from Dachau, the they would probably have give us the heave-ho much sooner.</span> <span id="s170">This was in 1939.</span> <span id="s171">My grandfather was still alive at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q.</span> <span id="s173">This period in Zagreb when you were hiding: were you able to get what you needed -- food or anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q. I think the food at that point was already rationed.</span> <span id="s175">I remember, like, getting one roll a day or something, you know.</span> <span id="s176">It was war already.</span> <span id="s177">Half of the world was already four years in war, so it wasn't easy to get anything but we just didn't have that much liberty to go out and get it.</span> <span id="s178">So just somehow survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q. Do you remember your parents talking about at that point where you were going to go next and what you would do?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A.</span> <span id="s181">We had some friends in Lublyana that had left Zagreb before us and they were trying to get us to cross into Lublyana but at that point it was under Italian, so finally in January of '42 we left Zagreb for Lublyana.</span> <span id="s182">That was a trip I never forget.</span> <span id="s183">We had to cross the border and it was so cold and we went in an oxcart.</span> <span id="s184">Grandma inside the cart and my father and I and my mother on top and we almost froze to death.</span> <span id="s185">My knees froze, my father's ears froze, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s186">But there were soldiers on us, it was like the front already.</span> <span id="s187">There were soldiers there and we didn't know if we weren't going to get killed.</span> <span id="s188">We had no idea what we were getting into.</span> <span id="s189">We crossed the river one night and I remember the only thing I took with me from home was pictures, family pictues, and I dragged those (laughing) for 40 years now.</span> <span id="s190">But that was the only thing I figured I could never replace.</span> <span id="s191">I could replace everything else but this I couldn't and I dragged that with me over hill and dale, over a river, across the border on an oxcart, and finally we made it into a camp some place overnight.</span> <span id="s192">And finlly we got into Lublyana.</span> <span id="s193">Friends were waiting for us and we found a place to live.</span> <span id="s194">We stayed there from January '42 till '43.</span> <span id="s195">But there again the problem started that they were picking up people.</span> <span id="s196">Every time somebody ventured out into the street they picked you up ad detained you for a day, for an hour, for good, then they let you go.</span> <span id="s197">Mostly men, because they were looking for recruits, for somebody they didn't look who the guy was, as long a he could walk.</span> <span id="s198">My father he got caught a couple of times.</span> <span id="s199">We told him not to go but he had to go.</span> <span id="s200">Any time he felt like going out for a smoke he went out, and he got caught.</span> <span id="s201">So he was quite tough but he made the best of it, and we just waited before we could go any further down the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q.</span> <span id="s203">What happened when your father got caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A.</span> <span id="s205">They questioned him for a day and then they let him go.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q. Were they the Italian authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s208">Italian Germans.</span> <span id="s209">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s210">They picked him up and they loaded him on a bus and took him some place for hours at a time and then they brought him back.</span> <span id="s211">And I told him many times, "Don't stick your nose out."</span> <span id="s212">(laughing) But they never learn; never learn, because they always got caught one way or the other.</span> <span id="s213">He got caught once, they were bombing a house in the city and he had to go back for a pack of cigarettes and a bomb fell near the house.</span> <span id="s214">So he learned, (she laughs) but it took him a few years.</span> <span id="s215">He likes the severity of the whole thing, to him it just was something that doesn't happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q.</span> <span id="s217">What was your daily life like in Lubljana?</span> <span id="s218">How did things return?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A. Well, there were nice parks, go for a walk, go out with a friend and that was about it.</span> <span id="s220">There wasn't much to do.</span> <span id="s221">There wasn't anything to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q.</span> <span id="s223">But you could do pretty much what you wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s225">I was always watching our back somebody wasn't after us, or -- actually there wasn't a war, there was a firing line going on; it was just, you know, it was state of war.</span> <span id="s226">But that didn't bother us, really, as far as -- once they got it over with, picking him up every other day, there was something like that, then it stopped.</span> <span id="s227">And in '43 we left; we got there in '42 and we left in '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q. Now, you lived in the open there, you weren't in hiding really.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A. Well, hiding: we didn't know where to hide from or who.</span> <span id="s230">So we were watching ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q. Were there a lot of other Jewish people in your predicament there?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A. I really don't know.</span> <span id="s233">They were themselves in a predicament, they were under Italian rule and here was Jugoslav country was Slovenia and they were under Slovenians but then the Italians came in and this was ours.</span> <span id="s234">They even wanted to give us an Italian prince to rule over the country when they came into Jugoslavia --anything, (laughing) just to get away with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q. And people were fairly resentful of the Italians?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q. Well, I think they felt better under the Italians than they did under the Germans because the Italians were in the war too with them, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q.</span> <span id="s238">What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A.</span> <span id="s240">We left and we went down south and we wound up in Monbacelli (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q.</span> <span id="s242">Why did you go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A. Because we hoped that we would be liberated sooner than if we stayed there.</span> <span id="s244">We just couldn't stay, you know, too long in any place, so we went to Monbacelli, and there we were made civilian internees of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q.</span> <span id="s246">How did you get there?</span> <span id="s247">Tell me a little bit more about the whole process.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A.</span> <span id="s249">We travelled -- you know, we decided it would probably be a nice place to be.</span> <span id="s250">We had no idea, we were just going.</span> <span id="s251">We were travelling south while the troops were coming north, so we stayed there and they caught us and we were under the the ----- and they put us in the house and we were ----- internees for sixteen months.</span> <span id="s252">We had to call every week to sign up, we weren't allowed to leave town, and in order not to stand out we went to church ever Sunday.</span> <span id="s253">So, there was not much to eat, they had a few chickens, a few geese, and my father started feeding those to fatten them up so we could eat something but we lived mainly on beans; eggs and beans -- bean salad, bean spread, anything beans; not even pasta, just beans.</span> <span id="s254">And we lived there with the farmers, with the peasants there, with not much to do, you know.</span> <span id="s255">I learned how to spend a little time and somebody taught me how to sew.</span> <span id="s256">There was not much to do, we just went from day to day and you ate what you could find that's where they make the good champagne, asta spumante, they were right out there.</span> <span id="s257">We weren't allowed into town, so we sat around there for sixteen months waiting for the war to come up, I mean for the liberate troops to come up so we could go down.</span> <span id="s258">You were never connected, we were always too far away from them and they were too far away from us.</span> <span id="s259">They came from Africa, the soldiers, and they went to Sicily and then to Italy, and then coming up and we were going down.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q.</span> <span id="s261">You said you went to church every week --</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q. -- did anyone know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A.</span> <span id="s265">We hoped they didn't but quite a few couples in the orthodox and I don't know how they survived.</span> <span id="s266">They couldn't eat anything.</span> <span id="s267">---------- church ------ in one and going out the other door (she laughs) --</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q. ----?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s270">They had to keep up appearances.</span> <span id="s271">And for a long time the grandmother wasn't allowed to speak any language for that matter because she only spoke German and not to get caught so she pretended to be deaf and mute, and only at night when nobody was around she was allowed to speak.</span> <span id="s272">My father didn't speak too well Italian but my mother and I did, so we'd get around.</span> <span id="s273">But the two of them had to kind of lay low.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q.</span> <span id="s275">Did the people think you were just Croatian refugees?</span> <span id="s276">Or where did they think you were from?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A. I don't think they knew.</span> <span id="s278">We hadn't been retired, they knew where we were from.</span> <span id="s279">The authorities knew, I don't know if the people knew but the authorities knew.</span> <span id="s280">We had to sign up with them every couple weeks, we had to go in and register, and if we wanted to leave town we needed permission and we had to be back.</span> <span id="s281">There was nowhere to go, so they kept good track of us, they wouldn't let us go anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q. Was your father working at all there?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A. No.</span> <span id="s284">There was nothing to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q.</span> <span id="s286">You had your own place?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A. Yes, they gave us a house.</span> <span id="s288">It was beautiful furniture, there was nothing else and there was no heat, just somebody's house, they had a veranda, it was very nice located and ------- nice and warm, but there was no heat in the house or anything, you know, but at least there was a place halfway decent to live in.</span> <span id="s289">But no food, there was no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q. Were you aware of other refugees in that area also?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A. Yes, they had quite a few people there in the same town.</span> <span id="s292">The same ----- with the government and everything but we became good friends, there was nothing else to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q. I just want to backtrack a second: when you went from Lubljana down to --</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A. Monbacelli?</span> <span id="s295">(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q. -- was that an arduous journey?</span> <span id="s297">How did you travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q. (she laughs) I forgot, really, how we got there.</span> <span id="s299">It must have been on trains, because it's far.</span> <span id="s300">Near Florence, that's far, and I think we must have hitched a ride on a train.</span> <span id="s301">It's kind of slipped my memory, I don't know why, it's just something doesn't connect.</span> <span id="s302">But we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q.</span> <span id="s304">You just traveled, just your family, that was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A. Yes, just the three of us.</span> <span id="s306">Actually, four; 80-year-old grandma.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q.</span> <span id="s308">It must have been something for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s310">But she survived.</span> <span id="s311">But then she didn't make it to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q. Do you sort of remember your frame of mind at the time and what you were thinking?</span> <span id="s313">Was it nervewracking, was it adventurous, was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A.</span> <span id="s315">When I look back on it now, it was nervewracking but at that point probably it really didn't faze me, I was (laughing) too young to think about, you know.</span> <span id="s316">It was imperative that we survive, because every day was a new story, a new beginning, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q. Do you remember your parents talking about the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A. Well, it was hard to get through the war, you know, and we ----- as far as we could.</span> <span id="s319">And then they let us out in '46 and we traveled again further down and went to Empoli (ph) and at Empoli we were hiding again.</span> <span id="s320">There we stayed on a farm, in a barn, we slept in a barn, and we cooked where the used to be like a pigsty, the animals were eating just where our kitchen was.</span> <span id="s321">That was where -- then the bombs started flying around and it was bad.</span> <span id="s322">Bombs were coming down, Americans were bombing the city, and we got caught again in the bombs.</span> <span id="s323">We went down inside the countryside and they were shelling on either side of the hills.</span> <span id="s324">My father almost got caught with a shell.</span> <span id="s325">(laughing) And we never had anything to eat -- we took walnuts off the trees at night, and in the morning the farmer came out and said, "Show me your hands" and when hands were black, they knew we stole walnuts from the trees and we had to eat that.</span> <span id="s326">We went into the field and we took some tomatoes and some peppers, whatever we could lay our hands on.</span> <span id="s327">And Grandma was playing deaf and mute and the rest of the time she wasn't allowed to speak.</span> <span id="s328">But then again the Germans were down already and they were trying to catch my father again and he was sitting on a bench and one day a German passed by and he said, in German, "We're going to take this guy."</span> <span id="s329">And my father took off -- my father spoke German, and the ----- were Italian, so my father took off, "That's it, I'm not going to sit around and wait for him to pick me up again."</span> <span id="s330">Every day it was -- and then the soldiers were already up and there were mines in the fields every morning we we got out of the barn to go out and get some fresh air, we had to watch the ground to see for land mines that they had left the night before.</span> <span id="s331">So that was already battleground, that was war already in full force.</span> <span id="s332">They were coming in -- that's what we actually wanted to get there but not being in between.</span> <span id="s333">Every day they bombed, one day they flew a mission over 500 planes we counted -- so low that you could count them and they kept dropping the bombs and they were always going further up.</span> <span id="s334">They were going to Germany, but there were some American bombs, not Germans, American, they were going to Germany.</span> <span id="s335">In the meantime once in a while would drop -- we never knew who was dropping the bombs, we never knew who was above, we just had to hide.</span> <span id="s336">When we heard the sirens go off then we had to run and hide.</span> <span id="s337">When the sirens didn't go back -- after the alert, then it just stayed like this forever, never stopped till the end of the war.</span> <span id="s338">Always on alert.</span> <span id="s339">And there was one place we slept, the four of us in one bed -- two of us this way and two across, like sardines in a pot.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q.</span> <span id="s341">Who were these farmers who were sheltering you?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A. Italians, Italian farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q.</span> <span id="s344">Did they know who you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A. I imagine they would.</span> <span id="s346">Well, they gave us their barn to sleep in, with the straw.</span> <span id="s347">I think it was warm; never snowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q. And again, were you Catholics now?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A. Nothing.</span> <span id="s350">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s351">I remember one thing that was so funny.</span> <span id="s352">It was Easter, Christmas -- one of the holidays -- and they were cooking and cleaning and doing their chores or whatever, and we said, "Where I came from, Jugoslavia, Christmas was a big holiday, Easter was a big holiday, nobody worked."</span> <span id="s353">And I said to them, "The closer you are to the Pope, the less religious you are."</span> <span id="s354">And they were just laughing.</span> <span id="s355">"Oh we work every day."</span> <span id="s356">Of course, in Jugoslavia we kept the holidays, whatever a person believed in we kept it.</span> <span id="s357">But in Italy they didn't seem to care whether it was Christmasday or Easter Sunday; whatever, they worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q. And you stayed in this new place --</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A. Empoli.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q.</span> <span id="s361">You stayed there about how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A. Till 1944; another year with a second year in between each.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q.</span> <span id="s364">You stayed mostly in the same ------- were you on the run a bit more than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A. Well, at that time the soldiers were coming up and they tried to help us to get where we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s366">To help us out there were soldiers from India that came and liberated that part of the country and they helped us out a little bit, and then they went further down south and then we wound up in Rome.</span> <span id="s367">In Rome we were in a camp that used to be old studio of Cinecita Roma and we were locked up there until they decided what to do with us.</span> <span id="s368">They had a few people there but not too many.</span> <span id="s369">Then they decided what to do with us, so they sent us to the camp in Bari.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q.</span> <span id="s371">When you went to Bari it was all refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A. Ja, it was a refugee camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q.</span> <span id="s374">Who were some of these people in Bari?</span> <span id="s375">How big a place was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A.</span> <span id="s377">That was a letdown, the camp, 1500 people or something.</span> <span id="s378">In the beinning it was a -------- transit camp, so people came there, they stayed there for a few weeks or months till they were repatriated.</span> <span id="s379">There were Chinese, there were 20 different nations, and whoever was able to be sent back, and the ones that had no place to go, stayed.</span> <span id="s380">So we stayed five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q.</span> <span id="s382">What month did you arrive, in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A. October 9, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q. Were there a lot of Jews there?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s386">There were Chinese, Japanese, Turks, Greeks -- a lot of Greeks -- all kinds of people from all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q.</span> <span id="s388">What was it like?</span> <span id="s389">What did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A.</span> <span id="s391">Some of them were barracks.</span> <span id="s392">There were 12 barracks and there were some big room with walls between and everything else was open, cots around [?]</span> <span id="s393">, everything was open, there was just a wall here and then there were 12 beds here and 12 beds there and all the way around.</span> <span id="s394">And then at the end was a lavatory at the end.</span> <span id="s395">And there was no privacy at all.</span> <span id="s396">So the Chinese were playing all might and they were gambling all night and you couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s397">And then they were arguing, and then they were fighting, and this went on and on and on.</span> <span id="s398">You couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s399">And nothing to do.</span> <span id="s400">At least they fed us, but there was nothing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q. Your family all stayed in the same barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A. Yeah, my father and my mother; my grandmother had left at the time, she found her son there and she went with him till she passed away a year later.</span> <span id="s403">She never left the camp.</span> <span id="s404">My uncle stayed in the city, lived in the city, he never left the camp either.</span> <span id="s405">So we three wound up in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q. Three days before she had gone to the camp, didn't they?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A. Yes, had no choice.</span> <span id="s408">Either go back home or stay in the camp and hope for the best.</span> <span id="s409">And the War didn't finish up until `45.</span> <span id="s410">We went there in '44, so there was still six months of war.</span> <span id="s411">The War finished in April 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q.</span> <span id="s413">What did you do all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A.</span> <span id="s415">In the beginning, nothing.</span> <span id="s416">Trying to get a better, some other barracks, like a room, family quarters or something, you know -- two wooden cots, two boards, and a piece of -------, whatever, to put under, like a horse, you know, with a piece of wood over the horse, that's how we slept.</span> <span id="s417">Five years.</span> <span id="s418">And we got fed.</span> <span id="s419">There was a big room where you'd get your meals and when you got in they put us in showers.</span> <span id="s420">Do this ------- whatever they were afraid we mmight bring -- then we were body-searched.</span> <span id="s421">And then we were assigned to our barracks and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s422">And over the years we improved a little bit -- we had our room, and we could do our own cooking if we wanted to.</span> <span id="s423">But the room wasn't bigger than somebody's bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q. Well, fill your story before the War ended.</span> <span id="s425">Were you allowed out of the camp, could you go into town --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A. With a pass.</span> <span id="s427">You needed a pass to get out.</span> <span id="s428">And there was no bus, so you hitch-hiked with soldiers into town.</span> <span id="s429">In the beginning it was hard, because there was still war and you know we were afraid to go, but later on there were buses that took us down into town.</span> <span id="s430">If you wanted to shop or a movie or whatever, it made it easy but in the beginning it was very hard.</span> <span id="s431">And until they got rid of a lot of other people -- and people kept always coming and going, you know, you never had the same amount of people at any given time, they were coming and going.</span> <span id="s432">And eventually we got a job in the office, my father, my mother and I got a job in the office.</span> <span id="s433">My father was the payroll clerk, my mother first she worked in the shower room, then she got a job in the office, and I was an interpreter for the commandant who was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q. Was the camp under the control of -------?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A. No, the United Nations Relief Organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q.</span> <span id="s437">In 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q.</span> <span id="s440">If it was a liberated area.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A. Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q.</span> <span id="s443">So your commandant was from the U.N.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A. Yeah, well, most of them were British.</span> <span id="s445">They were all soldiers that were fed up, so you know they got into camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q. Was it organized -------?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A. Oh, you become used to, to get the hang of it.</span> <span id="s448">Until they were more settled and we didn't get so many people in and out, so the ones that stayed eventually stayed for five years, six years.</span> <span id="s449">The first three years were hard because were all coming and going in droves.</span> <span id="s450">They had brought them in busloads and took them out by busloads.</span> <span id="s451">If they didn't kill each other during the night or something, then they took them out (laughing) with an ambulances or something.</span> <span id="s452">So, it was quite a story.</span> <span id="s453">I wrote a little novel about it.</span> <span id="s454">I have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q. Were there a lot of restrictions on what you could do or not do while the War was still on?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A. -----------------------------.</span> <span id="s457">If you really wanted to go into town they let you in on the pass, you had to be back at a certain time, but there was nothing else you could do in town either.</span> <span id="s458">Not much you could do.</span> <span id="s459">And then everybody hoped and prayed the War would end soon.</span> <span id="s460">We wrote a letter to the President, there was a big to-do in the camp and the soldiers and everybody, there was quite a ceremony.</span> <span id="s461">But that didn't mean that -- wanting the end of one, the other one started.</span> <span id="s462">Because we didn't realize how long it was going to take us to get out of there.</span> <span id="s463">People stayed after I left in '49 there, until '50.</span> <span id="s464">I think in '50 it was closed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q. Were you able to observe ----- your religion at all?</span> <span id="s466">Or was that just not important at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A. No, it ---- as good as occurred.</span> <span id="s468">I remember one of the guys in camp he did the menorah for us out of paint cans.</span> <span id="s469">I brought it with me, I don't know where it is now.</span> <span id="s470">But you know we were trying but there was not much you could do.</span> <span id="s471">Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q. Was there any sense of community in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A.</span> <span id="s474">In which sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q. Well, for example, the Jewish people band together in --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A. Yes, we were all working on our way out of it, so we were all like a group.</span> <span id="s477">Lots of people that worked in the office situation they all had relatives in America and were all trying to get out.</span> <span id="s478">We started doing it in 1945.</span> <span id="s479">It took years before we ever heard anything.</span> <span id="s480">The consulate in Naples was very forthcoming with anything.</span> <span id="s481">Visas or anything for that matter, we just had to sit around and wait our turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q. Do you remember how you were aware that the War was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A. Well, they kept us informed, because soldiers were there and they kept us informed.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q.</span> <span id="s485">How did you react?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A. Well, happy.</span> <span id="s487">We didn't know what was waiting for us at the next corner.</span> <span id="s488">We had no idea how long it's going to take us, what the situation was, who was going to help us out getting out.</span> <span id="s489">So we just hang in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q.</span> <span id="s491">Did you feel liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A. Well, yes, and then again, there's no place to go.</span> <span id="s493">How much liberated can you be if there's no place to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q.</span> <span id="s495">What did you do?</span> <span id="s496">What were your plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A. Well, we applied for visas.</span> <span id="s498">My father had brothers in America and he applied for visas and we waited.</span> <span id="s499">For '46, however long it took, how many visas were available.</span> <span id="s500">They were only fishing them out in little batches, maybe five or ten at a time for certain countries.</span> <span id="s501">I was supposed to go and all of a sudden a guy comes up and says well, I'll have to go with this guy, and it was two visas, so I couldn't go and I had to wait.</span> <span id="s502">I was pushed back, you know.</span> <span id="s503">They had to pick preference quotas and they had to pick preference couples or families, and I was on a a special visa, I couldn't go and I wanted to.</span> <span id="s504">You see, I was considered Czech according to the quota system because I was under age, I go according to my father.</span> <span id="s505">And my mother went on the Yugoslav quota, they were scarce too; and the Czech visas were scarcer, so many time when the quotas came around and visas came up, I was too old to go on my father's quota, so I had to wait another year.</span> <span id="s506">It took me three years to get here after my parents came.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q. Bui your parents came first.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s509">My father in '47, my mother in '48, and I came in '49.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q. Families didn't come over together.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A. No.</span> <span id="s512">All depended on the quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q. Because they had different nationalities.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A. Different nationalities.</span> <span id="s515">I was considered stateless, because actually in Europe you are what your parents are, not the country you're born in; like you're born in America, you're an American.</span> <span id="s516">END OF THIS SIDE, A</span></p> <p><span id="s517">BEGINNING SIDE B</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A. (cont'd) And if you're under 21, you go on your father's; and if you're over 21, then you're on your own.</span> <span id="s519">And I was considered most of the time stateless, I had no nationality, no nothing.</span> <span id="s520">I came on a Swiss passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q.</span> <span id="s522">It must have been terribly frustrating.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A. Oh yes.</span> <span id="s524">It's even more frustrating when you wait for something and it doesn't -- every day you hope and pray it's going to come and it doesn't come and you go back again, and you write letters and you make phone calls.</span> <span id="s525">And "Sorry, maybe next time."</span> <span id="s526">Maybe next year, maybe next year.</span> <span id="s527">This is how it went, for three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q. Were you afraid that you wouldn't get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A. No.</span> <span id="s530">Eventually we knew; it was just a matter of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q.</span> <span id="s532">Did conditions in the camp change after the War was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A. Well, it got a little bit better.</span> <span id="s534">There was more food, thay gave us a ration -- military rations, some cigarettes and some candy.</span> <span id="s535">If they weren't stolen before we got to them.</span> <span id="s536">So, my father sat there watching them dish it out to make sure everybody got his ration, because if they didn't, it was gone before it came in.</span> <span id="s537">We knew who stole it but but I wouldn't tell.</span> <span id="s538">(she laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q. Were there any activities -- were there schools for the kids or any cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A. Nothing.</span> <span id="s541">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q.</span> <span id="s543">So people just sat around.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A. Sat around all day doing nothing.</span> <span id="s545">Unless you worked in the office or in the kitchen or wherever in the barracks, you know, cleaning up or something; that was about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q.</span> <span id="s547">Did people get paid for their work?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A.</span> <span id="s549">In the office, yes.</span> <span id="s550">They paid whatever but they were paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q.</span> <span id="s552">Then after the War you were able to go into town and move around more freely, or--</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A. Still with a pass, never without one.</span> <span id="s554">That was the rule.</span> <span id="s555">They went on a pass, if you wanted to go not everyday but you needed a pass.</span> <span id="s556">You went to town then you needed transportation.</span> <span id="s557">The town was outside, I mean, the camp was outside the town and it was quite far to get to and from, so you hitchhiked.</span> <span id="s558">------- travel on a watertank, a military watertank, and one day I drove it (laughing) and I got the soldier in trouble -- I was just pulling on the wheel and he was doing the other stuff that I didn't know before, I never learned how to drive at that point.</span> <span id="s559">It was fun, though, come out on the watertank.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q.</span> <span id="s561">Did you make friends in he camp in Bari?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A. Yes, a lot of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q.</span> <span id="s564">You had social life when you were a young lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s566">Well, I knew quite a few young girls there my age, and, you know, but we knew each other from before, so it wasn't actually that we just met in the camp; we knew the families from my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q.</span> <span id="s568">The --------- you ended up in the families.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A. Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q.</span> <span id="s571">Did you have a boy friend in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A. Yes I did.</span> <span id="s573">(she laughs) Yes I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q. From your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A. No, he was from England.</span> <span id="s576">He wound up in Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q.</span> <span id="s578">So there was some semblance of a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A.
