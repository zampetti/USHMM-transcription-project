I happened to be on a Saturday at my grandfather's place; and he had a eruv.</span> <span id="s52">I don't know if you know; a eruv is a guide wire that sets a perimeter as far as we can walk on the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s53">And the first thing they did is, they came with a truck and ripped off that wire.</span> <span id="s54">So that was the first harassment that I actually seen by the Hungarian Nazis--showing their muscles, really, what they can do.</span> <span id="s55">And then afterwards, we were told that we could no longer go into 1 Czech: Veliký-Bo_kov, or Russ: Velikiye-Bychkov.</span> <span id="s56">Located in the Transcarpathian Oblast of Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">cheder, legally.</span> <span id="s58">That was forbidden.</span> <span id="s59">So we had to go illegally.</span> <span id="s60">And then we would have a look out for the police.</span> <span id="s61">So we'd take turns.</span> <span id="s62">Whenever the police came, they always were in pair.</span> <span id="s63">They had their green hats and a little feather on their head like, so they were recognizable from a distance.</span> <span id="s64">So as soon as they...we saw them coming, we get a signal-- "Disperse!"</span> <span id="s65">And we would run; and 'til it was all clear.</span> <span id="s66">And then we would resume again.</span> <span id="s67">And we sort of accepted that that's a way of life.</span> <span id="s68">We didn't question the parents who they were, why they're doing it.</span> <span id="s69">That's the way it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: This was in 1939?</span> <span id="s71">01:04:56</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: And then what do you remember immediately after that?</span> <span id="s74">Let's say in the...'40, early '40s.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Well, then afterwards it started to...for...tightened, I guess use the word "tighten" the noose more.</span> <span id="s76">They next step they did is, they took the licenses away of people--professional--of practicing their business.</span> <span id="s77">Like I had a cousin who was a dentist, and he was not allowed to practice dentistry anymore.</span> <span id="s78">We were supposed... We were forced to go secretly.</span> <span id="s79">So that if I went to a dentist and I had work some done and my teeth were bleeding...gums were bleeding, then I had to wait--make sure that the bleeding stopped--before I would leave.</span> <span id="s80">Because if they would have caught me, seeing uh that I had dental care through a Jewish dentist, then they would have punished him and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: How big a Jewish community did you have there?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: There were about 3,000 Jewish in that...and then about 7,000 Christians in that area there.</span> <span id="s83">My father was allowed to keep the store, because for some reason that I can't remember--I was about 10 or 11 at the time--is because we had Czech citizenship.</span> <span id="s84">So they allowed those with Czech citizenship to keep the businesses.</span> <span id="s85">But those of Hungarian, they took away.</span> <span id="s86">Why?</span> <span id="s87">I..</span> <span id="s88">.</span> <span id="s89">I..</span> <span id="s90">.</span> <span id="s91">I wasn't old enough there to understand.</span> <span id="s92">In fact, we were really such...lived in such an isolated area that the news would come from a drummer.</span> <span id="s93">We have a drummer coming like old time and beating on the door; and we would all run out toward the square.</span> <span id="s94">And then he would take out a piece of paper, and that's how we got our news.</span> <span id="s95">So we never really realized that anything can happen.</span> <span id="s96">I heard things--events--happening, but I could not relate to what was going around the world at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s98">So then what happen subsequently?</span> <span id="s99">01:06:56</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Well, afterwards...then my father was drafted into the Hungarian Army.</span> <span id="s101">And this was a very, very dramatic experience for us, having him away, because we were so close knit.</span> <span id="s102">And then he was uh gone for a year.</span> <span id="s103">And then they gave him a furlough.</span> <span id="s104">And while he was gone, because I was the oldest in the family I was considered man of the house.</span> <span id="s105">Uh, This was about 11.</span> <span id="s106">I had to go on night guard with an older person.</span> <span id="s107">And they gave us a stick in the hand.</span> <span id="s108">I had no idea what this was all about, but we had to walk around the perimeter to looking in case some saboteurs would come.</span> <span id="s109">Uh, and uh I..</span> <span id="s110">.</span> <span id="s111">I still wonder why should they take somebody my age.</span> <span id="s112">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s113">If somebody wanted to be a saboteur, do something, I'd run the other way.</span> <span id="s114">But you learned not to question.</span> <span id="s115">It was a sense...you sense that they have the power, and you have to obey and you have to do it.</span> <span id="s116">And then...uh later on, we continued...uh a life.</span> <span id="s117">We missed our father very much, and continued going secretly to cheder.</span> <span id="s118">And then we saw deportations begin.</span> <span id="s119">They...they uh ...took certain people--let's say the Hungarian nationality--first.</span> <span id="s120">And I had no idea what was going on.</span> <span id="s121">My parents never really talked to me about what was going on.</span> <span id="s122">And all I saw is people marching away towards the train station.</span> <span id="s123">And this was yet '42, in that time.</span> <span id="s124">And uh...some reason, I think people really didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s125">It was like a fear, or they didn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s126">And I had no idea what was going on, and just accepted as it was.</span> <span id="s127">And then, they announced that our turn was going to come.</span> <span id="s128">And my father, being in the military, was given the choice.</span> <span id="s129">He could either stay in the army and save himself, or come home and be deported with us.</span> <span id="s130">So he chose to come home with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s132">How old were you at that time?</span> <span id="s133">A: Twelve years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: So you were 12 years old.</span> <span id="s135">Okay.</span> <span id="s136">So your father came home then, and uh he decided he was going to go with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s138">I don't think he had any idea where we're being taken; because we were told that we are being taken to some city in Hungary, to...for him to work as a tailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">01:09:56</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s141">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Well, the first inkling of what happened is, I recall it was in a Passover in '44.</span> <span id="s143">And it was a Pesach night; and we ...all of a sudden, we heard the knock on the door.</span> <span id="s144">And we were all frightened who it is, because we had the shutters down.</span> <span id="s145">And here was somebody talking with a German accent.</span> <span id="s146">And it was the German soldiers knocking on the door.</span> <span id="s147">They were not the Nazis.</span> <span id="s148">They were the German soldiers retreating.</span> <span id="s149">And the strange thing was...about the whole thing is, that they come in... They were very polite in the beginning.</span> <span id="s150">They asked if they could stay, because our downstairs was vacant since the Czech officer had left.</span> <span id="s151">And they even offered to pay.</span> <span id="s152">And they put on a picture that "Hey, we're not as bad."</span> <span id="s153">And now I see why.</span> <span id="s154">They wanted to have confidence.</span> <span id="s155">They even put on some acrobatic things for the people, to show that they have come within...for good will.</span> <span id="s156">But once they got the confidence of the people, then they showed their true color.</span> <span id="s157">They came with guns afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s159">David, was this in '43 or '44?</span> <span id="s160">A: '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: This was in '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: '44.</span> <span id="s163">And then, we...we were notified that we were going to be deported.</span> <span id="s164">And there was uh... Just been accepting for us; because we were very Orthodox, and this was the will of God.</span> <span id="s165">And uh...(Excuse me) God will protect us and God will shield us from them, and just put our faith in him.</span> <span id="s166">And uh...when it came to our turn, we were only allowed to carry in our possession with us what we could carry.</span> <span id="s167">And we got a..</span> <span id="s168">.</span> <span id="s169">like a flat bed, a horse and buggy that we put our belongings, only what we could carry.</span> <span id="s170">And I can still remember that sight.</span> <span id="s171">This is in 1944.</span> <span id="s172">And after we loaded everything up and I looked at the house... And here, what the Hungarian Nazi's did, had the chutzpah to do on top of it--what they...what you call "insult to injury"--is that they gave my a father a signed document, right in front of him.</span> <span id="s173">They even put a seal on the door.</span> <span id="s174">Stating that when we come back the house will belong to us, that nobody else will take it over.</span> <span id="s175">And yet, when I look back, within me I had the feeling that it's never going to be the same again.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">01:13:04</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: So you loaded your...your... A: Personal belongings.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: ...personal belongings on a cart.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Cart.</span> <span id="s180">Yah, a wooden cart with a horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s181">It had a couple of wheels.</span> <span id="s182">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s183">And then what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: After that, they uh marched us to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s185">And the synagogue was like an assembly point, where what they would do is they would bring enough people until there was enough for a train load.</span> <span id="s186">And, for us, this was like electric shock.</span> <span id="s187">Whenever we heard a train before, in...in 1942 and 1943, when they began... Uh, because we knew that the trains are coming to pick up more people, take them away.</span> <span id="s188">So we already knew that going to the trains.</span> <span id="s189">We didn't know what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s190">But soon as we got into the synagogue and we were there, it is like being thrown into a cage.</span> <span id="s191">All of a sudden, they show their viciousness.</span> <span id="s192">Saw a couple of people passed out, and they beat them up; and we tried to help, and they wouldn't let and wouldn't offer any help.</span> <span id="s193">So we already sensed that something bad is going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s195">So you were in the synagogue there.</span> <span id="s196">What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Well, after that we stayed there a couple of days.</span> <span id="s198">Then the train arrived; and then we were put onto a train.</span> <span id="s199">It was still a passenger train, instead of a cattle train.</span> <span id="s200">And uh...from there, I found they took us to a ghetto in Hungary called Mátészalka.</span> <span id="s201">Mátészalka was sort of a central point where they brought all the victims from all of the shtetlach around in that area.</span> <span id="s202">And it's...just like they brought us to the train station from one shtetlach, that camp was sort of a shul for all of the surrounding areas.</span> <span id="s203">So when they had enough people in there for a large...or whenever a transport was available, then that's where uh was the assembling point.</span> <span id="s204">And that was...uh we lived in tents over there.</span> <span id="s205">And uh we...uh we didn't know what's happening.</span> <span id="s206">Nobody said anything to anybody: where we're going, what's going to happen, where are we heading.</span> <span id="s207">We knew we're waiting for something.</span> <span id="s208">For a train to take us someplace else.</span> <span id="s209">It was not the place where we knew that we were going to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s211">So then the train finally arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: The train arrived.</span> <span id="s213">It was several weeks.</span> <span id="s214">Four, five weeks.</span> <span id="s215">I can't recall the exact.</span> <span id="s216">And then, we still believed that we were being taken to a city in Hungary.</span> <span id="s217">And this time, instead of a passenger train, there was a cattle train.</span> <span id="s218">And they put us in, packed us very tight.</span> <span id="s219">And there was hardly room to move.</span> <span id="s220">And the whole family there--my grandparents--they were still together.</span> <span id="s221">And when they locked the door, the click, and put the key on, I knew within me--I wouldn't share it--I knew we were in for something.</span> <span id="s222">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s223">And when we got on the train, we could hear the Hungarian guards talking.</span> <span id="s224">Even though it was totally locked, we could hear them talking.</span> <span id="s225">So we knew we were guarded on the train.</span> <span id="s226">And then the train kept travelling.</span> <span id="s227">It was maybe a couple of days or so.</span> <span id="s228">And then it came to a stop.</span> <span id="s229">And we didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s230">Then we heard talking.</span> <span id="s231">All of a sudden we heard Hungarian, we heard German talking.</span> <span id="s232">And then the Hungarian voices disappeared; and then German guards had taken over.</span> <span id="s233">So that put fear in us, knowing that we're not going to Hungary anymore.</span> <span id="s234">That this was... And from there on in, it was the beginning.</span> <span id="s235">I'd say the beginning of the end, for a lot of people.</span> <span id="s236">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s237">01:17:52</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Now once the Germans took over, what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Then, the train continued.</span> <span id="s240">And I think we traveled for another two or three days.</span> <span id="s241">I'm not sure the exact amount of time.</span> <span id="s242">And I still remember, I could look through the cracks in the train.</span> <span id="s243">And I didn't know where was heading...we're heading, or where we're going.</span> <span id="s244">And I saw people working on damaged planes.</span> <span id="s245">Uh, there were airplanes.</span> <span id="s246">And later on, I found out that that's...Auschwitz was part of where they repaired--planes that were damaged during the war were stripped, used for spare parts.</span> <span id="s247">And also I remember seeing these uh...they're sort of balloons, so that planes cannot fly too low.</span> <span id="s248">And I had no idea what purpose they were; but there're to prevent planes from flying very far.</span> <span id="s249">And later... And I saw that sight.</span> <span id="s250">And...and when we arrived, it was like in the morning.</span> <span id="s251">It was a nice day.</span> <span id="s252">And we were all with anticipation.</span> <span id="s253">Where...where are we heading?</span> <span id="s254">And then the train kind of kept slowing down; and the train whistle blowing, slowing down.</span> <span id="s255">And then we see barbed wire compound there, and we see these things.</span> <span id="s256">And within me, wondering what is this.</span> <span id="s257">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s258">I never was in a camp before.</span> <span id="s259">And then, all of a sudden, the train came to a stop.</span> <span id="s260">And they opened the doors.</span> <span id="s261">And that was... That's was when I saw Hell.</span> <span id="s262">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: That was the first real Hell you saw.</span> <span id="s264">01:19:57</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: What happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Well, we were forced to get out.</span> <span id="s268">And all of a sudden, I..</span> <span id="s269">.</span> <span id="s270">I saw Nazis beating people.</span> <span id="s271">I've never seen in my life like that, actually.</span> <span id="s272">Physically beating, dragging children away from their parents.</span> <span id="s273">Because in... Parents trying to go after children; and you hear shooting and yelling and crying and children... It is a sight that--I could not tell you what I ate yesterday, but I could tell you 45 years ago what...the way it was.</span> <span id="s274">And all of a sudden, fear took over me.</span> <span id="s275">What is this all about?</span> <span id="s276">What's happening?</span> <span id="s277">What are we doing here?</span> <span id="s278">This is not a city in Hungary.</span> <span id="s279">This is not what we had thought.</span> <span id="s280">And all a sudden--we heard orders, barking: "That line!</span> <span id="s281">That line!</span> <span id="s282">That line!"</span> <span id="s283">And...nobody knew.</span> <span id="s284">It was just panic.</span> <span id="s285">Everybody ... And I found myself uh in a line with other youth.</span> <span id="s286">And I had no idea which line we were supposed to be, or what.</span> <span id="s287">And uh...I was looking for my father, you see; because there were all men on one side.</span> <span id="s288">And I ran out from the group of youth that I was in, and I ran towards the adults.</span> <span id="s289">And that's what actually saved my life in the beginning.</span> <span id="s290">And then I saw, momentarily, my mother and my brother and sister going a different line.</span> <span id="s291">And I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye to them; this all happened so fast.</span> <span id="s292">And I stood in line with my father.</span> <span id="s293">And uh...I had no idea what...what is this all about?</span> <span id="s294">What is this standing in line for?</span> <span id="s295">What is this here, and telling people to go one line, another line and this line?</span> <span id="s296">And then my turn came, with my father standing.</span> <span id="s297">It could have been Mengele.</span> <span id="s298">It could have been somebody else.</span> <span id="s299">I didn't even know who Mengele was, or anything.</span> <span id="s300">But it was a Nazi officer there.</span> <span id="s301">And uh...he uh...since I was with my father, he asked me how old I was.</span> <span id="s302">And my voice just froze.</span> <span id="s303">For some reason, something within side me said, "Don't say anything."</span> <span id="s304">And he kept saying, "How old are you?!"</span> <span id="s305">--"Wie alt bist du?!"</span> <span id="s306">And I just kept looking him, not saying anything.</span> <span id="s307">And my father didn't know, either, what was...why he asked age.</span> <span id="s308">And all of a sudden, he said I'm 14.</span> <span id="s309">He sensed something, all of a sudden, then.</span> <span id="s310">And he [NB: the Nazi officer] looked at me kind of suspiciously... "14?"</span> <span id="s311">And in a split second said, "Okay, you can go with the work group."</span> <span id="s312">If I..</span> <span id="s313">.</span> <span id="s314">I kept wanting to say the voice, "No.</span> <span id="s315">No, Dad.</span> <span id="s316">I'm only 12."</span> <span id="s317">And something held me back.</span> <span id="s318">If I would have said 12, that would have been it.</span> <span id="s319">What made me uh hold back my voice and not speaking, and what made him say... perhaps only God knows.</span> <span id="s320">Or somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">01:25:20</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: So then you were put in with a work group, or separated from your... A: Family.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s324">You... Okay.</span> <span id="s325">You are there.</span> <span id="s326">At this time, you had arrived... This was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s327">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Where did you go next, or what did you...?</span> <span id="s329">What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Well, in Auschwitz...uh they put us in a separate compounds, and gave us those cotton uniforms.</span> <span id="s331">Uh, and we were just waiting there.</span> <span id="s332">We had no idea uh what was.</span> <span id="s333">And then when I..</span> <span id="s334">.</span> <span id="s335">during the day, when I walked around with my father, I would ask him, "What is that terrible smell?</span> <span id="s336">What are all those chimneys, that smoke and everything?"</span> <span id="s337">Either he wouldn't know...he didn't know, or wouldn't tell me.</span> <span id="s338">He just didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s339">And that stench is just gruesome... awesome, from that smell constantly.</span> <span id="s340">And you see the smoke from the ovens day and night.</span> <span id="s341">And just to give you an example how we were duped into believing, to a point, that what they were doing was not happening, is a man came in all of a sudden in our barracks and he announced.</span> <span id="s342">He says, "I've got good news.</span> <span id="s343">I've just heard that in a couple of days we will be reunited with our families."</span> <span id="s344">And the families were dead already, and he still believed.</span> <span id="s345">Now can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s346">Still in Auschwitz itself already, and not being ab...not believing that this could be happening.</span> <span id="s347">So how can you convince anybody else to try to tell a story, when in Auschwitz itself the people wouldn't believe that this could be happening?</span> <span id="s348">So when... after about 5 or 6 days and they had arranged there, we told...we were told to march out and uh to get onto a cattle train.</span> <span id="s349">And we were in that group about um...13 people--13, 15.</span> <span id="s350">Or in that range.</span> <span id="s351">And we got on the train, uh my father said that today's my Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s352">And he had secretly hidden, risking his life, a little bottle of wine.</span> <span id="s353">And he took it out; and he passed it around to everybody, and everyone had a little sip and had a toast.</span> <span id="s354">And that's how I celebrated my Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s355">It was very sad.</span> <span id="s356">But there was no time to think then on this.</span> <span id="s357">The time then was survival.</span> <span id="s358">That was... It keep...it kept us going, to believe that we're going to make it.</span> <span id="s359">And, hopefully, that our families will survive, too.</span> <span id="s360">We did not know what happened to them, actually.</span> <span id="s361">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s362">01:26:23</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s364">So you were now back on a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Right.</span> <span id="s366">And the train took a couple of days.</span> <span id="s367">And then we embarked in a place that I found later on was called Plaszów.Plaszów was a combination of work camp and extermination camp.</span> <span id="s368">A lot of the Gypsies were brought in for extermination in that camp.</span> <span id="s369">And one of the things that I was told is survival means the ability to work.</span> <span id="s370">If you could work, there was hope for survival.</span> <span id="s371">If you couldn't work, you were done.</span> <span id="s372">So mentally I had to psyche myself out that I'm adult and I could do the work; and I wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s373">And so when we got there, I was still with my father.</span> <span id="s374">And one of the first thing they did, is they asked...they wanted to have people who had trades.</span> <span id="s375">First thing they selected first in work groups.</span> <span id="s376">And then they were...uh with all others, if they couldn't fit into work, then it was back to the extermination camp.</span> <span id="s377">So then my father was fall...fell out of the group as a tailor.</span> <span id="s378">And then they said, "Bricklayers.</span> <span id="s379">Who's a bricklayer?"</span> <span id="s380">I raised my hand.</span> <span id="s381">"I'm a bricklayer."</span> <span id="s382">I never laid a brick or a stone in my life.</span> <span id="s383">I never even touched one.</span> <span id="s384">But as I was in the camp, I saw how people laid the bricks and the stones, how they mixed the cement.</span> <span id="s385">And so I figured, "Well, I could do that."</span> <span id="s386">They said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s387">Fall in line."</span> <span id="s388">And they put me in the work group; and I..</span> <span id="s389">.</span> <span id="s390">in their eyes, I was a professional bricklayer.</span> <span id="s391">(Laughing) And I would mix cement and carrying the wheelbarrow.</span> <span id="s392">And we had to go to a mine where they mined stones, and then we had to carry each stone to a certain area and build a little wall underneath the barracks.</span> <span id="s393">It was useless work, for all practical purposes; but it kept us busy.</span> <span id="s394">In their eyes, we were doing something.</span> <span id="s395">So, at least I was able to be with my father together.</span> <span id="s396">And one of the things that stands out in that camp, that I remember, that I was working with a Polish.</span> <span id="s397">He was Christian, and he was there... was incarcerated because he committed a crime.</span> <span id="s398">So they also put him with us.</span> <span id="s399">And he got a certain... And when we worked together, we talked about things: life, and uh he was telling me why he was...what crime he committed.</span> <span id="s400">And next day, to flaunt [it] in my face, he waves goodbye.</span> <span id="s401">Because he was released, free to go.</span> <span id="s402">And here I thought, "I did not any crime or anything.</span> <span id="s403">And mine, there's no time limit for me.</span> <span id="s404">Only death would be the limit."</span> <span id="s405">It was uh very, very sad to see that-- knowing that here he could go free, and here I didn't do anything that I was virtually sentenced for life.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">01:29:52</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Well, in uh Plaszów, I was there about 6 weeks.</span> <span id="s409">All of a sudden, without any warning, they yanked me out from the work group.</span> <span id="s410">Nobody...there's no such thing as sitting down like you would say, "Well, tomorrow you're going to go someplace else, or do that."</span> <span id="s411">Just, "Come!"</span> <span id="s412">And they yanked me and said, "Tonight, uh you're going to a different camp."</span> <span id="s413">And fortunately, I looked all around and I was able to find my father.</span> <span id="s414">And we said goodbye 2 Also: Krakau-P_aszów.</span> <span id="s415">Located in the district of Kraków.</span> <span id="s416">Closed January 15, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">through the fence.</span> <span id="s418">And it was a very, very sad moment, too; knowing that I would never see him again.</span> <span id="s419">It...it just you had that feeling.</span> <span id="s420">I didn't give up hope, but it was very strange feeling.</span> <span id="s421">Then they put me on a train, and uh was like an overnight travel.</span> <span id="s422">And I found out after we arrived that it was a camp called Gross Rosen.</span> <span id="s423">Gross Rosen was...I found out was a combination.</span> <span id="s424">An extermination camp, and processing camp.</span> <span id="s425">So that when (excuse me) when the Russians were getting closer in Plaszów, they didn't want us to be free...they took us to Gross Rosen.</span> <span id="s426">And in Gross Rosen, they uh...we were waiting there and in process of being sent to another work camp.</span> <span id="s427">But before...uh we...they determined if we're going to be sent to a work camp or where, we were forced to strip naked in front of a..</span> <span id="s428">.</span> <span id="s429">a doctor or somebody.</span> <span id="s430">And he looked us over like cattle.</span> <span id="s431">And he determined whether you were physically fit to do heavy physical work.</span> <span id="s432">Or if not, then there was.</span> <span id="s433">.</span> <span id="s434">they had the extermination camp right there.</span> <span id="s435">And I..</span> <span id="s436">.</span> <span id="s437">they did not tell you where you're going to be sent or what.</span> <span id="s438">And after about 6 weeks--it seems like an average cycle (laughing)--6 weeks, they put me in a train again.</span> <span id="s439">I'd become a professional (laughing) traveller at that time.</span> <span id="s440">And then I found out...at this time I was in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s441">Actually, the first concentration camp itself.</span> <span id="s442">And the concentration camp, meaning that in this camp it was primarily for work.</span> <span id="s443">And when they wanted to exterminate somebody or end his life, they took him to places like Groß Rosen or Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">01:32:35 They had their methods to their madness.</span> <span id="s445">So again, in Reichenbach,the same thing.</span> <span id="s446">"We need bricklayers."</span> <span id="s447">Now, since I was a professional bricklayer (laughing), I right away raised my hand.</span> <span id="s448">And I was put into a work group.</span> <span id="s449">And it was very, very, very difficult work.</span> <span id="s450">We had to march several miles to work.</span> <span id="s451">And I was already half dead when I already got to work.</span> <span id="s452">And then to work yet, uh it took all the strength just to make it through the marching.</span> <span id="s453">And then, when we marched back, if a person was not physically able to complete the march, they just shot him on the spot.</span> <span id="s454">There was no...there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s455">So uh... So in Reichenbach, it was...uh this is where I spent the most time.</span> <span id="s456">I was there about 6 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: This is where you spent most of the time.</span> <span id="s458">Can you tell us something about what... What was your daily life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Well, we lived in the barracks.</span> <span id="s460">It was like this for the winter.</span> <span id="s461">Ice cold; no heating at all.</span> <span id="s462">In the morning, we had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and take an ice cold shower in an ice cold barracks.</span> <span id="s463">After we took the shower, we had to go and stand outside in the bitter cold for roll call.</span> <span id="s464">And finally, after that, they would give us some coffee and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s465">That was our ration.</span> <span id="s466">And then...uh we would then be on standby for which work group we're going to go.</span> <span id="s467">Because every day they need work in different areas.</span> <span id="s468">So then they would select us to go to a certain...oftentimes, work in the city building air raid shelters.</span> <span id="s469">And when there would be a raid, we had to stay in the open.</span> <span id="s470">And they watched us from a distance.</span> <span id="s471">[If] we 3 Also: Langenbielau I. Subcamp of Groß Rosen located in Lower Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">ran, we would be shot.</span> <span id="s473">So we were not afraid; because when we saw the airplanes, we knew when we heard the bombing that they're coming to liberate us.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">01:35:14 A uh very unique incident happened in Reichenbach that kind of stands out a little bit.</span> <span id="s475">Is when I was standing for roll call there; and as I'm standing, all of a sudden I hear a noise in the sky.</span> <span id="s476">And during roll call, it was a rule you were not supposed to make any movement.</span> <span id="s477">Not anything.</span> <span id="s478">And I was very curious.</span> <span id="s479">I looked up to see where that noise was coming from; and I saw it was American bombers flying over there on a mission to destroy Germany.</span> <span id="s480">And as I looked up with envy, wishing that I was one of those planes, thinking [of] being free, all of a sudden I hear a shrill right in front of me that could be heard in front of the whole camp.</span> <span id="s481">There was a Nazi Commandant saw me looking up.</span> <span id="s482">And: "Du!</span> <span id="s483">Schweinhund!"</span> <span id="s484">Why did I disobey his order?</span> <span id="s485">And he had a big stick in his hand.</span> <span id="s486">And his habit was, if somebody disobeyed one of his orders, he would ask him first, "Why did you do that," or "Why did you disobey?"</span> <span id="s487">And soon as the person answered, wham!</span> <span id="s488">He let him have it.</span> <span id="s489">And oftentimes that person would be beaten so badly that he could not go back to work, or [it] put him to death.</span> <span id="s490">Now here was my turn.</span> <span id="s491">"Why did you disobey?"</span> <span id="s492">And the little voice inside that told me in Auschwitz not to say anything, to keep quiet, was there the same thing.</span> <span id="s493">Saying, "Don't answer!</span> <span id="s494">Don't say anything!"</span> <span id="s495">And I was just looking straight in his eyes.</span> <span id="s496">And he was waiting for me to reply, and he was getting very impatient.</span> <span id="s497">In front of the whole camp there, here's a little Jew standing up there (laughing) that won't do what he says.</span> <span id="s498">And that little voice inside saying, "Don't answer.</span> <span id="s499">Don't say anything."</span> <span id="s500">He's getting...he says, "I know why you looked up."</span> <span id="s501">He says, "You wish you were on one of those planes, don't you?</span> <span id="s502">You wish you were free!</span> <span id="s503">," he says.</span> <span id="s504">And I just keep looking straight in the eye.</span> <span id="s505">He says, "Well, I got news for you!"</span> <span id="s506">He says, "You'll never be free again.</span> <span id="s507">You'll never make it out alive from here!"</span> <span id="s508">And I just looked him straight in the eye; and I said, "Someday..." He couldn't even see my lips move.</span> <span id="s509">"Someday, I will be free again.</span> <span id="s510">And some day I will see your country destroyed for what you have done."</span> <span id="s511">And this is what I was just thinking.</span> <span id="s512">And he's looking, and he's waiting for me.</span> <span id="s513">Here it is.</span> <span id="s514">I'm almost bracing myself that he's going to do it; and I'm just holding there steady and not saying.</span> <span id="s515">And he's waiting and waiting.</span> <span id="s516">And somehow he sensed that I wasn't going to answer.</span> <span id="s517">And he was in no condition...condition to hit somebody who didn't answer, and just walked away in disgust.</span> <span id="s518">(Laughing) Phew.</span> <span id="s519">And here it was, another day of survival.</span> <span id="s520">Now the interesting ending of this story is that during the Korean uh Conflict, I was drafted in the [US] military service.</span> <span id="s521">And afterwards I was sent overseas on a mission to keep the peace in Europe; and as I was flying over Europe and over Germany, I looked at the ground below.</span> <span id="s522">And I wondered if that Nazi Commandant was still alive.</span> <span id="s523">And if he was still alive, what would he have said if he knew that I was not only free, but also in one of those planes.</span> <span id="s524">For me, it was a moment to remember, that when... They say that justice triumphed over evil.</span> <span id="s525">That day that...</span></p> <p><span id="s526">01:39:15</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Let's come back to your typical day.</span> <span id="s528">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s529">(Drinking water) Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: In this camp.</span> <span id="s531">You stood for roll call, and then you went to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Well, afterwards they uh...the Nazi Commandant sensed that there is still some youth left under 16 in the...in the work groups.</span> <span id="s533">And he didn't know how to...I guess you use the words "flush them out."</span> <span id="s534">Because we all said we were older, and we were able to do the work.</span> <span id="s535">So then they couldn't say that we couldn't do the work; because if we couldn't have done the work, they wouldn't have kept us there in the first place.</span> <span id="s536">But he was very determined that he was not going to let any youth.</span> <span id="s537">And then he decided he's going to play one of his games different; that he is going to offer extra rations to anybody that can turn in a youth under 16.</span> <span id="s538">It's amazing what happens.</span> <span id="s539">There's only a few that knew about my age.</span> <span id="s540">Adults there.</span> <span id="s541">And before I knew it, all of a sudden I was yanked out from the work group and put with... We were about 13 in the camp who were still...uh managed to hide until now.</span> <span id="s542">And this time, they told us that we're being sent to an extermination camp because of...of our age.</span> <span id="s543">And I remember standing there with a group of others; and my thoughts were going through that this is the last day of life and that tomorrow will be end, and that I'll never return home again.</span> <span id="s544">And all of a sudden, I started concentrating mentally: that I want to return home, I want to be with my family, I want to be free again.</span> <span id="s545">And I started--without me even being aware of this coming--it's like the mind almost like going out of control, the concentration.</span> <span id="s546">All of a sudden, as I'm doing that, here's the Nazi Commandant front of me, standing there.</span> <span id="s547">And I thought... "Raus!</span> <span id="s548">," he says.</span> <span id="s549">And I thought I'm the first one that going to be shot or something.</span> <span id="s550">And all of a sudden, what happened that moment was that a group that was going out, a person had just passed out.</span> <span id="s551">And he [NB: the Commandant] went...passed through over a hundred people who were on standby--adults--and didn't ask them.</span> <span id="s552">And came to my group, and ordered me to go back into the work group.</span> <span id="s553">All the others were taken to extermination.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">01:42:24 And for me, it was like a rekindling.</span> <span id="s555">Here I was.</span> <span id="s556">As long as you were in a work group, there was still hope for survival.</span> <span id="s557">The interesting thing was...is that while I had hopes for survival being in the work group, I knew that now the Nazi Commandant knew about my age.</span> <span id="s558">He knew about me.</span> <span id="s559">And every day, I wondered, "How long am I going to remain in the work group?"</span> <span id="s560">I knew that he was very obsessed.</span> <span id="s561">Sure enough, after 6 weeks, I was yanked out of the work group and was taken into another compound.</span> <span id="s562">What they did is that they had a separate compound for those who are no longer considered physically fit to work.</span> <span id="s563">And they would take them over to the compound, and then a train would take them to a extermination camp.</span> <span id="s564">So this time, I pretty much resigned myself that no...no more concentration of being surviving, being able to make it; that this time I'm not going to make it, even though the will and desire was still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: So you...you sort of somewhat gave up on it.</span> <span id="s566">But you...then what happened to you?</span> <span id="s567">01:43:58</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Well, after about two weeks of uh...and being in that compound with the disabled and others... Uh, ironically, is during all this time--throughout the time there was now is about 9 months--throughout the ordeals, being exposed to all kinds of sicknesses and diseases-- typhus, cholera--I never even got sick once.</span> <span id="s569">Didn't even catch a cold.</span> <span id="s570">And because of my age...uh they found that I'm now...I was now with the disabled.</span> <span id="s571">And after about two weeks, they said, "Okay!</span> <span id="s572">Everybody up!"</span> <span id="s573">They didn't tell us what.</span> <span id="s574">And they took us into like half open cattle train.</span> <span id="s575">They gave us each a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s576">And to march in; and they packed us in in the train so tight.</span> <span id="s577">I mean, like standing up, there was no room to move.</span> <span id="s578">It was like sardines.</span> <span id="s579">So we knew that wherever we're heading, that this is going to be the final journey.</span> <span id="s580">This is not being taken to a work camp.</span> <span id="s581">And this was a journey that I will never forget for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s582">First, it...when we started that some people start getting weaker, and they could no longer stand anymore.</span> <span id="s583">Then they would fall down; and they'd be trampled on, because there was no room to move.</span> <span id="s584">And soon as they were trampled on, they died.</span> <span id="s585">They did not remove the dead after the train started.</span> <span id="s586">And this...as...this was a 7 day journey.</span> <span id="s587">And as the time went on, more people started passing out.</span> <span id="s588">And one time, I still recall this, one uh Nazi came.</span> <span id="s589">And then he...somebody spoke up or asked for some help, and he shot him right through the neck.</span> <span id="s590">And he just fell down.</span> <span id="s591">And it was an experience that I will never forget the rest of my life, is I fell down; and because there was now... About half of them were dead already; and you would sit and you talk to somebody just like a person like that like I'm talking to you, and all of a sudden he'd stop talking.</span> <span id="s592">Just like that.</span> <span id="s593">Just in the middle of the conversation, he died right there on the spot.</span> <span id="s594">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s595">This is the first time I was really confronted with death; because throughout when I lived in my hometown, not...not one member of my family ever died or even went to a funeral.</span> <span id="s596">And this was a strange experience.</span> <span id="s597">You just see him and all of a sudden stop talking, and he stays with the eyes open.</span> <span id="s598">Then when I fell down, I uh...there was somebody fell on top of me.</span> <span id="s599">And I felt like...I actually felt like I'm dying already.</span> <span id="s600">I could feel like...there was a feeling like I wanted to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s601">It was not a painful feeling.</span> <span id="s602">Just going to sleep.</span> <span id="s603">And there was inside...this is... We have some...such awesome power within us.</span> <span id="s604">There was like...kept seeing, like an electric shock I kept getting.</span> <span id="s605">"Don't fall asleep!</span> <span id="s606">Don't fall asleep!</span> <span id="s607">Wake up!</span> <span id="s608">Wake up, because this is gonna be your last sleep!"</span> <span id="s609">And I didn't know how to get the body off me, because I was so weak.</span> <span id="s610">And yet I knew that if I don't push him off that it'll be the end.</span> <span id="s611">So that little voice saying, "Come on!</span> <span id="s612">Muster all your strength, and you got to push him off."</span> <span id="s613">So all of a sudden then I just got on and the last strength.</span> <span id="s614">And I pushed him off.</span> <span id="s615">And then I fell on top of him.</span> <span id="s616">And now he was trying to struggle to survive.</span> <span id="s617">And I just...I didn't even have the strength to move.</span> <span id="s618">And he was trying to push me off, and he didn't have the strength.</span> <span id="s619">And I didn't have the strength to move, and we... Neither of us wanted to hurt each other or anything, but the bodies were all around.</span> <span id="s620">There, nobody moved.</span> <span id="s621">It was the most awesome, gruesome thing that ever human beings can do.</span> <span id="s622">And we would travel by...I remember we would be...would be like a bridge overhead, where trains go by, and it stopped.</span> <span id="s623">And people would look down, and look at us like, "What's going on?</span> <span id="s624">It's kinda strange."</span> <span id="s625">And they had no idea what it was all about.</span> <span id="s626">And then all of a sudden, when I finally did push him up out of the way and I..</span> <span id="s627">.</span> <span id="s628">he fell down and I..</span> <span id="s629">.</span> <span id="s630">I fell on top of him.</span> <span id="s631">Now he was struggling to push me off.</span> <span id="s632">And I was holding there; and all of a sudden, he got up and his final moment of breath and he bit my leg, right in here.</span> <span id="s633">And then he fell back and died.</span> <span id="s634">I had the most gruesome, gruesome nightmares for many years from this experience.</span> <span id="s635">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s636">01:49:15</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: How many days...which day was this here?</span> <span id="s638">You said the journey was 7 days?</span> <span id="s639">A: About seven days, I recall.</span> <span id="s640">Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s642">What happened...what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Well, the journey...my thirst.</span> <span id="s644">They didn't...they just gave us a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s645">We couldn't even eat, because we were very thirsty.</span> <span id="s646">And the thirst pains were so bad that I even tried to use the urine from my body, just to wet my lips.</span> <span id="s647">And I pretty much, as it went down uh... When we arrive, this was, I found out later, in Dachau.</span> <span id="s648">And when we arrived, I had already passed out, virtually.</span> <span id="s649">Three out of 150 there survived.</span> <span id="s650">They all...the rest of them just lay dead.</span> <span id="s651">And what they did is, they pick me up from the...with the hands and somebody else with the legs.</span> <span id="s652">And then they threw me in a stretcher...and they're getting ready to take me to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s653">That's where they took...that's where their objective was.</span> <span id="s654">And somehow, they...somebody who was carrying me noticed a hand moving, that I was still alive.</span> <span id="s655">So at a risk to his life, he took me into a barrack.</span> <span id="s656">It was actually like a shower room.</span> <span id="s657">And I was dazed at that time.</span> <span id="s658">Virtually, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s659">I thought... And when I came to [in] the bathroom there, it was... I woke up, and I..</span> <span id="s660">.</span> <span id="s661">I thought I was dead.</span> <span id="s662">I felt like I was in another world.</span> <span id="s663">"What are these people doing here?</span> <span id="s664">Where am I?"</span> <span id="s665">And I thought, I..</span> <span id="s666">.</span> <span id="s667">I..</span> <span id="s668">.</span> <span id="s669">I was totally dazed.</span> <span id="s670">I couldn't figure out even where I am.</span> <span id="s671">And then somebody came over and told me what happened.</span> <span id="s672">Explained to me that "You were just a few seconds away from being thrust into the crematorium, and they saw that you were still alive."</span> <span id="s673">And they said, "You're the first youth that age who actually made it alive."</span> <span id="s674">And then they took me and they hid me, you know, secretly in their barracks.</span> <span id="s675">So I was not even supposed to have been there.</span> <span id="s676">And I became like, to them, like a hero.</span> <span id="s677">That here are these fathers who said, well, if I made it then maybe their children would have made it through.</span> <span id="s678">And they...since I didn't get any rations, because I was... The ration was there like a piece of bread--enough to keep them alive until they were actually being...were going to be taken to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s679">And each one would take a piece of bread; and they would break off a piece and make up a slice for me, so that I could survive.</span> <span id="s680">And they said, "David, you must survive and let the world know what happened."</span> <span id="s681">I had no idea what they meant, or what they said.</span> <span id="s682">That basically was what had driven me to tell this story--not to make sure that it is not...make sure that it is not forgotten.</span> <span id="s683">And so over there, after... In Dachau, I..</span> <span id="s684">.</span> <span id="s685">uh started getting on my feet again; and found out I was in Dachau.</span> <span id="s686">And uh... Every night I heard the earth shaking from the bombardments.</span> <span id="s687">And here, in my mind I was thinking, "It is now really a race against time."</span> <span id="s688">We knew any day that this is going to end.</span> <span id="s689">The question was if we're going to make it out alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">01:52:58</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: So this gave you some more courage?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Hope.</span> <span id="s693">To be able to go on, to...to believe.</span> <span id="s694">What kept me is the belief that maybe my family is still alive.</span> <span id="s695">And it was... in Dachau, it was uh really uh very traumatic experiences that you would talk to one person one night, and the next morning he's dead.</span> <span id="s696">And then he would be taken like a piece of garbage and thrown on the stretcher.</span> <span id="s697">You don't think...you're not a human being anymore.</span> <span id="s698">You don't even know what you're thinking.</span> <span id="s699">You're just a person dazed, traumatized.</span> <span id="s700">And don't even know by what I'm hanging in.</span> <span id="s701">But the will to live there was still strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: What happened next after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Well, I was there about 6 weeks.</span> <span id="s704">And all of a sudden, again, I was yanked out (laughing) without any warning and put on a train again.</span> <span id="s705">Now this time I could consider myself really a professional!</span> <span id="s706">It was a really a strange experience.</span> <span id="s707">I actually walked out of Dachau on my own two feet--which a Nazi said...Commandant in Reichenbach said I would never do.</span> <span id="s708">They took the few of us that could still walk, and they marched us out.</span> <span id="s709">And we had no idea why they were marching us out.</span> <span id="s710">This was about three days before the Americans came.</span> <span id="s711">And they put us in a passenger train.</span> <span id="s712">And I learned, years later, what actually their main purpose was.</span> <span id="s713">But at that time, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s714">And we travelled for about a couple of hours or so; and then they told us to get off the train.</span> <span id="s715">And I found out that I was...it was a little town in Austria called Innsbruck.</span> <span id="s716">And as we were walk...marching off from...getting off from the train station, I remember that I saw...I looked...a couple of women in a group there, looking...were staring at us.</span> <span id="s717">That they were crying.</span> <span id="s718">And within me, I sensed that something is going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s719">And after we marched out of the station into the forest, they started shooting at us.</span> <span id="s720">They massacred many of them.</span> <span id="s721">And we got to a street, uh...and it was, this was...this was in the mountains, in the forest...in the Tyrolian Mountains of Austria.</span> <span id="s722">And all of a sudden, they started...the machine guns started firing at us.</span> <span id="s723">And many just panicked, run in every direction.</span> <span id="s724">Something...I had something inside told me, "Look where that fire is coming from."</span> <span id="s725">And as I saw it, and I dived into a hole in the side of the street and it just missed me.</span> <span id="s726">And uh this was still in April of '45, now.</span> <span id="s727">And I slept all night in that hole.</span> <span id="s728">When I woke up in the morning, snow was all over me and I was virtually frozen.</span> <span id="s729">I couldn't get up.</span> <span id="s730">And I had to walk bent over.</span> <span id="s731">I had no idea where I was, what in the Hell I'm doing here.</span> <span id="s732">And I started...I just started trying to straighten out a little bit; and then I started marching.</span> <span id="s733">And all of a sudden, the Germans came and rounded us up again--those who survived.</span> <span id="s734">And then...</span></p> <p><span id="s735">01:57:03</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s737">Can you hold for a little while?</span> <span id="s738">A: Yah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Because they're going to have to change and put in a new tape.</span> <span id="s740">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s741">Okay.</span> <span id="s742">Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s744">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 02:00:27</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Well, after they rounded us up again...uh it was a strange phenomena that happened.</span> <span id="s746">All of a sudden, there were soldiers, civilians, hunters with their rifles got together with us.</span> <span id="s747">And no one talked to us.</span> <span id="s748">No one said a word to us, or what's going, or where we're heading.</span> <span id="s749">And just told [us] to march.</span> <span id="s750">And...(excuse me)...and we had no idea where we're going.</span> <span id="s751">All I knew is that I was marching towards the front lines.</span> <span id="s752">And I saw the German soldiers retreating, going the other way.</span> <span id="s753">And we kept going 'til nightfall.</span> <span id="s754">And all of a sudden, when we got through...nightfall came, they told us to march forward.</span> <span id="s755">And then they disappeared.</span> <span id="s756">Everyone!</span> <span id="s757">The hunters, the civilians, the soldiers... No one tells you, and you don't question.</span> <span id="s758">And then, as a protection, a few of us, we went and started climbing the mountain there.</span> <span id="s759">We figured we would be safer.</span> <span id="s760">We didn't...the guards disappeared.</span> <span id="s761">We were left on our own.</span> <span id="s762">So then I marched to the highest mountain, with the strength that I had left; and I slept in a barn there overnight.</span> <span id="s763">We found a barn on top of the mountain.</span> <span id="s764">And when morning came, there were about 10 of us assembled there.</span> <span id="s765">We could look from the top of the mountains, there were vehicles going there.</span> <span id="s766">But we couldn't tell whether they were German vehicles or whether they were American.</span> <span id="s767">And so somebody said... You know, I didn't have any food.</span> <span id="s768">I was very starved.</span> <span id="s769">And somebody had [food] there.</span> <span id="s770">They said, "We'll give you some food if you'll go down and take a look."</span> <span id="s771">(Laughing) Well, I figured like this: "If they're Americans, I would be free.</span> <span id="s772">And if...if not, either way, I'd end up being starved to death or be back in captivity."</span> <span id="s773">So I said, "I'll go."</span> <span id="s774">That was the most suspenseful walk down the mountain in my life.</span> <span id="s775">I am walking slowly, slowly, slowly, to go down and see who are they.</span> <span id="s776">Well, I could not tell what American vehicles look like; but I knew they were not German.</span> <span id="s777">So I assumed it must be (laughing) the Americans.</span> <span id="s778">And as I walked down and I saw that they were not German, I motioned for the others also to come down.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">02:03:41 I never did get the food, (laughing) because I never went back up again for it.</span> <span id="s780">And I saw military vehicles going by.</span> <span id="s781">And for me, that was one of the most moving experiences in my life.</span> <span id="s782">Because I actually saw the mighty German Army surrender.</span> <span id="s783">American soldiers holding guns behind.</span> <span id="s784">And here are these same soldiers [who] were holding guns on my back, and now somebody else.</span> <span id="s785">This is...it's so difficult to explain...to...how life can be.</span> <span id="s786">Here, one day here's a group of people that wanted to destroy you; and here's another group of people that want to save you.</span> <span id="s787">And as I got down the mountain, I waved a vehicle to flag him down.</span> <span id="s788">So [he] pulled over.</span> <span id="s789">And it was one of those small trucks where soldiers were sitting in the back.</span> <span id="s790">And I waved at him; and I couldn't speak a word of English.</span> <span id="s791">So, the only thing [NB: way] I would tell him that I'm hungry, I just pointed my finger (laughing) at my mouth.</span> <span id="s792">So they gave me some crackers, and they just went on.</span> <span id="s793">And I just started walking.</span> <span id="s794">I don't know where I was walking.</span> <span id="s795">(Laughing) There wasn't anybody there uh picking me up, or asking.</span> <span id="s796">They were just busy, the soldiers, going up to finishing up the final remnants of resistance.</span> <span id="s797">Um, I wanted to share something, to back track a little bit, on... When the Germans had retreated and the...we were walking towards the mountains, we were actually walking into a line of fire.</span> <span id="s798">Because the American soldiers... That's what actually the Germans wanted.</span> <span id="s799">They wanted us...hoping we would get killed by American firepower.</span> <span id="s800">And we received a terrific pounding.</span> <span id="s801">The earth was shaking and trembling from American guns.</span> <span id="s802">Because they...we were right in no man's land, there in between.</span> <span id="s803">So after having gone through that Hell--and I remember that night, saying, "If I'd only make it through that night," I said, "I would be free."</span> <span id="s804">And I wrote... Later on, I wrote a poem about that...I'm not afraid... Entitled, "I'm not Afraid to March Forward, Because that's the Road to Freedom."</span> <span id="s805">And that poem won a golden award for that.</span> <span id="s806">So it made me feel pretty good.</span> <span id="s807">It describes my feelings as I am marching toward the front lines--the thoughts, and the feeling that tomorrow I'll be free again.</span> <span id="s808">And then I..</span> <span id="s809">.</span> <span id="s810">I have some music with it; and I used it as a teaching [tool].</span> <span id="s811">And when I speak to students, we sing it together.</span> <span id="s812">And...and it's very inspirational for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">02:06:33 And as I started going back, I started walking, a military vehicle stopped and picked me up.</span> <span id="s814">And what they were doing, they were picking up survivors like me, stragglers who were lost.</span> <span id="s815">And they carried me through...first to a German town, and uh...Gar...Garmisch.</span> <span id="s816">Yah, Garmisch is there.</span> <span id="s817">And we...it was interesting.</span> <span id="s818">I saw most of the women were wearing white nurses' cap.</span> <span id="s819">So I asked, "What is a white nursing... Why is everybody all of sudden a nurse?"</span> <span id="s820">Well, what I was explained is that the Russians, when they invaded, they used to rape women.</span> <span id="s821">And this way, they thought the Americans would do the same things.</span> <span id="s822">So by being a nurse, they were hoping they wouldn't be.</span> <span id="s823">(Laughing) So they then took me to a sanatorium.</span> <span id="s824">Oh, no.</span> <span id="s825">Not at first.</span> <span id="s826">First they took me into a German home.</span> <span id="s827">And they were giving everybody the C-ration food now.</span> <span id="s828">And everybody was grabbing it, and taking... We were in that home...I think we were about 10 or 15 people.</span> <span id="s829">And I was the only one that turned them down, American soldiers.</span> <span id="s830">And they said, "Look here, everybody's eating the food.</span> <span id="s831">How come you're not eating it?"</span> <span id="s832">I said, "That food is going to make me sick."</span> <span id="s833">I said, "I am not used to eating that good kind of food."</span> <span id="s834">They said, "Well, what do you want?"</span> <span id="s835">I said, "I'd like to have some fresh vegetables."</span> <span id="s836">"Where are we going to get fresh vegetables?</span> <span id="s837">There's a war going on!</span> <span id="s838">(Laughing) And you want fresh vegetables!"</span> <span id="s839">Well, they saw the seriousness of me, that I really wasn't going to eat that food--even though I was nothing but skin and bones.</span> <span id="s840">They went to German farmers and collected potatoes and carrots.</span> <span id="s841">And they brought it to me; and I had a little pot, and I boiled it.</span> <span id="s842">And that's the only food I ate for about 3 weeks.</span> <span id="s843">And I didn't need any medication or anything to recover.</span> <span id="s844">Many of those who ate that food became sick.</span> <span id="s845">Some even died.</span> <span id="s846">Mainly because their system just wasn't used to it.</span> <span id="s847">That little voice, again, was there: "Don't eat that food."</span> <span id="s848">Now after about 3 weeks, I was able to start eating regular food.</span> <span id="s849">But until the body became acclimated, then I was just eating that.</span> <span id="s850">And they were just [so] amazed, that I was like this American soldiers' center of attention.</span> <span id="s851">They look at me.</span> <span id="s852">How can somebody who is skin and bones still be alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">02:09:08</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: And then you went from there... Let's see.</span> <span id="s855">You were in that home.</span> <span id="s856">Then where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Then they took me to...they called Garmisch-Partenkirchen.</span> <span id="s858">This was a sanitarium used by the Austrians for rehabilitating people.</span> <span id="s859">And they used that as a shelter.</span> <span id="s860">So they took us to a central point there; then awaiting transportation to go back home.</span> <span id="s861">So again, when I was over there, the American doctors wanted to give me medication and all that.</span> <span id="s862">And I said, "No.</span> <span id="s863">I just want to have the natural foods, and then I'll be all right."</span> <span id="s864">And I didn't have to take any medication or anything.</span> <span id="s865">And within three weeks, I was ready to travel.</span> <span id="s866">Again!</span> <span id="s867">(Laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s868">02:09:54</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: So where did you travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Then from there, the American army took me uh to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s871">It's called Plze_.</span> <span id="s872">In Plze_, they...it was then that portion became...it was...it was divided in American and Russian zone.</span> <span id="s873">So I remember an American officer was saying, "Are you sure you want to go back into the Russian zone?</span> <span id="s874">Sure you don't want to stay in the American zone?</span> <span id="s875">Come..." I wouldn't even think of it.</span> <span id="s876">In fact, I remember when I was in uh...recuperating in Garmisch, there was somebody there from France.</span> <span id="s877">And he had a son my age; and he wanted me to come to stay with him, to live.</span> <span id="s878">And there's no way.</span> <span id="s879">Uh, so once we got into the Russian zone, then it was entirely different.</span> <span id="s880">We didn't get treat...any special treatment.</span> <span id="s881">And as I was going to the train station to take another train, all of a sudden I saw people...people uh there.</span> <span id="s882">Yelling, shouting, throwing stones; and here they caught a Nazi.</span> <span id="s883">And they're... Somebody said, "Well, why don't you stop.</span> <span id="s884">And you can have revenge on them."</span> <span id="s885">"No.</span> <span id="s886">I want to go home."</span> <span id="s887">And that was the first.</span> <span id="s888">And I had run toward the train station; and I ran and ran, and I just missed the train.</span> <span id="s889">It felt...it was very depressing, because I was so anxious.</span> <span id="s890">Then finally another train came and took me to Hungary.</span> <span id="s891">And Hungary, when I walked in there...in that square, it was like a million people all had converged--they're coming home.</span> <span id="s892">And it was ironic that after I arrived, they start asking question about your age.</span> <span id="s893">And was the first time I could tell what my real age (laughing) was, without having to have fear that uh something would happen.</span> <span id="s894">And then, they said that it would... they didn't know how long they could...I would have to wait, because there were so many people who wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s895">Those who had survived.</span> <span id="s896">And that the only way to get home was to travel on top of the train, one of those cattle type trains.</span> <span id="s897">Can you imagine the experience?</span> <span id="s898">Travelling overnight when I had nothing to hold on to.</span> <span id="s899">And just swinging there, going through tunnels.</span> <span id="s900">I was so anxious to get home.</span> <span id="s901">And finally when I got into Sighet... This was in Romania.</span> <span id="s902">It was about 15 miles from where I lived.</span> <span id="s903">And this was my next point before getting home.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">02:12:54</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: So then you... Eventually, you did get home?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: In Sziget, the only way from there to get home was walk.</span> <span id="s907">And this was at night.</span> <span id="s908">And I finally got into the town.</span> <span id="s909">It was about 2:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s910">I was scared.</span> <span id="s911">There was the Russian soldiers there.</span> <span id="s912">And I didn't know what they'd do; I thought they'd shoot.</span> <span id="s913">So I just stood still in those bushes all night.</span> <span id="s914">And I was so elated I was finally home.</span> <span id="s915">And then the next morning, I went home and I found that there was a Russian family living there.</span> <span id="s916">They wouldn't even let me in the house.</span> <span id="s917">They said this is their house now.</span> <span id="s918">It belongs to them.</span> <span id="s919">And I said, "Can I just go in and just open the door?"</span> <span id="s920">Because my survival was the ability that I saw myself opening the door to my home.</span> <span id="s921">And I just wanted to have that.</span> <span id="s922">I opened the door; and this was the most touching moment for me, that here is a vision that I carried with me and finally came through.</span> <span id="s923">Then it entailed a scene what it's like living under the Russians.</span> <span id="s924">I would lose my freedom again.</span> <span id="s925">I found a cousin that survived; and uh we both decided that we are going to leave from there forever, and not...not make it our home anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s927">So then where did you go from there?</span> <span id="s928">02:14:20</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: From there, I went back to Sziget again, where I came.</span> <span id="s930">And I didn't know where I was going to head.</span> <span id="s931">I just knew that I wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s932">And I heard...word was passed on that there is a uh organization to help people to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s933">And here I was on my own.</span> <span id="s934">Nobody cared for us.</span> <span id="s935">And the only way to get--we had to go to Hungary--was by train.</span> <span id="s936">And this time, we had to have tickets for travelling.</span> <span id="s937">I didn't have any tickets.</span> <span id="s938">I didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s939">And I went on a train; they didn't notice me.</span> <span id="s940">And when I got to a city--it was probably Debrecen, or something--they started checking for tickets.</span> <span id="s941">It was at night, and I didn't have one.</span> <span id="s942">And I ran out of the station; and the ticket master yelled to the police, "After him!</span> <span id="s943">After him!"</span> <span id="s944">And I ran, and ran in a bombed out building.</span> <span id="s945">And I was there by myself.</span> <span id="s946">And I said, "My God, what in the heck am I doing?</span> <span id="s947">Here I was supposed to be home free, reunited with my family.</span> <span id="s948">Here I'm a fugitive, the police are after me!"</span> <span id="s949">And I heard them talking: "Did you see anybody run in here?</span> <span id="s950">Did you see anybody running there?"</span> <span id="s951">They couldn't.</span> <span id="s952">And then they finally left.</span> <span id="s953">The next day, I didn't give up.</span> <span id="s954">(Laughing) Back on the train again.</span> <span id="s955">(Laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: So that took you to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">4 Rom: Sighetul-Marma_iei, or Hung: Mámarossziget.</span> <span id="s958">Located in Romania near the northern border with Hungary and the Ukrainian SSR.</span> <span id="s959">Under Hungarian control during 1940-1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: It took me to Budapest.</span> <span id="s961">In Budapest, I found out that there was a youth group.</span> <span id="s962">Those that were...few that survived, and others that were hidden during the war, were now decided also to leave Europe.</span> <span id="s963">And we formed what we called a "kibbutz" to go to Palestine, it was called at that time.</span> <span id="s964">And after waiting for about six months over there, (excuse me) they told us that the only way we'd be able to get out from Budapest is to go on cattle train, like we went to Auschwitz; because the Russians were not allowing legally.</span> <span id="s965">So they had to...whatever arrangements, whoever made it didn't explain anything to me other than get on the train.</span> <span id="s966">And...and I remember we were travelling at night, and the train going through just like in Auschwitz--cling, cling, going; cling, cling, stopping.</span> <span id="s967">And just wondering if we'll ever be discovered, because we went illegally.</span> <span id="s968">Finally, morning came; and they told us that we were in Austria, in American zone.</span> <span id="s969">So we knew we were finally free.</span> <span id="s970">So when we got to Vienna and we stayed there about two or three days... Uh, I'm trying to think in which...there's a place that uh...very famous hotel.</span> <span id="s971">I can't think of it right now; but we stayed there about three days.</span> <span id="s972">And they said we will not be able to go directly to Palestine, because the British were blockading it.</span> <span id="s973">Uh, that we'll have to go to Germany and wait.</span> <span id="s974">Talk about depression (laughing) setting in!</span></p> <p><span id="s975">02:17:28</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: So then you are now on the move again.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Back on the train again!</span> <span id="s978">(Laughing) This is why I had done this story before.</span> <span id="s979">I called To Hell and Freedom; and this is a continuous story where I superimpose the sounds of the trains.</span> <span id="s980">Because that's what this is all--the whole story of trains, trains, travelling.</span> <span id="s981">Then, when we got to Germany, they put us into a former German military camp.</span> <span id="s982">And uh it was called Leipheim.</span> <span id="s983">And we were then there processed, preparing ourselves to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s984">One, we learned military drill; because they told us that as soon as we're going to get in there, we're going to be in the fighting.</span> <span id="s985">From one Hell to another Hell.</span> <span id="s986">But we were not afraid, because we knew this time that we'll have to fight for our freedom.</span> <span id="s987">It's not going to come easy.</span> <span id="s988">And in between times--this is really ironic-- they arranged, whoever was in charge of the whole thing, for us to learn farming; trained by German farmers.</span> <span id="s989">So we learned farming, learned how to plant seeds for farms; and learning how to prepare for war again.</span> <span id="s990">And we found out that after...it's almost a year waiting, tha...uh the...they would not allow legally.</span> <span id="s991">They would only allow one [person] a month from our group.</span> <span id="s992">From the various groups, the British would only allow so many per month.</span> <span id="s993">So what we would do in the kibbutz is we would put our name in our hat...in a hat.</span> <span id="s994">And then the one that got pulled out, that [one] got [to go].</span> <span id="s995">I remember one, the first one that got [to go], when he arrived--he went to Israel...he went to Palestine, and told us how wonderful it is there.</span> <span id="s996">And uh we were really eagerly looking forward to the day we would join him.</span> <span id="s997">And then after about a year waiting-- frustrating, depressing, waiting--all of a sudden somebody from the office calls me in and that somebody wants to talk to me.</span> <span id="s998">"What is it about?"</span> <span id="s999">"Well, do you have any relatives in America?"</span> <span id="s1000">First thing, I said, "Well, I think I have an aunt.</span> <span id="s1001">But I don't know any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Why?"</span> <span id="s1003">"Well, your relatives just found out about you."</span> <span id="s1004">I had about four aunts that I didn't know, my father's sisters.</span> <span id="s1005">"And they want you to go come to America."</span> <span id="s1006">I said, "Oh, no, no.</span> <span id="s1007">Not me.</span> <span id="s1008">I'm... And America's not for me."</span> <span id="s1009">Okay, then they sent telegram back to America, saying, "He doesn't want to come."</span> <span id="s1010">Then they sent another telegram.</span> <span id="s1011">They said, "Well, if you really want to go to Israel, then it will be easier to go to Israel from America than from Germany."</span> <span id="s1012">And I just wanted to get out of there.</span> <span id="s1013">I said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s1014">I will accept their kind offer, and I'll come to America."</span> <span id="s1015">That's how I came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">02:20:39</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: And where did you come to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: I came to New York, and I stayed there for awhile.</span> <span id="s1019">And I lived in a small shtetl; New York was just overwhelming for me.</span> <span id="s1020">So then they...I..</span> <span id="s1021">.</span> <span id="s1022">they sent me to Cleveland when I arrived from New York.</span> <span id="s1023">And I stayed there with the family, for a little while.</span> <span id="s1024">Then I started high school.</span> <span id="s1025">And that's when... I was one of the few, very few, of my age who made it; and when I started high school and I..</span> <span id="s1026">.</span> <span id="s1027">I was looked at like [I] came from another world.</span> <span id="s1028">Because uh I was their age, and uh they were all very nice.</span> <span id="s1029">But they didn't even know how to approach me or ask me any questions, because everything was so fresh.</span> <span id="s1030">In their minds, they had just seen in the movies the horrors and these things.</span> <span id="s1031">So I was looked at as uh somebody who had come from another world.</span> <span id="s1032">You know, it was a strange experience to go to school.</span> <span id="s1033">And yet, it was a struggle; because the teachers had a struggle with what to do.</span> <span id="s1034">I was at an age, I was too old for junior high school and I missed all that background in junior high school to be in high school.</span> <span id="s1035">So what do they do?</span> <span id="s1036">They send me [to] both!</span> <span id="s1037">(Laughing) To high school, and junior high school private tutoring.</span> <span id="s1038">From that, and... Talk about having a rough road!</span> <span id="s1039">But I managed to keep up with them; and...and I finished high school.</span> <span id="s1040">And I was just getting on my feet, starting... starting to college, when I get a "Dear John" letter from Uncle Sam.</span> <span id="s1041">That was when the Korean War was on.</span> <span id="s1042">That was just a joke.</span> <span id="s1043">(Laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">02:22:31</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: How old were you then?</span> <span id="s1046">A: I was about 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1048">So what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Well, they said, "There's a war on, and you're of military age.</span> <span id="s1050">And you're going to be drafted."</span> <span id="s1051">And then I tried to explain to him what I just went through, that Hell.</span> <span id="s1052">I told him that uh being in a camp would be very detrimental for me.</span> <span id="s1053">Well, they were...listened and said, "Yah.</span> <span id="s1054">We'll give you two choices.</span> <span id="s1055">Either go to the draft, or go to jail.</span> <span id="s1056">Which one do you want?"</span> <span id="s1057">(Laughing) Very sympathetic.</span> <span id="s1058">Naturally, uh...I didn't want to go to jail.</span> <span id="s1059">I took--I may not say the better of the two, but I took one of the two.</span> <span id="s1060">(Laughing) And when I arrived in that military training camp... That night, it was the most gruesome, the most horrible experience of my life.</span> <span id="s1061">Because it brought back all of the traumatic experiences.</span> <span id="s1062">It was at night.</span> <span id="s1063">Flashlig...the lights were on the perimeter of the camp, the barbed wire of the camp.</span> <span id="s1064">And the shouting: "Get off!</span> <span id="s1065">Get off!</span> <span id="s1066">Get in there!"</span> <span id="s1067">You know, it was just like a repeat.</span> <span id="s1068">And get in there; and the first thing, that "You guys are the lowest scum on earth!"</span> <span id="s1069">And telling you, "We're going to make men out of you!"</span> <span id="s1070">And so on.</span> <span id="s1071">And I thought, "Here we go again."</span> <span id="s1072">And the next thing they do is that we're going to shave.</span> <span id="s1073">And I said, "Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1074">They're not going to do that!"</span> <span id="s1075">But they did it.</span> <span id="s1076">And to do it, I had to numb myself like I did in the camp.</span> <span id="s1077">All that healing that I was just going through, that they were just coming; with everything there, [it] was destroyed in that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: You're talking about shaving your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Shaving my head, and cutting the hair.</span> <span id="s1080">And just being back in a camp again.</span> <span id="s1081">So I lived with the same survival instinct that I had to do in the camps.</span> <span id="s1082">And it was very depressing.</span> <span id="s1083">It was very traumatic.</span> <span id="s1084">But there's no one to turn to that you can say how you really feel.</span> <span id="s1085">No one can really understand or relate.</span> <span id="s1086">They had no feeling to even think how I would feel.</span> <span id="s1087">And so I'm just like a machine, numb machine, going through the mechanical motions of something that I was forced into doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">02:25:15 And I managed to keep up with the training, until one day they announced that part of the training exercise will be...is to go through a gas chamber of tear gas.</span> <span id="s1089">And that was like a bolt of lighting would have struck.</span> <span id="s1090">Suddenly, the next day I..</span> <span id="s1091">.</span> <span id="s1092">I started limping a little bit.</span> <span id="s1093">I just couldn't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s1094">And the limp got worse and worse.</span> <span id="s1095">And it got so bad that I just could not walk anymore, and my whole body became totally paralyzed.</span> <span id="s1096">I..</span> <span id="s1097">.</span> <span id="s1098">I was just like a piece of wood.</span> <span id="s1099">I'd pick up my hand and it'd fall down.</span> <span id="s1100">Well, they carried me in in the stretcher, just like the kind they carried me in--a little bit fancier, but it was like in Dachau, it reminded me.</span> <span id="s1101">And the doctors started asking questions, "What happened?"</span> <span id="s1102">Well, after they learned of what happened, they were so upset that how could they--the military authorities--not recognize some compassion of uh helping me stay out, or do something else.</span> <span id="s1103">So they said they are...that I have suffered enough in my life already.</span> <span id="s1104">That they are now willing to give me a medical discharge, and I can go back into civilian life again.</span> <span id="s1105">Well, there was that little voice again.</span> <span id="s1106">(Laughing) For better or worse.</span> <span id="s1107">And uh...I told the doctor, I said, "One."</span> <span id="s1108">I said, "I want to stay in, because I want to complete my military obligation.</span> <span id="s1109">Because I want to pay...repay my debt to America for liberating me.</span> <span id="s1110">And the other thing is," I told him, "the Nazis could not keep me down on my feet.</span> <span id="s1111">I walked out of Dachau.</span> <span id="s1112">And I want to walk out with an honorable discharge, and not a medical discharge."</span> <span id="s1113">They were very surprised; because they said, "My God," they said, "they...there are some guys here, they'd give their right hand if they could get out.</span> <span id="s1114">Because you're going to be in the fighting right after you get through."</span> <span id="s1115">But I was just numb.</span> <span id="s1116">I..</span> <span id="s1117">.</span> <span id="s1118">I was just... I don't know what I was...whether it was really me saying; but I just said, "I'll make it."</span> <span id="s1119">And I went back in training again; and I asked them only one thing, before I went back, is to waive the requirement of having to go through that gas chamber exercise.</span> <span id="s1120">And they said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1121">And I went back training again.</span> <span id="s1122">And it was just like in the camps.</span> <span id="s1123">Up in the 4:00 morning, standing roll call again.</span> <span id="s1124">(Laughing) "You're the lowest scum on earth!"</span> <span id="s1125">Again, too.</span> <span id="s1126">Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1127">Here we go again.</span> <span id="s1128">How much more can a person take something like that?</span> <span id="s1129">But you become numb, you know.</span> <span id="s1130">You...you're not really sensitive to feelings any more.</span> <span id="s1131">You just...you know that you have to do that to get over to get to the next step.</span> <span id="s1132">And I knew, just like in the camps, that they are rewards for hard work in there.</span> <span id="s1133">And I went and I really worked hard.</span> <span id="s1134">Not only in physical training in the military, but we had to do a lot of training we had to learn from books--tactics, manuevers.</span> <span id="s1135">And I made up my mind that I wanted to be on top.</span> <span id="s1136">And we finished...we were like a hundred and fifty of us; and I finished in the top three on the 150.</span> <span id="s1137">And then, because of that, they sent me for special military intelligence training school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">02:29:06</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: What happened with the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Well, uh...when--ironic--when I finished and they sent me out to the school, they...uh they made me in charge of the group of the... They gave me in charge of the record.</span> <span id="s1141">And I had no idea why, really, I had all those problems from the...from what caused the paralysis.</span> <span id="s1142">And since I was in charge of the records, I looked up...I was able to look and see.</span> <span id="s1143">They wouldn't tell me why it was.</span> <span id="s1144">They just said... And then I learned that it was because of that.</span> <span id="s1145">Because I didn't understand yet all this what's going on inside the mind.</span> <span id="s1146">I knew it was from that, but I really did not know the details of it.</span> <span id="s1147">So this kind of helped me uh understand myself a little better.</span> <span id="s1148">So then, when we got into training and I finished, I was almost a year in communications intelligence; because what they trained us for is to be front line person for the war, to report what's going on for the airplanes.</span> <span id="s1149">It was in the Air Force.</span> <span id="s1150">And then after I finished training and they sent me to the South for more advanced training; and then they sort of divided up.</span> <span id="s1151">Half of us went to Europe, and the other half went to Korea.</span> <span id="s1152">Fortunately, my name--because it was alphabetical--they took the first half of the alphabet list, they sent to Europe.</span> <span id="s1153">So it was a little bit of luck there, because if I had gotten into Korea I would have been sent... My function was the training to be a front line observer like.</span> <span id="s1154">So when they sent me to Europe--they didn't say where--when I got to Europe, they said I'm going to be sent to Germany.</span> <span id="s1155">(Laughing) And ironically, when there I was...I was numbed again.</span> <span id="s1156">I said, "There is one thing that I'm gonna do...want to do.</span> <span id="s1157">Is I want to finish my military obligation, and I want to visit Palestine."</span> <span id="s1158">Because when I left that group in Germany in 1946, I made a commitment that someday I'll look them up.</span> <span id="s1159">And so I saved up all my military leave time, and uh used it up to go to Europe [NB: Israel].</span> <span id="s1160">It was a..</span> <span id="s1161">.</span> <span id="s1162">as I'm talking, there was a little incident that is ...happened in Germany that I thought it would be worthwhile sharing with you.</span> <span id="s1163">Is...uh part of my job was also delivering supplies to the area where we were stand...where we stayed, in the mountains there.</span> <span id="s1164">And once when I was driving--this was a real big-semi truck that I was driving--and it was really rainy, very slippery.</span> <span id="s1165">As I was going up the mountain, I was going...and all of a sudden, as I was going downwards, I see a group of civilians right in the middle of the road.</span> <span id="s1166">I didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1167">I slam on the brakes and my whole truck went out of control.</span> <span id="s1168">And the civilians scattering all over the place.</span> <span id="s1169">And here I am fighting to bring the truck under control.</span> <span id="s1170">And all of a sudden, finally, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1171">The truck went a little uphill climb, and it came to a stop.</span> <span id="s1172">And all of a sudden, the German civilians were came and all around the truck.</span> <span id="s1173">So since I could speak German, I asked if I did any harm or any damage when this... Because I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1174">They said no.</span> <span id="s1175">Uh, then I said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s1176">Why don't you just move out, and I want to keep going."</span> <span id="s1177">"No."</span> <span id="s1178">They took ... And they had a truck, a small truck; and they parked it right in front of mine.</span> <span id="s1179">They weren't going to let me go, and they wouldn't tell me what uh it's all about.</span> <span id="s1180">And I figured ... Well, I took the truck in gear and started pushing that other truck off the road.</span> <span id="s1181">And they were trying to prevent me from doing... And all of a sudden, I see a German comes up and with a gun.</span> <span id="s1182">Yells, "Halt!"</span> <span id="s1183">And that was... I had a gun, too.</span> <span id="s1184">We were given it to protect ourself.</span> <span id="s1185">All the fury that ever came out... Because I didn't want to, before, intermingle with anything; because I knew I'm there to do my job.</span> <span id="s1186">I yelled out...back at him, that he was so shocked.</span> <span id="s1187">Here a American soldier is yelling at him in German.</span> <span id="s1188">He didn't know what to say.</span> <span id="s1189">He said, "Raus!"</span> <span id="s1190">And I said, "I didn't do any harm.</span> <span id="s1191">I didn't do any damage to anything, and I'm not going to get out."</span> <span id="s1192">And he saw the seriousness on my face, and he saw... And he reminded me of that Nazi Commandant, and...that in Reichenbach.</span> <span id="s1193">I mean, here...in Reichenbach, being if it was like that, I wouldn't have said one word.</span> <span id="s1194">And here, there were all kinds of witnesses around.</span> <span id="s1195">There were two in the front.</span> <span id="s1196">And he saw that it was a good chance that he could have died, too, if he did something.</span> <span id="s1197">And I that felt...I said, "I'm not going to let go."</span> <span id="s1198">I felt, and a thought came to me, "Here I came as a..</span> <span id="s1199">.</span> <span id="s1200">to keep the peace, and I could end up dying."</span> <span id="s1201">And he saw the seriousness there was.</span> <span id="s1202">And he was looking around and he was thinking (laughing) that maybe (laughing) it could happen to him.</span> <span id="s1203">And he put the gun back in his holster.</span> <span id="s1204">And I asked him, "What happened?</span> <span id="s1205">Why...why all this happened?</span> <span id="s1206">What's going on."</span> <span id="s1207">He said [that] ahead of me, there happened to be an American soldier was driving [who] inadvertently killed a German civilian.</span> <span id="s1208">So the civilians were harassing the American troops.</span> <span id="s1209">Or anybody that come down.</span> <span id="s1210">And be like in the middle of the road, and the person go out of control.</span> <span id="s1211">And then they'd run away.</span> <span id="s1212">And I just happen to be in the road again.</span> <span id="s1213">(Laughing) And what did he do?</span> <span id="s1214">Three weeks later, I get called in by the commander from the camp.</span> <span id="s1215">He says, "Dave, I just got a report that you killed a German civilian."</span> <span id="s1216">Of course, I had the witness and told the story.</span> <span id="s1217">He was so angry of what that German policeman did, trying... because of what I did [that] he wrote to the mayor of that town, telling that this is not Nazi Germany anymore.</span> <span id="s1218">And so that's when that ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">02:35:51</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Okay, then, right after... Then, after you completed your service in Germany, you came back to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: I went for that... I told you about that visit to Palestine--it was Israel, in 1956.</span> <span id="s1222">And after I got back, I went back to civilian life, and tried one more time.</span> <span id="s1223">(Laughing) So then I went to school of engineering, since I was in communications engineering.</span> <span id="s1224">And I went and also got a job, working in the day and going to school at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1226">How did you end up in Detroit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Well, this company I stayed in Cleveland that I worked for, uh transferred me from Cleveland to Detroit.</span> <span id="s1228">And that's...</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1230">Thanks very much.</span> <span id="s1231">I think we went through the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Yah, it's... I think that uh we can all learn from what has happened, that... The things that I try to emphasize, as I teach it in the schools, is to...for the...those who are involved in teaching education to teach the youth that this is not a one-time happening.</span> <span id="s1233">That we must understand ourselves first.</span> <span id="s1234">That we have to understand that--and this is difficult to communicate--that every human being is capable of carrying out horrors and atrocities.</span> <span id="s1235">Because there were some uh victims in the camps, who became Kapos, that were more brutal than the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1236">Because they wanted to have favors.</span> <span id="s1237">And then there were some guards, who did...all they did is guard.</span> <span id="s1238">They did not uh actually uh abuse people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">02:38:04 In fact, as I look back, there was one incident in Reichenbach that happened that I was working in a woman's compound.</span> <span id="s1240">And there were uh newly arrived women in that camp, who saw me uh working there.</span> <span id="s1241">And was...must have been a mother.</span> <span id="s1242">And she says, "Kinderle."</span> <span id="s1243">(Beckoning with his arm) I turn around.</span> <span id="s1244">"You!</span> <span id="s1245">I got some food for you."</span> <span id="s1246">I said... She says, "Come on!</span> <span id="s1247">Come on!</span> <span id="s1248">The guard is not looking now."</span> <span id="s1249">So I ran to the fence quickly, and she gave me some bread, and I ran back to the detail...work detail.</span> <span id="s1250">And there was a guard coming [who] saw me.</span> <span id="s1251">And that was it.</span> <span id="s1252">Once you did that, that was the end.</span> <span id="s1253">And he said...it was uh one thing...once you were caught, it was off to a wall.</span> <span id="s1254">It was traditional they take you to a wall with a stick; and you got the stick and picked it up and walking to the wall.</span> <span id="s1255">And I prepared myself.</span> <span id="s1256">And all of a sudden, just before we got there, he stopped and he asked me how old I was.</span> <span id="s1257">And here was a little voice that said... For the first time, I had to make a decision.</span> <span id="s1258">If I told him my real age, I knew I was gonna... If I told him the truth that was my age, then I knew that that was the end; because he would turn me in.</span> <span id="s1259">There was a voice saying, "This time, tell what your age is."</span> <span id="s1260">I told him that I am 13.</span> <span id="s1261">He looked at me.</span> <span id="s1262">He says, "Get back to work!"</span> <span id="s1263">And I was expecting, after that incident happened, that he would turn me in.</span> <span id="s1264">And he never turned me in.</span> <span id="s1265">Strange things happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: So you gave the right answer that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Why I did, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1268">It...it just... You...you're faced with a split decision.</span> <span id="s1269">You don't know who's telling you to do what.</span> <span id="s1270">You just...and then you... I know if I had have said 16, that would be the end.</span> <span id="s1271">And I took a chance, [a] risk, saying that I was 13.</span> <span id="s1272">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Dave, I want to thank you.</span> <span id="s1274">It was a terrific interview.</span> <span id="s1275">You really expressed yourself well.</span> <span id="s1276">A: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1277">And thank you for inviting me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: I think that there were some wonderful things that you brought up, and you brought out some new facts and things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: I hope that what I shared will be of benefit to others.</span> <span id="s1280">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1281">Thanks a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">02:40:43</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">PHOTOGRAPHS &amp; OBJECTS</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">02:40:44 David's grandparents and aunt in an automobile.</span> <span id="s1286">Taken in Bochov in 1937, when his aunt returned from the America to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">David's father, Abraham Bergman.</span> <span id="s1288">Circa 1920-1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Three children: David's older sister, Sarah; David (then age 5); David's younger brother Mendel.</span> <span id="s1290">Taken behind the family home in Bochov, circa 1936.</span> <span id="s1291">This is the only picture of the three children together which survives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">ID papers, with photo, from Leipheim DP Camp, 1946.</span> <span id="s1293">Shows circular stamp: "UNRRA, American Zone, Leipheim."</span> <span id="s1294">David and his best friend from Bochov, 1946.</span> <span id="s1295">His friend (no name given), who is the same age as David, survived the war in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">David in a USAF flight suit, 1952.</span> <span id="s1297">This photograph was taken just after the incident concerning gas chamber training, during which David had lost some weight.</span> <span id="s1298">He appears quite thin here, but says he quickly recovered after he was told he would not have to endure the tear gas training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Wooden clogs, of the type prisoners were forced to wear in labor camps.</span> <span id="s1300">These have the wooden bottom and leather top.</span> <span id="s1301">They have heavy nails or rivets in the bottom, and were painful to wear.</span> <span id="s1302">This pair was given to David by a friend who was a combat artist.</span> <span id="s1303">After the war, this friend found the clogs at Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">02:45:00</span></p></body></html>
