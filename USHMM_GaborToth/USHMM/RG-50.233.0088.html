volume were very soft and when the voice of the interviewee dropped it was often impossible to hear the words.]</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: Today is March 25, 1992, I’m Anthony Di Iorio.</span> <span id="s5">I’m at the home of Ellen Mendel and I’m here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to interview her about her recollections of the Holocaust and about the effects of the Holocaust on her family.</span> <span id="s6">Before beginning I should probably mention that Ellen had some surgery this morning as a result of an accident on her foot but as a great trouper and academician she has decided to go ahead with this interview even though it is a beautiful day here in New York City.</span> <span id="s7">Hello Ellen.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: Hi, Tony.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: How’re you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: Great.</span> <span id="s11">Enjoying this a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: You’re enjoying a broken toe a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I appreciate the opportunity of talking to you about my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s15">I’m going to ask you to go back in time, forgetting about feet and the nice weather and take us back to Germany when you were a little girl growing up.</span> <span id="s16">First of all where were you born in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I was born in Essen.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And your birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: September 22, 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: My parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My father, his name was Ernst and my mother was Jella Mendel.</span> <span id="s24">That’s how we pronounced it in Germany.</span> <span id="s25">He was a physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Your father was a physician?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: In Germany.</span> <span id="s29">In Esssen?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: She was a housewife.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Now what memories do you have, if any, of growing up in Essen?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Okay, what I’ll tell you about is what I remember and also what I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Was told by your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Right.</span> <span id="s37">An interesting fact is that I was born one week after the Nuremberg laws came out.</span> <span id="s38">They came out September 16.</span> <span id="s39">I was born a week later.</span> <span id="s40">And at that point Jews were not allowed to have anybody working in their house who were Christians unless they were over fifty because the Nazis were afraid that they would intermarry or…</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Hanky Panky?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Right.</span> <span id="s43">And so my earliest days -- you know I had a nursemaid that they had to let go and I know my mother explained how sad that occasion was so they had to let her go of this nursemaid and they changed several times.</span> <span id="s44">There was Shvesta Gatzog or Shvesta Maria.</span> <span id="s45">So I think I got Shvesta Maria.</span> <span id="s46">She was over fifty so that was okay.</span> <span id="s47">She was nice too but from my earliest years were kind of changing caretakers.</span> <span id="s48">There was, of course, my mother but I think she felt it would be good to have a nursemaid for me in those early years.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: So your nursemaids were all elderly Aryan women?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Right and they were very lovely people and my parents got along very well with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Were there other non-Jewish people in the household?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: What I want to say is that I think Shvesta Roiskin,, Shvesta Gatzog, Shvesta Roiskin, Shvesta Maria -- Shvesta Roiskin made them….</span> <span id="s53">.</span> <span id="s54">They also could have somebody Jewish so maybe one of them was Jewish.</span> <span id="s55">If you had someone who was Jewish they could be that age.</span> <span id="s56">But I am aware that there was a lot of change in the beginning because even though the Nuremberg laws came out -- until they came to the people -- you know, a little time must have gone by, there was a lot of confusion.</span> <span id="s57">And then my mother used to say that new edicts would appear like a bolt of lightning out of the air overnight.</span> <span id="s58">You never knew what was going to happen next, where the Jews couldn’t go, what they had to do or what they couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s59">So my parents, for example, were married at home because that was easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: When were they married?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: And they didn’t go on vacation in Germany on their honeymoon because that was already was closed off as far as I recollect so they went to Italy on their honeymoon.</span> <span id="s62">They got married in 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: So the Nazis had been in power for more than a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Right.</span> <span id="s65">On my birth certificate also there’s a swastika.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: No.</span> <span id="s68">My father said because of the situation we couldn’t afford it.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Was he able to continue practicing medicine?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Well that’s an interesting story -- because he served in the First World War and had been decorated for distinguished service the army kind of was able to protect their own as it were and Hitler couldn’t do very much.</span> <span id="s71">So he was allowed to practice for a very, very long time and he was of the opinion that Hitler was blowing over and that then things would be better.</span> <span id="s72">So we stayed in Germany until 1939 which isn’t to say that we didn’t want to leave earlier.</span> <span id="s73">After Kristallnacht I don’t think any Jews had any doubt of what was going to be the mood of the country.</span> <span id="s74">I wouldn’t say the fate of all Jews because it wasn’t known at that time.</span> <span id="s75">So during Kristallnacht, for example, I was in Essen alone with my grandfather, my father’s father, while they were getting ready in Berlin, they bought all this furniture that you see here, they bought all of that and they got ready to emigrate.</span> <span id="s76">And I would always be left with different people, my grandfather in Essen or my grandparents in Heidelberg while they would leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: So your grandfather in Essen, would that be on your father’s side of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Your grandparents in Heidelberg on your mother’s side of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: One of the stories that is told, that my father told me is that when I was a toddler we were in the trolley car and there were a lot of men with their swastikas and we were sitting there.</span> <span id="s81">My father was trying to keep a very low profile and me being this curious little kid I started asking all about those signs that I was seeing.</span> <span id="s82">In a loud voice Papa [vas iss dos] and my father tried to explain very quietly so that I wouldn’t cause a commotion and nobody would notice us.</span> <span id="s83">And I said [very indistinct] and I just kept on and on and he wasn’t able to let me know enough that I had to keep quiet.</span> <span id="s84">So finally he took me and we got out of the trolley car because he was afraid that we would get in trouble.</span> <span id="s85">My father was also in a concentration camp, in Dachau.</span> <span id="s86">In the early days the Nazis were imprisoning a lot of people and it seems to me from what he told me he was put in because he was vice-president of the B’nai Brith chapter.</span> <span id="s87">So they were ransoming until they got all the money he was there.</span> <span id="s88">So he was there maybe two days or something like that.</span> <span id="s89">But he was in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Two days in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And this was to extort money?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: So the fact that he was a war veteran and a physician didn’t make any difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: At that point it didn’t matter anymore.</span> <span id="s96">At that point Hitler had taken over the army.</span> <span id="s97">And so the army was powerless.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Was this after you were born this happened or before?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Oh, after.</span> <span id="s100">It was after Kristallnacht I guess.</span> <span id="s101">Oh yeah, that was just before the…probably ’38 or something like that</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Was he still practicing medicine at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No, he had to stop at some point.</span> <span id="s104">There was one point where everybody had to stop who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s105">At that point he said if I can’t make my livelihood then I can’t live here.</span> <span id="s106">At that’s when he started to get ready and to find out how to get out, where we could go, who would give us the affidavit, and these must have been extremely stressful times.</span> <span id="s107">As far as my life before that I came from very comfortable milieu.</span> <span id="s108">My parents’ families on both sides had lived in Germany since about the 1700s.</span> <span id="s109">We were very comfortable and my life was a very good one.</span> <span id="s110">An interesting story is told that people like my -- once my mother told the story that if my father --- this couldn’t happen in the Holocaust though---he was so prominent, two things, first he walked into a store like Woolworth, or some kind of a low class store, people were overheard to say well -- Dr. Mendel…[in German] if he goes in we could also go.</span> <span id="s111">But more directly, when my parents were getting ready for the emigration it was around the time of Kristallnacht and they were in Berlin and I was alone in Essen with my grandfather.</span> <span id="s112">When they called they were told don’t come back, stay where you are.</span> <span id="s113">You won’t be recognized in Berlin, in Essen you’re too well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: So your grandparents told your parents that….</span> <span id="s115">.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: I think somebody called the house and spoke to my grandfather.</span> <span id="s117">My grandfather was very prominent in Essen, not only my grandfather but his brother had a huge practice my father inherited.</span> <span id="s118">He made some discoveries with diabetes.</span> <span id="s119">He was very well known……[indistinct] But he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: This would have been your father’s uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes, Uncle Felix.</span> <span id="s122">My father called him Uncle Felix.</span> <span id="s123">He was my great-uncle.</span> <span id="s124">So they stayed longer and my father treated people from the Krupp family and so they helped also and from the packing they gave him favors because 1) he was well liked 2) he was well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: So you’re saying Krupp, people from Krupp helped your father during the emigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yeah, yeah, right.</span> <span id="s127">I mean we got everything out.</span> <span id="s128">All into our [indistinct] and everything and most of it seemed to come from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Did your parents own their own place or were they…</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: No, I went back there and they were renting.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Apartment building or a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Like a big apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Now you mentioned you were with your grandparents at one point.</span> <span id="s134">Did they live with you or was it just you and your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: No, this was in Heidelberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Oh, so you stayed in Heidelberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yeah, my parents would park me there and I would be with my grandparents but you know I’ve been in therapy and some of the stuff that’s come out you know in the last ten years even would say is that on some people I was afraid they were never gonna come back and that they wouldn’t take me.</span> <span id="s138">So today certain reactions to things go all the way back to that time when I was left with wonderful grandparents but all I wanted to do was in a garden…</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: This was in Heidelberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yeah, all I wanted to do was go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Home meaning to Essen.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: With my parents…I just wanted my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: So would you say you were growing up half the time in Heidelberg and half the time in Essen?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No, I think most of the time I was in Essen but then when my parents would get ready for a few weeks I would stay for a time…Moving ahead ….</span> <span id="s145">[indistinct] well that’s some of what I remember when I was growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: So you remember seeing any other Nazis besides the ones on trolley car that day?</span> <span id="s147">That was the first time you had seen a swastika?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: That was the first time I responded out loud, so openly.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did your father ever explain afterwards what the swastika meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Nobody ever explained anything to me and so I came to this country, I was a very confused little child.</span> <span id="s151">I had many fears and once I found out in a big, long workshop that I thought that everything that ever happened that was wrong was my fault.</span> <span id="s152">That any problems my parents had you know I just [?]</span> <span id="s153">had this feeling that I was always doing the wrong thing so everything must have been my fault.</span> <span id="s154">Nobody really ever talked to me about it because they didn’t think I would understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: So not even afterwards did they explain?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: No, not when I was a child.</span> <span id="s157">You know I’d be much older before they explained anything.</span> <span id="s158">Then my father spoke.</span> <span id="s159">I can tell you what he did.</span> <span id="s160">We were only allowed to take out ten dollars, the equivalent of ten dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: When you left Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: When we left Germany and my father knew that it would be hard for us to get started and he couldn’t be a physician right away.</span> <span id="s163">So he took toothpaste out of toothpaste containers with gloves, no well he squeezed it out with gloves and put in money with tweezers and then he sent it ….</span> <span id="s164">[indistinct].</span> <span id="s165">I’m not sure if he ever got the money but…</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Got it out of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Right, and there were always these obstacles.</span> <span id="s168">Even when we were in Belgium we almost didn’t get out.</span> <span id="s169">Many times we almost didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s170">At one point though in terms of Germany my father didn’t want to wait any longer in Germany because he saw what was happening and so we emigrated to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: When did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: We left in May ’39.</span> <span id="s173">And we were in Belgium, in Brussels until January 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Just the three of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yeah, just waiting for our number to come up.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: So you were waiting for visas to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Right, yeah, the affidavit, the folder [?]</span> <span id="s178">, the visa, the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: And your grandparents in Heidelberg, did they remain behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: My grandparents in Heidelberg, at some point, probably before we left Germany, because we were in Essen, well they were still there Kristall …I’m not sure if they were still there Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: My grandparents in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s183">But I know I was with my grandfather in Essen at Kristallnacht, but I don’t know if that was because they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Your grandfather Mendel, that would be November 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Right.</span> <span id="s186">I think maybe in ’37 they may have left.</span> <span id="s187">They left, let’s see, I’ll tell you who all left.</span> <span id="s188">My grandparents left either around Kristallnacht or before.</span> <span id="s189">I have a sense it was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: These would be your mother’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: My mother’s parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: This would be the Hocher.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: The Hocher part of the family, right.</span> <span id="s194">They left and his brother left and his wife, Uncle Simon, that’s with his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Grandpa Ferdinand and his wife and his brother Simon and his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Right, and family actually.</span> <span id="s197">And their whole family.</span> <span id="s198">Went to Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: So the Hochers went to Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yeah, them anyway.</span> <span id="s201">There were a lot more.</span> <span id="s202">Because they were in the cigar business and they had connections in Holland because they imported from Holland.</span> <span id="s203">So in order to get away from Hitler they went to Holland assuming that they would be okay.</span> <span id="s204">At least that was the first leg of the journey.</span> <span id="s205">And also my mother’s sister and her family, her husband and her child.</span> <span id="s206">He was three years old in Holland …he was born about 1937 ….</span> <span id="s207">no, he was born in Holland, I think.</span> <span id="s208">Yeah, my cousin was born in Holland, yeah I think in ’37.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: This would be your aunt Erica?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: And they went around the same time that your grandparents …</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Right, they all went to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s213">They lived in different houses in the same part of Amsterdam because I saw it when I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: But when you left Germany, you went to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: To Brussels, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Completely independently of their movement.</span> <span id="s217">You didn’t visit them.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Right I think it’s because my father had a cousin in Belgium and we were going to live with them.</span> <span id="s219">Right, I think we sort of lived in their building.</span> <span id="s220">Their name was Rose, right.</span> <span id="s221">Alex, that’s right, I played with their son.</span> <span id="s222">And my father wasn’t really -- it was dangerous for Jewish men to go out on the street at night.</span> <span id="s223">It wasn’t really a curfew.</span> <span id="s224">So he didn’t go out that much.</span> <span id="s225">I know I wasn’t easy there either.</span> <span id="s226">And I went to a parochial school.</span> <span id="s227">I went to a Catholic nursery school.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: You were too young to go to school in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Did you start learning another language at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes, I learned French, Belgian French.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: When you left Germany, were you able to say good-bye, do you remember saying good-bye to any family members at that point?</span> <span id="s233">Did you know you were really leaving for good?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: It was really sad.</span> <span id="s235">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s236">My father must have said good-bye to his father [indistinct].</span> <span id="s237">I guess we said good-bye but I don’t remember good-byes.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: You were glad they were taking you with them, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yeah, my earliest memory which was in Germany is that we’re leaving and walking out of the house and as I turn around I guess a door’s open and I see the workmen starting to make changes in the apartment and my attitude as I’m walking forward is why couldn’t they have waited till we left to start turning things upside down.</span> <span id="s240">On some level I was aware.</span> <span id="s241">I was really aware on some level of what was going on but it wasn’t anything my parents could speak t me about.</span> <span id="s242">So it was something I just felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Did you have any playmates in Essen?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I had playmates, I don’t remember about my playmates in Essen.</span> <span id="s245">I did but no hard and fast ones.</span> <span id="s246">Maybe it had to do with the times.</span> <span id="s247">When we got to Brussels because I went to nursery school, I did play with this boy Alex in the building because he had a dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did you have any pets speaking of dogs?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No, I always wanted a pet.</span> <span id="s250">We could never have one.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q; No pets.</span> <span id="s252">Any dolls, any …?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Oh yes, I had a doll.</span> <span id="s254">I have a picture somewhere if I could dig that up where I’m looking out of the window and I have my doll.</span> <span id="s255">And my grandparents gave it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: You got to keep the doll?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: I kept my doll.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: From your grandparents from Heidelberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: From Heidelberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: So the doll was from Heidelberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Right, from those .</span> <span id="s262">.</span> <span id="s263">yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s264">Then I had a great grandfather ….</span> <span id="s265">[indistinct]</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: What kind of a doll was it …?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Yeah, very cute.</span> <span id="s268">It had blond hair.</span> <span id="s269">It had eyes that opened and shut, I believe, I won’t swear to it.</span> <span id="s270">What I remember is it had a cape.</span> <span id="s271">It had a beautiful velvet cape with maroon on the collar part.</span> <span id="s272">And hair and I used to hold her very tightly …[indistinct] and so I got one in America, my first doll in America, I remember that also.</span> <span id="s273">I had three dolls, I had that doll and I had one named Kita.</span> <span id="s274">Those were German dolls, they were celluloid.</span> <span id="s275">And that had hair stuck on.</span> <span id="s276">I also had a boy doll, his name was Peter.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: What was the girl’s name?</span> <span id="s278">Do you remember that?</span> <span id="s279">She got up to go to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: It was a very good doll …………[indistinct]</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: The blond with the maroon cape, she made it to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yeah, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: And that was the end of her career?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I think so, either that or she got lost somewhere in the shuffle because I don’t remember that part.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Do you have any other memories of Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Oh, yeah, Brussels I remember sitting on the kitchen table because I had been naughty or something or else they were cleaning, I can’t remember which.</span> <span id="s287">Anyway everything is out of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s288">I’m sitting in the middle of the table and I’m saying my catechism in French.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: You were saying catechism in French?</span> <span id="s290">[She says some of it].</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: That’s Wednesday night I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Now you were a Jewish girl though with Jewish parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Yeah, but I went to …I had a little apron and a little slate, yeah my mother made me a little apron.</span> <span id="s294">My mother made all my clothes.</span> <span id="s295">One she was very handy and two we didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s296">So I remember that and I remember that experience.</span> <span id="s297">And then my father tells us that we used to go to the beach in the summer.</span> <span id="s298">Well, we didn’t used to I guess we were there one summer.</span> <span id="s299">We went to [?]</span> <span id="s300">.</span> <span id="s301">And my father tells the story that he was lying there and all at once he hears these people laughing.</span> <span id="s302">And he looks up and he sees that I am walking on the beach following a little dog, a little male dog and I am imitating a little dog urinating, putting my leg up and trying to urinate with my leg up.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: This is the pet that you wished you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: I guess so because I always wanted a dog, a pet.</span> <span id="s305">So he was embarrassed.</span> <span id="s306">It seems as if I was always embarrassing my parents ……[indistinct].</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: So you were a mischievous child?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: I think I was, yeah.</span> <span id="s309">My father used to call me “strolth.”</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: What’s that supposed to mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Like a little imp.</span> <span id="s312">I think that’s what it means.</span> <span id="s313">I have to look it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And you didn’t have any other nicknames?</span> <span id="s315">You were Ellen otherwise?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Called me devil, little devil.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: What did you ever do to earn that?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: In America I was always getting into trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: But in Germany you didn’t get into trouble did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: No, there they called me Sonnenscheinkind.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Oh, well everybody knows what that means.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yeah, ….</span> <span id="s323">[indistinct] sunshine.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: So in Germany you were Strolth and Zonnascheinkind?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: I’m not sure I was Strolth later on.</span> <span id="s326">I was much loved and much looked after and focused on.</span> <span id="s327">There were pros and cons to that.</span> <span id="s328">I was an only child.</span> <span id="s329">And I have a book about every word I ever spoke and what I ate and how much I weighed ….</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Did you know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: No.</span> <span id="s332">I knew I was Jewish when we came here because my father was a very loyal member of the synagogue and the rabbi from Essen founded a synagogue here.</span> <span id="s333">We came a year after they founded it.</span> <span id="s334">They founded it a year after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s335">.</span> <span id="s336">We weren’t here yet, November in 1939.</span> <span id="s337">We came in 1940 ……[indistinct].</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: So one of the rabbis of Essen founded another synagogue in New York in November 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Called the Builders, Habonim.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Builders Synagogue, right here in New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Sort of an answer to the …that we wouldn’t be left out.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Meanwhile had you ever heard of Hitler?</span> <span id="s343">I know your first experience with the swastika was on the trolley car.</span> <span id="s344">Was the name Hitler ever mentioned, do you recall talk of Hitler or of war, because after all war has broken out during these months?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: My parents were the kind of people who would want to shelter their children from everything, any harm.</span> <span id="s346">And that happened until my father died last spring.</span> <span id="s347">Their attitude always was we want to shelter Ellen, we want to protect her, we don’t want her to worry.</span> <span id="s348">So I think they made very sure never to discuss anything controversial or fearful or [indistinct] around me.</span> <span id="s349">[indistinct]</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Did they ever give you a reason why you were moving to Belgium and then eventually moving across the ocean?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: No, I wish they had.</span> <span id="s352">Let me just go back.</span> <span id="s353">This was a story my father told over many, many, many times.</span> <span id="s354">My grandparents Hocher would have liked to have come to America and planned to.</span> <span id="s355">But it was a question of getting the papers together and everything.</span> <span id="s356">And they said to my father and my mother, my father was always the spokesman for the family, why don’t you leave Ellen with us in Amsterdam?</span> <span id="s357">And you’ll be free to settle and get yourself together because after all it’s not easy with a little girl and you don’t know what awaits you?</span> <span id="s358">And then we’ll bring Ellen with us.</span> <span id="s359">No my father said no, no.</span> <span id="s360">No matter how bad things are there always will be enough for Ellen.</span> <span id="s361">Wherever we go Ellen will go with us.</span> <span id="s362">There will always be enough.</span> <span id="s363">And so we finally got out January 1940.</span> <span id="s364">May 10th was the invasion and all borders were closed.</span> <span id="s365">So the fact that I’m here talking to you is a double miracle, maybe a triple one.</span> <span id="s366">One is that my father didn’t say yeah that might be a good idea, let’s do that and then I would have been killed with my grandparents probably in Sobibor or elsewhere because I would have been too young to useful.</span> <span id="s367">The second is that our number came up before the invasion.</span> <span id="s368">It was just luck.</span> <span id="s369">We could have been sitting there and it could have been July and we might still not have our number.</span> <span id="s370">So that’s a clear-cut two.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: And what’s your maybe third one?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I just made it up because I like three.</span> <span id="s373">Oh three.</span> <span id="s374">We went through the Atlantic Ocean and it was mined.</span> <span id="s375">That was the last voyage of the Van Dank the boat we came on.</span> <span id="s376">It was torpedoed, mined, sunk on it’s return voyage.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: The Van?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: The Van Dank.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Dutch ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yeah, Dutch ship.</span> <span id="s381">We sailed from [?]</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Du, no Da which sank on it’s return.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: 1940 going back.</span> <span id="s384">So that’s three, but you thought of another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Well not another one but what struck me was that you’d always been afraid that your parents would leave you behind and yet here your father had this golden opportunity to leave you behind and yet he said no and you weren’t there to hear this.</span> <span id="s386">If you’d only heard this conversation then, there all of your worries and your concerns probably would have evaporated.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yeah, yeah, because a lot of my memories from Holland was I’m supposed to take a bath and go to bed.</span> <span id="s388">And I decide I don’t want to take a bath but I don’t want anyone to get angry at me so I get undressed, I have the bath water drawn and I’m standing there but I figure if I don’t put my foot in the water I’ll never have to take the bath and I won’t have to go to bed and then my parents won’t leave me in the middle of the night while I’m sleeping and never come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Very elaborate.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: That was quite a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Yeah, now while you were in Belgium, ’39, early ’40, did you ever get a chance to visit family members in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: No, but what we did, that’s a good question, before we left we stayed two weeks with my grandparents and it was at that time all the good-byes, all the plans, and that’s when I was so afraid my parents would leave.</span> <span id="s393">We lived with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Which grandparents now?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Holcherr.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: O.K, so this was in the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: In Amsterdam, by then they were there because they had gone in ’37 or ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Before leaving you guys go to live in Amsterdam …</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: To live for two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Was this January or December?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: You were there with your grandparents, the very same grandparents who wanted to keep you.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Right.</span> <span id="s404">It may have been at that time when that conversation came up.</span> <span id="s405">It was at that time I was fearful of taking a bath because I thought my parents would leave and never come back.</span> <span id="s406">And at that time I guess that’s when we said our good-byes.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Do you remember saying good-bye to those grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: No, I don’t think I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Was there any possibility of them leaving since they indicated they wanted to go to America as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yeah, there was and I guess their number didn’t come up or they didn’t have anybody at that moment in Amsterdam but it seemed imminent almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: So there was paperwork?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Possibly, I don’t know at what stage it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: How about the other members of the family?</span> <span id="s414">You mentioned your aunt Erica, your mother’s youngest sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: They stayed.</span> <span id="s416">They weren’t planning on going to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Did anyone suspect that Germany might …</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: And my aunt, Tanta Simon they weren’t planning that I know of to come to America either.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: They were in the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: And they were continuing the same line of work, they have the cigar …</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Right until the Germans …</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Did anyone suspect that the Germans might invade Holland which was a neutral country?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: I don’t think anyone did.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Nobody thought about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: I don’t think people thought about these things.</span> <span id="s427">My father wouldn’t go to Holland because he was a doctor and he didn’t have any connections there.</span> <span id="s428">So we had some connections in America so we figured … somehow my father didn’t want to stay around because there was talk of Australia if we couldn’t get into America.</span> <span id="s429">That was a possibility, to go to Australia.</span> <span id="s430">Never wanted to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: After the fact, did he ever share with you his thoughts about -- remember you were telling me that being Jewish and talking about Nazis and Hitler that was saved for much later.</span> <span id="s432">Eventually when your father came around to telling you about these years including the decision to leave Germany, did he add any additional information?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: It was my mother who said how things happened overnight.</span> <span id="s434">My father had tremendous ambivalence about leaving Germany.</span> <span id="s435">Germany had been a source of success, friendship and many things.</span> <span id="s436">And when we came here he says [spoken in German] which means we got to thank God every day that he brought us to this God damn country.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Meaning the United States of America.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Right.</span> <span id="s439">And I used to hear in the beginning years after that how wonderful Germany was.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Before the Nazis came.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Right.</span> <span id="s442">So my father used to live in his stories to me more in what happened before the Nazis except for his overcoming.</span> <span id="s443">He never shared feelings vulnerable.</span> <span id="s444">He never shared feeling Jewish, never talked about stuff like this, nothing.</span> <span id="s445">All he said is they thought he was a mad man and he would burn himself out.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: You’re talking about Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Hitler, yeah.</span> <span id="s448">He really felt that he could outlive Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: And he did, but only because he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: He was right, but only because he left.</span> <span id="s451">And he was very reluctant to leave.</span> <span id="s452">All he did was save us.</span> <span id="s453">We don’t fight the language.</span> <span id="s454">He made me speak German.</span> <span id="s455">I’m bilingual.</span> <span id="s456">He said we’re not fighting the language, just the people.</span> <span id="s457">And he used to talk about [in German].</span> <span id="s458">So you had a sense of who was good and who wasn’t good.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: So it wasn’t the people even, it was some people bad and some people good.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Right.</span> <span id="s461">And he spoke about sometimes about friends who hadn’t survived, people he was very close to who were very successful, I guess.</span> <span id="s462">But that was the irony of some people [indistinct] that their country would turn on them.</span> <span id="s463">So my father thought [indistinct].</span> <span id="s464">Just my mother who said overnight you never knew what was happening next.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Would you say that your mother was more eager to leave than your father was?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Well, you see my father’s father was still in Germany and my mother’s parents had gone to Holland so in a way perhaps but I think they both had really decided.</span> <span id="s467">The minute my father couldn’t practice medicine he resolved to leave.</span> <span id="s468">And he also said many years later he would never go back to a country that had thrown him out.</span> <span id="s469">Never go to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Even though it had been such a great place before the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Right.</span> <span id="s472">No, his father kind of died right before the war.</span> <span id="s473">[indistinct]</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Did you find out what happened to the other members of your family who didn’t leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: For a long time we didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s476">I remember one day my mother found out [indistinct].</span> <span id="s477">I’m not even sure if she cried.</span> <span id="s478">I don’t remember my parents crying for anything that ever happened.</span> <span id="s479">I only remember my mother maybe a little bit she cried when her parents were killed, but not a big cry …… [indistinct] maybe she cried but nothing long lasting.</span> <span id="s480">I remember though once she found out -- late, because I must have been about ten years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: And what did happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Well, they were put on cattle cars and I found out from my aunt, I thought they were shot getting off the cattle cars, but to speak to my aunt she told me they went to Sobibor and they perished there.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Your mother’s .</span> <span id="s484">.</span> <span id="s485">?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Parents.</span> <span id="s487">Ferdinand and Eva Holchherr.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Eva being her stepmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: So it would be your grandfather Holchherr and your step-grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Right and the only one that I ever knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: And they were deported from the Netherlands directly from Amsterdam or were they sent to any camps …?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: No, I think they were sent to Sobibor.</span> <span id="s494">Where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: That’s in eastern Poland.</span> <span id="s496">It was an extermination camp that was active in ’42 and ’43.</span> <span id="s497">And you don’t recall the date that this happened ….</span> <span id="s498">?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: They might know [indistinct]</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: So your grandparents were deported together.</span> <span id="s501">Were there any other members of the family that were with them in the cattle cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Well you see Tanta Ella and Uncle Simon were [indistinct]</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: First your grandparents, they were sent directly to Sobibor from the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s504">Now you were starting to talk about your grandfather’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Right, Simon, who [??]</span> <span id="s506">in a cigar factory together and they were very close.</span> <span id="s507">He had a son from his first wife.</span> <span id="s508">His name was Heinz Holchherr … so, let me get the family group.</span> <span id="s509">There was Simon and his second wife Ella.</span> <span id="s510">Her name used to be Lizer but now of course when they got married so that was Holchherr.</span> <span id="s511">They had two children.</span> <span id="s512">One was Heinz who was from his first wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s514">Whose mother died when he was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Right.</span> <span id="s516">Sometime around a little before the first World War.</span> <span id="s517">And his father was very prominent in the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: This would be Simon.</span> <span id="s519">He was a war veteran of the German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Right.</span> <span id="s521">He had a big scar… [indistinct]</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: From the war or from fraternity.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: No, from the war.</span> <span id="s524">He and his wife had another child.</span> <span id="s525">Her name was Lisa Lotte.</span> <span id="s526">They were all living in Holland but then Lisa Lotte went to England to study to be an interpreter.</span> <span id="s527">And Heinz eventually in those years got married.</span> <span id="s528">He got married to someone named [indistinct].</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: German woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: German woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q Also living in the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Yeah, I believe that was the story.</span> <span id="s533">Pretty popular.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yeah, Jewish.</span> <span id="s536">Now I won’t swear that he didn’t get married in Germany and come there with his wife.</span> <span id="s537">I’m not positive but I could find out for you.</span> <span id="s538">But they had a child who was about a year younger than I, maybe she would have been, or a year and a half younger, about that age.</span> <span id="s539">And Lisa Lotte was studying in England to be an interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: This was Heinz’s half sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Right, Ella’s daughter, came back to visit her parents and was trapped -- couldn’t go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: She came back when to visit her parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Before you could get out again.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Was it after you had left for America?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: So we’re talking early 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: And bang, the Germans come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Right, and she’s stuck, she can’t go back to England.</span> <span id="s550">Because she was their daughter, she was just studying there and she didn’t have a right to be out there.</span> <span id="s551">She was there at the wrong time.</span> <span id="s552">So she was stuck with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: And they all have German passports?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Either German or Dutch, but it didn’t matter, they were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Right, I mean they would only have been living in the Netherlands for a year or two so Lisa Lotte for example really wasn’t living in the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s556">In all probability their passports were German.</span> <span id="s557">With a J on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Probably.</span> <span id="s559">Yeah they definitely had the J on it because we had that too.</span> <span id="s560">So she was stuck there and she and Heinz and Heinz’s wife and then there was a little daughter.</span> <span id="s561">They were asking for young people to go to the work camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Who’s they?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: The Germans were asking for names of people to volunteer to go and … you know things were bad in Holland for the Jews, in Amsterdam by that time.</span> <span id="s564">I don’t know what time.</span> <span id="s565">I don’t know if my grandparents were still there but around those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: During the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Oh, for sure.</span> <span id="s568">And Simon thought that things could be a little better for them.</span> <span id="s569">So he encouraged them to volunteer to be in a labor camp to work, young people, in Germany.</span> <span id="s570">And they never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: So he encouraged Lisa Lotte and Heinz.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Probably Margo went too, not positive.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Heinz’s wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Heinz’s wife.</span> <span id="s575">Now the little daughter, I’m not positive.</span> <span id="s576">Her name was Suzanne.</span> <span id="s577">I don’t know where she was killed.</span> <span id="s578">The parents, I’m not even sure who went to Theresienstadt but Tanta Ella, Simon’s wife and uncle Simon were deported to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: To the best of my understanding, but I’m not positive.</span> <span id="s581">Maybe the little girl went too, their little granddaughter, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s582">Because Tanta Ella survived the war because she came to live with me in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: So Jella survived deportation to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: No, Jella was my mother, Ella?</span> <span id="s585">Ella went to Theresienstadt suffered tremendously.</span> <span id="s586">Her husband was deported from Thereienstadt to Auschwitz and killed.</span> <span id="s587">A lot of people in our family went to Auschwitz, names I haven’t mentioned to you.</span> <span id="s588">There were many brothers.</span> <span id="s589">There was Simon and Ferdinand and many others and a lot of them were deported because only two people came back, Tanta Ella and Tanta Marie.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Ella remained in Theresienstadt until the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: And she was liberated and then I guess she was in a DP camp and then she went back to Holland a little bit and had difficulty living with my aunt and uncle who by then had returned from Switzerland because they had fled to Switzerland, I didn’t tell you that story and so then she came here.</span> <span id="s592">And she never wanted to talk to me about what happened.</span> <span id="s593">It was only on her death that I [indistinct] but she lived with us.</span> <span id="s594">So first my father died, ’57, then my mother died in ’70, and my great-aunt is still alive.</span> <span id="s595">And all the stuff that came to me that I inherited she took to the Windermere to hold for me and it was all in her will that everything in the house belonged to me.</span> <span id="s596">So when she died my friend Bernie and I [indistinct] cleaned out the apartment and found some of the pictures that I have here that I had never seen.</span> <span id="s597">So I pieced a lot of this together.</span> <span id="s598">She would say little things but not much.</span> <span id="s599">It was too painful for her.</span> <span id="s600">I remember once she showed me money from Theresienstadt that they were supposedly into her views but she said it was horrible, horrible, just horrible, she couldn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s601">She wore black for a long time, wouldn’t wear lipstick.</span> <span id="s602">She was in mourning for a long time till her husband ….</span> <span id="s603">[indistinct]</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Did she tell you any stories about her husband in the time that he was in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Nothing about it, no incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s608">I think she felt guilty that she survived.</span> <span id="s609">She had a great deal of difficulty dealing with any of it.</span> <span id="s610">By the time she died I wasn’t living at home anymore and quite honestly I was reluctant to ask her because it wasn’t very popular yet in those days.</span> <span id="s611">I’m trying to remember when Epstein’s book came out, Children of the Holocaust so when I read it I could identify a lot with that kind of feeling [indistinct]</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: So she really has little idea or share very little with you as to why she might have survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: It had something to do with breaking her foot and being in the infirmary but I could never piece together how that could help her survive.</span> <span id="s614">I think she felt very, very guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Do you know how long she was in Theresienstadt, in terms of years?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Maybe not that long.</span> <span id="s617">You see if Simon could have stayed in Theresienstadt he might have lived too but he got deported.</span> <span id="s618">It seemed to be that she was in the right place at the right time not to get deported and it was pure luck.</span> <span id="s619">And she never wanted to talk about it.</span> <span id="s620">She kept it, just everything locked in her heart.</span> <span id="s621">It’s just that when I wouldn’t eat or something she’d say [in German referring to eating in Theresienstadt] what I’m leaving on my plate.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: You would have drooled at the sight of that in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yeah, and she did show me the money and I think she talked about the orchestra, maybe.</span> <span id="s624">Maybe she did talk a little, very, very little.</span> <span id="s625">She was a very strong woman.</span> <span id="s626">She was like a duchess, very proud, and it was her way to stay sane certainly after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: How old was she, approximately, when she was in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Well, we could figure it out.</span> <span id="s629">She was 90 when she died in ’76.</span> <span id="s630">So let’s say over forty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: She was 90 in ’76.</span> <span id="s632">That means in 1945 she would have been about 59, so she was getting along in years.</span> <span id="s633">Was she active in anything at Theresienstadt, social service, because there were some activities available?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Yeah, shows for money.</span> <span id="s635">She never spoke about it, never spoke about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Were there any other family members in Theresienstadt other than Ella and Simon?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: I think Tanta Marie may have been there but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s638">They may have just gone straight to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s639">I could find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: What about Heinz and his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I think my cousin Henry may know that.</span> <span id="s642">I could find that out, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: And he was with Lisa Lotte?</span> <span id="s644">Did they volunteer together to work in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Now another that that occurred to me, your Holchherr family in the Netherlands, they were in business, right?</span> <span id="s647">They were in the cigar business.</span> <span id="s648">Were there any losses of property?</span> <span id="s649">Was there any talk about compensation?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, we got back from Germany.</span> <span id="s651">They worked hard, my mother’s family, and they would get back for the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: The one in Heidelberg that was confiscated?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: What about their business activities in Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: They may not have been on the same level.</span> <span id="s656">Don’t forget they were new in the country.</span> <span id="s657">It would take a while for them to ….</span> <span id="s658">I don’t want to break your train of thought.</span> <span id="s659">I just want to briefly touch on my aunt who was also living in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s660">So you’ve got my grandparents, Simon and Tanta Ella and Heinz and his wife and family and Lisa Lotte coming back and then you have Erica and Franz.</span> <span id="s661">Erica was my mother’s sister, a year and a half younger.</span> <span id="s662">She must have been born in about 1909.</span> <span id="s663">That’s when she was born, March 7, 1909.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: In the same town?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Yeah, and she married Franz who came from Mannheim.</span> <span id="s666">They left Germany.</span> <span id="s667">He was like an engineer, mechanical engineer or chemical engineer, but I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: An engineer.</span> <span id="s669">And his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Joseph.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Franz Josef, that was his last name?</span> <span id="s672">Spelled German style with an “f’, Josef.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: I don’t know because in Holland whoever I knew was a “ph”.</span> <span id="s674">So they may have changed it.</span> <span id="s675">And they emigrated to Holland.</span> <span id="s676">They didn’t emigrate with anyone.</span> <span id="s677">I think my cousin Paul was born in Holland.</span> <span id="s678">They left also in about ’37, got married and then left</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Around the same time as your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Right.</span> <span id="s681">My grandparents may have gone there first and so it might have been you know, they may have all gotten there first and then that might have been why they went, you know – because that would be her parents, her stepmother and her father.</span> <span id="s682">And in Holland, in Amsterdam, they all got stuck.</span> <span id="s683">So what happened to my mother’s sister and her family, they fled.</span> <span id="s684">They disguised themselves as French peasants, as peasants …</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Erica and Franz.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Yeah, and she had a little baby boy two or three years old….</span> <span id="s687">[indistinct]</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: This is the baby born in the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yes, I think he was, my cousin Paul.</span> <span id="s690">Now I have pictures of myself with Paul, just before we left.</span> <span id="s691">I have those pictures.</span> <span id="s692">And they fled on bicycle, train, and foot.</span> <span id="s693">And they also were helped by underground.</span> <span id="s694">They had false passports.</span> <span id="s695">And for much, much money, jewels and everything else, you could buy your way sort of to freedom.</span> <span id="s696">And it was like an underground railway.</span> <span id="s697">So they would stop off and different people would escort them for a while.</span> <span id="s698">But in one place towards the end of that journey, my aunt explained, nobody came.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: You mean there was a rendezvous and they were stood up?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Nobody came to escort them, they were stranded, they were stood up.</span> <span id="s701">My uncle, who was no slouch, he said I’m not taking any chances I’m not waiting any longer.</span> <span id="s702">So in the middle of the night or whatever it was he knocked on the door of someone he knew in Brussels who was a colleague of his, an engineer, and he said would you take us in.</span> <span id="s703">And they did.</span> <span id="s704">And then they continued on.</span> <span id="s705">I remember my aunt told the story, they wrote out the whole story down, but that’s in Holland because I saw it once.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: When did this trip take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: I have to ask my aunt.</span> <span id="s708">Maybe ’42 or ’43.</span> <span id="s709">Well I could try to figure it out by when my cousin was born</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: In Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: In Switzerland.</span> <span id="s712">So once I think they were in a place and there were German officers on the other side of the inn and they just tried to keep a very low profile.</span> <span id="s713">My aunt like she couldn’t speak the language, and the baby, and she was wearing a babushka.</span> <span id="s714">My uncle spoke French very well so he could almost pass.</span> <span id="s715">They had papers I think that he was maybe from Alsace somewhere so that if there was a German accent it wouldn’t be so strange.</span> <span id="s716">And when they just about got to the border, even there the Swiss weren’t so great and they sent back many, many people.</span> <span id="s717">But they were lucky.</span> <span id="s718">They were taken in, they had a child.</span> <span id="s719">Men and women were separated and they had to work very, very hard and they only got back together because my uncle said there was nothing he couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s720">So, he said he could fix toilets and toilets were overflowing and they needed a plumber and he was good with his hands so ….</span> <span id="s721">Then they gave them a room together.</span> <span id="s722">My aunt said they were so thrilled just to have that room together.</span> <span id="s723">And shortly thereafter [indistinct], it may have been my cousin was born.</span> <span id="s724">Eventually they went back to Holland and two more cousins were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: So they survived in Switzerland and then returned to Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Right, but en route my uncle as well as my cousin got tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s727">In that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Your cousin meaning the …</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: My first cousin Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: The child born in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Born in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: In Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: The first one.</span> <span id="s734">The second one was born in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: The first child made the trip across France.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Now, did we miss any stories along the way?</span> <span id="s738">We just talked about Erica, this would be your aunt, your grandparents we talked about them so far as we can remember.</span> <span id="s739">We got your parents and you across to America.</span> <span id="s740">And then Lisa Lotte and Heinz we have them deported to the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Maybe to Germany or maybe to the east, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s742">[some indistinct comments].</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Well I’m sure that wasn’t so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: It was tough, very tough, first we lived in a furnished apartment where we had bedbugs and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Nothing like that in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: No, you’re right, nothing like that in Germany.</span> <span id="s747">I’m sure my father would say that.</span> <span id="s748">We weren’t used to that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s749">I remember our first night in America.</span> <span id="s750">We came at twelve o’clock midnight and we lived in the Beacon Hotel and they had two floors.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: You were glad to get off the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Well my father said I was seasick for the whole trip and he was always singing to me so I wouldn’t think about being seasick.</span> <span id="s753">The problem was that my father would spend hours and hours at night studying for the medical boards.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: So he could then practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Right because we didn’t have money and we didn’t have an apartment.</span> <span id="s756">We didn’t have much of anything except each other.</span> <span id="s757">And in the middle of the exam he had a heart attack.</span> <span id="s758">That’s when we were still living in a furnished apartment, [indistinct] … so he was laid up with a bad heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: And he was a young guy then, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Well he was older when he was married …[indistinct] … in his forties.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: So he was born in 1895, that’s still pretty young.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Oh yeah he was young for that.</span> <span id="s763">I always remember my father having heart trouble.</span> <span id="s764">So not only was I always “shushed’ in Germany, I would be “shushed’ in America, too.</span> <span id="s765">Don’t get your father upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: But of course he didn’t have the heart trouble because of you?</span> <span id="s767">That I think we could say with a great deal of certitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Right.</span> <span id="s769">And I know that, that part I knew, but I was afraid that I could make him have a heart attack …[indistinct] because I was told that.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Meanwhile it was probably the stress studying and trying to make a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yeah because we observed, oh my parents went every Friday night to synagogue and every Friday night we made the candles and everything and whatever they talked about, the certain thing about the prayer and the grace after the meal it had to do with [in Hebrew] it had to do with please give us sustenance and my father would sort of smile at my mother.</span> <span id="s772">It was always something that was of concern.</span> <span id="s773">My mother made my clothes because she didn’t have any money for it.</span> <span id="s774">She would make jam and jelly out of rind.</span> <span id="s775">There were a lot of resourceful ways.</span> <span id="s776">My father walks so he wouldn’t have to take the subway.</span> <span id="s777">I heard all those stories when I was pretty young.</span> <span id="s778">So it was a time of sacrifice.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: When did your parents and eventually you first learn about the Holocaust, that is to say the full magnitude of what was going on?</span> <span id="s780">They left because he couldn’t practice and because the Nazis were very mean towards the Jews and they trashed synagogues and so forth but I think it’s safe to say that they never could have imagined in 1938 and 1939 what would have happened.</span> <span id="s781">Being American during the forties and keeping in mind the controversy of whether or not …</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: They only became an American in ’46.</span> <span id="s783">They were enemy aliens when they came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Yes, German spies perhaps.</span> <span id="s785">But seriously the argument that Americans didn’t know what was going on in Germany … it was kind of a shock at the end of the war when the camps were opened and photographs were distributed.</span> <span id="s786">When did your parents first realize that there had been this Holocaust, concentration camps, extermination camps, millions of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Well certainly by the time they found out about my grandparents being deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: So during the war …</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: There wasn’t much [indistinct].</span> <span id="s792">In ’45 I was ten years old.</span> <span id="s793">By the time there were the Nuremberg trials I was very aware of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: So you knew who Hitler was by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Oh yeah, and I was following it.</span> <span id="s796">I was following the Pacific and the Atlantic and I had a big map and I was looking at my map and at the Solomon Islands and Iwo Jima and all of that stuff.</span> <span id="s797">I read the Times.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: And you learned English.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: The German, the French, English.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Well my parents felt they couldn’t keep up two languages so French went by the wayside.</span> <span id="s802">And I remember certainly and I mean but that was very late, the Nuremberg trials I knew how horrible things had been.</span> <span id="s803">I had the papers for that with all the pictures and we didn’t have television or anything, you know Goering with all his [couldn’t understand], I had all those pictures, and I was reading about it and Patton I remember and VE Day I remember.</span> <span id="s804">I knew about the war how horrible it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: And you knew what the swastika stood for?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: And I certainly knew what the swastika stood for and I knew when my parents found out about my grandfather but I didn’t know much.</span> <span id="s807">I didn’t know when my parents found out, I think gradually they began to find out what it was all about.</span> <span id="s808">The first time I ever saw pictures of everything was very late.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: When your aunt died or just before you …</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: No, not those pictures, of the concentration camps and the bodies and that was -- well of course there weren’t any movies around.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: No, not movies, documentary .</span> <span id="s812">.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Yeah, this was a documentary --when I was in San Francisco in 1958 that was the first time I had actually seen all those bodies.</span> <span id="s814">I remember once hearing about lampshades and soap and I couldn’t believe that that could happen.</span> <span id="s815">I just didn’t believe that that was possible.</span> <span id="s816">From hair, mattresses.</span> <span id="s817">I didn’t believe that that could be done.</span> <span id="s818">I couldn’t believe that.</span> <span id="s819">…[indistinct].</span> <span id="s820">I could only deal with situations like when Tanta Ella came -- I know when we got Tanta Ella at the airport, it was nineteen forty something, six, well certainly by then but that was after the war.</span> <span id="s821">I don’t know what they knew.</span> <span id="s822">You know whatever the Red Cross let through.</span> <span id="s823">We didn’t hear from my aunt and uncle, anyway they were stuck in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s824">We didn’t hear much … [indistinct].</span> <span id="s825">If we did, my father was the kind of person who would not share that with me.</span> <span id="s826">He would protect me.</span> <span id="s827">He would shelter me.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Wanted to preserve a little bit of sunshine.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yeah, he did.</span> <span id="s830">[indistinct]</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: In retrospect, basically you got a little information here, a little bit here and there.</span> <span id="s832">Of all your family members who would credit as being your single biggest source as to what happened to your family in Germany and then outside of Germany?</span> <span id="s833">You have your parents, you have Tanta Ella, you got Erica.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: My aunts, Erica, when I went to Holland a few years ago.</span> <span id="s835">First of all when she first came here in ’52 she brought the diary and that was very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: This was the diary …</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: They had a diary.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: That my uncle kept.</span> <span id="s840">You know, a journal.</span> <span id="s841">She still has it.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: This is their underground railway escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: So I knew their story very well.</span> <span id="s844">I knew what I told you of our story from my father, but our story was not through the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s845">It was getting away before the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Getting away before the Holocaust and before you knew what the Holocaust was going to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Right, so Erica told me not too long ago that when my grandparents were killed and that was a big shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Even they skirted, Erica skirted the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s849">Ella, I suppose, of all of your surviving family is the one that was the most involved in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Right.</span> <span id="s851">I got little from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Because she didn’t want to speak.</span> <span id="s853">And the other members of the family who were very directly involved in the Holocaust, none of them survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Right.</span> <span id="s855">Only Tanta Marie who lived in the Bronx and I never had any conversation about [indistinct].</span> <span id="s856">All the cousins, they were like ten years older than I, and they made it out.</span> <span id="s857">This was all in my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s858">See on my father’s side a lot of his grandfather’s brethren, siblings, died early, or didn’t have boys.</span> <span id="s859">I didn’t have kids or they did.</span> <span id="s860">I think all their kids made it but I don’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s861">I really don’t know much about my father’s side of the family.</span> <span id="s862">I mean I know about various cousins and their children but not too many.</span> <span id="s863">Of my grandfather, he was the oldest too.</span> <span id="s864">He sent everybody through school.</span> <span id="s865">They were all in practice.</span> <span id="s866">They were lawyers.</span> <span id="s867">My father’s family was pretty successful, they were lawyers and doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Well your mother’s side of the family also were rather successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: I think they were, they really were but my father was such a snob you would have thought that my mother came from …</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: The wrong side of the tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Instead where did they come from, Waldorf and Heidelberg, not bad places?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Right.</span> <span id="s874">They were very</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: In fact, if you would look at the Germany today, people from Heidelberg and Waldorf would look down on the people from Essen.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Well I think it had to do really with my father’s attitude that his family was the best in the world and nobody could compete.</span> <span id="s877">A very interesting thing that I just found out last week because one of my mother’s cousins was here from Italy.</span> <span id="s878">She has her story from Italy.</span> <span id="s879">They went to Italy.</span> <span id="s880">Everybody went somewhere else.</span> <span id="s881">Someone else went to South Africa, some to Canada, some to England, you know but they’re different people.</span> <span id="s882">And she said that my mother’s family was the most, you know they always felt they were the most elegant, and they thought that they looked down on the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s883">So both my parents came from sort of snobbish backgrounds but my mother kind of gave up to go along with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Well even you look pretty elegant with your foot laid up like that on top of a chair after an operation what we’re talking eight hours, less than that, five hours after surgery.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Well I guess we’re all survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Yes, one thing or another.</span> <span id="s887">But as for the rest of the story of your mother’s family we can get some more information from your aunt …</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: From Holland.</span> <span id="s889">And Henry Bauer in Rego Park, Queens, and Claire, my cousin Claire, if I need anything they could all …[indistinct] and they’re my best sources.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: I’m good at doing this … and detective work [indistinct].</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: We’ll look forward to that and to you getting on your feet again.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Do you want to see any pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Yeah, but we’ll just close the tape and look at some photos.</span> <span id="s895">On behalf of the U.S. Holocaust Museum I’d like to thank you for your time and your help.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Is there anything else that I should have told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: You look kind of exhausted by now.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: I’m not exhausted, I can talk forever.</span> <span id="s899">I think what’s important is that yes a lot of people perished and it’s horrendous.</span> <span id="s900">But the miracle is all who survived and overcame all the adversities … mother, father, aunts, uncles, Tanta Ella, they all survived to live very productive often giving service to others kind of lives.</span> <span id="s901">Either they were successful, professionally, they had children, or they did things for others, they lived worthwhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: An understatement.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Right.</span> <span id="s904">I mean they lived the kinds of lives anyone could be proud of in spite of what they went through.</span> <span id="s905">Because they could have said screw it I don’t want to do anything ever again.</span> <span id="s906">I give up -- or whatever.</span> <span id="s907">But those who survived and did it well are the answer to Hitler, that in spite of all the adversities they were able to overcome and maintain a connection to their Judaism because my great aunt despite Theresienstadt everything she was very orthodox when she came to America.</span> <span id="s908">She held on to her religion; she held on to her dignity; she held on to her keeping the family together; she held on to knowledge and exploring other area in life, you know reading.</span> <span id="s909">Certainly my parents are excellent examples.</span> <span id="s910">My father was a wonderful doctor and he also took care of people free of charge.</span> <span id="s911">So he was also a humanitarian.</span> <span id="s912">My mother was very supportive and Franz and Erica founded an old age home.</span> <span id="s913">I don’t know if they founded it; they were very instrumental in putting up an old age home and they did all the design for the old age home.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: In Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Yeah, in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s916">And then the rest of the family too in spite of what happened.</span> <span id="s917">They overcame.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: To that list I would just like to add you.</span> <span id="s919">You certainly were successful as a professional, still are, serving mankind, humankind.</span> <span id="s920">I don’t know which campus is it you’re …</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Now I’ve been in the school system for 32 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: New York City public schools as a teacher first and as a guidance counselor.</span> <span id="s924">I was awarded guidance counselor of the year twice.</span> <span id="s925">And now I’m on sabbatical and I’m looking at how children go about making plans.</span> <span id="s926">I’m going to write a book and I’m also a therapist in private practice.</span> <span id="s927">I think what I’m happiest about is that in 32 years of being in the school system I was very committed to my job and never once did I [indistinct].</span> <span id="s928">And now I feel that I’m ready to retire next year, I’m not burned out but I feel I’m ready to move on.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: A new career?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Right, bigger horizons and a few books.</span> <span id="s931">Thank you for giving me the opportunity for doing a little postscript.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: On that happy note I again want to thank you.</span></p></body></html>
