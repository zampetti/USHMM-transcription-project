id="s612">I: So a lot of these people were not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">R: Oh, yes, they were mostly Jewish and one day a Hungarian man - I don’t know his name - he went away, he escaped from the camp.</span> <span id="s614">And he stayed out maybe two days.</span> <span id="s615">They had already German shepherd dogs there and it was impossible to escape.</span> <span id="s616">And I was working in the camp.</span> <span id="s617">I had this much easier already.</span> <span id="s618">And this same man I hear, they don’t let him out of the camp no more.</span> <span id="s619">When he try, they are afraid he will go again and they sew people like that big red points on the material.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">I: So they would be conspicuous - like targets.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">R: Can shoot easier.</span> <span id="s622">This same fellow was working in the camp and it happened I heard it.</span> <span id="s623">The commandofuehrer came.</span> <span id="s624">The commandofuehrer, an SS man, came and with him I was a witness in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s625">The commandofuehrer came and said to that guy, “Why you was running away from the camp?”</span> <span id="s626">He get up, pulled his hat, you had to take off the hat when you talk with an SS man.</span> <span id="s627">He said, “I was camping side by side with the German against Russia, but in a situation like that, it is hard work and no food, too bad.”</span> <span id="s628">Then Yom Kippur he got them - on Yom Kippur they made up a gallow and hang him.</span> <span id="s629">We had to see the gallow.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">I: Just this one man?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">R: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s632">They before hung, I don’t know what nationality.</span> <span id="s633">They went away, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">I: So they made an example of this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">R: They shot the people.</span> <span id="s636">We had a sleeping room upstairs for a thousand people.</span> <span id="s637">We built it.</span> <span id="s638">I was electrician, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">I: How did you keep track of things like holidays?</span> <span id="s640">Like how did you keep track of when Yom Kippur was?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">R: Yah, yah...very interesting.</span> <span id="s642">There were rabbonims in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">I: Rabbis.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">R: Rabbis.</span> <span id="s645">They counted.</span> <span id="s646">They know when Passover was, when Yom Kippur was.</span> <span id="s647">In person, I don’t know if it is a Sunday or a Monday.</span> <span id="s648">We had no calendar, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">I: I would think it would have been difficult to keep track of the days.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">R: And they hung them, too.</span> <span id="s651">They shot and they let them lay in the blood that we pass by and you can see what happened when you ran away.</span> <span id="s652">One day, I was electrician, I was in the washroom, what you call the washroom; it was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">I: Was it just cold water?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">R: Oh, yes, only cold water.</span> <span id="s655">But we had then already a shower.</span> <span id="s656">We installed a shower.</span> <span id="s657">So I stay in the washrooms and do my duty and next to me is standing a man with on his arm Baraba.</span> <span id="s658">When somebody did something bad in Auschwitz, they brought in some “funischtungslager.”</span></p> <p><span id="s659">I: You’ll have to translate “funischtungslager.”</span> <span id="s660">What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">R: This is a camp where nobody comes out alive.</span> <span id="s662">They know exactly that they treat them there so bad that they will die and the Polish have a camp like that.</span> <span id="s663">And he stand next to me.</span> <span id="s664">But I was already electrician and I was able I could open the mouth, my mouth already.</span> <span id="s665">Then I told him...I said to him, “You see, for one year you told me so long my boots will hold I will live.”</span> <span id="s666">And he said to me, “You were lucky.”</span> <span id="s667">So I was camp electrician.</span> <span id="s668">Somebody remind me on that already.</span> <span id="s669">One day, we painted out...we had a lot of good people, good paint mans.</span> <span id="s670">They painted over the kitchen and I had a poem in my heart [ ].</span> <span id="s671">And they asked me one day if I know something.</span> <span id="s672">I say, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s673">And they put it on big...over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">I: The poem that you remembered, they printed it and hung it up as a banner?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">R: Not hung.</span> <span id="s676">They painted it in writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">I: So you remember what the poem was?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">R: Hang by me in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s679">Still are with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">I: Can you recite it?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">R: Yah.</span> <span id="s682">Glucklich ist der niferlar, in kamp0f das lebens den humor.</span> <span id="s683">Lucky is the person was never lost in the fight of life his humor.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">I: That’s important, isn’t it, to keep your sense of humor.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">R: So, I was the camp electrician until January 1945, when they called us together and that we have made the first ... the death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">I: Everybody in the camp had to make this death march?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">R: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">I: What did they call it?</span> <span id="s689">They didn’t call it a death march, did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">R: No, later they called it the death march.</span> <span id="s691">That was whoever couldn’t walk no more they shot them and throw them on the highway.</span> <span id="s692">They left them in the ... what is the - “garden” ...</span></p> <p><span id="s693">I: In the ditch.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">R: In the ditch.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">I: How many people started this march?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">R: One thousand, complete with the SS.</span> <span id="s697">Not one SS man hided - came not with them.</span> <span id="s698">It was good for business.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">I: But there were 1,000 prisoners marching to start?</span> <span id="s700">How far did you have to march?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">R: One night we have slept - I don’t know - we slept two days and two nights and the next day in the night they said, “Tonight we will shoot nobody.</span> <span id="s702">if somebody cannot walk, we will put them - they took a farmer - they put them on a wagon and drove them.</span> <span id="s703">Besides, I was nearly dead, too.</span> <span id="s704">I couldn’t walk no more and there were - the last time we got Mischlinger - where the parents, one parent were German and one parent were Jewish.</span> <span id="s705">We were already in the army, the German army.</span> <span id="s706">They took them out of the army, brought them to the camp.</span> <span id="s707">Two of them grasped me under the arm and helped me out an hour.</span> <span id="s708">And so I made it.</span> <span id="s709">But when we came to the station, there were a lot, thousand upon thousand.</span> <span id="s710">They came to the station.</span> <span id="s711">Somebody came with a revolver and everyone who was sitting down, they killed them.</span> <span id="s712">But he will not stand to transport any [ ].</span> <span id="s713">So they put us on some open wagon that were awful.</span> <span id="s714">You have to stand up; you couldn’t sit down now no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">I: If it was a sign of weakness...</span></p> <p><span id="s716">R: No, you couldn’t - there was no room to stand up - to sit down.</span> <span id="s717">At night came - we had somebody was sitting on your feet, the next guy.</span> <span id="s718">But still there were two or three left over what couldn’t sit down.</span> <span id="s719">It was so bad that somebody went out, opened his jacket and say, “Please, shoot me.”</span> <span id="s720">But they did that.</span> <span id="s721">When somebody want to be shot, they would.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">I: The ones that they felt couldn’t stand the transport, they killed them rather than keep them on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">R: Ah, yes.</span> <span id="s724">Besides, the first time that women were on the transport and a boy hollered, “My mother’s there.”</span> <span id="s725">Imagine that.</span> <span id="s726">I never forgot that!</span> <span id="s727">His mother was there.</span> <span id="s728">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s729">I: But there must have been many dead bodies laying around then.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">R: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s731">We went on the train then.</span> <span id="s732">The transport was so bad, it was so cold, that when we came to the “hangerwerker” in Balen (?)</span> <span id="s733">, the SS, they took the SS off with stretcher.</span> <span id="s734">The SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">I: Because they couldn’t stand the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">R: Six or sever, I saw.</span> <span id="s737">The prisoner, there was some prisoner they collected dead people then.</span> <span id="s738">And there was some prisoner you could see they were still breathing.</span> <span id="s739">They were laying among the dead people.</span> <span id="s740">Then, again, in the “hangerwerker” a friend of me was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">I: Where did this train take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">R: To Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">I: Back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s744">Where you started?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">R: Yah.</span> <span id="s746">And the “hangerwerker” they did once make planes there.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">I: An airplane factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">R: Yah.</span> <span id="s749">And from there they brought us to different camps.</span> <span id="s750">And I came to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s751">We had known of its existence already.</span> <span id="s752">So, they came to Sachsenhausen...I came to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s753">And in Sachsenhausen, baruch abu (?)</span> <span id="s754">, I got louses again.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">I: How long had you been without lice?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">R: The whole...maybe a year.</span> <span id="s757">Oh, that was something!</span></p> <p><span id="s758">I: Did they...how did they keep you clean after they got rid of the lice?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">R: Each week we got new clothing.</span> <span id="s760">They were disinfected.</span> <span id="s761">I forgot to tell you in Polish how we have to go back.</span> <span id="s762">In Polish, how one day they deloused and deloused the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">I: By spraying it.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">R: Or gas.</span> <span id="s765">And we was outside, but then we got new clothing.</span> <span id="s766">But for six people were no clothing and they went to bed without clothing.</span> <span id="s767">And that was between Saturday and Sunday.</span> <span id="s768">In the morning, they hollered “Gas, gas” and they broke the windows.</span> <span id="s769">Somebody was laying a “chesche;” Jewish people was laying his brother dead in his arms.</span> <span id="s770">Then I came, later I came to Sachsenhausen and here went out repairing cars from the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">I: Repairing cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">R: Yah.</span> <span id="s773">There I saw already German soldier in uniform without the bullet...in German uniform that mean when you have no more bullet they take the air.</span> <span id="s774">He said something while a prisoner there already.</span> <span id="s775">On the 3rd of April, 1945, we was outside working in Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s776">The American came by air.</span> <span id="s777">It was day, the sun was shining.</span> <span id="s778">So the American came.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">I: You say “by air.”</span> <span id="s780">You mean they came over to bomb the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">R: During the day.</span> <span id="s782">The sun was looking like the moon.</span> <span id="s783">Everything was burning.</span> <span id="s784">Everything.</span> <span id="s785">And I want to run.</span> <span id="s786">Usually I was washing my shirt when the alarm went.</span> <span id="s787">On that days I was not washing my shirt.</span> <span id="s788">And I want to run.</span> <span id="s789">And there were two Germans, not jews.</span> <span id="s790">They take me on my shirt and hold me down, I shouldn’t run.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">I: Where would you have run to?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">R: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s793">You know, I never was a soldier in my life.</span> <span id="s794">Every day.</span> <span id="s795">Bombs were looking out.</span> <span id="s796">Everything was burning.</span> <span id="s797">So Hestlinger was burnt.</span> <span id="s798">Then was the “klingerfabrike” that day.</span> <span id="s799">The thing they call the “klinger” they make once bricks there.</span> <span id="s800">But they make hand grenades there.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">I: Hand grenades?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">R: Yah.</span> <span id="s803">And the “klingerwerker” and the American bombard that and they have over 1,000 prisoners and they were all dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">I: The explosion must have been tremendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">R: Oh!</span> <span id="s806">Some of the bombs were sticking there.</span> <span id="s807">They never exploded.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">I: But I mean the hand grenades exploded...</span></p> <p><span id="s809">R: No, no.</span> <span id="s810">Not from the factory.</span> <span id="s811">They make it on purpose, they make it on purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">I: So here we are...</span></p> <p><span id="s813">R: It is not alles so kosher what the American did, what the English did was also not so kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">I: I know.</span> <span id="s815">We do not look good in history.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">R: No, they could be nicely... They dropped like light bombs during the night and they stick up the camp.</span> <span id="s817">But still one bomb fall in the camp and they don’t bombard what belong to American buildings, the American companies and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">I: All they had to do was bomb a few rail lines and the concentration camps could not have been reached.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">R: And they know that all this time already.</span> <span id="s820">They know.</span> <span id="s821">They know.</span> <span id="s822">They know that.</span> <span id="s823">Then, at the end of April, then we are now a couple days.</span> <span id="s824">They sent me once before to another camp - Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">I: Ravensbruck, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">R: A woman camp.</span> <span id="s827">But when I came there, there were no more women there.</span> <span id="s828">There were only one barrack with scientist...</span></p> <p><span id="s829">I: Why did they send you to Ravensbruck?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">R: Should install gas pumps, electric gas pumps.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">I: Did you have a sense that the war was coming to an end in April?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">R: Then yes, yah.</span> <span id="s833">But I had no idea that we were ever lived at end.</span> <span id="s834">We did...I was come to that...we had tank traps.</span> <span id="s835">Some installed tank...that the Russian cannot come to the camps.</span> <span id="s836">They know exactly where the traps were.</span> <span id="s837">They went not over the traps; they went over the parts what were open or they’re closed.</span> <span id="s838">When they brought this back to Sachsenhausen and came the attack.</span> <span id="s839">And then two days or three days later we are, they hit us again.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">I: Again.</span> <span id="s841">You were in a great many camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">R: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s843">They brought us also what you call a death march.</span> <span id="s844">No food.</span> <span id="s845">Then finally after two days, the Red Cross - the International Red Cross - came and brought packages that were very good for some and very bad for some.</span> <span id="s846">In the packages were no bread.</span> <span id="s847">There were a couple cookies, butter and the people at that and the stomach wouldn’t take that no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">I: It was too rich a diet for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">R: Yah, it was like...four or five men got one package.</span> <span id="s850">And then one night we was marching.</span> <span id="s851">We had no idea where we are going.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">I: The march was always to a railroad station?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">R: No, this time to the ship port.</span> <span id="s854">Bremen.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">I: Bremen.</span> <span id="s856">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">R: We found out later they had two boats, two ships.</span> <span id="s858">They put them on and the ships went out and they bombard the ships.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">I: Who bombarded the ships?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">R: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">I: They bombarded their own ships to destroy Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">R: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">I: They really went to all kinds of peculiar lengths to destroy people...</span></p> <p><span id="s864">R: They did it with two ships - Capicona and the other I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">I: Made them sink?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">R: Yah.</span> <span id="s867">And when they was swimming, that is what I heard.</span> <span id="s868">That I haven’t seen.</span> <span id="s869">They was swimming to the land.</span> <span id="s870">There were young kids standing and they killed them.</span> <span id="s871">Also, were a story, there was a captain.</span> <span id="s872">He went from Bremen to Hamburg with a bicycle.</span> <span id="s873">He got...refused to take the dirty prisoner on his ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">I: He didn’t want his ship to get dirty?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">R: Yah.</span> <span id="s876">That is what I heard.</span> <span id="s877">So in Mecklenburg and Schwerein, we wandered in the forest, we was eating horse meat from dead horses what was killed in the fire line and we was eating the “brentessen” - it was very good vegetable, when you touch it, it bite you.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">I: A vegetable that bites you?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">R: No, no.</span> <span id="s880">It burns you.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">I: It burns you.</span> <span id="s882">What kind of vegetable was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">R: In German “brentessen” - I don't know; nobody eats it usually.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">I: At this point now, were you still part of the death march or had you broken away from the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">R: You couldn’t break away.</span> <span id="s886">I will come to one day.</span> <span id="s887">On the 2nd of May, 1945 - I imagine that that’s tomorrow...</span></p> <p><span id="s888">I: That’s right, it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">R: On the 2nd of May, somebody came through - I know now.</span> <span id="s890">He said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s891">We will stay here ‘til the war’s over.”</span> <span id="s892">In the forest.</span> <span id="s893">We were 85,000 men on the march.</span> <span id="s894">And, during that march, the American dropped leaflets.</span> <span id="s895">But we was marching...</span></p> <p><span id="s896">I: What did the leaflets say?</span> <span id="s897">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">R: Oh, no, I was not in leaflets or nothing.</span> <span id="s899">I was interested to breathe the air.</span> <span id="s900">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s901">They were in German, that they should give up and all that.</span> <span id="s902">And we wake up the next day - no more SS there.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">I: They just ran away?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">R: Yah.</span> <span id="s905">But it seemed very simple.</span> <span id="s906">There were a lot of people.</span> <span id="s907">Wrong way from the SS were going.</span> <span id="s908">We was going behind them always.</span> <span id="s909">Now was no more SS; where you should go?</span> <span id="s910">There came the American, they don’t want us to march, so many people...</span></p> <p><span id="s911">I: There were 85,000 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">R: Yah, they need the solder bring in more inland and so far, we had no idea.</span> <span id="s913">So Ireland (sp.?)</span> <span id="s914">Schwereinen, Mecklenburg.</span> <span id="s915">I personally split it up.</span> <span id="s916">Everyone did what he can do.</span> <span id="s917">there were Belgian, Romanian, Hungarian - name it, all the nations in the world were from somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">I: You never actually got to Bremen then?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">R: No.</span> <span id="s920">Not even to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s921">They want to bring us.</span> <span id="s922">Next day, I went up there...I was sleeping in a German truck and then, from the German army, but then they drove the truck, so I had no idea where to go at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">I: When the Americans came, did they say “The war is over?”</span> <span id="s924">How did you come to know the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">R: We don’t see the war today.</span> <span id="s926">Till we are finally - they make camps.</span> <span id="s927">They said, “Halt, you cannot walk no more.</span> <span id="s928">The Americans.</span> <span id="s929">You cannot walk no more; stay here.</span> <span id="s930">There was civilian people what went from their homes, they were afraid for the Communists.</span> <span id="s931">They were all going.</span> <span id="s932">Were no more...regular and you stay in the camp and then they took us there.</span> <span id="s933">The Hungarians, they brought them back to Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">I: Did they bring food in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">R: Yes, we got food.</span> <span id="s936">I know now.</span> <span id="s937">The Americans brought in food, right...</span></p> <p><span id="s938">I: Right away?</span> <span id="s939">You must have been getting pretty hungry, is what I’ve been thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">R: No, we eat a little bit.</span> <span id="s941">There was potatoes already in May.</span> <span id="s942">You know the storage potato.</span> <span id="s943">You could eat potatoes and you could go by a farmer and get water already and get washed.</span> <span id="s944">And I went to Hamburg, not to Berlin.</span> <span id="s945">I had a cousin, a step cousin in London and I had a sister-in-law in London.</span> <span id="s946">I was saying, in Hamburg, “From Hamburg to London is no distance.”</span> <span id="s947">But I stay in Hamburg also for 4 1/2 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">I: Four and a half years after the war was ended and you were still in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">R: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">I: In those days you had to get papers guaranteeing that you would not become a burden to this country.</span> <span id="s951">Somebody had to put up the money for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">R: Yah.</span> <span id="s953">But the people what come now in here, they don’t need papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">I: That’s right.</span> <span id="s955">It’s changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">R: They don’t need papers and the people what people came inhere was good, but tradesmans.</span> <span id="s957">They go right away to the welfare.</span> <span id="s958">I never take any compensation from that country.</span> <span id="s959">I am a citizen and I was working over 30 years in that country and I am retired and live happily afterward.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">I: Well, let me fill in a couple of little gaps here.</span> <span id="s961">What did you do in your 4 1/2 years in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">R: We was working for the American Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">I: Joint Distribution Committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">R: Oh, yah, very interesting.</span> <span id="s965">There were special Polish people.</span> <span id="s966">They had kids.</span> <span id="s967">And they know then already that they will be killed.</span> <span id="s968">The kids and all they were not over living.</span> <span id="s969">they were already with the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s970">They put the kids by farmers, in convents and so forth.</span> <span id="s971">And we was working to collect the kids in [ ].</span> <span id="s972">Is pretty big banker in German, international.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">I: International bankers?</span> <span id="s974">And what did they do with these children when they got them?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">R: They collect them.</span> <span id="s976">They smuggled them to Israel.</span> <span id="s977">Then I want to go Israel.</span> <span id="s978">There are the use for guards in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">I: In the Jewish brigade?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">R: They make us a lot trouble.</span> <span id="s981">They could not understand us very much and they don’t want me here.</span> <span id="s982">They brought in a musician.</span> <span id="s983">And he was dancing and couldn’t dance no more.</span> <span id="s984">then the Jewish Brigade came and say, “You cannot dance about German music or German people.</span> <span id="s985">And a lot of people say you want to dance and we don’t care for the music what you play.”</span></p> <p><span id="s986">R: (Mrs. Treitel): We were all living in a collective.</span> <span id="s987">In a commune.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">I: In Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">R: No, in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s990">We were organized in various places.</span> <span id="s991">Pretty organized.</span> <span id="s992">And that’s actually where we were.</span> <span id="s993">They called in Blanken the Vobel estate.</span> <span id="s994">It was an estate like a city, it was so big.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">I: Did you come to this country together?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">R: Yes, we were married in ‘47.</span> <span id="s997">And immigrated in ‘49.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">I: And where did you come to in the United States at first.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">R: We arrived in New York and we were...our destination would be Chicago.</span> <span id="s1000">That’s where we lived all these years.</span> <span id="s1001">In Skokie.</span> <span id="s1002">Came a cousin send us job and housing that you need and he was happy that he could live alone.</span> <span id="s1003">They put us in a hole there.</span> <span id="s1004">We were not spoiled.</span> <span id="s1005">We was used to live again.</span> <span id="s1006">We started very hard and we made pretty good.</span> <span id="s1007">We started.</span> <span id="s1008">Very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">(Mrs. Treitel) The first thing he did when we arrived, after we arrived, he went to night school for one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">I: What did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">R: To learn English.</span> <span id="s1012">I don’t want to study no more.</span> <span id="s1013">I study my trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">I: But you could still be a sheet metal worker?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">R: The year was ‘49.</span> <span id="s1016">A lot of people out of work here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1017">It was hard to get a job.</span> <span id="s1018">So finally, I went with the streetcar to some Jewish organization and they recommend me a job.</span> <span id="s1019">The job was okay.</span> <span id="s1020">Only the boss.</span> <span id="s1021">I’ll make it short.</span> <span id="s1022">The check were no good.</span> <span id="s1023">So I worked there and later I got my money.</span> <span id="s1024">I have to say that.</span> <span id="s1025">I got every penny.</span> <span id="s1026">After three months I saw I have no product...</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Moss products.</span> <span id="s1028">Shipping trees, one in a store.</span> <span id="s1029">One in a nursery.</span> <span id="s1030">Always the same.</span> <span id="s1031">I was not used to that.</span> <span id="s1032">So then I got a job on Madison Street, the same salary.</span> <span id="s1033">I was not good for that job.</span> <span id="s1034">I was no good.</span> <span id="s1035">The job is maybe okay, but also Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1036">So then finally I came to a job in plumbing.</span> <span id="s1037">So the language were bad.</span> <span id="s1038">But I could talk a little bit already.</span> <span id="s1039">And so I was staying in with a working helper.</span> <span id="s1040">I had to change anyway.</span> <span id="s1041">The plumbing in Germany is not the same plumbing...</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">I: ...as in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">R: Right.</span> <span id="s1044">So there I stay and work.</span> <span id="s1045">Nonunion, but I got already a little bit more money.</span> <span id="s1046">And we got finally an apartment.</span> <span id="s1047">Very interesting.</span> <span id="s1048">An apartment.</span> <span id="s1049">There were rent control in Chicago and that were a kitchenette apartment.</span> <span id="s1050">A Jewish owner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">I: A small apartment, but it was your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">R: A Jewish owner, with a big building, with elevator.</span> <span id="s1053">he took a nice price and we paid it; we had no choice.</span> <span id="s1054">But finally, after a time, I get a real apartment.</span> <span id="s1055">We found out that a Jewish fellow, we found out he overcharged us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">I: But you didn’t know any differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">R: No, I had no choice.</span> <span id="s1058">But over the court, he had to give back the overcharged money.</span> <span id="s1059">That was a very good experience I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">I: That was justice.</span> <span id="s1061">I wanted to ask you, you said something earlier about having gone back to Europe to testify in the war crimes trials.</span> <span id="s1062">Can you tell me a little bit about that?</span> <span id="s1063">You’re the first person I’ve met who has done that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">R: (Mrs. Treitel) That was only a few years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">I: How did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">R: When I was living in Chicago, the German consul find out, or some reason, that I was in Goleschau.</span> <span id="s1067">So they called me.</span> <span id="s1068">How they got it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1069">The called in...Germans were very precise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">I: Yes, they kept all the records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">R: Very precise.</span> <span id="s1072">I want to go back again.</span> <span id="s1073">I want to go back.</span> <span id="s1074">After I was liberated, I went with the train to Berlin from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1075">I want to see what is what.</span> <span id="s1076">I went to - first of all, I went to people what helped me.</span> <span id="s1077">Catholic, bakery - they always give a bread to me, while they were in danger, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">I: Yes, anybody that helped was in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">R: So I went.</span> <span id="s1080">I have already chocolate.</span> <span id="s1081">I went in, but I don’t know if they recognize me now.</span> <span id="s1082">I went up.</span> <span id="s1083">I was thinking maybe I’ll be able to find a picture from my mother.</span> <span id="s1084">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s1085">Only my uncle was there from my wife’s side.</span> <span id="s1086">The uncle was there.</span> <span id="s1087">He was in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1088">He lost a leg during the first world war.</span> <span id="s1089">So he...</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">I: And he survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">R: He survived, yes.</span> <span id="s1092">So that uncle was working by the Jewish congregation in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1093">One synagogue were not burned in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1094">There were a bunch of synagogues.</span> <span id="s1095">A beautiful city.</span> <span id="s1096">Fifty, over fifty years ago.</span> <span id="s1097">His synagogue was now a museum.</span> <span id="s1098">Protection.</span> <span id="s1099">There were the SS in there.</span> <span id="s1100">And kept all the papers.</span> <span id="s1101">So I went there and say, “Please can I see the paper from Herbert Treitel?”</span> <span id="s1102">Max Treitel, Lipman Treitel, Seigfried Treitel...Herbert Treitel.</span> <span id="s1103">There I saw the first time that I had to sign for the kids and for myself that I am against the German government.</span> <span id="s1104">There I found it out myself.</span> <span id="s1105">That were interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Now we go back to Chicago.</span> <span id="s1107">It’s a wonderful city, too.</span> <span id="s1108">In Chicago, I make it short.</span> <span id="s1109">Finally my boss, what also was Jewish, Harry Kaufman, make no attempt after I was working there a year, no attempt to bring me in the union.</span> <span id="s1110">He make a helper out of me.</span> <span id="s1111">When he was still alive, I would be still a helper.</span> <span id="s1112">But he died.</span> <span id="s1113">And the business was sold and the business agent from the union came in and Mrs. Kaufman said “he is a good worker, put him in the union.”</span> <span id="s1114">And they put me in the union.</span> <span id="s1115">I had to make tests.</span> <span id="s1116">They put me in the union and later I got a wonderful job.</span> <span id="s1117">I was there and that only job in Evanston, 17 years with this firm.</span> <span id="s1118">A plumber usually in record.</span> <span id="s1119">Usually a plumber stay to build a new house.</span> <span id="s1120">When family house, or high rise is finished, they let him go.</span> <span id="s1121">But I was on job and I was specialized in heating, electric controls on boilers, and then I kept a pretty good job.</span> <span id="s1122">I make a good living.</span> <span id="s1123">My wife was no more working and we have a daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">I: You have one child, a daughter.</span> <span id="s1125">Is she in this city or in Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">R: In Chicago area.</span> <span id="s1127">Then I move to Sarasota.</span> <span id="s1128">Then you want to know about when I testify.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">I: Testify, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">R: I went to Chicago to the consul.</span> <span id="s1131">I told him there was a kapo there what killed Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1132">Oh, he told me he’s already in [ ] house, in heavy prison.</span> <span id="s1133">When we moved here, I got a letter from German consul in Atlanta, if I am willing to go to Germany to testify.</span> <span id="s1134">I went.</span> <span id="s1135">We both went.</span> <span id="s1136">They paid for everything.</span> <span id="s1137">The bad thing was that fellow what were for court, he wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1138">The SS man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">I: Was this Barbe, the one you’d encountered before, or someone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">R: No, no.</span> <span id="s1141">Somebody else.</span> <span id="s1142">A Polish name.</span> <span id="s1143">And I was so - really that I was an electrician there.</span> <span id="s1144">I was really a key witness.</span> <span id="s1145">Finally, a year later they call me again.</span> <span id="s1146">Then the consul called me and say, “I have already the airline tickets.”</span> <span id="s1147">(Mrs. Treitel) We were supposed to go and he became ill and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">He became ill and I wanted to see...for me, I only went there I want to see that guy.</span> <span id="s1149">But I never saw him and through another newspaper I heard that he came free and then he came to another place for court again.</span> <span id="s1150">He’s still on trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">I: After all these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">R: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">I: That must have been a terrible letdown for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">R: To find out that he a little bit younger than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">I Mr. Treitel, before we conclude this interview, I would very much appreciate it if you would single out the one, any one event that occurred during the Holocaust that you think was the most remarkable for yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">R: Remarkable.</span> <span id="s1157">What can I say?</span> <span id="s1158">This is hard.</span> <span id="s1159">The people what...I don’t blame people that say don’t understand us.</span> <span id="s1160">Is was indescribable.</span> <span id="s1161">Never ask.</span> <span id="s1162">I have a neighbor here.</span> <span id="s1163">I said, “Do me one favor.</span> <span id="s1164">We live different than you.</span> <span id="s1165">Not that we are different people, but all that make us awful people.</span> <span id="s1166">Really, not awful.</span> <span id="s1167">I cannot say it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">I: What you’re saying is that we cannot understand.</span> <span id="s1169">And you’re correct.</span> <span id="s1170">We cannot understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">R: No, I don’t blame the people that don’t understand.</span> <span id="s1172">I don’t blame.</span> <span id="s1173">A fly outside had more liberty than we ever had.</span> <span id="s1174">They killed us like nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">(Mrs. Treitel) For no reason, Just for being.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">There were...on one death march there were a potato raid.</span> <span id="s1177">Two Russian boys went on the potato raid, to take a couple of potatoes and they took a machine gun...life was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">I: Life had no value.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">R: No.</span> <span id="s1180">No value at all, at all.</span> <span id="s1181">Then we had no chance to come out.</span> <span id="s1182">The chance was so flum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">I: Okay.</span> <span id="s1184">When you came to this country, were there things that were disappointing to you, considering what you had expected?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">R: Two points were very disappointing to me.</span> <span id="s1186">That when I had the affidavit in 1938 for the United States, I had an affidavit that was worth more than a barrelful of gold.</span> <span id="s1187">And let me not in.</span> <span id="s1188">That I will unforget and unforgive.</span> <span id="s1189">They say the law was like that.</span> <span id="s1190">Where were my rights?</span> <span id="s1191">Where was Miss Liberty?</span> <span id="s1192">When they know we are in danger there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">I: That’s a very sad commentary on this country.</span> <span id="s1194">What’s the other thing; you said there were two things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">R: First of all, we had here from Jewish organization or from any one, we had no personal help.</span> <span id="s1196">We came on in New York, in Ellis Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">(Mrs. Treitel) I don’t know that it was Ellis Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Yah, sure it was Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s1199">We came on there.</span> <span id="s1200">For my wife her aunt was standing there whole day.</span> <span id="s1201">We was there.</span> <span id="s1202">They searched our luggage.</span> <span id="s1203">All that we had they searched like Nazi don’t search for munition or for dope.</span> <span id="s1204">They searched all about our what we had.</span> <span id="s1205">WE had a little bit.</span> <span id="s1206">What could you bring in.</span> <span id="s1207">A box.</span> <span id="s1208">They searched it.</span> <span id="s1209">In fact, there was a Jewish officer...</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">I: Immigration officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">R: No.</span> <span id="s1212">What searched.</span> <span id="s1213">Immigration officer got me, too.</span> <span id="s1214">Custom officer.</span> <span id="s1215">A Jewish one.</span> <span id="s1216">He said, “For what you bring more?”</span> <span id="s1217">He was living like a human being all his life.</span> <span id="s1218">He said to me, “For what do you bring all his stuff with you?”</span> <span id="s1219">My wife had a guitar with her.</span> <span id="s1220">She was in the newspaper next day.</span> <span id="s1221">I don’t know where the piece of paper still is.</span> <span id="s1222">And people brought things... We had trouble in Germany from the English people.</span> <span id="s1223">They went from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1224">And then they try to take the watches from the immigrants and the pictures.</span> <span id="s1225">The English.</span> <span id="s1226">And they were tough guys.</span> <span id="s1227">They were...lived that through.</span> <span id="s1228">There came fights with the English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">I: So your introduction to the United States did not really amount to a warm welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">R: Yah.</span> <span id="s1231">The Red Cross was there and gave us a donut.</span> <span id="s1232">No, not very warm.</span> <span id="s1233">And now we are citizens and we are very proud.</span> <span id="s1234">After hardship in the United States, we are very proud to be here.</span> <span id="s1235">I was in a lot of countries in my life.</span> <span id="s1236">I was in Poland, Holland, Belgium and in Israel - for more, Germany.</span> <span id="s1237">And there is not better country in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">I: Well, I agree with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">(End of interview)</span></p></body></html>
