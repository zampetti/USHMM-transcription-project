off by telling me your name, where you were born, what year you were born in, and your name as it was then?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: All right.</span> <span id="s13">My name is Rita Kerner Hilton.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Warsaw in 1926, July 22, 1926.</span> <span id="s15">I lived in Warsaw until I was six years old, seven years old, and then we moved to my mother's hometown Pomortsy.</span> <span id="s16">This is near Lodz, exiled city.</span> <span id="s17">My grandfather was a practicing dentist there and since my mother was a dentist, they decided to practice together.</span> <span id="s18">That's where I lived until the war broke out and the Ghettos and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Tell me a little bit about your life growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: When I was a small girl, my parents were doing very well financially.</span> <span id="s21">My father was a entrepreneur.</span> <span id="s22">My mother wasn't working at that time, and we always had a maid.</span> <span id="s23">I had a nanny when I was small.</span> <span id="s24">When we moved into Pomortsy, my grandmother was running the house, but she always had sleep-in help.</span> <span id="s25">Since my mother worked in the office, it was in the same apartment, I had a babysitter, or whoever it was, a part-time governess who'd come in after school hours and do homework with me and read with me, take me out to the park.</span> <span id="s26">So, I had kind of a pampered existence.</span> <span id="s27">I went to sleep-away camp.</span> <span id="s28">I had a bicycle which was, you know, they were expensive.</span> <span id="s29">So, I did have a very loving, a very pampered existence at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Were you particularly religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: No.</span> <span id="s32">My grandfather strongly believed in reformed Judaism, which did not exist in Poland as such.</span> <span id="s33">They never kept a kosher home.</span> <span id="s34">We did observe holidays.</span> <span id="s35">We observed Passover, and he used to go to the synagogue on high holidays, sometimes would take me, but it was different.</span> <span id="s36">He strongly felt that if there would be a reformed Judaism then he could probably follow it.</span> <span id="s37">He could not follow the orthodox, the rabbis teachings, and argue with some of them about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: How integrated were you in the larger community?</span> <span id="s39">Were most of your friends Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Did you go to a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Well, I went to a public school, which was hard to get in, but this was the best -- I'm talking about primary school.</span> <span id="s42">We lived in a so-called new section of town, not the Jewish section, a new section of town.</span> <span id="s43">There were maybe about few Jewish kids there, mostly from the prominent families, doctors, lawyers and stuff like this, dentists.</span> <span id="s44">And when I first came, I remember one of those days a kid called me a dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s45">I was a big girl, I was in first grade, and I gave a smack to the right and a smack to the left, and I never had any problem in that school.</span> <span id="s46">When the time came to go to high school, there were three high schools in town.</span> <span id="s47">A girls' school, a boys' school and a German school.</span> <span id="s48">This town was very much German.</span> <span id="s49">There were a lot settled by the Germans.</span> <span id="s50">They were German textile markets.</span> <span id="s51">This was a textile factory town.</span> <span id="s52">And they were having every year there were less Jewish kids accepted there.</span> <span id="s53">You had to pass an exam, and you had to be the top of the top of the top to get into that school.</span> <span id="s54">If you couldn't get in, you had to commute to Lodz, which was a 45 minute ride by street car.</span> <span id="s55">You had to go to private school then which was costly.</span> <span id="s56">Well, I got into that school.</span> <span id="s57">And again the first few days someone said something about being a Jew, but the principal of the school, she was very anti-semitic, but she was very fair, and she did not stand for any discrimination.</span> <span id="s58">And again, I had no problem.</span> <span id="s59">I had a bunch of friends, but little by little, I mean, there was one girl, later on, she was in camp with me, Alena, and we used to fight like cats and dogs, but at the same time we were the only Jewish kids in the same level, Jewish girls on that level.</span> <span id="s60">The year before they accepted I think three or four or five.</span> <span id="s61">Our year they accepted three, the following year they accepted two.</span> <span id="s62">The boys had a harder time in school.</span> <span id="s63">There were a couple boys who were sons of prominent doctor and they took his penis and dipped it in ink, and also there was a doctor upstairs, a friend of my parents, they had a younger kid.</span> <span id="s64">He started going to the same school that I did, but they taunted him and he started losing clumps of hair from nervousness, and they had to place him in Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s65">The Jewish schools were state schools, but the principals, the teachers, the kids were Jewish, and there were two schools.</span> <span id="s66">One was the better one, and the other one wasn't so good.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">But still, in order to get to the high school, if you came from the Polish school, your chances of getting into the high school were much better than if you came from the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s68">You know, separated, but equal.</span> <span id="s69">And I had, as I said, had not too much problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Were there social and cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: At one time I know my mother used to go to all those fancy charity balls, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s72">And I think closer to the war, there were a couple Jewish charity balls.</span> <span id="s73">I think she still used to go to the Red Cross ball and so on.</span> <span id="s74">But there were less social contact.</span> <span id="s75">My mother had a friend, a school friend, who was of a German decent, a very, very prominent family.</span> <span id="s76">They owned big factories, and she married a Polish boy.</span> <span id="s77">They were patients for years and years and years.</span> <span id="s78">They used to socialize, and then closer to the war, that dried out.</span> <span id="s79">We didn't have those contacts as such.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: So, let's talk a little bit about how things started to change.</span> <span id="s81">Were you aware of what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s83">My aunt lived in Germany.</span> <span id="s84">They came to the States before the war.</span> <span id="s85">They knew it was coming on.</span> <span id="s86">Also, there was a group of Polish people who lived in Germany, never had their German passports.</span> <span id="s87">They were never citizens, and in 1937, they all sent them out and we used to collect money for them.</span> <span id="s88">We used to give them meals and so on, because they were thrown out from Germany without anything.</span> <span id="s89">So, we were aware very much of what was going on.</span> <span id="s90">But no one believed it was going to happen, what happened, because during the first World War, the Germans were the better friends than the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">People did not like Russians in this part of Poland.</span> <span id="s92">So, we were aware, but we never thought they would destroy us all.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: What happened when the Germans occupied your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: One of the first actions they put a bunch of restrictions.</span> <span id="s95">We couldn't use the street cars.</span> <span id="s96">We couldn't use the cafe downstairs where everybody used to sit.</span> <span id="s97">No Jews were allowed there.</span> <span id="s98">We couldn't go to the park.</span> <span id="s99">Schools were closed.</span> <span id="s100">I don't know when they told us to wear the -- before the stars, I think we had to wear the yellow armbands.</span> <span id="s101">There were scenes downstairs, I see through the window that they would grab a Jew with a and cut the and cut the beard.</span> <span id="s102">And usually it was young kids doing it.</span> <span id="s103">The Hitler Youth were like a bunch of little puppies jumping on.</span> <span id="s104">This was the beginning.</span> <span id="s105">Then they started -- see we knew we would not be able to stay in the apartment.</span> <span id="s106">This was a fancy section of town, and it was a very large apartment.</span> <span id="s107">What has happened was a crazy situation and part of the apartment someone sublet it, it was a subleased to people who owned the cafe downstairs.</span> <span id="s108">They were German Nationals.</span> <span id="s109">And they requested that section.</span> <span id="s110">So, we managed to get some furniture out because we were evacuated not by the Germans, but by this owner of the restaurant, the cafe.</span> <span id="s111">So, my mother got out some of her extra, one extra chair and a foot drill and some equipment and we got some furniture from that part of the apartment out, and we have hidden it.</span> <span id="s112">Some Pole took it for us.</span> <span id="s113">And we did manage to get some valuables out, which eventually we left with the Poles.</span> <span id="s114">We never saw it again.</span> <span id="s115">But at that time we -- and we kind of waited, when they are going to kick us out.</span> <span id="s116">And sure enough, the order came in 24 hours we had to leave beddings for 12 beds, all the china, all the furniture, all the equipment in the office.</span> <span id="s117">Everything had to be left.</span> <span id="s118">We were allowed only to take our personal clothing.</span> <span id="s119">That's when we moved.</span> <span id="s120">That Pole he promised us it would be out of town, a little suburban area, very quiet.</span> <span id="s121">Nothing will happen to us, and then he -- the Jews were not allowed to have money, "X" amount of German marks, no gold, no silver, no diamonds, and when they started talking about forming the Ghetto in he persuaded my grandfather that he's going to save for safekeeping, he'll take all his valuables.</span> <span id="s122">And Grandfather had all his money in a gold money belt.</span> <span id="s123">His total life savings were in those gold coins.</span> <span id="s124">American dollars, British sterling pounds, everything in gold.</span> <span id="s125">So, he left it with the Pole, and after the Ghetto was formed, we couldn't get out, but we sent someone to pick it up, and he denied that he had ever had it.</span> <span id="s126">We never saw that stuff again.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Did that surprise you?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: At that time, yes.</span> <span id="s129">At that time, he was so -- seemed like my father knew him and we knew him.</span> <span id="s130">We stayed with him.</span> <span id="s131">We paid rent, but we stayed with him for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s132">There was also a situation where we wanted to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s133">My mother decided to smuggle herself, smugglers and go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s134">She had some fabrics she felt she'll take it to Warsaw and sell it maybe live on it for a while.</span> <span id="s135">Our relatives in Warsaw wanted ut to move there.</span> <span id="s136">They felt that this was not German, this was the protector at this part of Poland at that time.</span> <span id="s137">So, she went.</span> <span id="s138">She had a fur coat, and covered in fabric and went and was stopped somewhere and all the smuggled goods were taken away.</span> <span id="s139">We didn't know what happened, but they let them out.</span> <span id="s140">This was a put up.</span> <span id="s141">They just wanted to get the goods.</span> <span id="s142">So, a few days later she came home, luckily for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Now, I'd like to get a sense of the mood when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s144">Were people fearful?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Were people being abused?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: No.</span> <span id="s147">The fear was when we were all running to Lodz before the Germans came.</span> <span id="s148">I don't think people were so fearful.</span> <span id="s149">It's hard to say how they felt.</span> <span id="s150">We all didn't know what would happen.</span> <span id="s151">By 11th of November, this is a Polish holiday, and just before they arrested all the prominent people in town, not only Jews, they arrested Poles, they arrested anyone, teachers, lawyers, bankers, whoever had any prominence so they couldn't start any uprising.</span> <span id="s152">They wouldn't stir the population against the Germans.</span> <span id="s153">And we never saw them again.</span> <span id="s154">Some of the Poles were let out.</span> <span id="s155">Some Poles were let out, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: You don't know what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: No.</span> <span id="s158">And then, as I said, it was winter, I think it was March, maybe February, when the Ghetto was formed, the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s161">And we didn't have a place to go.</span> <span id="s162">There was my grandmother's sister.</span> <span id="s163">She had a three or four bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s164">By that time, there were two other families living in part of that apartment and we wound up in a little room.</span> <span id="s165">Some other relatives were there.</span> <span id="s166">It was just bedlam.</span> <span id="s167">Finally, we found out that there was a little house that belonged to a pharmacist, a Polish pharmacist, and they told he has to get out of his apartment.</span> <span id="s168">So, we shared that apartment with a few other families, and that's where Mom opened up the office, reopened her office.</span> <span id="s169">This was an open Ghetto.</span> <span id="s170">There were no wires, no barbed wires, just check points.</span> <span id="s171">Jewish police were watching it.</span> <span id="s172">The Poles and the Germans would come into the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s173">If they didn't know you, you could get out.</span> <span id="s174">I had a friend who would go out, but no one knew him in town.</span> <span id="s175">But I couldn't get out because they knew me, and I could never step my foot out, outside.</span> <span id="s176">The Ghetto was on two sides of that little section.</span> <span id="s177">There was a main street going through with the street cars, so we had certain hours we could walk through, walk across the main street.</span> <span id="s178">You could walk across in the morning.</span> <span id="s179">You could cross in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s180">Once you went on the one side, you couldn't go back until the hour came that you could do it.</span> <span id="s181">They formed a factory.</span> <span id="s182">They started having German army coats made, and money was coming in.</span> <span id="s183">There were various people who were in charge of the Ghetto, and there was one so-called revolution after another one.</span> <span id="s184">One group would kick them out and get other ones, with the help of the Germans.</span> <span id="s185">Personally, our family, my mother was having a lot of patients.</span> <span id="s186">There were no Polish dentists in town, so her patients would come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Polish people.</span> <span id="s189">We had access to food.</span> <span id="s190">We had access to a lot of things.</span> <span id="s191">She was making money, and she was helping the whole family.</span> <span id="s192">She had aunts and uncles and she was supporting everybody at that time.</span> <span id="s193">I worked with my grandfather in an outpatient clinic.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: This was a dental clinic?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: No.</span> <span id="s196">Grandfather before he became a dentist, he was something you called a feltcher (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s197">It's almost like a medic.</span> <span id="s198">My grandfather was doing it.</span> <span id="s199">My grandfather was doing it.</span> <span id="s200">So, he was very well educated in medicine basically.</span> <span id="s201">Never became a doctor.</span> <span id="s202">And there was a need for an outpatient clinic, so this was free of charge.</span> <span id="s203">He opened it up under the hospital of the Jewish government, and I worked with him.</span> <span id="s204">The afternoons I had tutors, and my mother was very anxious for me to finish my -- somehow not to lose my years of education, so in the afternoon I had a tutor and was doing the high school program as much as we could, but at least I had somewhat.</span> <span id="s205">I wasn't left completely wild.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Tell me about the organization of the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s207">Who was preventing you from coming and going?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: There was a so-called Jewish , originally there was one lawyer in charge of it.</span> <span id="s209">There was a bunch of people who took over, and there were all kinds of unsavory things.</span> <span id="s210">Unsavory in terms of there were rations coming in, the food was coming in, and I think they were selling it in the Black Market.</span> <span id="s211">There was another group denounced them.</span> <span id="s212">Eventually they were arrested and some of them were hanged later in Lodz Ghetto.</span> <span id="s213">There was a Jewish police, but they were strictly order police.</span> <span id="s214">I don't think they wore hats.</span> <span id="s215">They just wore arm bands.</span> <span id="s216">They were watching all the end streets of the Ghetto and the crossing streets.</span> <span id="s217">We had a whole little government which was running with the understanding of the Germans and they were dealing with the Germans.</span> <span id="s218">The food and everything else was going through that group.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: This group was corrupt?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: The first one, yes.</span> <span id="s221">I mean, I wouldn't say the first one.</span> <span id="s222">That one lawyer was not, but the group which took over, they were corrupt, very corrupt.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: How did people get chosen for these duties?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s225">I think they just got a group of people together and went to the Germans and what they did, I don't know.</span> <span id="s226">This third group they were a couple of brothers and someone else, and they denounced the second group as corrupt, because I guess they got wind of what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Were there any women in positions of responsibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s229">Not at that time, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Do you remember how you all felt about these Jewish police taking orders from the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Well, they were not really taking orders from the Germans.</span> <span id="s232">They had to do a job and there were friends among them.</span> <span id="s233">I mean, they were not in any way abusing people or killing people, or hitting people.</span> <span id="s234">They were just standing there and wouldn't let you go.</span> <span id="s235">The Germans and the Poles could come into Ghetto, and they told you not to go.</span> <span id="s236">This is the border, this is the line, you can't cross the line, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Did they have any other responsibilities like organizational schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: No, in Ghetto, there was absolutely nothing, no schools.</span> <span id="s239">The only thing we had organized, they organized a hospital.</span> <span id="s240">It was an old factory, and we organized it as a hospital.</span> <span id="s241">We had a bunch of fundraisers, which were like reviews, and people volunteered to entertain and perform and we would all go to the shows and that would raise money for the hospital.</span> <span id="s242">But that was the extent of this cultural events.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Now, you said your mother worked and she had outside patients.</span> <span id="s244">Did you have enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s246">My family, at that time, we had too much to eat, because we had access to everything at much lower prices than the real Black Market.</span> <span id="s247">Those items were on the Black Market, but we were going directly from the Poles to us as I guess going to some middle man in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s248">So, we did have enough to eat.</span> <span id="s249">Grandma again, had a little girl who helped run this place, and as a result my mother was supporting that family, and the tutor's family, and she had two aunts and one uncle.</span> <span id="s250">She was supporting them, giving them money so they could buy their food.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Were times hard for other people in the Ghetto, or was this Ghetto not too severe?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: No, it wasn't too severed.</span> <span id="s253">But it was, like those two women who were teaching me, there were two sisters that lived with their mother, and they had absolutely no way of getting any money.</span> <span id="s254">They were tutoring me and they were tutoring my other friends, so that was their main way of making money.</span> <span id="s255">My mother gave orders that when they came in the afternoon, we served a little snack.</span> <span id="s256">I didn't need a snack, but by serving some little sandwiches or something the tutor could eat and she didn't have to eat home.</span> <span id="s257">So, there were ways of helping people.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Was your sense for other people, was there food rationing?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: There was rationing.</span> <span id="s260">There was a Black Market.</span> <span id="s261">There was rationing, but again it was not so bad like in Lodz.</span> <span id="s262">I mean, people survived.</span> <span id="s263">No one starved to death.</span> <span id="s264">The Jewish administration, I think they had some kind of a welfare department because Mom was taking in any patient who couldn't pay, Jewish patient, would get a slip from the department and they would come in and she treated them free.</span> <span id="s265">She'd never take any money.</span> <span id="s266">I mean people had money, but that was something else.</span> <span id="s267">But if they didn't, they were all treated for free.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Were most people in the Ghetto working, older people or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s270">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s271">That Ghetto lasted about two years.</span> <span id="s272">People still had things.</span> <span id="s273">People were selling things.</span> <span id="s274">They were selling linens.</span> <span id="s275">They were selling, if they had any jewelry, they were selling, so I don't think at that time, and look, I was a young girl, and I was concerned with working and meeting boys later and so on, and doing some school work, so maybe I did not delve into that too deeply.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: So, you were still doing all of those things?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: I was still doing all of those things until the Ghetto was closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Now, how at this point you had really lost touch with all of your non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: All right, there was an interesting encounter I had.</span> <span id="s280">In high school, we had one girl who was of German decent, and as before they would taunt Jewish girls, the year before the war, they started taunting her.</span> <span id="s281">We would not go to the -- they had catholic classes in school.</span> <span id="s282">The priest would come in and teach them catholic, you know, the religion.</span> <span id="s283">So, we were excused for the hour and the three of us, there was another girl and we used to sit in the cafeteria and just sit and kill an hour.</span> <span id="s284">They used to send once a week a Jewish teacher to teach all of the Jewish girls, the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s285">So, the kids would taunt her, and I was one of the few people who were friendly with her.</span> <span id="s286">And I met her one day in the Ghetto, she worked in the Ghetto, and I was shocked because she hugged me and kissed me on the street.</span> <span id="s287">Her family declared themselves Tolstoy, you know, the German Nationalist.</span> <span id="s288">And she gave me a big greeting, and I was very much surprised.</span> <span id="s289">But you see, I took her part and defended her against the Polish girls before the war.</span> <span id="s290">But that was the only contact I had with her.</span> <span id="s291">I mentioned that woman who was my mother's friend, she married a Pole.</span> <span id="s292">When the war broke out they were in the textile business like everybody else in town, and Mom decided to invest some money in some wool clothes.</span> <span id="s293">Because we figured that during the war the factories will be closed, then that will be worth more money, but she left the fabric -- I mean I don't know how many bolts of fabric she bought, she left if with that family, with him and his family.</span> <span id="s294">When it came the time that she wanted to sell it, he was the only one who came with the money.</span> <span id="s295">She sent him a message and within a few days, and this was a nice profit, because naturally that thing increased in value and we got it.</span> <span id="s296">We got the money.</span> <span id="s297">So, he was one of the few.</span> <span id="s298">He was good and he was honest and he didn't look to take the stuff and not to deliver.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: So, it sounds like in the Ghetto you were able to carry on somewhat of a normal</span></p> <p><span id="s300">existence?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: It didn't change things, but you were still able to eat?</span> <span id="s303">A: In my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: And there weren't too many rough restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s306">We had every once in a while the Germans would come in.</span> <span id="s307">There were restrictions where you couldn't have certain metals and precious metals and then they started raids, and it was just wild.</span> <span id="s308">They would come in from all sides, line up, the ones with the brown shirts and the red armbands, they were lined up at arms lengths, they even took the boy scouts, the Hitler Youth, they lined up and they would go from apartment to apartment from room to room and looking for furs and looking for metals and naturally silver.</span> <span id="s309">But even cooper and pewter, whatever metals they could melt.</span> <span id="s310">There were several incidents like this.</span> <span id="s311">They were also at one time, they wanted to evacuate Jewish youngsters.</span> <span id="s312">They were looking -- my mother got hold of -- I mean she knew about it a few days before, and I was hidden and some Jewish woman came with the Germans and said there is a young girl.</span> <span id="s313">I said I'm in the hospital, I was in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: What were they going to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: They took them away.</span> <span id="s316">We do not know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s317">Q: Were Jews allowed to keep businesses or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Local businesses.</span> <span id="s319">There was a restaurant and shoemakers and things like this, but no business as such.</span> <span id="s320">Once they established the factory, they were making money.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">They were paying them money, the operators.</span> <span id="s322">That brought some income to the Ghetto under .</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: I want to back track for a second because I forgot to ask you about how before the Germans arrived in your town, your community starting to prepare for that possibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s325">I really don't know what way they did and whether they didn't.</span> <span id="s326">There were a lot of people like the doctor upstairs.</span> <span id="s327">There were Polish, in the Polish army officers, there were Jewish officers, and they were drafted and they went with the Army.</span> <span id="s328">Most of them, they wound up in Italy or many of them went up in .</span> <span id="s329">We don't know who killed them.</span> <span id="s330">I think the Germans, but the Germans were blaming the Russians, and the Russians were blaming the Germans.</span> <span id="s331">But this was most of the Polish army was destroyed there, the officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: You had mentioned that there was sort of an organizing for this.</span> <span id="s333">The masks --</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Oh, the masks because they were afraid to throw down the gas bombs.</span> <span id="s335">We were afraid of the gas bombs.</span> <span id="s336">There were a few raids in town, and we used to sit when there was a raid, we used to sit I don't know what you call it -- in Poland they had the drive in like it was a drive in under to go to the yard.</span> <span id="s337">So, they had this one section and it was supposedly the safest place to be in case of an attack or bomb falling down.</span> <span id="s338">There were some dog fights around.</span> <span id="s339">We saw a German plane being shot down.</span> <span id="s340">The Polish army was a joke.</span> <span id="s341">We never realized that.</span> <span id="s342">We thought, oh they are so strong.</span> <span id="s343">They used to have a song about the march of the Reds.</span> <span id="s344">He wouldn't give anything.</span> <span id="s345">He wouldn't give a buck, and when we started running away from the Germans we were following the Polish army.</span> <span id="s346">They were with the little scrawny horses, with little cots pulling the small arms, absolutely disorganized bunch of nothing.</span> <span id="s347">They were like 18th century and here was the smite of German army.</span> <span id="s348">So, they were overrun in no time.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: So what were these masks?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: They were afraid of gas.</span> <span id="s351">They were supposed to be prevent us from being poisoned by gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Did you use them?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: One time we were sitting down, there was a raid, and everybody was "Oh, they threw a bomb."</span> <span id="s354">They were masks like surgeons wear.</span> <span id="s355">The whole thing was a joke, but we didn't realize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Anything else you all did in preparation for this?</span> <span id="s357">A: No, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: What were the circumstances that you had to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: They announced that the Ghetto would be liquidated, and we had like two days to get ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: This was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: May of '42.</span> <span id="s362">In fact, the 15th or 16th of May because my friend, Alena had a birthday that date.</span> <span id="s363">They announced -- first of all there was a group of men who will be working in those factories, the coat factories.</span> <span id="s364">They will stay for a while.</span> <span id="s365">They selected a group of people who would stay in the Ghetto and clean it up.</span> <span id="s366">And they needed medical person also.</span> <span id="s367">There was a doctor and he was old and he was a bachelor, and he had a sister who was a dentist, and they volunteered to stay.</span> <span id="s368">Our family was ordered to go to the hospital, because there were a lot of patients.</span> <span id="s369">The population was told to bring all the infirm, all the sick ones, all the very old ones to the hospital.</span> <span id="s370">So, on a given day, and we were allowed to just take what we had on our backs and those bundles.</span> <span id="s371">We wore a few layers of clothes and we went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s372">On the given day, when we got to the hospital, we were told that there is an old age home somewhere so we carried the patients, whoever was left, and this place was filled to the rafters because they brought everybody who was in any way infirm there.</span> <span id="s373">That first day, they marched the whole population to that stadium, which was actually at the other end of town.</span> <span id="s374">And we have been in a hospital that night, so we haven't seen what happened, but we were told what happened.</span> <span id="s375">As they approached the stadium there was an area which was like fenced off which was before you entered actually the stadium.</span> <span id="s376">They started separating the parents, the old ones, and they started taking the children away.</span> <span id="s377">All the children under ten years old.</span> <span id="s378">I was told that they threw a baby over the fence and said we don't need such .</span> <span id="s379">Smashed child's, baby's head on a fence.</span> <span id="s380">They took them all to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s381">They grabbed a bunch of boys, young fellows and they took them to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s382">That night, they took all the women who were left to Lodz.</span> <span id="s383">The following day they came to the hospital, and the group which came were the same boys and they were friends of ours.</span> <span id="s384">They were my friends.</span> <span id="s385">I knew them.</span> <span id="s386">They told us that they were putting people into those cattle cars and then they took the women to Lodz by street cars and just the men are left in the stadium.</span> <span id="s387">They were the ones who carried the patients to the lorries, carts really, and they announced who couldn't walk should go on a lorry.</span> <span id="s388">And my grandmother felt that she couldn't walk all the way down.</span> <span id="s389">So, we had kind of a touchy moment because we walked through town.</span> <span id="s390">I think this was Sunday, because a lot of people were there and some of them would make the sign of a cross when they recognized us, and the whole personnel was walking.</span> <span id="s391">There was one woman who was hiding a kid in her backpack and she was walking.</span> <span id="s392">She wouldn't go on the cart, and when we reached shortly before we reached the stadium, you had to turn left at the stadium and the station was straight ahead and all the carts with the patients went straight, and the cart with the boys went straight and then we kind of froze for a minute, and the cart with my grandmother and other people went leftward to the stadium.</span> <span id="s393">So, they were with us.</span> <span id="s394">That night and a man told us again about these awful, awful scenes which took place -- I think that out of population of 8,000 finally 3,000, 3,500 wound up in large Ghetto.</span> <span id="s395">That night they took us to Lodz by street cars.</span> <span id="s396">The street cars stopped running about midnight, and that's when they were taking us all to large Ghetto.</span> <span id="s397">That second day, were just men and group from hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: And the children who hadn't been evacuated?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Well, I don't think there were too many children at that time.</span> <span id="s400">Q: Because of that earlier --?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: That day before, they took them all away.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: You had mentioned that earlier in the Ghetto --?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: There were some teenagers, but not too many.</span> <span id="s404">I think they sent them to some work camps, but not too many.</span> <span id="s405">We arrived at Ghetto late at night and they put us in some place, just empty rooms.</span> <span id="s406">We were told that the gypsies were evacuated from that area before and that's just like a holding area.</span> <span id="s407">And people were crying and crying about their lost children and their grandchildren.</span> <span id="s408">It was just very, very sad about the old people, and some other people wanted to know about what happened to the sick and the infirm.</span> <span id="s409">They left them in the hospital, and what happened to them?</span> <span id="s410">And that same morning some friends of our starting coming in looking for us, and one couple took care of my mother and me, and one person took my grandmother, someone took my grandfather.</span> <span id="s411">We stayed with those people.</span> <span id="s412">They shared a couple of days they shared their food with us.</span> <span id="s413">They could hardly afford it.</span> <span id="s414">Then we got a room for the four of us and we started our existence.</span> <span id="s415">I wouldn't call it living, in the large Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: One thing that strikes me about all of this is your mother must have been pretty strong?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: She was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s418">She held the family together.</span> <span id="s419">She had tremendous resources.</span> <span id="s420">Later on, here, she was very unsure of herself and very vague and afraid, and even my husband who knew her younger, younger age, he couldn't understand how absolutely brave and resourceful and fighting for life.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Was that unusual for a woman?</span> <span id="s422">A: To be a dentist?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Not to be a dentist, but to really be taking care of everyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Well, she had to.</span> <span id="s425">There was no one else.</span> <span id="s426">She went to school when she was 18 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">When she finished high school she went to Warsaw to study dentistry.</span> <span id="s428">There were no dorms, she lived on her own.</span> <span id="s429">She rented a room and lived on her own.</span> <span id="s430">She had to.</span> <span id="s431">Her father paid for it, but still, she had to be resourceful.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: So, now you're in Lodz.</span> <span id="s433">A: We're in Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Conditions, I'm sure, are a little bit different?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Conditions are horrid.</span> <span id="s436">We had this one room, which was our bedroom, our living room, our kitchen, our bathroom.</span> <span id="s437">The first few nights, Mom and I slept on a straw mattress on the floor, and mice came in and started running on our faces, so we had to give this up.</span> <span id="s438">So, we shared one bed and Grandma had a cot, and Grandfather had a bed.</span> <span id="s439">We all worked.</span> <span id="s440">, who was the head of Lodz Ghetto, didn't like dentists, so she worked as a nurse in one of the factories.</span> <span id="s441">I worked in a brassiere factory.</span> <span id="s442">Grandfather was working also like a male nurse in one of the factories.</span> <span id="s443">Grandma got a job, old ladies were sorting rags and making bowls out of those colored rags, and eventually some younger women were knitting rugs for the Germans.</span> <span id="s444">The problem was that the rags were full of lice and they were sorting them on wire tables.</span> <span id="s445">So, she was bringing the lice home.</span> <span id="s446">When they give us rations, you have to pick up the rations, the first day because very often they would run out of the things.</span> <span id="s447">I think there were 750 to 900 calories a day what we were getting at that time.</span> <span id="s448">And just before the winter they decided to give us rations for the whole winter.</span> <span id="s449">Our wood and coal and turnips and potatoes and cabbage and beets.</span> <span id="s450">So, we had to go and pick it up at night.</span> <span id="s451">Mom and I would stand in line.</span> <span id="s452">The only way to pick this up was to put it on a sack and put it on your shoulders and carry it.</span> <span id="s453">You wouldn't let anyone carry it, because they would disappear.</span> <span id="s454">We had four people, so we sometimes had to do it in four installments, four nights in a row to pick up that stuff.</span> <span id="s455">On the one bed we had the coal and the wood, and on the other bed we had all the potatoes and cabbage and we had the inventory.</span> <span id="s456">We knew how many months it was supposed to last, and every couple of nights we would check which potatoes were getting rotten.</span> <span id="s457">And this is the potatoes we ate because we knew it had to last for the whole winter.</span> <span id="s458">We also got bread, a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s459">So, again, we cut up the bread in sections and little slices so we had for breakfast a piece and for lunch a piece and for dinner a piece and so we were not -- we were always hungry, but some people would eat the bread on the first day or the second day and they were starving the rest of the week.</span> <span id="s460">And what else we did, we all got some kind of a -- we didn't make anything warm to drink in the morning but you could buy hot water or coffee, so Grandma was going later to work so she volunteered.</span> <span id="s461">Then she started tripping on the street and falling down.</span> <span id="s462">She would come with a bloody face, whether she was weak or whether she had pressure too long, we don't know.</span> <span id="s463">So, we gave that up.</span> <span id="s464">During the day we all got soup.</span> <span id="s465">If you worked, you got the soup.</span> <span id="s466">And you had to work because you would get the money, the German money.</span> <span id="s467">The , they were named after Mr. who was the absolute tyrant in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s468">And then at night we made a little something to eat, from whatever we had, whatever rations we had.</span> <span id="s469">If we had any vegetables we made it a little bit thick with any starches or whatever they give us.</span> <span id="s470">This was the existence.</span> <span id="s471">Cold miserable and we all started getting sick.</span> <span id="s472">I was getting abscesses on my face and sties in my eyes.</span> <span id="s473">Grandfather fell on ice and broke his arm, and he started staying in bed.</span> <span id="s474">Grandmother had those dizzy spells, and we just tried to exist, and this was two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Did you have much contact with people outside of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s477">At work, you work.</span> <span id="s478">I had a boyfriend, and we used to walk the streets because he had no place to go, and I had no place to go, so it was cold and we used to walk the streets and talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Were there curfews?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: I think there were curfews.</span> <span id="s481">I'm sure there were.</span> <span id="s482">We didn't walk at night.</span> <span id="s483">We walked on a Saturday.</span> <span id="s484">It was a day off, so we walked.</span> <span id="s485">Towards the very end of the Ghetto, I got a job in the fields, in the vegetable fields.</span> <span id="s486">There were two kinds of police in the large Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">There was this regular order police.</span> <span id="s488">They watched the exits.</span> <span id="s489">They watch order and stuff like this.</span> <span id="s490">And there was so-called commando.</span> <span id="s491">The head of commando was someone called Mark Kleeger (ph).</span> <span id="s492">Those bunch of thugs, they would get orders from Germans to deliver diamonds or deliver or find gold among the Jews, but they were nasty.</span> <span id="s493">They would come into someone's house looking for this stuff, and naturally they figure out the person would hide the stuff in sugar or flour.</span> <span id="s494">So, instead of taking a plate or a bowl, they would just dump everything out on the floor looking for the valuables.</span> <span id="s495">They were in charge of the fields where they distributed the vegetables.</span> <span id="s496">I mean, so if you knew someone and we knew someone and they were there and they put the finger on the scale a little bit or lifted the scale you could get a little bit more.</span> <span id="s497">They had special rations.</span> <span id="s498">They ate in special places.</span> <span id="s499">They would buy their groceries in a special store like all the others of .</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: These were Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: That was Jewish police.</span> <span id="s502">And as I said, he had those fields out near the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s503">He established vegetable fields.</span> <span id="s504">We had people working there.</span> <span id="s505">And I was getting sick and through connections and through people I got the job in those fields.</span> <span id="s506">It was a hard labor.</span> <span id="s507">So, first of all you got two soups a day instead of one.</span> <span id="s508">I had to walk two or three miles to that place, but the fresh air.</span> <span id="s509">I mean there was nothing much to do, the fresh air and the sun started drying up my face, and then we were working when we were weeding, we would take the weeds home.</span> <span id="s510">They were a source of green vegetable.</span> <span id="s511">When we were thinning out radishes, we would eat raw radishes.</span> <span id="s512">That they couldn't catch us, but when we were doing something with the weeds, weeding the weeds, we used to eat the raw bean and put the greens back into the ground so they couldn't figure out who was eating them.</span> <span id="s513">We weren't really stealing, we were just hungry so we'd eat a bean.</span> <span id="s514">But that helped me later on to survive the rest of it, because all of a sudden my health improved so much.</span> <span id="s515">And because I was getting two soups a day, I didn't have to each so much at home.</span> <span id="s516">I was getting the extra soup.</span> <span id="s517">I would bring it home at night so we had it.</span> <span id="s518">And my grandfather was getting weaker and weaker.</span> <span id="s519">He couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s520">This was really awful, so we kept on saving his bread.</span> <span id="s521">And his wish was to live so long that we can pick up his rations.</span> <span id="s522">This was his inheritance because he said he lost all his gold, he can't leave us anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">What we did he died the day before the rations came, and we didn't report it until the following day, we picked it up and then I reported the death, so we had this extra little food and an extra loaf of bread, which later I left if in Auschwitz because we're still hoarding and we're still afraid to let go and eat everything a once.</span> <span id="s524">But the existence in Lodz Ghetto was awful.</span> <span id="s525">They also had the criminal police, , this was German police.</span> <span id="s526">They had their headquarters in a little church, and they would call people in and say what do you have?</span> <span id="s527">Our landlord, he was the head of fences before the war.</span> <span id="s528">A real, very unsavory character, but he had a heart of gold.</span> <span id="s529">And he must have had money.</span> <span id="s530">They beat him to death.</span> <span id="s531">They let him out, he died a day later.</span> <span id="s532">But he was like -- his face was like liver.</span> <span id="s533">He never told them what he had.</span> <span id="s534">They called my mother in.</span> <span id="s535">They said we heard you are a rich dentist from .</span> <span id="s536">What do you have?</span> <span id="s537">And she said, "Well, I have a couple of gold chains, I have a little diamond."</span> <span id="s538">And they said, bring it in.</span> <span id="s539">So, she brought it in and they let her go.</span> <span id="s540">So, they were satisfied.</span> <span id="s541">If she would have said she had nothing, they would have tortured her.</span> <span id="s542">This between the and the Jews under commando, this was pretty tight situation over there.</span> <span id="s543">And then they started evacuations.</span> <span id="s544">They were evacuating constantly people.</span> <span id="s545">One of the worst actions was when they took the children out.</span> <span id="s546">Orders came that they have to take the children, they're going to take them to better places.</span> <span id="s547">There will be fresh air and farms and the people put signs on it and they mobilized all the Jewish police including all the people who worked for the health department, including my mother, and they had to go and collect the children.</span> <span id="s548">The children were being taken voluntarily by the parents, taken down, because they couldn't hide them.</span> <span id="s549">The moment the family would hide a child, the rations would be taken away, so not only the child didn't have the rations, but the family wouldn't have the rations.</span> <span id="s550">Our next door neighbors had hidden a child and they struggled.</span> <span id="s551">Unfortunately she died later, but it was -- and then they were taking the old people.</span> <span id="s552">They would make you line up on the street and get out and just select the old people and the children Now, one of the worst actions was around the Jewish holidays, this was '44, I believe.</span> <span id="s553">And we lived on the corner, and the lady the one who was our so-called landlady, she was the wife of the guy who was killed.</span> <span id="s554">Before the war she was in Argentina.</span> <span id="s555">So, we started lining up on one street and she called everybody up and she said forget it.</span> <span id="s556">This is not our street.</span> <span id="s557">Our address is the next street.</span> <span id="s558">There were two entrances there.</span> <span id="s559">She said, all of you go back home and hide.</span> <span id="s560">Just sit quiet, don't open the window, don't stand next to windows.</span> <span id="s561">At that time she had hidden some children and my grandparents.</span> <span id="s562">We didn't know where they were, somewhere.</span> <span id="s563">They had all kinds of nooks and crannies in that building, and we had all hidden quietly, and at noon they rang the whistles and they stopped the action.</span> <span id="s564">So, they were ready to call that second street, where we were, they called it off, so we were saved.</span> <span id="s565">If she would have -- we walked out and somebody said to us, someone who knew us and said, where are your parents, and my mother said, hidden.</span> <span id="s566">He said, that's silly, they'll find them.</span> <span id="s567">They'll kill them.</span> <span id="s568">And he was not sure about mom, but when we went back, like I said, that action was closed.</span> <span id="s569">I mean stopped, and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Were you all sort of fatalistic about this?</span> <span id="s571">Was it terrifying to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: It was terrifying.</span> <span id="s573">You didn't know what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s574">Some friends of my mother's he was high official, she had her parents, and they went down when the street went down, and he told that he'll be able to release them because he was a very, very high position, and he could never do anything about it.</span> <span id="s575">They took him.</span> <span id="s576">They started having lists and first I knew I was not on the list.</span> <span id="s577">One of my grandmother's sister was on the list, and we tried to get her out, and my friend told her to go, because there was no -- you couldn't support them.</span> <span id="s578">You couldn't do anything with them.</span> <span id="s579">Once they were on the list, the rations were cancelled.</span> <span id="s580">So, who could afford to feed them.</span> <span id="s581">So, they took her, and my grandmother had one brother and two sisters in large Ghetto.</span> <span id="s582">One of the sister-in-laws died, two children were evacuated, one uncle was evacuated, the girl finally , and she died there.</span> <span id="s583">The other aunt, they took them away and we never heard of them again.</span> <span id="s584">The woman, the last one's husband was either taken away or died, and she was the last one who was evacuated before our family was gone.</span> <span id="s585">So, they all were gone.</span> <span id="s586">I mean, there were relatives in other towns, but we never knew what happened to them, but those I knew until '43 what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Now, I want to know a little bit more to the organization of this Ghetto.</span> <span id="s588">I know there were Jewish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Well, the organization was the head of the large Ghetto was .</span> <span id="s590">Q: Did you have any contact with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: No, he slapped my mother's face once, because he thought she was peddling something on the street and he was going in his carriage and there was a peddlar and she ran into our building and my mother was working in the building and he ran after her and slapped her face.</span> <span id="s592">At one time I wanted to get a petition, when I had those abscesses, for some different job.</span> <span id="s593">I never got into him.</span> <span id="s594">I never had any contact with him.</span> <span id="s595">He had his own clique.</span> <span id="s596">His brother, we called Prince Joseph, after Napoleon's brother.</span> <span id="s597">They all had good apartments.</span> <span id="s598">They had special rations.</span> <span id="s599">They all wore high boots like the Germans.</span> <span id="s600">They all rode in those carriages with the horses, and he thought he was a king.</span> <span id="s601">The money was --the only money we could use in Ghetto were pictures on it.</span> <span id="s602">We called it .</span> <span id="s603">That was the only way you could buy anything.</span> <span id="s604">He liked the doctors, he didn't like the dentists, so the dentists were person non grata.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Your mother didn't practice dentistry at all in the large Ghetto?</span> <span id="s606">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: All right, we'll get to that.</span> <span id="s608">I'll let you finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: If someone displeased him, he would just send them out, either send them out on transport or if someone did something which was according to his rules not right, maybe abuses, they were assigned to the feces brigade.</span> <span id="s610">And this was the most horrid thing you ever saw.</span> <span id="s611">They would collect, there were cesspools, so they would collect the feces from the cesspool in wagons in special tanks.</span> <span id="s612">But those people were pulling those things, and they had to empty them somewhere in the suburbs of the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s613">I remember there was a young couple.</span> <span id="s614">I don't know what he did, and they punished him.</span> <span id="s615">She was a beautiful blonde and she used to pull that thing.</span> <span id="s616">They were covered with feces.</span> <span id="s617">Naturally a lot of those feces were full of disease, so those people never lasted too long.</span> <span id="s618">You probably know the landmark of the Ghetto was everybody carried a little canteen to work because we got our soup in it.</span> <span id="s619">So we all carried it.</span> <span id="s620">As a matter fact, I got as a birthday present, someone made one that was not made out of tin but made some nice metal so that it didn't have that tinny taste, because the soup would get soured in it.</span> <span id="s621">Even those people who pulled those feces wagons, they would walk around with their bowl or their canteens attached to their belts because somehow on their route they would stop and wherever and they would get their soup.</span> <span id="s622">So, as filthy and dirty and miserable as they were, they ate on the road.</span> <span id="s623">But those people really, this was like he punished them.</span> <span id="s624">This was worse punishment I think than being evacuated on the transports.</span> <span id="s625">I also had a hard time with grandfather when he was dying.</span> <span id="s626">We had cold water only.</span> <span id="s627">We had to pump the water downstairs to bring it up.</span> <span id="s628">And they had laundries, public laundries.</span> <span id="s629">You sent out your stuff, took three months, two months you got it back.</span> <span id="s630">Not that we had valuable things.</span> <span id="s631">They gave us things out when we came to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s632">Well, Grandfather was sick towards the end and he had uremia, and he had accidents, and in order to change the bed I had to pick him up and put him on another bed.</span> <span id="s633">We'd change the bed and finally when he died -- he wanted to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s634">He had some procaine (ph) and his cousin caught him and he was ready to take it, but anyway, he died.</span> <span id="s635">In order to bury him, one had to provide two clean sheets for a shroud.</span> <span id="s636">We had no clean sheets.</span> <span id="s637">So, I went to these friends of my mother's who lived in Lodz before the war, and there were several families there that they all lived in Lodz.</span> <span id="s638">And that was the one who lost their parents, and I said, could you lend me two sheets so I can bury Grandfather and we will either buy some on the Black Market later on, or we'll get our bundle and we'll give it back to you.</span> <span id="s639">She said, "No, I'm sorry, I don't have it."</span> <span id="s640">I was devastated.</span> <span id="s641">And finally the people next door who were new acquaintances, the ones who had lost the child, she knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s642">She said, "I hear you have a problem.</span> <span id="s643">Here are the two sheets."</span> <span id="s644">So, this is how we managed to bury him in clean sheets.</span> <span id="s645">This was towards the end of the war, and they felt that they are going to survive the war and they're going to have their linens and have everything else.</span> <span id="s646">They lost half of their family and they still couldn't understand that those things were not important.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: I was mentioning that as far as I understand it, there was a lot of organization in the large Ghetto.</span> <span id="s649">Cultural activities, little religious programs, theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: I have never attended any of it.</span> <span id="s651">I don't know anything much.</span> <span id="s652">There was a private library, and I used to go for books.</span> <span id="s653">The front was bordering the street which was closed.</span> <span id="s654">The main street of Lodz Ghetto had street cars going like in .</span> <span id="s655">No one lived in those buildings.</span> <span id="s656">I think they had factories, most of them.</span> <span id="s657">There was barbed wire.</span> <span id="s658">This was guarded by the Jewish policeman watching that no one should sneak out and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">That library, the private lending library was on that street, but I know we used to go through the back and stand in line and borrow books.</span> <span id="s660">That's the only thing which I had in terms of cultural events.</span> <span id="s661">As I said, I was there for two years, and we had to take care of the old people.</span> <span id="s662">We had to bring the rations, and bring the food and do the fire and bring the water, and bring the slops down.</span> <span id="s663">Everything was on my mother's and my back, and one time she had an infection in her finger, so she couldn't grab.</span> <span id="s664">She had an infection in her palm and she couldn't carry things.</span> <span id="s665">She would go with me to pick up the rations just to guard me and I was carrying it.</span> <span id="s666">I worked, and as I said, Saturdays I would go out, and I met this guy.</span> <span id="s667">I started going out with him on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s668">We would just walk, because he was taking care of his mother and sister-in-law and a child, and he was a policeman, but he was not doing anything how should I say, he didn't beat people.</span> <span id="s669">He was watching, I think he was a sergeant, but they call it in German " " that means people who kept the order.</span> <span id="s670">They were not the criminals and they were not the commander.</span> <span id="s671">Those were the thugs.</span> <span id="s672">They are the ones who are the messy guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: When you would take walks, what would you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: People very often, you saw people lying on the ground.</span> <span id="s675">They found bodies on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">The children, they used to sell , and there were children, there was a little chant the little children would sell , and three for one mark.</span> <span id="s677">This was almost like a Ghetto song, those little children selling.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Children were working.</span> <span id="s679">My mother was working in a factory where children were working.</span> <span id="s680">I don't know what jobs they had, sorting something putting something together.</span> <span id="s681">They were little children.</span> <span id="s682">And I remember once she told a story about a little boy and he said he saw a goose, but he said it in Jewish and he says I saw a gants, not something whole a gants, he meant a goose and he started flapping with his wing and trying to say what the goose was.</span> <span id="s683">And he saw a gants, and my mother said the eyes would dig because he saw an animal.</span> <span id="s684">Even the little children, the ones who were finally eventually were evacuated, but at one time they had little factories for them.</span> <span id="s685">Even they had to work to get a little soup.</span> <span id="s686">Life was -- there were wives who fought with husbands about food.</span> <span id="s687">The husbands would threaten the wives or steal.</span> <span id="s688">People would steal the food from each other.</span> <span id="s689">People would sell the bread for cigarettes and then they were starving.</span> <span id="s690">It was so difficult to live.</span> <span id="s691">Now, I was a young girl and I didn't have any clothing, and we used every piece of scrap of whatever we could do something to make something.</span> <span id="s692">When we first came in, they gave us some stuff, some linens, some pots and pans, because they had from other liquidated Ghettos, they would get the stuff in and when people were brought in, that was the organization.</span> <span id="s693">They would distribute some of the stuff.</span> <span id="s694">I remember we got this big grey shawl with fringes on it, full of holes.</span> <span id="s695">And I ripped the shawl, I took out the fringes and pieced the whole thing together.</span> <span id="s696">I think I made three hats for us, for mother, for grandmother and for me, because it was cold and some mittens.</span> <span id="s697">We grabbed things out of the Ghetto, Ghetto.</span> <span id="s698">Among other things there was a piece of fabric.</span> <span id="s699">I'll always remember it was an orange piece of fabric and I needed something.</span> <span id="s700">And it was not enough for a dress.</span> <span id="s701">I had a friend who was working with me and she was a dressmaker and she said find some wool.</span> <span id="s702">So we found -- I found some on the Black Market, some yarn, and she made me knit parts of the sleeves and the yoke and the turtleneck, and some trim on the skirt, she made like pockets, and I had a beautiful dress, I mean made out of very small piece of fabric and those scraps.</span> <span id="s703">And the Polish peasant women never wore coats, even working women, they wear those big plaid throws, I mean like big squares.</span> <span id="s704">They were square.</span> <span id="s705">So, I was with Mom, we bought this plaid thing and made a jacket for me, because you had to I needed some clothes.</span> <span id="s706">I was outgrowing what I had, and I needed something.</span> <span id="s707">We managed as I say, things from scraps.</span> <span id="s708">Every little scrap of wool, every piece of scrap of something, you pieced it.</span> <span id="s709">You bought pieces of wool and made a sweater.</span> <span id="s710">You're talking about people in Ghetto how short sighted they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">When I was working for that factory, the corset factory, we would get this was for the German population, and Germans would send in cut out pieces of brassieres, I mean they were all cut, and all the fittings and the little hooks and buttons, whatever, slides for the brassieres or if we did corsets there were stays and eyelets, and we had to count everything and package it in small loads so we would distribute it to the assembly line.</span> <span id="s712">I worked in the warehouse where we would distribute.</span> <span id="s713">We even measured thread.</span> <span id="s714">We gave them certain amount of thread so no one could steal anything.</span> <span id="s715">The guy who was in charge of the factory was a manufacturer before the war, and he felt that the factory has to be run in the correct order.</span> <span id="s716">There were times we had absolutely nothing to do.</span> <span id="s717">No shipment came.</span> <span id="s718">There was very little and the assembly line was working very slowly and they would come in and they needed a dozen buttons, a dozen stays and we would just give them to the assembly line, but the biggest work was when the shipments would come in.</span> <span id="s719">We had to count, like I say, every button and repackage it.</span> <span id="s720">So, the foreman of the factory used to say, "Whatever you're doing, just make believe you're working."</span> <span id="s721">So, we would have a book in the drawer and we'd knit under the table and on the table we would have button or stays open up a package and make believe we were counting or whatever.</span> <span id="s722">This guy would come in, you would have to hide from him because he did not believe, he could not bring himself to say, "Look girls, there is nothing to do."</span> <span id="s723">As long as the Germans don't come in and they don't catch you with it, he was petrified.</span> <span id="s724">When the time came for me to get transferred to the fields, I needed his release, and he wouldn't release.</span> <span id="s725">With all the connections I had to get to those fields, he didn't want to lose one of his workers.</span> <span id="s726">Finally, someone from our hometown, who was also director of a more important factory, he was a director of the uniforms, the coats for the German Army, he finally approached him and said, "There's a young girl here.</span> <span id="s727">She's sick.</span> <span id="s728">She needs some fresh air.</span> <span id="s729">This dust in the factory is killing her."</span> <span id="s730">I couldn't breath, I was having attacks of asthma.</span> <span id="s731">"Why don't you release her?"</span> <span id="s732">Finally, I got the release from him, but when I approached him he wouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s733">There were many people like this.</span> <span id="s734">They were so self important.</span> <span id="s735">They felt so important, and they were nobodies nothings.</span> <span id="s736">All of a sudden they became heads of factory or whatever.</span> <span id="s737">And Ghetto was one huge factory, starting from electronic equipment, uniforms, which was the most important things, boots, supplies for the Army, going down to the brassieres, hats, artificial flowers, brooms.</span> <span id="s738">And even those rag rugs, braided rugs which were made out of scraps.</span> <span id="s739">They would take torn sheets which they would get from various cities when the other towns or cities were liquidated like in .</span> <span id="s740">That group saw that the good stuff went to Germany or for the German settlers.</span> <span id="s741">The junk came back to Lodz Ghetto.</span> <span id="s742">Some of the stuff was torn, they were rags.</span> <span id="s743">They would dye them different colors and make braided rugs out of them.</span> <span id="s744">So, everybody was working and everybody produced something, and we produced and the Ghetto was getting food.</span> <span id="s745">There was no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: How were these people selected to be in positions of authority whether it was the police or the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: I don't know, connections, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Were there ever women in positions of authority?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s750">I think so, I don't know how many, mostly a men's society.</span> <span id="s751">The guy Kleeger, the one who was the head of the commando, he had a brother who's the most extremely decent guy, and she was a friend of my mother's from before the war, and he was in charge -- this is a specialty of empty containers.</span> <span id="s752">You see, if they brought containers to Ghetto, let's say they brought brown sugar or they brought flour or something, that department would scrape out the things and there was still food in it and they had to return to those things back to the Germans to refill it.</span> <span id="s753">So, he was in charge of the empty containers.</span> <span id="s754">This was -- he had a high position, but he felt that this was a position which in any way he's not jeopardizing anyone's life and anyone's position.</span> <span id="s755">He wanted to survive, and he survived and his wife, but this was his job, and one day I told you when the commander, his brother's hoodlums were coming into the building, one day he was passing our apartment building and he saw the guys were coming in to check, and he just walked in.</span> <span id="s756">My grandparents were home.</span> <span id="s757">He walked in and just sat down and talked to them.</span> <span id="s758">He was waiting for those guys to come and he wanted to chase them on their way.</span> <span id="s759">He felt they shouldn't anyway, he never said anything later, and they left the building and he later told my mother that he came in because my grandparents said "What was Simon doing here?</span> <span id="s760">He just came to visit us in the middle of the day?"</span> <span id="s761">He came, he wanted to prevent any scenes with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s762">As I said, he was the most decent guy in the world.</span> <span id="s763">His brother survived, I think, either brother or nephew.</span> <span id="s764">He was hiding.</span> <span id="s765">Those people survived that lived in Israel, and we saw them.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">There were a lot of decent people.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: There was also corruption?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: I think there was corruption.</span> <span id="s769">There had to be corruption.</span> <span id="s770">There had to be corruption.</span> <span id="s771">You see, in large Ghetto I was such a low level of living that I really don't know what was going on, but we know -- the whole administration and when I read this book about Lodz Ghetto, one time he had theaters here and orphanages, he had schools, he was making the famous speech, give me your children, he felt justified in sending out the children because maybe he can save some people.</span> <span id="s772">When finally it came to his evacuation, they gave him a special passenger car.</span> <span id="s773">He didn't go in a cattle car, and he expected that they were going to take him on an inspection of camp and he's going to help them in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s774">And there are three theories what happened to him.</span> <span id="s775">One was that some people from Lodz Ghetto killed him when he arrived.</span> <span id="s776">Some of them he was gassed or some German killed him.</span> <span id="s777">So, we don't really know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s778">Now, once they evacuated us, the evacuation --see what happened, they were having more and more lists and more and more evacuations and they would grab people on the streets.</span> <span id="s779">I was afraid to go anyplace.</span> <span id="s780">And I had some money coming to me and some vegetables coming to me because the vegetables all of a sudden were ripening, and I was afraid to go by myself to the place that I was working.</span> <span id="s781">And this friend of mine, the policeman, he said he'll take me, because at least we hope they won't grab me on the street when I'm being escorted.</span> <span id="s782">At that time, we knew something was going to happen, so we made this big out of some fabric back packs and packed all our valuables and some food.</span> <span id="s783">That was sitting ready to be taken in case they evacuate us.</span> <span id="s784">We never knew in the last few weeks of August, this was the beginning of August '44.</span> <span id="s785">He was late, and that in a way helped me and Mom be together, because by the time he arrived, they took us by that time they just blew the whistles everybody out.</span> <span id="s786">That's it.</span> <span id="s787">So, we went down, and downstairs he was there.</span> <span id="s788">He just came.</span> <span id="s789">If he would have been 15 20 minutes before I would have left and I would have never been with my family.</span> <span id="s790">I would have gone with him.</span> <span id="s791">So, he helped us to go to the train station and that's where they put us in the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s792">There were about 80 people in the cattle car and one bucket, one slop bucket.</span> <span id="s793">I don't even know if there was anything to drink.</span> <span id="s794">We all had something to eat, I mean whatever we grabbed.</span> <span id="s795">As I said, we had an extra bread which we never allowed ourselves to eat the whole bread.</span> <span id="s796">We're saving it because what happens tomorrow.</span> <span id="s797">We were so conditioned to it that you have to save something for tomorrow.</span> <span id="s798">And Grandma was embarrassed to go in the bucket.</span> <span id="s799">She couldn't -- and we tried to cover her with the coat and so on.</span> <span id="s800">People were dying on the train.</span> <span id="s801">This was one night when I --</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: I'm sorry to interrupt you but did you have any idea where people were being sent?</span> <span id="s803">A: No, there were all kinds of rumors but no one knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Had you heard about this before?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: We didn't hear of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s806">We heard about bad things happening, but the only time that I knew something was happening when those boys told us that the people were taken to cattle cars, the old people and the children, and those boys were never heard of again.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Back track, one of my friends was hung in Lodz Ghetto.</span> <span id="s808">He was found, he was trying to escape from camp.</span> <span id="s809">And this was a boy I saw him when I was 15, I gave him my photograph, and then somebody told me that he was hung, and they found my photograph with him.</span> <span id="s810">Since that time, I was going up the ladder.</span> <span id="s811">I had boyfriends who were much older than him, and I became obsessed to get that photograph back, because I felt if that boy felt that way that he had my photograph, it was taken when I was 12 or 13, before the war.</span> <span id="s812">I finally tracked that photograph down and had it, and I told you that the people from Ghetto some of them were hung.</span> <span id="s813">The ones who were in charge of the Ghetto at one time, which I mention it in my book.</span> <span id="s814">So, when we got -- what were we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: The cattle cars, going to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Yes, the cattle cars, going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s817">We arrived at Auschwitz, and it was dark in the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s818">All of the sudden the light was kind of blinding.</span> <span id="s819">They lined us all up in fives.</span> <span id="s820">We had my grandmother with us.</span> <span id="s821">They told us to leave this stuff whatever we had.</span> <span id="s822">I just had like a little lunch bag, and I had my photographs there, and I had some money there, and a couple of rings and things like this.</span> <span id="s823">Mother, I think had probably instruments.</span> <span id="s824">If anything, aside from anything else she had was instruments.</span> <span id="s825">She had a red cross arm band, because in Ghetto everybody was identified by something.</span> <span id="s826">They had caps and they had bands, and they had different hats with different i.d.'s and so on.</span> <span id="s827">was big on uniforms but couldn't afford uniforms, so he was giving people hats.</span> <span id="s828">As we were approaching , there were a lot of Polish couple, like trustees working there, the ramp, and I didn't realize until later what this Pole did.</span> <span id="s829">He saved our lives.</span> <span id="s830">What he did, is pushed me into the line first and separated me from my mother and my grandmother and put some people in between.</span> <span id="s831">Then he put my mother in, again, put some people in between, and then put my grandmother.</span> <span id="s832">He knew where she was going.</span> <span id="s833">He wasn't sure where my mother was going.</span> <span id="s834">He knew where I am going.</span> <span id="s835">And the family was together.</span> <span id="s836">Very often they's say let me go with that loved one and they would oblige.</span> <span id="s837">So, naturally they send me in and then he asked my mother where she is going, and she saw the sign and she said I am going to work.</span> <span id="s838">The sign was , so she said I'm going to work.</span> <span id="s839">He looked at her, clapped her on her behind and let her go.</span> <span id="s840">And naturally, they send Grandmother to the left, and my mother had nightmares because it was so confusing that we didn't have a chance to look what happened to her.</span> <span id="s841">It was so fast, and so unbelievably confusing, and I think that the Pole by separating us, knew what he was doing and he saved us, the two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Was there a general hysteria?</span> <span id="s843">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: People just weren't --?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: There's a by word of Auschwitz "shnell (ph)" Everything they did you had to do fast, fast, fast.</span> <span id="s846">You had no time to regroup, you had no time think, you had no time to do anything.</span> <span id="s847">Get off the trains, line up, fast.</span> <span id="s848">That's all you could hear "Shnell, shnell," When they finally regrouped us on the other side of the table, again they formed us in fives.</span> <span id="s849">There were groups of prisoner girls, and they started driving us, practically driving us, fast, running, and while we were running, we encountered a group of subhumans, to us at that time they were subhumans, they wore tops of men's pajamas, but they were not the regular prison garb.</span> <span id="s850">They all had their hair shaved.</span> <span id="s851">They had the wooden lace shoes on.</span> <span id="s852">Their doppers (ph) were plastic or fabric or whatever, or no, they were wood sabits (ph) like Dutch shoes, because it was muddy around.</span> <span id="s853">There were sent in another direction, and they started yelling give me your bread, give me something, they'll take it away it from you.</span> <span id="s854">Give it to us, and they were supervised by the Germans, but basically they were smacking them, and we were shocked seeing that group, and naturally wouldn't give them the bread.</span> <span id="s855">I mean, God forbid, we had to hide the bread for us.</span> <span id="s856">We'll need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">And finally they brought us into an area where the baths were.</span> <span id="s858">This was a real legitimate bath, a processing area.</span> <span id="s859">By that time it was getting dark, and they warned us to turn in all the gold and all the diamonds and all the valuables that we have because they'll be taken away.</span> <span id="s860">And rumors were going that they were going to do very personal inspections.</span> <span id="s861">Well, Mom had a bridge with two diamonds in.</span> <span id="s862">She had it made in such a way that she could take it out.</span> <span id="s863">The diamonds were taken out of the things and she had it in her mouth.</span> <span id="s864">This was like a final ration in case we need anything.</span> <span id="s865">And I was very upset.</span> <span id="s866">I got panicky and I said I don't want to give these Germans absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s867">Let's bury them.</span> <span id="s868">And I also had a couple of rings, old rings.</span> <span id="s869">And in the dark, my mother says "Are you sure?"</span> <span id="s870">And I said Mom, I don't want you to give it to them and they are going to look in your mouth and they will find it and they will get, and I don't want them to have it.</span> <span id="s871">And there we put into the ground, ground it with our heels, and got rid of the diamonds and got rid of the gold.</span> <span id="s872">There were a couple of other things they took, but this, it's like a feeling, like great we didn't give it to them.</span> <span id="s873">Anyway, they took us to this shed --.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: What happened to the diamonds?</span> <span id="s875">A: She ground them into the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Was that the end of the story with the diamonds?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yes, but we wouldn't give it to the Germans.</span> <span id="s878">That was fun --, when I think about it now, this was fun, because they didn't get it.</span> <span id="s879">Maybe somebody eventually found it, maybe not.</span> <span id="s880">I don't care.</span> <span id="s881">They were sewed in a little plastic thing -- well, we didn't have plastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Anyway, they took us to the shed.</span> <span id="s883">We had to get undressed, get the clothes off.</span> <span id="s884">They took everything away from us and they sent us to the sauna and lucky for me, I don't know why, they didn't cut my hair.</span> <span id="s885">They did shave our hair and they give us tattoos.</span> <span id="s886">It was very late at night by that time.</span> <span id="s887">They were getting a lot of transports.</span> <span id="s888">Rumor was that they wanted us to -- eventually would have gassed us, but they were so busy, the crematorium was so busy that they felt maybe they can do something with us, the able bodied people.</span> <span id="s889">And, they gave us some clothes.</span> <span id="s890">I wound up with a skirt, my mother wound up with a mini, so we switched and the wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s891">Then the last act was they painted a stripe, a red stripe down our backs and that broke me up.</span> <span id="s892">Talking about panic, and we walked naked in front of the guys, in front of the Germans and in front of Polish copos.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Somehow, I took this whole thing without shedding a tear, but when they painted that stripe on my back, I started crying.</span> <span id="s894">Again, one of the Poles walked over to me, hugged me and said, "Don't worry, you'll survive.</span> <span id="s895">You'll be okay."</span> <span id="s896">I mean, I spoke Polish at that time fluently, and I was a pretty girl at that time, and he felt sorry for me so he said, "Don't worry, you'll make it, just don't cry."</span> <span id="s897">So, they sent us out, by now it's late at night.</span> <span id="s898">They didn't have a barrack for us.</span> <span id="s899">They'll send us to the latrine.</span> <span id="s900">I don't know if you know what the latrine in Auschwitz looked.</span> <span id="s901">They were concrete benches with holes that could accommodate 500 people at once.</span> <span id="s902">There were benches on both sides and then in the middle there was a long bench from back to back there were holes with a pit underneath.</span> <span id="s903">And that's how we were using as toilets.</span> <span id="s904">Well, that's where we spent the night, in the toilets.</span> <span id="s905">Well, I don't have to repeat Auschwitz stories.</span> <span id="s906">We stood up from 5:00 in the morning or 6:00 in the morning and then they put us in the barracks and we had 14 people, 12 to 14 people to one six by six or seven by seven bed.</span> <span id="s907">They gave us a can of whatever they gave us was in a metal can, no spoon, no nothing, and five people had to eat out of it, so everybody's watching how many swallows you did of that.</span> <span id="s908">And one of the first nights there, once we got into the barrack, they were burning, the crematorium was going night and day.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: You knew what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: We didn't.</span> <span id="s911">But someone woke up and those barracks, like you see in the Museum how they look, they had little windows on top and someone must have woken up and saw this red glow in the sky and someone started crying all of a sudden 1,000 women started crying and people who were in charge of it, group of Hungarian girls, they started yelling to be quiet because the Germans would come in and so forth.</span> <span id="s912">We still didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s913">We knew something bad had happened, but we didn't know about the crematoriums, what's happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: You didn't know what the crematoriums were?</span> <span id="s915">How many people were in your barrack?</span> <span id="s916">A: About a thousand.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: From all over?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: This was probably mostly Polish group run by the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s919">The girls who were in charge had short skirts and they for some reason they all like polka dotted blouses and they had their hair.</span> <span id="s920">They cut my hair some more.</span> <span id="s921">They didn't like my having hair, so they shaved it a little -- they didn't shave it, but they cut it completely.</span> <span id="s922">And Mom developed, we were afraid, because she developed from the wooden shoes a wound on her ankle and that was festering, and two weeks later they had the selection, luckily they put us through a shower again, and the paper bandage fell off, so when they selected her, they didn't see her with the bandage.</span> <span id="s923">As much as that was festering and messy, they didn't do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Was your day fairly controlled?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Extremely.</span> <span id="s926">We had to get up, I don't know, 5:00 or 6:00.</span> <span id="s927">It was cold in the morning.</span> <span id="s928">You stood on that for hours.</span> <span id="s929">They counted, and counted first from the barrack, then they counted from the section, then they counted -- they had to count the whole camp through and had to tally.</span> <span id="s930">If someone died, they had to tally.</span> <span id="s931">If someone died, they had to tally.</span> <span id="s932">If they couldn't find someone, they were looking for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: This is the whole camp, not just your barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: No, no, they started with counting the barrack, then there was a whole section, then they had to have it to one person, and if they couldn't find her they were looking for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Somebody was maybe hiding.</span> <span id="s936">Maybe someone died, maybe someone couldn't get up.</span> <span id="s937">It started over and over and over.</span> <span id="s938">And the morning was cold.</span> <span id="s939">Then they would give us five minutes in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s940">Sometimes they put us in one of the other barracks was like a washroom.</span> <span id="s941">I don't know how many spigots, but again, it was fast, fast, fast.</span> <span id="s942">There was no toilet paper, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s943">You couldn't wash, you couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s944">If you managed to put your hand under the spigot and get a little water, they gave us something in the morning, I don't know if they gave us bread at night or in the morning -- no, I think we used to get the bread at night and save a piece to have it for the morning, and they gave us some soup during the day and some kind of a liquid during the day, in the morning.</span> <span id="s945">Once we were standing in the , and one of the girls, whatever she had she had some kind of a jacket with patch pockets, and I said, "Gee, that would be nice to have for bread."</span> <span id="s946">And she ripped out the pocket and said, "Here."</span> <span id="s947">She knew my mother from her town, because we would save the piece of bread to have it for the morning, and you were afraid to put it down.</span> <span id="s948">You slept on top of the bread so God forbid someone shouldn't steal if from you.</span> <span id="s949">So, that pocket was a great thing to put the piece of bread.</span> <span id="s950">I mean, you know, such little things can mean so much to you.</span> <span id="s951">Anyway, luckily for us we only stayed only two weeks there.</span> <span id="s952">This was hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: No.</span> <span id="s955">Yes, I offered -- I couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s956">Mom was doing something, checking some things.</span> <span id="s957">You know they asked who was a medical thing, so she would go down, and they made us sit in those beds and you couldn't lay down.</span> <span id="s958">You just had to sit.</span> <span id="s959">Fourteen people in one of those platforms.</span> <span id="s960">Well, I couldn't sleep at night with all the noise and at night they had the slop bucket at the door and somebody had to go, they had to go to the slop bucket and when the slop bucket was full, had to be taken to the latrine.</span> <span id="s961">Well, I volunteered.</span> <span id="s962">And one of the escort from one of the other girls, from one of the workers, but they felt themselves above carrying a slop bucket, and at least I could get some fresh air.</span> <span id="s963">Walk, when the bucket was full, I could go walk out.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Did you see anything strange when you'd walk out at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Nothing, it was just dead.</span> <span id="s966">Nothing was seen, no one was walking, except as I said, figures taking the slop bucket.</span> <span id="s967">That's about all.</span> <span id="s968">No one was allowed to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s969">But, I was waiting for that occasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: It just sounds sort of eerie.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: It was very hot in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s972">This was still August.</span> <span id="s973">So during the day, it got hot, and in our camp they would send us out again for another count, and by that time it was hot, and we stood there for hours until they tallied.</span> <span id="s974">It was a way of torture.</span> <span id="s975">They were just cruel and people were fainting and people were dying in the lines and you were not allowed to help them.</span> <span id="s976">You had to leave them the way they were.</span> <span id="s977">If someone passed out, they passed out.</span> <span id="s978">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: You went out a night, did you see the crematorium flames or smell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: There was a small and there was dust, but we didn't -- there was some white stuff floating, but we didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s981">The first night the glow was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s982">And we were afraid, I don't know, we were afraid to do anything.</span> <span id="s983">You were not allowed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Once I was in the bathroom, maybe I wasn't moving fast enough, there was this famous Erma , she later came to Bergen-Belsen, blonde, gorgeous cool and she had this big whip and she smacked me with a whip.</span> <span id="s985">Because as I said, the whole ward was fast, whatever you did.</span> <span id="s986">You had to line up fast, you had to go to the bathroom fast.</span> <span id="s987">They gave you five minutes in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s988">Five minutes maybe not even five minutes to get some water to wash up, wash up, maybe you could wet your face maybe take a sip of water and wet your hands.</span> <span id="s989">That's about all.</span> <span id="s990">Conditions were awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: How were the other guards, the copos, your block elders?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s993">It's hard to say.</span> <span id="s994">They lived very nicely, especially the block elders.</span> <span id="s995">They had little rooms with quilts and they had little stoves.</span> <span id="s996">And one with the block elder she would help and then they had a whole bunch of lesser girls and -- our group was Hungarian so there was a communication gap.</span> <span id="s997">Some of them spoke German, some of us spoke German and some of us didn't.</span> <span id="s998">I didn't speak too well German, but I understood.</span> <span id="s999">So, you were afraid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Were they nasty?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Sometimes, like I said with the hair.</span> <span id="s1002">They couldn't stand the fact that I had hair.</span> <span id="s1003">I mean I didn't.</span> <span id="s1004">I had short hair, but they couldn't stand that.</span> <span id="s1005">They didn't have a razor, so they clipped it and said that's to prevent lice.</span> <span id="s1006">Because they saw some workers working on the roof, again Polish workers.</span> <span id="s1007">I talked to them once.</span> <span id="s1008">I don't know how I managed to say something, and I said I could use a stick, and he said fine, tomorrow we'll work on the roof and I'll make you a stick for the soup.</span> <span id="s1009">It's like a tongue depressor and he dropped that stick for me, so I could dig into the soup.</span> <span id="s1010">They didn't like it.</span> <span id="s1011">So, the following day, they called me down to the bottom of the thing and said, "We have to cut the hair."</span> <span id="s1012">So, they cut some more.</span> <span id="s1013">I had no choice.</span> <span id="s1014">Because except for the block elders and their assistants the rest of them had shaved heads.</span> <span id="s1015">How they got there, how they became them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1016">There was a woman who came along, she was a dentist from Poland, and she kind of asked my mother and said, you know, I can get you a job and so on and she was hinting that my mother has anything she should give it to her and she could arrange for her to get a job as a dentist.</span> <span id="s1017">At that time we didn't have anything, and my mother was upset.</span> <span id="s1018">She said, if I had the diamond, I could have given her the diamond.</span> <span id="s1019">I could have gotten a job.</span> <span id="s1020">Lucky for us, we didn't have the diamonds and they sent us out to Bergen- Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Why don't you tell me how that came about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: About two weeks after we were in Auschwitz, they lined up, had another selection.</span> <span id="s1023">They took us to the showers, gave us some clothes, and they took aware our clothes.</span> <span id="s1024">I mean if I had a little -- I had a little skirt and a tank top, they took the skirt away.</span> <span id="s1025">The tank top was so short, I had a ribbon in the tank top and I had to tie it between my legs otherwise my whole behind was showing.</span> <span id="s1026">And they ran us out, and again they had a selection and they were supposed to send us out.</span> <span id="s1027">Then something happened, the trains were not there, and they put us in some temporary barrack.</span> <span id="s1028">The following day, they ran another selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">They gave us a bath, and they put us on the train.</span> <span id="s1030">This was the time I really don't know if Auschwitz had two stations or not because this is the only time and I went back to Auschwitz, I remember, we went through the main camp of Auschwitz, because we were in and this was, I saw the red buildings, the permanent buildings.</span> <span id="s1031">I saw the band playing.</span> <span id="s1032">So, I had a feeling they had some other station in Auschwitz proper which they loaded us.</span> <span id="s1033">They unloaded the cars somewhere else, and they put us there.</span> <span id="s1034">They put us in cattle cars again.</span> <span id="s1035">They give us a piece a bread and a piece of cheese.</span> <span id="s1036">There was one water bucket with water, and there was one slop bucket, and they put us on the trains.</span> <span id="s1037">I think we were there either two nights or three nights, and one night they stopped somewhere and they brought a fresh bucket of water, and assigned someone to distribute the water.</span> <span id="s1038">Brought a little cup and we were supposed to have a sip.</span> <span id="s1039">One woman got so frenzied, she grabbed her shoe and dipped it in there and drank from the shoe.</span> <span id="s1040">When they give us the clothes, by that time, I've got those laced up shoes with wooden soles.</span> <span id="s1041">One was white and one was black, and I had this men's shirt, long flannel thing, blue satin, significant later, I'll tell you about that story.</span> <span id="s1042">We stayed, and as I said the train was on and off and on and off.</span> <span id="s1043">At night it would stop.</span> <span id="s1044">I remember once we were next side there were real cattle making cattle noises.</span> <span id="s1045">This was an absolute nightmare.</span> <span id="s1046">Later on when I had my typhous fever, all I had I kept on saying, take the train out of my head, get the train out of my head.</span> <span id="s1047">That's all I could hear is that.</span> <span id="s1048">It took me years before I wanted to take a train anyplace, because even when I was in Europe and we traveled later, I was very reluctant to take a train.</span> <span id="s1049">We finally arrived at Bergen-Belsen about maybe the third day.</span> <span id="s1050">All the passing and stopping we passed, I think, Dresden.</span> <span id="s1051">We saw someone tried to climb up.</span> <span id="s1052">We could see the bombed out cities and we were very happy to see those bombed out cities.</span> <span id="s1053">I think it must have been the third day.</span> <span id="s1054">We felt that another night on the train we will completely lose our identity and it was confusing.</span> <span id="s1055">We were getting confused without food, without drink, and with the total darkness for so long, no knowing where we were going, what we're doing.</span> <span id="s1056">Anyway, they took us, we came to Bergen- Belsen, and until that time Bergen-Belsen was not a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1057">They had various camps of various entities, prisoner of war camp, but there was no camp concentration camp as such.</span> <span id="s1058">Again, they asked people who can't walk who would like to go by truck, and I think one or two people who were very sick, they went.</span> <span id="s1059">Otherwise, my mother with the bad leg, she would not go on the truck.</span> <span id="s1060">She was afraid, because we knew by now, by that time, when you are sick something bad is going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s1061">We finally got into the main camp.</span> <span id="s1062">It was a long, long street.</span> <span id="s1063">The front of the street, the beginning of the street, there was administration places, there was a bath, there was a little crematorium which they could burn two bodies.</span> <span id="s1064">But this was done for bodies.</span> <span id="s1065">It was never done to use it for killing people.</span> <span id="s1066">If people died, they would use it.</span> <span id="s1067">They gave us a bath and we put our clothes in a little basket, and when we walked out from the other side of the bath, we got the clothes.</span> <span id="s1068">They marched us down to the end of the street of the town, the very end of the camp, and there was this big tent that could accommodate about 1,000 people.</span> <span id="s1069">It was clean.</span> <span id="s1070">We all got a blanket each.</span> <span id="s1071">On the floor of the tent was wooden shavings, bales of wooden shavings, clean, never used.</span> <span id="s1072">There as a latrine in the back right under the guards tower, big pits and there was a couple pieces of wood where you could kind of lean against, but you could use it any time you wanted.</span> <span id="s1073">There was a wooden trough with pipe.</span> <span id="s1074">We could use the water any time we wanted.</span> <span id="s1075">They nominated one lady, she was from Germany, she spoke German, as camp director, and her assistant, she was originally from Germany, so they spoke fluently German.</span> <span id="s1076">They counted us once a day.</span> <span id="s1077">This camp is located on the , so it's like heather.</span> <span id="s1078">At that time there was fields in back of us, later on they build more and more and more but at that time it was just us and the fields.</span> <span id="s1079">So, we could sit in the sun.</span> <span id="s1080">We could drink when we wanted, we could go to the toilet when we wanted.</span> <span id="s1081">Even at night, if you wanted to go to the toilet, -- if the guards heard something going on, he would put the light on, the spot light on, if he heard a movement.</span> <span id="s1082">So, maybe they eliminated you when you were using the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">When the girls were sitting there, they would just look.</span> <span id="s1084">After a while, you lose all inhibitions, and if they want to look, let them look.</span> <span id="s1085">That's what we're going to do.</span> <span id="s1086">At that time we didn't have any doctors so the first day, the second day, they brought a big chest with some first aid things and some pills, some equipment.</span> <span id="s1087">Mom became the doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">There was a head dentist, I don't know his name, but he was until the very end, a very, very decent guy.</span> <span id="s1089">So, one of the first questions he asked me is "How come your head is shaved?"</span> <span id="s1090">They couldn't understand that.</span> <span id="s1091">There were SS but they had no idea about the horrors of Auschwitz or the other camps.</span> <span id="s1092">They were just half way decent people in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1093">The food we got was paradise next to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1094">Fairly decent soup, we got some kind of coffee in the morning and a nice piece of bread and at night very often they had something, a piece of cheese or some artificial jam or something and Sundays we'd get red cabbage and there was some meat in it and potatoes with jackets and this was the first few weeks.</span> <span id="s1095">The next few days they put another tent up.</span> <span id="s1096">We got a big group of Hungarian women another tent up.</span> <span id="s1097">So, about that time there was 3,000 people in that compound, because there were other groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: All coming from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1100">I think they were coming from Auschwitz because the other ones were Hungarians.</span> <span id="s1101">Can I tell you something interesting about -- by that time, we didn't have a doctor and they brought a bunch of women from the Warsaw uprising, gentile women.</span> <span id="s1102">They were not with us, but they brought one of the doctors to us to work with us and one of the women somehow when there was another nurse and I and my mother and people were coming in with various ailments, there was one lady who was from Germany, had lost her husband and child.</span> <span id="s1103">She was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1104">Her husband was Jewish, and she kind of started becoming administrator to the very end.</span> <span id="s1105">She was the administrator of the hospital.</span> <span id="s1106">As a matter of fact, we saw her in the United States.</span> <span id="s1107">She survived.</span> <span id="s1108">So, we would sleep -- it was so cold, but we would sleep, this Polish doctor, and Lisa and my mother and I would take one blanket and put it underneath us on the shavings and would cover ourselves with the three other blankets.</span> <span id="s1109">It was much warmer.</span> <span id="s1110">And the body head kept us going.</span> <span id="s1111">It was getting cold.</span> <span id="s1112">By that time, I think my mother started looking at some teeth.</span> <span id="s1113">I mean, checking, also everything on the floor, we had no place to do but, one day we got notified and some people approached Mom and the other women and a few other ones that this is Yom Kippur and the Hungarians are going to have a service and we are invited.</span> <span id="s1114">After dark come in one by one and come in, sneak in.</span> <span id="s1115">So, one by one, it was very dark, and you know they closed the camp.</span> <span id="s1116">Except for the towers, there was no one in camp.</span> <span id="s1117">They would close it up, all the Germans would just disappear at darkness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">And we all hide under the blankets.</span> <span id="s1119">We wrapped ourselves in blankets and quietly walked into the tent.</span> <span id="s1120">They lined up the shavings in such a way they were like benches.</span> <span id="s1121">In the very front they made a out of the shavings covered with blanket.</span> <span id="s1122">How they got a candle, I do not know, but they had a tiny little candle.</span> <span id="s1123">There as a young girl and an elderly woman and they sang the whole out of memory.</span> <span id="s1124">And they sung, and they warned us please do not cry, please do not wail, please do not make a sound.</span> <span id="s1125">Don't sing, don't do anything, just be quiet, because the Germans would have shot all of us.</span> <span id="s1126">I tell you, this was one, even the Polish woman, she was sitting there with the tears running down her eyes, this Polish doctor.</span> <span id="s1127">We all sat, and until today I go to services and when I hear the chant, I see that scene because it was eerie.</span> <span id="s1128">Can you imagine, by that time there must have been 1,500 women there, like ghosts sitting in the gray blankets listening to the service, and then again, they let us out one by one, two by two, please don't say anything.</span> <span id="s1129">Don't talk when you walk, just sneak into your own tent.</span> <span id="s1130">This was unbelievable, the faith, and as I said we all took chances by attending that service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Since you were not particularly religious growing up, how did the part of that service make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Unbelievable because I knew -- let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s1133">We had a record of one of the famous cantors home so I have heard I don't think I ever went to services, because this was such an Orthodox synagogue, so I couldn't go maybe when I was little kid they took me, Grandfather took me, but I never went.</span> <span id="s1134">But I always heard this record, because my father liked that cantor and he had this record.</span> <span id="s1135">And I used to play with the record player, so I was very much aware of that chant, and I knew it.</span> <span id="s1136">I knew the melody, and I knew that this was something very, very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Was there a special sense of solidarity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Solidarity, feeling of something, hope.</span> <span id="s1139">To do something like this in such circumstances was unbelievable, especially after Auschwitz where we were so controlled and here we could attend this service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: About the camp, were you isolated from all these other groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1142">Well, the way the camp was done was like I said, wa one long street and there were various sub camps on various sides.</span> <span id="s1143">We were aware of several of them, and later on I was aware of more of them.</span> <span id="s1144">One was called the stern camp and one was called the diamond camp, and those were the people from Holland and Belgium.</span> <span id="s1145">The rumor --they lived with the families at that time.</span> <span id="s1146">That's when the children came in.</span> <span id="s1147">Rumor was that they paid a lot of money to the Germans to bribe them in terms of giving them diamonds and gold and money, so when they evacuated them, they promised that they'll be kept separate and they'll be kept with the families, and they'll not be destroyed.</span> <span id="s1148">Eventually, they separated them.</span> <span id="s1149">They sent the parents out and the children were kept and I'll tell you about the children camp a little bit later.</span> <span id="s1150">They started bringing more and more people to our section, our compound.</span> <span id="s1151">It's getting crowded.</span> <span id="s1152">One day the tents blew off.</span> <span id="s1153">There was a big storm and wind and just the tents collapsed.</span> <span id="s1154">So, they put us somewhere temporary, and for a so called hospital they build a little tent in a corner and the rest of the people were in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1155">And that's the first time I saw myself.</span> <span id="s1156">Those barracks had windows.</span> <span id="s1157">It was just a temporary measure until they could build some more places for us.</span> <span id="s1158">I walked one day, and I saw this person walking without hair and wearing this crazy blue striped dress, and I knew that this original model, there's only one.</span> <span id="s1159">No one else has this copy of that.</span> <span id="s1160">And I couldn't believe that this was me, and I stood there and I looked at my reflection an I touched my face and I touched my hair.</span> <span id="s1161">I couldn't believe -- I mean I was like a little baby, like you show a baby a picture and he says that's me.</span> <span id="s1162">That's the way I was.</span> <span id="s1163">I couldn't believe that's me.</span> <span id="s1164">I looked at the dress and said no there's no other one, that's me.</span> <span id="s1165">I'm the only one.</span> <span id="s1166">It was a shocking experience to see yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: How long had it been since you had seen yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: This was after Yom Kippur, probably two months or so.</span> <span id="s1169">It had to be in October because I don't know exactly when Yom Kippur took place, but this was shortly afterward when the tents were blown down.</span> <span id="s1170">So, then one of the people who one of the tasks was one of my friend Alena who went to school with me, her mother was a pediatrician before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">During the war, the beginning of a war, she was run over by a truck, so her face -- she was never a pretty women, but her face was damaged, crooked and stuff like this.</span> <span id="s1172">Well, she became a doctor, and they sent another one, Doctor Annie.</span> <span id="s1173">She was a woman born in Russian, went to medical school in Russia, married a French diplomat and she lived in Germany.</span> <span id="s1174">She was Jewish, but she lived in Germany before Hitler, because he was a French diplomat.</span> <span id="s1175">She was a socialite.</span> <span id="s1176">She never practiced medicine, but this was our other doctor.</span> <span id="s1177">By that time they moved us again.</span> <span id="s1178">They build some barracks and they built a so-called hospital.</span> <span id="s1179">We were moved like three times.</span> <span id="s1180">So, this was when Schnabbles (ph) started coming in.</span> <span id="s1181">We had one big room where the patients stayed in the bunk, and one corner we had the staff, and by that time they brought more nurses, must have been about six nurses, seven nurses and two doctors, my girlfriend Alena was a nurse.</span> <span id="s1182">My mother was there.</span> <span id="s1183">On the one window we had this out patient clinic and in the back was a little tiny room and it was a dental office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Excuse me, this is completely separate from the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: They had access to it.</span> <span id="s1186">It was part of the camp, but this was a separate little building.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">That's when we started seeing the two I don't know what you call it, the German -- they were like medial corps men, or something.</span> <span id="s1188">One was a decent guy, his name was Fisher.</span> <span id="s1189">And he liked to grab the girls' boobs.</span> <span id="s1190">So, we gave him a name of Fisher Tapper.</span> <span id="s1191">Tapper in Jewish is to tap, to grab it, and he liked to grab whenever he could when no one else was looking.</span> <span id="s1192">The other one was obnoxious.</span> <span id="s1193">He was a young fellow and we called him the pig, so I don't know his name.</span> <span id="s1194">And Doctor Schnabbles started coming in.</span> <span id="s1195">He was an elderly man, according to rumors again, he was a nose and ear man.</span> <span id="s1196">He was checking what patients and what cases we have.</span> <span id="s1197">One of the first patients which he started doing something with, was a woman came on the transport, had a compound fracture of her tibia.</span> <span id="s1198">The skin was broken, the bone was sticking out.</span> <span id="s1199">It was a horror.</span> <span id="s1200">They put some kind of a metal frame around it and she had to be operated on.</span> <span id="s1201">So, he decided -- first of all, it was cool.</span> <span id="s1202">He never would take off his coat.</span> <span id="s1203">He did all his surgeries in his coat.</span> <span id="s1204">He decided to set the leg.</span> <span id="s1205">Well, he was not very successful.</span> <span id="s1206">So, the pediatrician opened up her mouth and said, "Doctor, don't you think you should do this and that?"</span> <span id="s1207">Well, that was the end of her.</span> <span id="s1208">She was ugly as it is, he didn't like it with the scars and all on her face, but that put her in disfavor.</span> <span id="s1209">We had two guys were watching, he tried to set the leg.</span> <span id="s1210">He never did.</span> <span id="s1211">The woman was crippled.</span> <span id="s1212">She survived the war, I think, but she was in the hospital with us all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: So, the first time he started setting that leg, it never took.</span> <span id="s1215">Well, Schnabble was looking always for patients, what he could operate on.</span> <span id="s1216">He was always checking what we have.</span> <span id="s1217">At that time, our staff consisted of Lisa, who the director of the hospital.</span> <span id="s1218">We had a scribe because they wanted reports.</span> <span id="s1219">How many patients were admitted, what they were coming in for, what sicknesses we had and stuff like this.</span> <span id="s1220">There must have been six or seven nurses, and then we had two orderly ladies.</span> <span id="s1221">We even had like a little toilet in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Those two women had to take the stuff out, but we had like a little outhouse attached to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1223">I don't remember what we had later, but that one I knew we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: How many doctors were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: At that time, they took the Polish woman away, there was my friend Alena, Doctor and Doctor Annie, the Russian woman, who didn't know much about medicine, but she was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: How many of the nurses really had any medical training?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Very few.</span> <span id="s1228">What I had was like a practical nurse whatever I picked up, so did my girlfriend Alena.</span> <span id="s1229">There were one or two, there was one Dutch, she came and there was another one, a Belgium that really had training or not, but we did what we could do.</span> <span id="s1230">Let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s1231">It was more than the other people could do.</span> <span id="s1232">And then I had a little dental office.</span> <span id="s1233">We had also all kinds of patients and they were there forever.</span> <span id="s1234">Some of them died, some of them we let out.</span> <span id="s1235">Basically, a lot of surgical things.</span> <span id="s1236">I remember there was one young girl who claimed she could never get up and we tried to get her up, and we could never get her up.</span> <span id="s1237">Sometimes we climbed up and to get her out of the bed to straighten out that mess, and never knew what was wrong with her.</span> <span id="s1238">One day she just died, so evidently there was something wrong with her.</span> <span id="s1239">There was another young girl she had a groin abscess which was draining for weeks and months.</span> <span id="s1240">I mean the woman with the leg, I remember once I wanted to wash my famous dress, I mean we had nothing.</span> <span id="s1241">So, if you wanted to wash a dress you borrowed something from a patient and wore that for a day and washed the dress and the patient was lying naked.</span> <span id="s1242">Conditions were pretty horrid, but as I said, they were still feeding us.</span> <span id="s1243">We got the bread in the morning, and we, the personnel didn't have to stay and it was getting cold.</span> <span id="s1244">We also had a young girl who was a mental patient, whether she was manic-depressant, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1245">One day, Schnabble came in and decided to do some kind of a surgery, and we didn't have electricity so they brought carbide lights.</span> <span id="s1246">She got frantic.</span> <span id="s1247">Something was going on in the other room and the lights.</span> <span id="s1248">This was a scene like .</span> <span id="s1249">She went wild.</span> <span id="s1250">We started chasing her.</span> <span id="s1251">She was running and she was jumping over the patients.</span> <span id="s1252">She was climbing the beds and they were the two, three story beds.</span> <span id="s1253">And people, in that frenzy they are extremely strong, and they are extremely violent and they are very agile.</span> <span id="s1254">Well, we finally got her and had some shots for her and put a straight jacket on her and got her some shots.</span> <span id="s1255">She was petrified of Schnabble.</span> <span id="s1256">One of the tents was still up and I spent with her about two or three days in the tent.</span> <span id="s1257">My mother was petrified that she's going to kill me, but she kept calm.</span> <span id="s1258">I mean, you could talk to her a little bit, you couldn't get the story out of her.</span> <span id="s1259">After that outburst, that place where we give her the injection, that festered and eventually she died.</span> <span id="s1260">She had an infection.</span> <span id="s1261">When we knew Schnabble was coming, we used to put the straight jacket on her, because she was so petrified.</span> <span id="s1262">When he walked in, we all had to stand at attention.</span> <span id="s1263">We couldn't move.</span> <span id="s1264">The only person who ever moved was one of the little orderlies.</span> <span id="s1265">She was a little woman, blonde nose, no teeth.</span> <span id="s1266">She was a young woman, bow legged, and she wanted to show him that she was working, so she would sweep the floor, including his feet.</span> <span id="s1267">It was a riot, and he used to say, "The only one who works here is this one, the little one.</span> <span id="s1268">She's the only one who's working."</span> <span id="s1269">As I said, she would sweep over his books, and he liked her.</span> <span id="s1270">He never did anything in any way to stop her.</span> <span id="s1271">Well, one of the first opportunities he had to send Doctor out, they were sending out the transports.</span> <span id="s1272">The transports, at that time, were going in and out, whether this was to a labor camp or something, so he sent her out, because he couldn't stand her, because she tried to correct him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Alena's mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Alena's mother.</span> <span id="s1275">So, they went out.</span> <span id="s1276">They did survive the war.</span> <span id="s1277">I think they wound up in and went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1278">Her mother died in Lodz or , and she survived and she was an artist, and she lived in Paris.</span> <span id="s1279">I was in touch with her, and then she died of cancer.</span> <span id="s1280">So, she was a young woman.</span> <span id="s1281">But they survived the war.</span> <span id="s1282">By that time, Mom had got some kind of ear infection, and I remember she was in such pain.</span> <span id="s1283">She got some medication and she was cold.</span> <span id="s1284">So, someone had a pair of prison underpants, stripes.</span> <span id="s1285">I remember she put it on her head because this was the only warm thing she could put on her head.</span> <span id="s1286">She was sitting in the bunk, lying on the bunk with the underpants on her head like a hat.</span> <span id="s1287">At that time, somehow, Lisa, this was the administrator, and the other one that was the scribe, somehow they were trying to do a little , and get my mother out, because they needed a dentist and they were bringing this man dentist, he was Dutch, from another camp.</span> <span id="s1288">I think at that time, Binko (ph) came around, I don't know what happened, but there was a lot of whispering going on and a lot of talking back and forth, but whether the German dentist --whatever happened, Mom got better and went back to practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Tell me about Binko?</span> <span id="s1290">A: Well, she was a dentist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: What was her full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Haddasa Binko (ph).</span> <span id="s1293">She was a dentist.</span> <span id="s1294">She came in couldn't find a job, was looking for a job.</span> <span id="s1295">How she became the head doctor, don't ask me.</span> <span id="s1296">She must have talked to the right people, Germans probably, and they appointed her the head doctor.</span> <span id="s1297">That little barrack was getting too small for us so again they built another one.</span> <span id="s1298">By that time we had a separate room for the staff.</span> <span id="s1299">I think we were doing the outpatient in the same room.</span> <span id="s1300">I finally beg hospital beds a small little room which was my mother's office.</span> <span id="s1301">In the back, at that time, they brought in a group of women from Slovakia.</span> <span id="s1302">I don't know if they were Jewish or not, with children.</span> <span id="s1303">They had little children with them, and they built like an annex to our hospital, at the end of our hospital they were getting more firewood to warm up the place.</span> <span id="s1304">They were getting some special soups, and they had some little possessions with them.</span> <span id="s1305">They had pillows, they had some tea.</span> <span id="s1306">Every once in a while we could get when the transport came in, they would bring us a box of junk, medical supplies and all kinds of odds and ends.</span> <span id="s1307">I was in charge of all the medical supplies.</span> <span id="s1308">Whenever I got any vitamins I would take it to the children, because I felt that this was very important for the mothers, so I became very friendly with them.</span> <span id="s1309">Anything with baby powder, whatever they found and the Germans wouldn't use I started packages and so on.</span> <span id="s1310">A little cough medicine for children, pediatrics, so I would take it to those women.</span> <span id="s1311">Later on they helped me.</span> <span id="s1312">Anyway, it was getting cold, it was getting very, very nasty.</span> <span id="s1313">The weather was getting nasty.</span> <span id="s1314">One day a young woman came with pain -- and you see by that time we had a couple of other doctors, I think.</span> <span id="s1315">We tried to avoid telling Schnabble what was wrong with the patient.</span> <span id="s1316">We didn't have the means to diagnose.</span> <span id="s1317">We had no blood tests.</span> <span id="s1318">We had no x- rays, it was just feel and think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Were people coming in for all kinds of conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Everything, and I can tell you, describe the conditions.</span> <span id="s1321">There was one thing, dental condition, which I think it's called , where pieces of gums and lips would rot, decompose, and they would come in sometimes with a whole mouth missing, lips missing.</span> <span id="s1322">I remember once three sisters came.</span> <span id="s1323">One was completely gone.</span> <span id="s1324">The other one had quite an advanced case.</span> <span id="s1325">The third one had just started, and every once in a while we got vitamins.</span> <span id="s1326">I mean we got all kinds of crazy things, which were odds and ends from various shipments, because the rest of the supplies -- oh yes, they used to give us once in a while paper bandages, and peroxide and some vitamins maybe and some aspirins.</span> <span id="s1327">We did get some stuff, but it was little odds and ends like vitamin C.</span> <span id="s1328">You had to use , the one who got the shot of vitamin C was the one who had the least advanced case of that cancer of the mouth, because we felt one or two shots may prevent that thing to spread further and maybe we could save.</span> <span id="s1329">The oldest one, there was no way of saving.</span> <span id="s1330">She was, for all practical -- maybe here in the United States with heavy doses of vitamins and heavy doses of medication, maybe one could save her, maybe, maybe not.</span> <span id="s1331">But certainly you couldn't save her.</span> <span id="s1332">This was what we had to do.</span> <span id="s1333">There was another thing which later came up, much later.</span> <span id="s1334">A patient would come in with a little blister and the blister would get bigger and bigger and bigger.</span> <span id="s1335">Unless that blister was opened and drained very often half of the body was covered with the blister.</span> <span id="s1336">What did this?</span> <span id="s1337">I don't know, because I'll tell you later about the British doctors who were there and we used to tell them what to do with it, because they had no idea what to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: How did you figure it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: We found that when they came with the blister and when we pierced the blister and drained it, and had some dressing we put it on, maybe some antiseptic powder, whatever we had we tried, somehow we could close the blister if it wasn't too advanced case of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Did you have enough supplies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: No, I'll tell you about that later.</span> <span id="s1342">Anyway, that one time this was one of the most horrid stories I ever saw.</span> <span id="s1343">A young woman came in and the suspicion was that she had appendix inflamed.</span> <span id="s1344">It just happened that Schnabble walked in and he heard what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">What do you have.</span> <span id="s1346">See, we had to give them reports, and at one time this one medical guy used to stay the doctors have to stay at the stairs.</span> <span id="s1347">When he comes in in the morning to pick up the reports, he doesn't want to get off the bicycle.</span> <span id="s1348">You had to hand him that while he was on the run.</span> <span id="s1349">He was awful, screaming, yelling.</span> <span id="s1350">Anyway, Schnabble came in and found out that girl is complaining about appendix.</span> <span id="s1351">He decided he is going to operate.</span> <span id="s1352">Felt her around, I think he put rubber gloves on or whether his leather gloves, again, he wearing his coat.</span> <span id="s1353">We set up the surgery in the dental office.</span> <span id="s1354">He ordered his help, the Russian boys should bring some wood, so they brought some wood.</span> <span id="s1355">It was raining.</span> <span id="s1356">It was sleeting, so I started a fire in that little wooden stove.</span> <span id="s1357">He assigned my mother to the anesthesia.</span> <span id="s1358">She was his favorite anesthetist.</span> <span id="s1359">The anesthesia consisted of a little mask, a little cage that goes and you drip ether drop by drop from the bottle.</span> <span id="s1360">No other support, nothing.</span> <span id="s1361">Annie was helping him, two guys were standing there, and I think he had one other girl, a nurse to assist, and I was the dirty nurse at that time.</span> <span id="s1362">He opened her up, couldn't find her appendix.</span> <span id="s1363">He saw something and he said, well, I don't know that looks suspicious, he was ready to cut this out.</span> <span id="s1364">This was the bladder.</span> <span id="s1365">It looks like a fish bladder.</span> <span id="s1366">He poked around.</span> <span id="s1367">He decided he can't find the appendix.</span> <span id="s1368">He took all the intestines out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">And the conditions are not sterile exactly.</span> <span id="s1370">I mean the fire which was going there, it's full of soot and he can't find it.</span> <span id="s1371">Put everything back together, took everything out again.</span> <span id="s1372">He still can't find her appendix.</span> <span id="s1373">At that time he barked to one of the guys, go bring Alenluf (ph).</span> <span id="s1374">Alenluf was a Greek doctor, I don't know if he was the main compound or where he was, but he was in the men's camp, and I understand he was a very known surgeon.</span> <span id="s1375">Well, a guy went on the bicycle and Doctor Alenluf was running after him.</span> <span id="s1376">In the meantime, we kind of kept covered and kept the ether slow, not to have her in a deep sleep.</span> <span id="s1377">I grab Alenluf's coat and put a pair of rubber gloves on him.</span> <span id="s1378">That's what I manage because by now he's very impatient.</span> <span id="s1379">Alenluf looked in and found the appendix which was not infected at all, and closed her up.</span> <span id="s1380">She developed peritonitis.</span> <span id="s1381">For three days that woman was in a coma screaming and he was coming in.</span> <span id="s1382">He sent morphine.</span> <span id="s1383">He sent painkillers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">He also sent diet soup for her and white bread, but she couldn't eat anything.</span> <span id="s1385">It lasted three days, and she died.</span> <span id="s1386">But this was a horror.</span> <span id="s1387">And you can't say anything, and he's pulling out all of her intestines out on the table and back into the cavity and back on the table and back in the cavity.</span> <span id="s1388">It was a horror.</span> <span id="s1389">And you have to stand there with a poker face and don't say a word, nothing.</span> <span id="s1390">You can't react.</span> <span id="s1391">And even this Doctor Alenluf, very gingerly worked and did whatever he had to do, and he didn't say you did wrong, nothing.</span> <span id="s1392">He just did his job and that's it.</span> <span id="s1393">This was one of the worst things which I witnessed.</span> <span id="s1394">Now the funny thing happened with those slovak women.</span> <span id="s1395">We had a bunch of syringes and we had various -- like I said, you asked about supplies, we would write that we need so and so many bandages and so many aspirins, we need so much -- they would cut it down in half, but they would bring us stuff.</span> <span id="s1396">And we had some pain killers and we had something if someone had an attack of something.</span> <span id="s1397">We also had babies.</span> <span id="s1398">There were babies born.</span> <span id="s1399">We had one woman once who knocked on the door in the middle of the night and said she's in labor, and our administrator went over, Doctor Annie went over to the tower and said, look we have a woman in labor.</span> <span id="s1400">None of us is a midwife.</span> <span id="s1401">So, they came in.</span> <span id="s1402">The two guys, and they went from barrack to barrack and they found a midwife and the baby was delivered.</span> <span id="s1403">I think Schnabble showed up so he called him Joseph Von Jordan, because there was a ditch over there and he said this is River Jordan.</span> <span id="s1404">And the following day he sent a few diapers and something, there were a few of them, but the baby eventually died because the conditions were so bad that those infants could not survive.</span> <span id="s1405">But, they didn't take away the babies.</span> <span id="s1406">They didn't kill the babies.</span> <span id="s1407">They didn't do any harm to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: There were a number of babies in the camp?</span> <span id="s1409">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Were they family camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: That was later that we got into.</span> <span id="s1412">At that time there were just a few newborn, we had a few of them and those slovak women who had their children with them.</span> <span id="s1413">Anyway, one day I needed my syringes to be sterilized and walked through and the Slovaks had a fire going, and I said, "Would you let me do the syringes here?"</span> <span id="s1414">She said, "Oh, you're so busy.</span> <span id="s1415">Why don't you let me do it.</span> <span id="s1416">I'll watch it for you, and I'll do it."</span> <span id="s1417">I said "Fine."</span> <span id="s1418">I came back.</span> <span id="s1419">She burnt every one of them.</span> <span id="s1420">Now, this could be considered sabotage.</span> <span id="s1421">I mean you know you had to really be so careful because here you are burning eight syringes.</span> <span id="s1422">I was beside myself.</span> <span id="s1423">I was afraid that Schnabble would come in and want to do something, give them an injection, whatever if he said something we had to do it.</span> <span id="s1424">Well, I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1425">Finally I got this guy Fisher on the side and he was from Northern Poland originally, and we were afraid to speak in front of him because we were afraid he understand Polish and I told him.</span> <span id="s1426">I told him what happened.</span> <span id="s1427">I said, look I was busy and I took it to them and they burned it and they didn't pay attention.</span> <span id="s1428">He started bringing, the same day he came in the afternoon, he brought one syringe.</span> <span id="s1429">Whether he stole them, how he got them within a week I had the whole set of syringes back and he never denounced me.</span> <span id="s1430">He never said anything to Schnabble, nothing.</span> <span id="s1431">So, even in those conditions there were people who were a little compassionate.</span> <span id="s1432">By that time things were getting bad, more transports.</span> <span id="s1433">I believe this was the time they brought the commandant from Auschwitz and he was cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: I think Horss.</span> <span id="s1436">And that she's the head and she was blonde and some others.</span> <span id="s1437">I mean this nasty crew from Auschwitz came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Do you know about what time, what year that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: This was in '44, had to be around winter of '44, because it was getting cold when we lived in Auschwitz, when we had those surgeries.</span> <span id="s1440">Also, when they were bringing the soups to the hospital, there were a bunch of wild women running around and trying to take the soups, the kettles, so we had to with sticks and stand guard, to escort the people who brought the soup, because they would just eat them and run with them.</span> <span id="s1441">We needed them for the patients.</span> <span id="s1442">The camp was getting bigger and bigger, and one day they said they were going to move all of our patients, and the whole camp first, on the other side of main street.</span> <span id="s1443">This was originally a prisoner of war camp, and they had some permanent buildings which were hospital buildings, and they moved first the camp and then they moved the hospital.</span> <span id="s1444">Our group was assigned to main building number one.</span> <span id="s1445">It had an operating room.</span> <span id="s1446">It had a dental office.</span> <span id="s1447">It had some wards.</span> <span id="s1448">We had like an outpatient room.</span> <span id="s1449">So, the first order of business was that the operating room had white tile floors and walls.</span> <span id="s1450">So, the first thing they did, they removed all the tiles, the ceramic tiles, because the commandant wanted that for his bathroom.</span> <span id="s1451">I believe we had electricity.</span> <span id="s1452">I can't even remember.</span> <span id="s1453">They must have had electricity because my mother had this sterilizer that was an electric sterilizer or she had spirit or something to sterilize the instruments.</span> <span id="s1454">The dental office was so beautifully equipped that when the Red Cross would come in an examine the camp, that's where they would take them, because there was all the equipment you wanted to have.</span> <span id="s1455">No x-rays, but everything else.</span> <span id="s1456">There was enough novocain that we were afraid if we used up the novocain, the war would never end.</span> <span id="s1457">Then there must have been a room for the nurses, and then there was room where the doctors lived and Mom took me with her and I shared a bed with her because they wouldn't give me a bed.</span> <span id="s1458">I was a nurse and they wouldn't give me a bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: So, all along you were living in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1461">And that room was Doctor Annie and a couple of other doctors, Lisa was the administrator, Theresa who was the scribe, then they sent in another dentist, the Russian dentist, Larissa.</span> <span id="s1462">One day, the commandant children governor who was a Seventh Day Adventist, was German, they were arrested.</span> <span id="s1463">She came down with typhus.</span> <span id="s1464">This was much later, so she was put in with the doctors in that room.</span> <span id="s1465">That was his orders that she should be kept in that room.</span> <span id="s1466">We had one surgical ward where people had all kinds of wounds, surgical wounds.</span> <span id="s1467">Sometimes we had to cut something, and we were getting very little supplies, and I took it upon myself -- because I was working always with Doctor Annie in the outpatient clinic.</span> <span id="s1468">I very seldom worked the wards.</span> <span id="s1469">I did very well with the outpatients in whatever had to be done.</span> <span id="s1470">Whenever we got supplies I used to go in to change the dressings and you almost needed a gas mask for it.</span> <span id="s1471">This was stinky, festering thing and we didn't have enough bandages.</span> <span id="s1472">We didn't get them enough.</span> <span id="s1473">We couldn't change them every day.</span> <span id="s1474">Maybe once a week, once in ten days they would bring us the supplies and there was some peroxide and maybe some ointment, maybe some powder to dust on the wounds, and I used to get so many blessings when I used to change the dressings.</span> <span id="s1475">This was the main hospital building.</span> <span id="s1476">The next one was the nicest building.</span> <span id="s1477">That's where the children were.</span> <span id="s1478">By that time, they took away or send them out or whatever happened to the parents of the Dutch and Belgium children, so they formed an orphanage there, and the Slovak women lived there with their children, and then the few mothers as long as the babies were alive, they lived there.</span> <span id="s1479">That's were Doctor lived.</span> <span id="s1480">That place was heated.</span> <span id="s1481">They gave them some food.</span> <span id="s1482">They were getting the white soup for the children.</span> <span id="s1483">They were getting the white bread, and I have a feeling they must have inoculated the children for typhus, because I was not aware of many of them having typhus fever.</span> <span id="s1484">I know they were inoculating people because at one time Binko and I and another nurse went to one of the subcamps or whatever and those people had passports from Argentina, from Brazil from Australia.</span> <span id="s1485">Whether they were real passports, whether they were false passports, we don't know because many of them were Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1486">But we went out there when the epidemic started and we were inoculating the whole group there.</span> <span id="s1487">Then there were two other barracks where one was not so bad and then there was one which was worse condition and then there was one number 5 where I think there were 500 people dead and 100 dead every day.</span> <span id="s1488">They would bring the people -- they would just bring them in blankets and leave them there.</span> <span id="s1489">I mean, people who were in the different barracks would just bring them in the blankets, and if there was any hope for them, they were separated and put somewhere else, but those were people like in a hospice, they were just dying there.</span> <span id="s1490">I was very friendly with the head nurse and she had she used to say to me after I had typhus fever come and I'll give you some bread because they didn't eat.</span> <span id="s1491">She would get and she had a count of 500 so she got 500 pieces of bread according to the count.</span> <span id="s1492">She said, they're not eating, and you may as well have another piece of bread and get some strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: The dead people, they just dumped them outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: That I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s1495">When we first came in there was a little morgue not far from the hospital buildings.</span> <span id="s1496">A little concrete structure.</span> <span id="s1497">Well we started taking the people out.</span> <span id="s1498">Everybody was taking them out.</span> <span id="s1499">Well, after a while that place would not accommodate the bodies and they didn't have time to take them.</span> <span id="s1500">It got to a point that it was like a tremendous field of dead bodies, and that's what the British finally saw.</span> <span id="s1501">Families would walk by and look and who do I know there.</span> <span id="s1502">If the blanket wasn't soiled, we would save the blankets for other people and if they were soiled we left them there.</span> <span id="s1503">The pile was growing taller and bigger and bigger and taking more room and they had no -- they could not keep up with removing the bodies.</span> <span id="s1504">Toward the end when there was this tremendous epidemic, they would give people extra soups, they were giving them all kinds of privileges.</span> <span id="s1505">They would dig ditches and burn the bodies.</span> <span id="s1506">They just could not keep up with it.</span> <span id="s1507">When the British liberated the camp, the camp took the British General, whoever it was, showing the camp, and naturally they avoided that area.</span> <span id="s1508">So, there was a bunch of noisy girls and he said, never mind, come here, come here.</span> <span id="s1509">We didn't speak English, but they said you have to see this place.</span> <span id="s1510">And the British were flabbergasted seeing that, and they made the German officers remove those bodies.</span> <span id="s1511">They came so beautiful the first day.</span> <span id="s1512">They came with their hair done, and their uniforms were so nice and clean and they had to handle those bodies, and the deeper they were going, the more decomposed those bodies were.</span> <span id="s1513">Believe me, at the end of the day, they looked as raggedy as most of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1514">This was horrid.</span> <span id="s1515">Anyway, the camp was getting bigger.</span> <span id="s1516">There were transports coming in every few days, and they needed help with the transports.</span> <span id="s1517">When the transports came in, the able bodies would get a shower and they would place them in camp, but there were some sick people coming in and they were checking who was sick and who is not, so they would need a doctor to ascertain whether the person could be saved.</span> <span id="s1518">A few were nurses, and I felt so badly, the girls were going out every night one I said, "I'm going.</span> <span id="s1519">I have to help them.</span> <span id="s1520">I just can't let them work both nights."</span> <span id="s1521">So, we went out.</span> <span id="s1522">By the time we got there, most of the able bodies they were processed.</span> <span id="s1523">There was this big room with all kinds of bundles.</span> <span id="s1524">They made the people leave the bundles and there were sick people.</span> <span id="s1525">Some of them were lame, but we managed to undress them and put their clothes in those little fish net bags and once they went through the thing, the steam would kill the vermin, and they could go on the other side and find their own clothes.</span> <span id="s1526">There was one woman who was in a coma, and the Germans kept saying, "Throwing her out.</span> <span id="s1527">She's half dead, she's dead."</span> <span id="s1528">I kept on shoving her around that place behind some things because I felt by the time I finished, maybe she'll revive.</span> <span id="s1529">Whether she was in a diabetic coma, what, a fairly young woman well dressed, and every time they saw me, they said "Come on take her out.</span> <span id="s1530">Let's take her out.</span> <span id="s1531">Let the guys take her out."</span> <span id="s1532">So, I was hiding her behind bundles, behind anything.</span> <span id="s1533">Unfortunately the end of the evening we couldn't do anything but slap her face.</span> <span id="s1534">I tried to give her some water.</span> <span id="s1535">Whatever we tried to do it couldn't revive her, so they took her out.</span> <span id="s1536">That transport was so full of lice.</span> <span id="s1537">We got so bitten by lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Where were most of these transports from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: They were from Hungary.</span> <span id="s1540">I think Poland by that time was clean.</span> <span id="s1541">They finished with those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: They weren't necessarily coming from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: No, no those people were coming with their own clothes and whatever the camp wore.</span> <span id="s1544">They were not from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1545">They were not from camps.</span> <span id="s1546">They were wherever they lived in.</span> <span id="s1547">Anyway, then it was getting almost light and they said all right we're finished with you.</span> <span id="s1548">We can take you back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1549">And we said, "You know, you bathed everybody, you deloused them, and here we are crawling with insects.</span> <span id="s1550">We are bitten all over the place and why don't you let us have a shower and delouse us, our clothes, otherwise we'll bring the whole stuff back to camp."</span> <span id="s1551">They said that's a good idea and they even stoked the fires and we had a nice warm shower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: How often did you shower?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: We never showered.</span> <span id="s1554">The first time when they brought you to camp.</span> <span id="s1555">This was the second one.</span> <span id="s1556">Maybe once they took us out.</span> <span id="s1557">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: So, you never washed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Well, we washed.</span> <span id="s1560">Maybe once they took us to shower, maybe when we're changing camps, I think they marched us.</span> <span id="s1561">This was a pleasure, this shower, and they took our clothes and they deloused them.</span> <span id="s1562">Three weeks later I came with the typhus fever.</span> <span id="s1563">I came back and I said boy I was bitten and this one doctor was with me and three weeks later, as I said, to the day, I came down with it.</span> <span id="s1564">At first they didn't know what was wrong with me.</span> <span id="s1565">So, by this time we didn't have Schnabble.</span> <span id="s1566">We had a young doctor who was wounded at the Russian front.</span> <span id="s1567">His arm was injured and he was working in camp.</span> <span id="s1568">They heard that I might have typhus fever, so he and the dentist came to examine me, because they have never seen typhus before, and they figure out that I have it.</span> <span id="s1569">By that time, the doctors in the room that I slept with they decided they don't want anyone with the typhus fever, so they kicked me out on the ward.</span> <span id="s1570">But I had my own bed, and I was lying next to a girl who used to be a patient of mine.</span> <span id="s1571">She had t.b. but I tried to keep her on calcium.</span> <span id="s1572">The theory was that calcium was good for t.b. and we had calcium, she would get it.</span> <span id="s1573">Again, she was a young woman.</span> <span id="s1574">You tried to help people who were not too far gone.</span> <span id="s1575">We felt if we could help them, keep them going for a while, maybe they can keep on going.</span> <span id="s1576">By that time, the epidemic started.</span> <span id="s1577">The typhus epidemic.</span> <span id="s1578">It was by the end of the war, this must have been February or March and by the end 90 percent of the people had typhus.</span> <span id="s1579">My fever was building up about three weeks.</span> <span id="s1580">It's like with pneumonia.</span> <span id="s1581">It build up, if the patient can survive the crisis.</span> <span id="s1582">Well, Mom would warm up water in the sterilizer and wash me and bring water and wet my lips.</span> <span id="s1583">And those Slovak ladies made me a little pillow.</span> <span id="s1584">I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s1585">This tiny little pillow.</span> <span id="s1586">They collected some feathers because they thought I was so nice to them, and they brought me this.</span> <span id="s1587">And I kept on saying "Get the train out of my head, get the train out of my head.</span> <span id="s1588">I can't stand the train."</span> <span id="s1589">And when they would bring the turnip soup into the room, it was wretched.</span> <span id="s1590">I couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s1591">Finally one night, I must have reached the crisis, and called this woman next door and said "Get me my mother."</span> <span id="s1592">So they woke up the night nurses, got my mother and she came running in and there was a doctor and again we had some supplies.</span> <span id="s1593">We had something to support the heart, just a stimulator heart, and they gave me a shot of it, because I felt I don't know.</span> <span id="s1594">I think I was dying.</span> <span id="s1595">Then I got better.</span> <span id="s1596">In the interim, I just want to bring out the difference between two doctors.</span> <span id="s1597">I haven't seen those surgeries because I was so sick.</span> <span id="s1598">This young German doctor performed some surgeries.</span> <span id="s1599">Again, he wanted to learn.</span> <span id="s1600">He did them in the operating room under sterile conditions and he always had this Greek doctor with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Sometimes he would I mean people told me about it.</span> <span id="s1602">Sometimes he would hesitate what to do and he would look at the Greek doctor and the Greek doctor would say, "Well, don't you think you should do this," but very diplomatically, and he never offered advice until the guy looked at him.</span> <span id="s1603">He didn't know where he was going.</span> <span id="s1604">So, they did perform some surgeries on those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: So there was actually a somewhat serious effort to cure people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: I don't know if it was serious to cure people of if this was a way for him to learn.</span> <span id="s1607">I mean they never had the chance to -- if he is a very known professor and he is a young doctor and maybe he should learn.</span> <span id="s1608">And he and his pal, the dentist, used to sit in the dental office most of the day.</span> <span id="s1609">He also had some massages done.</span> <span id="s1610">First one masseuse and then the other friend of mine, the one who was the head of that very sick ward.</span> <span id="s1611">She would come in because he needed physical therapy on his arm.</span> <span id="s1612">The first time we had the inkling that things were going bad for Germans they were discussing it very quietly.</span> <span id="s1613">The Russians are so and so many kilometers from Berlin and they were afraid of Russians.</span> <span id="s1614">My mother overheard a conversation.</span> <span id="s1615">Whether that was done to let us know, or they just forgot about her working because she ignored them, that's when we knew things were happening.</span> <span id="s1616">By the time, close to the liberation, there was cholera there.</span> <span id="s1617">There was a raging epidemic of typhus.</span> <span id="s1618">There was all kinds of sickness and less supplies and less food.</span> <span id="s1619">One day this other doctor, I think it was called up over lined us up -- we didn't have water, I don't think we had bread.</span> <span id="s1620">He said times are very bad but you cannot abuse your patients, you have to take care of them.</span> <span id="s1621">He was trying to give us a pep talk how to take care of our patients.</span> <span id="s1622">How ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1623">One day one of the guards -- I somehow suspected whether they were experimenting with our lives.</span> <span id="s1624">One day a young woman came in and she had a turban, a very tightly wrapped turban around her head and she said she's itching.</span> <span id="s1625">We took off the turban, her head was so covered with lice, like you see, you have a big ant hill and you kick it apart and you see the ants coming out.</span> <span id="s1626">I'm talking about big ant hills.</span> <span id="s1627">I mean, you couldn't see the hair.</span> <span id="s1628">So, we cut it and put some disinfectant.</span> <span id="s1629">We had some anti-lice things, burned the hair outside, the whole thing, and I was wondering if by any chance if they did not decide that this is a fast way of doing it.</span> <span id="s1630">Because they were all inoculated.</span> <span id="s1631">The Germans were all inoculated.</span> <span id="s1632">After the war, I think some of them got typhus, when they were handling the bodies, but they were very well isolated and inoculated.</span> <span id="s1633">Whether they tried this, I don't know because I don't know how anyone could have lived with that mess, and the way the turban was wrapped around her head, it was a young woman.</span> <span id="s1634">It was -- I've never seen anything like it.</span> <span id="s1635">I'm telling you you see a ant hill, a big one, and this is what is creepy.</span> <span id="s1636">So, as I said, toward the end, there were so many sick people.</span> <span id="s1637">So many people dying, and you couldn't do a thing for them.</span> <span id="s1638">Yes, there was an effort to save them, every once in a while they had the surgeons that wanted to do something, but I don't think this was so much an effort to save them.</span> <span id="s1639">I have a feeling that this was an opportunity for the doctors to learn.</span> <span id="s1640">Schnabble was just learning whatever he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1641">I don't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1642">He disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: You mentioned a name "Kramer."</span> <span id="s1644">Isn't Kramer someone who also came from Auschwitz and replaced Horss?</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: I don't know whether he replaced Horsss.</span> <span id="s1646">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1647">I think Horss was caught in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1648">I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: This Kramer then was head of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: I know there was someone by the name of Kramer gave us a pep talk.</span> <span id="s1651">I never seen Horss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">I know of him, but I have never seen him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Before we get to the end, I just want to ask you a couple questions.</span> <span id="s1654">It sounds like you had contact with people, prisoners from a lot of different surroundings, is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: Not so much from the other camps, but just with transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: The transports were coming in and this woman became the main camp.</span> <span id="s1658">They would break out the fences between some other camps and that became a huge, huge, huge camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: So, then a lot of the subcamps got combined?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1661">The Dutch and the Belgium camp, that was combined with ours.</span> <span id="s1662">The Indonesia, no.</span> <span id="s1663">What happened to the prisoner of wars or whatever, we took over those parts of the building, I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1664">I know the Russians were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: When you were more integrated were the conditions and relationship also integrated or did certain people just stay with their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: I think they stayed more or less within their own barracks.</span> <span id="s1667">They had to stay and they were allowed to come to the hospital, but otherwise, I don't think there were any social activities there at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Did you develop strong relationships with the other people you were working with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Some of them, yes.</span> <span id="s1670">And there were a lot of strong relationship in terms of there was one of the nurses and she was very friendly with a couple of girls.</span> <span id="s1671">She lived --she didn't live with us.</span> <span id="s1672">She lived with a couple of girls.</span> <span id="s1673">One of them was the head, a block elder, and she lived with them.</span> <span id="s1674">They were like sisters.</span> <span id="s1675">That was the thing.</span> <span id="s1676">People were developing relationships and if they were like sisters, they could help each other.</span> <span id="s1677">Some of the doctors, there were two, one of them died, so we were friendly later on, my mother and I, and we have seen her after the war and were together in Sweden.</span> <span id="s1678">We maintained contact with those people because we were together and there were a lot of relationships like this.</span> <span id="s1679">People would adopt each other.</span> <span id="s1680">Those were ones who had the easiest way of surviving, because when one was very sick, the other one helped them.</span> <span id="s1681">We had friends, two sisters, one is now in Brazil, one lives in California, and they were together, and one of them I don't remember which one, she was so sick that the older sister would chew a piece of bread, because the bread was hard and she would chew a piece of bread and shove it in the sister's mouth to make her so she could swallow it, and that's how they made it.</span> <span id="s1682">So, there were all kinds of pieces of kindness.</span> <span id="s1683">And when I was so sick that that girl who I used to take care of before, she was the one who basically, because the nurses wouldn't do much for me.</span> <span id="s1684">They were busy.</span> <span id="s1685">But she was conscious, she was not very sick.</span> <span id="s1686">That's why they placed me there and she kept an eye on me.</span> <span id="s1687">If I needed anything, the sicker I was getting, she would take a sip of water and put it in my lips or wet something and put it on my lips and she was in a way taking care of me.</span> <span id="s1688">She didn't do physically anything, she was in bed, but she was kind of keeping an eye -- she was the one who alerted them that I was coming down with the crisis, so she did help me.</span> <span id="s1689">Mom got typhus later.</span> <span id="s1690">I mean all the doctors got sick.</span> <span id="s1691">I mean everybody was sick.</span> <span id="s1692">The sign was if you spilled your water like we had this French doctor, she had a bed above us, and the sign was that if you started taking water at night to bed and then spill it over head she had typhus.</span> <span id="s1693">We knew that she had.</span> <span id="s1694">There were certain symptoms.</span> <span id="s1695">I could recognize someone with the typhus just looking at them.</span> <span id="s1696">Later on, the British doctors, they had no idea what's wrong with a patient.</span> <span id="s1697">I said the trembling, the lip trembling, people didn't even have the spots, there were certain symptoms you could just recognize they had typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: Certainly you've read stories and heard stories in camps about people that the need for survival --</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: There was stories about it that there were.</span> <span id="s1700">I never witnessed it but there were stories about cannibals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: People would steal from each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1703">It was known.</span> <span id="s1704">If someone was unconscious they put a piece of bread in front of them so they would steal it.</span> <span id="s1705">This was, as I said, the will to survive.</span> <span id="s1706">But it got so bad that they were walking to camp, they were walking to the hospital and they were just defecating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: This was another interesting thing I read in your testimony.</span> <span id="s1708">When I read about Bergen- Belsen I guess towards the end it sounded as if, not from your testimony, but from elsewhere, that nobody really took care of anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Basically, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: The authorities of the camp really didn't make any provisions to feed, to clothe, to house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: Well, they were housed.</span> <span id="s1712">There were barracks.</span> <span id="s1713">Clothes, whatever they came with, and there were some people working.</span> <span id="s1714">As I said, when the people came in with their own clothes, the good stuff was taken away.</span> <span id="s1715">They had big warehouses when the war ended.</span> <span id="s1716">The prisoners broke into those warehouses and everybody was carrying all kinds of clothing.</span> <span id="s1717">One of the funniest thing this Russian dentist with his boyfriend and my mother didn't know what happened, she was just recuperating from typhus and this guy walked in in a top hat, tuxedo with tails and a white scarf around his neck.</span> <span id="s1718">He was one of the Russians.</span> <span id="s1719">They were the first ones to break into the warehouses and he thought he looked very snazzy in that outfit, this was after the war.</span> <span id="s1720">But the war was a field of dead.</span> <span id="s1721">There were people dying by the thousands every day and they would just dump them out and there was no way no matter what the Germans tried to do to bury them, and they would bring crews to the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1722">They fed them extra, they forced them to work.</span> <span id="s1723">There was tasks that they could not keep up.</span> <span id="s1724">I think there were two graves when they finally cleaned out the camp, one I don't know how many thousands of people buried in those graves, mass graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: What percentage of people do you think came through the hospital at one time or another?</span> <span id="s1726">You were treating women, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1728">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1729">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1730">We had lines every day.</span> <span id="s1731">As a matter of fact, after we were liberated they took everybody to Bergen, but in the meantime the British helped us clean up some of -- they whitewashed some of the buildings, and I stayed another month or so, maybe another few weeks.</span> <span id="s1732">No, we liberated the 15th of April, the 8th of May I was still in the old place and they gave us new blankets and we were still admitting people and still taking care of it because the healthy ones they could process and take to Bergen, which was a military camp, and they placed them there.</span> <span id="s1733">The sick ones, they had a whole procedure they had to -- and they were magnificent.</span> <span id="s1734">They would take them in and they would bathe them on stretches and they would shower them and they cleaned their heads.</span> <span id="s1735">And they were basically British soldiers and dress the wounds and place them in hospital barracks.</span> <span id="s1736">This was a very slow process.</span> <span id="s1737">In the meantime, people were coming in.</span> <span id="s1738">They needed help now, and by that time we had some supplies.</span> <span id="s1739">So, we were admitting some of them and we were treating some of them on an outpatient basis, but at least we had some bandages and supplies.</span> <span id="s1740">We had some medications.</span> <span id="s1741">If they had a headache, we could give them aspirin.</span> <span id="s1742">I mean things like this, and they were still getting sick.</span> <span id="s1743">They were still getting typhus.</span> <span id="s1744">That thing was still raging, and the British soldiers were all inoculated and toward the end there was a rumor they were going to evacuate the camp, like they did in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1745">There was a march.</span> <span id="s1746">There was a group that went on trains, and I think the trains were bombed, and I think some of the Dutch Jews perished that way.</span> <span id="s1747">Anyway, there was a rumor that the camp is mine and they are going to evacuate the camp and whoever can walk and the rest of the people will go, and the girls came over to me, the nurses that wanted to distribute some of the medicine what you have and the syringes and everything and they said, "Are you going to walk?"</span> <span id="s1748">I said, "No, I'm not leaving Mom, and she can't walk.</span> <span id="s1749">I'm staying no matter what happened."</span> <span id="s1750">Well, that night we had bombs and they bombed this was Lindenberg, the Allies bombed a nearby town and a day or two later we saw all the Germans walking -- the British didn't come in yet, but they were walking with the white arm bands and for some reason I was sent out to either get the soup or get some supplies and I was passing the baths, the sauna and our favorite the guy, the pig, this German, he was burning paper in this sauna, in the furnace.</span> <span id="s1751">They were very nice.</span> <span id="s1752">They were still in charge, and they came in and they wore the arm bands, didn't discuss anything, but at the same time the day the British came in there was a cook, a German cook in one of the kitchens, and they were supposed to be working.</span> <span id="s1753">He said, I have another few bullets and I'm going to shoot all the Jews.</span> <span id="s1754">He killed a girl, wounded one, and the British were not in, the Germans were half way in and out.</span> <span id="s1755">By that time we were guarded by Hungarians.</span> <span id="s1756">The guards were all released, outside guards.</span> <span id="s1757">And there was a group of Hungarians and they were guarding the camp with the guns.</span> <span id="s1758">This was a German, and they felt, they swore that they are going to get themselves some Jews.</span> <span id="s1759">One of the girls was brought in.</span> <span id="s1760">She walked out, she said, "We are free.</span> <span id="s1761">We are liberated."</span> <span id="s1762">Bang, and she was gone.</span> <span id="s1763">What has happened, when the British came in the 15th of April the tank went through, waved the flag, everybody say hooray and they went out and we are still prisoners until they finally came in and started checking.</span> <span id="s1764">Well, it was in the afternoon, they just went in until they could organize themselves.</span> <span id="s1765">Then they discovered the bodies so they called all the officers and the soldiers and they had to remove the bodies.</span> <span id="s1766">Some of the girls were nuts.</span> <span id="s1767">They were distributing the food in metal cans and they were rusting.</span> <span id="s1768">One of the girls saved the rations which was pretty awful and rotten and become spoiled and she wanted one of the Germans to eat it.</span> <span id="s1769">And the Germans were guarded by the British because otherwise the mob would have torn them apart.</span> <span id="s1770">There was a language problem, but this one somehow managed to convey to the British soldier that she doesn't want to do any harm.</span> <span id="s1771">She just wants that German to eat that food, and he made him eat it.</span> <span id="s1772">The funny thing is, I went once to see this removal of the bodies.</span> <span id="s1773">It was a frantic scene.</span> <span id="s1774">The girls were screaming and yelling and hollering and they wanted to pull on the Germans.</span> <span id="s1775">I went once to see it, but I just couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1776">I also went out, I think one day after they liberated us and I went out -- the gates between the compounds were open.</span> <span id="s1777">The main street was open.</span> <span id="s1778">That's where you saw this unbelievable mob of people walking with all kinds of clothing because they broke into the depots and whatever they could wear, the funniest outfits and funny things, and people were milling, looking for friends and that's how I went to the men's place, the men's camp to look for people from my town and people who I knew, and I found this one boy who had a very bad eye infection and got him doctors and got him to a hospital.</span> <span id="s1779">He lost his eye but he survived.</span> <span id="s1780">He's alive.</span> <span id="s1781">He lives in California.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: We started talking about liberation.</span> <span id="s1784">I wondering if the Germans were sensing what was happening and if there treatment of you changed, if you could feel their fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: Well, once the bombing took place nearby, a couple of days before the British came in, and that's where the German headquarters surrendered and therefore the Germans were wearing the white armbands.</span> <span id="s1786">They were ready for take over and by that time, except the crazy shooters, the ones we were in contact with, they were okay.</span> <span id="s1787">Even the one that was screaming, he was always quiet.</span> <span id="s1788">I saw him burn the papers and I don't remember why I went out, either to pick up some supplies because we still could not walk between the compounds on the main street, but for some reason I was sent for something, I think we were sent to the kitchen for soups.</span> <span id="s1789">By that time they were not delivering and that's why I went with a group of girls, and that's when I saw him burning those papers frantically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">They were packing and he didn't even see us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: They weren't trying to convince you how nice they were or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: No, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1793">I understand that the dentist somehow got some testimony of various prisoners.</span> <span id="s1794">They never approached us.</span> <span id="s1795">This was one person I would have given him a clean bill of health.</span> <span id="s1796">He was arrested, but then he was released because he really didn't do anything ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: Do you remember how you felt when the British arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: Unbelievable feeling of relief.</span> <span id="s1799">Just went out to see them and we all went out to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">First the people came in and said the British tank went in.</span> <span id="s1801">I think I've seen the British tank.</span> <span id="s1802">They were shooting, so we were afraid to walk around.</span> <span id="s1803">The Germans were still shooting and the Hungarians were still watching.</span> <span id="s1804">You couldn't go outside of the camp and after they finally took all the guns from those Germans, then you went out.</span> <span id="s1805">That's when I went to the main, on the main street and I saw this unbelievable motley crew of people.</span> <span id="s1806">Some of them were still dying.</span> <span id="s1807">Some of them were hardly moving.</span> <span id="s1808">There were bodies around, but whoever could move, they were moving.</span> <span id="s1809">They were walking, and they were smiling.</span> <span id="s1810">And unfortunately, there were so many people who died still after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1811">It was incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: How did the British treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: The liberators treated us very nice.</span> <span id="s1814">The first day they decided we are starving so they brought soup, and the soup was very rich, and we all ate the soup and all got deathly ill.</span> <span id="s1815">Our bodies could not absorb this fat, so everybody got sick.</span> <span id="s1816">We overate that soup.</span> <span id="s1817">It was a thick, I remember, with a coat of fat on top.</span> <span id="s1818">They were very anxious to help us.</span> <span id="s1819">The British would as I aid the British soldiers as such they were beautiful towards the patients.</span> <span id="s1820">The British officers they were just -- later on they were funny, we had to fight them, but in the beginning they were just very compassionate it.</span> <span id="s1821">Then they realized that the food they were giving us we can not take this very rich food, so they started giving us like a diet food for a while until we could adjust.</span> <span id="s1822">They were giving us those little K rations.</span> <span id="s1823">They were giving us cigarettes and chewing gum and some lemonade and some cookies and were giving some tins of those cookies.</span> <span id="s1824">I decided to smoke a cigarette.</span> <span id="s1825">Mom said, I don't want you to smoke until after the war.</span> <span id="s1826">The war was still on, so the 8th of May and I was sitting and the cannons and you could hear the war was over and there were announcements and stuff like this.</span> <span id="s1827">I took a package of those -- I had a whole bunch of those little player cigarettes and I was smoking one after another.</span> <span id="s1828">She said, I told you not to smoke.</span> <span id="s1829">She was so sick, she said I told you not to smoke.</span> <span id="s1830">I said, "Mom, the war is over.</span> <span id="s1831">I'm smoking."</span> <span id="s1832">This was like an act of rebellion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: How come you remained in the camp for a while after the British liberated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: They needed some people to be still there because as I said, the transfer of the patients was such a slow one they needed us.</span> <span id="s1835">It took them a while, maybe a week, ten days, two weeks.</span> <span id="s1836">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1837">And she was so sick, so I stayed.</span> <span id="s1838">I couldn't move her.</span> <span id="s1839">By the time we got to Bergen, they didn't have any more room, so there was this huge officers' casino and they converted this to a hospital.</span> <span id="s1840">This was the end of everybody in Bergen.</span> <span id="s1841">And they had this huge ballroom, it held about 170 beds.</span> <span id="s1842">The place was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1843">It was a round building.</span> <span id="s1844">They called it the round house.</span> <span id="s1845">Out of the ballroom, there was a magnificent terrace.</span> <span id="s1846">And Rhododendron blooming around, it was just gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1847">There were a couple rooms where they had the casino, but they removed all the tables and they patients there.</span> <span id="s1848">I think the paper I gave you was signed by this doctor who became the head of this thing.</span> <span id="s1849">At that time our staff consisted of British doctors.</span> <span id="s1850">They were volunteers, second or third year medical students.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Your hospital was transferred to the town of Bergen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Well, there were a lot of buildings to the hospital, but this was the very, very end of it, because they were transferring people all the time, but this was the very end.</span> <span id="s1853">There must have been about 250, 300 patients at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Did they burn down or do anything with the old quarters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: I'll tell you that.</span> <span id="s1856">So, we had rooms there.</span> <span id="s1857">Mom started working a little bit there was a dental office there, but she had swollen legs.</span> <span id="s1858">She was just working a few hours a day.</span> <span id="s1859">They had the most beautifully equipped kitchen I have ever seen.</span> <span id="s1860">I don't know if many fancy restaurants here have kitchens, fully electric, they could cook a few hundred eggs at the same time.</span> <span id="s1861">They had frying pans they could turn upside down by touching a button.</span> <span id="s1862">It was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1863">There were naturally, a couple of elderly Germans running that kitchen for us.</span> <span id="s1864">They claimed that they never knew anything about it.</span> <span id="s1865">As I started telling you there was the British doctor who was the head.</span> <span id="s1866">A few British nurses, we had British volunteer students at that time.</span> <span id="s1867">A bunch of us, a few French nuns came from France and they brought in a bunch of German nurses, and there was one ward with people with t.b., diarrhea, as sick as they come.</span> <span id="s1868">The British assigned our girls to that room, and the room that had 170 beds they were basically convalescing, and they gave the German nurses this.</span> <span id="s1869">And we went on strike.</span> <span id="s1870">The rationale was that since some of the very sick people cannot don't know what's going on and the Germans may harm them and we will be much more compassionate to them.</span> <span id="s1871">Our argument was that we all went through typhus.</span> <span id="s1872">We are all very weak, and there's no reason for us to be exposed at this point to t.b. and diarrhea and we should be assigned the convalescent, which was a much lighter load and let the Germans work there.</span> <span id="s1873">So, we went on strike.</span> <span id="s1874">We had a translator girl who spoke English and finally got through his head that this was the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s1875">But he was very much afraid what will happen.</span> <span id="s1876">We said we will supervise.</span> <span id="s1877">We'll check, and the nurses were busting because they were all registered nurses.</span> <span id="s1878">We were all a motley crew.</span> <span id="s1879">We didn't have uniforms, I mean, like a butcher's apron.</span> <span id="s1880">We had nothing, and we were watching what they were doing.</span> <span id="s1881">Another thing I was very happy to do, they would send the women from the town from Bergen to clean the hospital and we had this was the ballroom, it had a gorgeous parquet floor and we made them wash the floor twice a day.</span> <span id="s1882">They would come in the morning to clean, and they would come in the afternoon to clean, and God forbid that they left a dry spot.</span> <span id="s1883">Wash it, the German word was .</span> <span id="s1884">I couldn't speak German very well, but this was a funny feeling, you know, I was in charge.</span> <span id="s1885">So, little by little our big ward would empty because they were getting better and getting out.</span> <span id="s1886">The British, I started telling you about the British soldiers even before when they had this blister disease.</span> <span id="s1887">Once, I remember one of the young fellows came and he was getting ready, he found a patient with a blister thing and he was getting ready for a serious surgery.</span> <span id="s1888">I took him on the side, I said you are the doctor, I'm not, but we have had such experience with it, you don't have to do serious surgery, just make sure you lance it and drain it and then if you have -- they didn't have antibiotics but I think sulfur or whatever they had, something to dress the wound and she'll be okay, because she didn't have tremendous blisters.</span> <span id="s1889">He did it.</span> <span id="s1890">They were still students.</span> <span id="s1891">A lot of them got sick.</span> <span id="s1892">They left and we had a group of Belgium medical students, volunteers and they were not treated by the British very well.</span> <span id="s1893">They used to mooch the cigarettes from us because we used to have all the cigarettes from the British.</span> <span id="s1894">We were getting those packets every day.</span> <span id="s1895">Somehow they resented that.</span> <span id="s1896">Those guys, I think they were older, and they were just very good, trying to help the people and take care of them.</span> <span id="s1897">The British burned Bergen-Belsen as they emptied it.</span> <span id="s1898">They left one building standing and I don't know when there was a ceremony and we were invited, taken in by trucks.</span> <span id="s1899">I think there is a picture at the Holocaust Museum of that ceremony.</span> <span id="s1900">This was when they raised the words of General Glen Hughes who was the Second British Army.</span> <span id="s1901">He said that now they can raise the British flag because this awful place doesn't exit any more and the ceremony was that they threw flame throwers burned the last barrack.</span> <span id="s1902">Whether the administration building still stands, I don't know, but this was the last thing and they raised the British flag over it because they never raise a British flag over a place as horrid as Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Did they burn it just for the horror of it, or did because they wanted to burn off the disease?</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: They wanted to burn off the disease.</span> <span id="s1905">They were burning them as soon as they were empty.</span> <span id="s1906">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s1907">I mean the whole German population.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: So, your life started becoming a bit more normal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1910">We were there until July and they had a movie and the survivors could go to the movies during the day.</span> <span id="s1911">The British soldiers it was there for the British soldiers at night, but I was working during the day, so I was invited by the Belgs -- the Belgs could go at night, so they would invite me to go to the movies.</span> <span id="s1912">I was a young girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: Do you remember what the first movie is you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: I think with Esther Williams.</span> <span id="s1915">A funny thing happened.</span> <span id="s1916">One day they said they are going to hand someone, some Nazi somewhere nearby.</span> <span id="s1917">Let's go, let's go see it.</span> <span id="s1918">So, I said to Mom, I'm going.</span> <span id="s1919">Where are you going?</span> <span id="s1920">I don't know, to Ludenberg.</span> <span id="s1921">So one of the girls said oh we have a truck.</span> <span id="s1922">There was one woman and three or four of us that went.</span> <span id="s1923">There was no hanging.</span> <span id="s1924">We couldn't get a way back.</span> <span id="s1925">There was no way of getting back.</span> <span id="s1926">Finally we found there was some camp under the Poles and four or five women invited us.</span> <span id="s1927">They had some food.</span> <span id="s1928">They gave us their beds and we stayed with them at night.</span> <span id="s1929">They gave us food, and the following day we are trying to get in the worst way to go back to Bergen.</span> <span id="s1930">We are standing on the corner and there is a mob of people looking for transport and we tried to get anything you can.</span> <span id="s1931">At that time, there was who became the head of Bergen.</span> <span id="s1932">He married Ms. Bimko.</span> <span id="s1933">He knew my mother.</span> <span id="s1934">They used to play cards together, whatever.</span> <span id="s1935">He knew her.</span> <span id="s1936">There was another guy, a British officer, who used to hang around, used to play bridge with a bunch of people in our hospital and he heard that I disappeared, that I went somewhere and there was no way of calling.</span> <span id="s1937">There was no way of doing something.</span> <span id="s1938">And they had a vague idea of where I went with those women, but where did we go, Ludenberg.</span> <span id="s1939">They were all very concerned and I'm standing on the corner with those few women who is passing by but this British officer.</span> <span id="s1940">His name was Eric, on a motorcycle.</span> <span id="s1941">I started hollering, Eric.</span> <span id="s1942">He said you know the whole world is looking for you.</span> <span id="s1943">I said, well, we can't get back.</span> <span id="s1944">No one wants to take us back.</span> <span id="s1945">We can't communicate.</span> <span id="s1946">We can't go back.</span> <span id="s1947">So, he stopped the truck, on after another finally found out where they are going whether they can take us back.</span> <span id="s1948">He said they'll take us back.</span> <span id="s1949">So, we get on the truck and there are some soldiers in the back and they are driving and driving and they take us somewhere else and we said Where are you taking us?"</span> <span id="s1950">As I said, we couldn't speak English.</span> <span id="s1951">Finally they explained to us that at a certain time those soldiers have to be on the base otherwise they'll be AWOL, which I didn't know what the word means, but they explained that they had to be back.</span> <span id="s1952">Once they will be taken back to their posts, then we'll be taken to Bergen.</span> <span id="s1953">This was one of the high drinx after the war, what I did.</span> <span id="s1954">Trying to be normal, being almost a normal teenager.</span> <span id="s1955">I was 19, but still being a normal, all of a sudden an act of rebellion , get out do something adventurous, naughty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: Free?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: Free, that's exactly what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: How did you get to Sweden?</span> <span id="s1959">Why did you decided to go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: Well, what has happened at that time, Swedish government invited "x" amount of people to go and they needed doctors and nurses and dentists to go along to take care of the patients, so we signed up.</span> <span id="s1961">They took us to , and that was also funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">They had to clean us out, so they had two tents, one for the men and for one for the women and this friend of ours was a doctor got very friendly on the train going to and he came through and he said, "You know, the women were washing me."</span> <span id="s1963">And they made the German men, wash the women.</span> <span id="s1964">They wanted to punish the Germans in a way, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1965">They didn't try to punish us.</span> <span id="s1966">We just decided the hell with it.</span> <span id="s1967">They're not meant to us.</span> <span id="s1968">I mean, this was the thing, don't get shocked.</span> <span id="s1969">Don't get shocked, they're not men.</span> <span id="s1970">They're Germans, they're not even human beings.</span> <span id="s1971">Let them wash us and that's all, because they really had to scrub us and they took us on a boat at night.</span> <span id="s1972">They gave us army coats and we sat on the deck at night, wool blankets or something else.</span> <span id="s1973">It was very lovely.</span> <span id="s1974">They fed us.</span> <span id="s1975">They put us first in a place called .</span> <span id="s1976">It was a school, and they kept us in quarantine.</span> <span id="s1977">They boys were hanging through the windows looking for us, looking for girls, making dates the moment they let us out.</span> <span id="s1978">There were all kinds of dates, and then they took us to another camp in .</span> <span id="s1979">They started assigning people to work, so we were assigned to Northern Sweden.</span> <span id="s1980">This is, you see, talking about groups against groups.</span> <span id="s1981">Even in camps they were fighting.</span> <span id="s1982">After the liberation, there were incidents between the Poles and the Jews.</span> <span id="s1983">In Sweden, the camp that we were assigned to, my mother knew a man who really liked her and he said, oh I know a dentist, we need a dentist here and there were 200 Jews and 400 Poles in the camp.</span> <span id="s1984">They requested Mom by name.</span> <span id="s1985">We didn't want to go to Northern Sweden, but we had to go because they were requesting her not just a dentist, they wanted her.</span> <span id="s1986">By that time, there was a nurse, so I was signed up as her assistant.</span> <span id="s1987">We got there and the Jews were going.</span> <span id="s1988">What has happened?</span> <span id="s1989">They were fighting.</span> <span id="s1990">There was such incidents, such fighting, such name calling, that they took the Jews out and took them to another camp.</span> <span id="s1991">The Poles were so nasty and so anti-semitic.</span> <span id="s1992">So even there, after that happened, they were charming to us, I mean I was a Miss, but the Jews could not live in that camp with the Poles.</span> <span id="s1993">So, even then, and this is July August in '45, they still didn't have enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: You decided to go onto Sweden rather than go back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: We definitely didn't want to go to Poland.</span> <span id="s1996">I had an aunt here who left Germany before the war.</span> <span id="s1997">We wrote to her the first letter, turned out she got it.</span> <span id="s1998">We gave it to some British soldier to send it out, but she couldn't write to us in Germany.</span> <span id="s1999">The moment we got to Sweden, the first we went and put an application to the United States, so our order was very long.</span> <span id="s2000">We registered before even contacting, establishing contact with the family, and I found a crazy thing happened.</span> <span id="s2001">My mother had some cousins and we knew one of them in New York.</span> <span id="s2002">They were in the advertising business.</span> <span id="s2003">He came to Poland before the war, and we wrote a letter to David Glicksman in New York.</span> <span id="s2004">Well, David Glicksman changed his name to David Gipson.</span> <span id="s2005">His brothers didn't, but he changed it.</span> <span id="s2006">He lived in Manhattan and there must have been some kind of a dead letter office in New York, and after the war they must have been opening those letters and tracing people down.</span> <span id="s2007">The letter was written in German.</span> <span id="s2008">He got the letter.</span> <span id="s2009">My aunt lived in Washington.</span> <span id="s2010">He called her up.</span> <span id="s2011">A few days before I had an uncle, my mother had an brother in France who survived, and he contacted the family so we got established a contact and in a few days money was coming in and packages were coming in and telegrams were coming in and May 1946 we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: Let me just ask you a few general questions.</span> <span id="s2013">We just a have a couple more minutes.</span> <span id="s2014">It seems like your early days, your affluence, your family education, all of that really helped you survive the war years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s2016">I think so.</span> <span id="s2017">The fact that Mom was a dentist so she always either made money or later on we were in the position to be sheltered a little bit more.</span> <span id="s2018">The fact that I worked with Grandfather during the years in Ghetto, I really was very good at outpatient.</span> <span id="s2019">I wanted to be a surgeon.</span> <span id="s2020">I was very interested in medicine, and I was good at it, but when I came here I found out that I had to go back to school for a couple of years and by that time, I didn't have the means to go to medical school, and I really didn't want to go to be a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: When things were really, really difficult during those years, and there was a lot of depravation, what do you think sustained you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: I think the family unit.</span> <span id="s2023">The fact that we had the grandparents.</span> <span id="s2024">We had to take care of them.</span> <span id="s2025">The first few years in Ghetto, we had to take care of the older people, no matter what.</span> <span id="s2026">I mean we took care of my grandfather and he was such an unusual person.</span> <span id="s2027">He was a felcher and then he was grown up and then he went to dental school and became a dentist.</span> <span id="s2028">He was extremely educated, self, well read and self educated extremely wise man, very much a head of his time.</span> <span id="s2029">He believed in all kinds of inventions.</span> <span id="s2030">He believed in all modern gadgets.</span> <span id="s2031">The first modern gadget came in , I think my grandmother had one of the first electrical irons.</span> <span id="s2032">Things like this, he was very much.</span> <span id="s2033">He said there are ships waiting in America.</span> <span id="s2034">Any moment they'll liberate us.</span> <span id="s2035">They'll come in with food.</span> <span id="s2036">They'll invent a pill that you won't have to eat anything.</span> <span id="s2037">You'll just be able to take a pill and it will keep you going for a day.</span> <span id="s2038">Little did he realize the to eat was very pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: And the family unit sustained you because you lived with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: I lived with my mother.</span> <span id="s2041">As I said, when the times she was sick, I would take care of her, when I was sick, she would take care of me.</span> <span id="s2042">We watched each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: Did that sort of help you not to feel so isolated from the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s2045">I had her.</span> <span id="s2046">I was very close to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: When you think back, fifty years ago, your experiences, is there one haunting image?</span> <span id="s2048">Is there something you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: There is anger.</span> <span id="s2050">I get angry.</span> <span id="s2051">I watch something and I said how dare they do that to us.</span> <span id="s2052">How dare they made us subhumans.</span> <span id="s2053">I mean we're human beings and what audacity to treat us the way they treated us.</span> <span id="s2054">What nerve they had to kill us.</span> <span id="s2055">I mean it's such it doesn't mean if I meet a German I'm nasty to them, but I have a deep burning anger of why they did it.</span> <span id="s2056">What human being has a right to do to other human beings.</span> <span id="s2057">I mean we watch those things and we see those children.</span> <span id="s2058">What right do people have to do it.</span> <span id="s2059">But he was such a systematic deliberate and also the question of dehumanizing us.</span> <span id="s2060">People say why did you subject yourself.</span> <span id="s2061">They did it little by little.</span> <span id="s2062">Layers, they took layers, they took our apartment, they took the house, they took the privileges.</span> <span id="s2063">They kicked us out from the house.</span> <span id="s2064">They put us in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s2065">From the good conditions we wound up pour and no way of taking a bath and no way to shower yourself, living in that one room and gradually worse and worse and worse.</span> <span id="s2066">It wasn't like they took someone from a very fancy house and put them in camp.</span> <span id="s2067">Those people didn't survive, for the most part.</span> <span id="s2068">They broke down immediately.</span> <span id="s2069">They did it deliberately and gradually.</span> <span id="s2070">One step at a time, one humiliation.</span> <span id="s2071">The fact when we got to Auschwitz and they undressed us and we had to march in front of men.</span> <span id="s2072">And the women, there were religious women, elderly women, young girls, and I was a young girl.</span> <span id="s2073">I never undressed myself in front of any one.</span> <span id="s2074">Here I had to march naked in front of a bunch of men.</span> <span id="s2075">This is all humiliation.</span> <span id="s2076">This is all making people subhuman.</span> <span id="s2077">This is slowly and slowly and slowly so you had no we didn't have the strength to fight them.</span> <span id="s2078">There was no way of fighting them.</span> <span id="s2079">I mean sure there was uprising in Warsaw Ghetto, but there was no movement in Lodz Ghetto like this and saw to it.</span> <span id="s2080">There was no such thing as revolution and I get angry.</span> <span id="s2081">I get very angry.</span> <span id="s2082">That's why I'm doing this, why I'm speaking to people.</span> <span id="s2083">I want to leave the history.</span> <span id="s2084">I want that to be part of my history.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: Is there anything else you want to say?</span> <span id="s2086">A: No, do you have any questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: There was no thought of resistance or rebellion at ?</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: No.</span> <span id="s2089">We were busy.</span> <span id="s2090">We were busy and then the sickness.</span> <span id="s2091">It was overwhelming, just like a flood.</span> <span id="s2092">There was no dike, you could put your finger in and you couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s2093">You tried to do something, but there was nothing.</span> <span id="s2094">We had no means to help the people.</span> <span id="s2095">If they survived, they survived.</span> <span id="s2096">If they didn't survive, you couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s2097">Some cousin, my mother's cousin I found in one of the barracks, tried to get her something.</span> <span id="s2098">The fever took over, the typhus took over and she died.</span> <span id="s2099">I mean, you were helpless.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: But you must have felt you helped people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: Oh, you tried.</span> <span id="s2102">As I said the question was if someone wasn't very sick we could help them.</span> <span id="s2103">If we had the means, if we had the dressing, we had the pill we could give it them, maybe they'll survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s2105">A: You're welcome.</span></p></body></html>
