No, we moved to several places and actually grew up in Hindenburg, in Upper Silesia, where my parents manufactured liquor and they had a big business there.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q. Drinking liquor?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q. Was that an area for that—was it an unusual business?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A. No.</span> <span id="s14">It was not unusual and this was a mining district and the miners, when they came up they like to drink.</span> <span id="s15">So you found these gaststette almost everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q.</span> <span id="s17">About how many people did he employ?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A. Well, he had about eight people and he did a lot himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q. Could you tell me a little bit about your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A. I went to school, what you called a Lyceum, and I finished after ten years and I got a very good education.</span> <span id="s21">My parents gave me every opportunity—I played the piano, I learned to sing, I could ski, I could skate.</span> <span id="s22">They gave me every opportunity to learn sports, to everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q.</span> <span id="s24">While you were in school, did you have mostly Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A.</span> <span id="s26">We were three Jewish girls in our class—one was a redhead, one was dark and I was blond.</span> <span id="s27">Three out of thirty.</span> <span id="s28">The rest was mostly Catholic and a few</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Protestants.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q.</span> <span id="s31">How would you describe your relationship with the non-Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A.</span> <span id="s33">We were very close.</span> <span id="s34">There was no anti-Semitism at this time.</span> <span id="s35">They were very nice and the teachers were very nice.</span> <span id="s36">If you were a good student, you had a good standing in the class.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q.</span> <span id="s38">What did you hope to become after you finished school?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A. I wanted to study but that time, we didn’t have a Gymnasium for girls and in order to study, you had to make the Matura.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q. Like the aribtur?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A. Arbitur, right.</span> <span id="s42">And you could only do it in the neighboring cities, not in Hindenburg where I used to live.</span> <span id="s43">So I would have to get up at 5:00 in the morning and come home late and this was very inconvenient so I finished my school and went later to a business school and learned how to type and steno and everything that goes with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q.</span> <span id="s45">When you finished the business school, did you take a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A. Yes, I took a job in Breslau for a short time as a secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q.</span> <span id="s48">How far was Breslau?</span> <span id="s49">Were you able to commute?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A. Breslau was the capital of Silesia.</span> <span id="s51">No, that was not commuting.</span> <span id="s52">I had to move to</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q.</span> <span id="s55">Did you live in Breslau then by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s57">Later on I got married, my husband was from Hindenburg, too, and he came to Hindenburg to visit and he met me and we got married and moved to Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q.</span> <span id="s59">As a young married couple, did you participate in the cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A.</span> <span id="s61">We belonged to the B’nai Brith and we went to meetings but I had two children shortly after we got married and we also traveled a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q. By cultural events, I was including opera and concerts…</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A. Oh, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s64">We had a subscription for the opera.</span> <span id="s65">We had a subscription for the theaters.</span> <span id="s66">There were two theaters, one opera and one for lighter music-operettas.</span> <span id="s67">And we went twice a week to the theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q.</span> <span id="s69">You mentioned that you traveled a lot.</span> <span id="s70">What type of business was your husband in?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A.</span> <span id="s72">He was a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q.</span> <span id="s74">Did he practice in Germany only or internationally also?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A.</span> <span id="s76">In Germany only.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q.</span> <span id="s78">What type of law did he practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A.</span> <span id="s80">He was not specialized but he had many criminal cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q.</span> <span id="s82">In 1933 when Hitler came to power, how was your husband affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A. Well, it didn’t affect us because we didn’t take this matter seriously like most unfortunately.</span> <span id="s84">Everything went as usual.</span> <span id="s85">Then it started—his practice wasn’t so good anymore.</span> <span id="s86">The gentile clients didn’t come.</span> <span id="s87">So we gave up our beautiful apartment and moved downtown and had the practice and our apartment together.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q. Were most of your husband’s clients gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A. Yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q. Was he allowed to practice as far as the German government…</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A. Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s92">Most of the younger lawyers were not allowed to practice anymore but he was one of the older lawyers and he was allowed to practice until he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q.</span> <span id="s94">As a lawyer, how did your husband feel about the belief that Hitler wouldn’t last long?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A. Well, he felt the same as I did otherwise we would have left earlier probably.</span> <span id="s96">And I still had my parents in Upper Silesia in Boiten.</span> <span id="s97">Of course, we were thinking of emigrating and we prepared already.</span> <span id="s98">We got affidavits from distant relatives here and little by little prepared to emigrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q.</span> <span id="s100">When did you first think about emigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A. I think after Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q.</span> <span id="s103">But up to 1938…</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A. No, we wanted to emigrate earlier but for some reason—my parents were still there and I don’t know—there is something in a human being that they push things away, the bad things away and hope that things will take a turn for the better.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q.</span> <span id="s106">How did you notice the difference in the gentile attitude towards the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A. Oh yes.</span> <span id="s108">That was very noticeable right away.</span> <span id="s109">They were not so friendly anymore.</span> <span id="s110">I could only have a maid who was over 45.</span> <span id="s111">And the milkman was not so friendly anymore and the grocer was not very friendly anymore.</span> <span id="s112">And later, much later, there were certain hours when the Jews could shop and there wasn’t much left then but this was when my husband was in Cuba already.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q.</span> <span id="s114">You mentioned that you had two daughters.</span> <span id="s115">Were they in school at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s117">They were in private Jewish school—that time already.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q.</span> <span id="s119">How did you shelter them from the unfriendliness?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A.</span> <span id="s121">That time they were about 10- 12 years old –they didn’t complain too much and since they went to a private Jewish school, they didn’t get in contact with the other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q.</span> <span id="s123">Did you belong to a congregation at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A. Yes, we did but as I said, we were members of the B’nai Brith.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q.</span> <span id="s126">Did you notice when you were in the synagogue or at the B’nai Brith meetings, were most of the people talking about the Auswanderung or did the rabbi give…</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A.</span> <span id="s128">This was the only conversation.</span> <span id="s129">We saw my relatives packing and going—to South America, to Shanghai and we, of course, planned, too.</span> <span id="s130">My brother-in-law, he was a ship doctor with the Nord Deutsche Lloyd and he wrote to the line—yes, he did them a great favor.</span> <span id="s131">When he was a ship doctor during World War I and he was that time in China with a ship from the Nord Deutsche Lloyd and he was able to take all the silver and brought it to a forwarded and asked him to hide it until somebody, the firm will claim it.</span> <span id="s132">He really saved the whole silver for the Nord Deutsche Lloyd and they didn’t forget it.</span> <span id="s133">And when he was ready to go—he was a doctor in Berlin, with his wife and two little boys, and he got his visa right away to Cuba and took one brother along and my husband with one daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q. Was this after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A. No.</span> <span id="s136">I think that was shortly before the Kristallnacht because my husband left after Kristallnacht but he didn’t go together with them.</span> <span id="s137">He went separately to Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q.</span> <span id="s139">What happened to you on Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A. Early in the morning, the bell rang and a woman came.</span> <span id="s141">She was my husband’s client and she was very grateful to him and she warned him about what was going to happen—that they arrest the Jews and bring them to a concentration camp and things like this.</span> <span id="s142">So my husband dressed and took Laurie along, my daughter, and she carried a briefcase and in the briefcase he had a nightshirt and some toilet articles and they went to the station but they didn’t go the main street, they went around and came to the station.</span> <span id="s143">My husband went to my parents, to Boiten.</span> <span id="s144">There, my father was imprisoned already and everything—my parents’ apartment, it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s145">The chandeliers they took down and smashed them to pieces.</span> <span id="s146">Everything was broken.</span> <span id="s147">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s148">Even my mother’s needlework, they pushed a bayonet through the needlework.</span> <span id="s149">What they did to the china—everything was completely destroyed—this apartment.</span> <span id="s150">And this is when my parents moved to my apartment in Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q.</span> <span id="s152">But your husband went to your parents’ apartment…</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s154">He went there and my mother had gone to the old age home to find shelter—she had a sister there and there was a decent gentile man who bought my parents’ house and he was a very decent man and he was at the station when my husband came.</span> <span id="s155">He must have called to my husband “Are you Dr. Schutz?”</span> <span id="s156">And my husband answered and this man took him to my mother and he brought my husband to the altersheim (old age home) because my husband didn’t know where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q. Your husband was saved…</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A.</span> <span id="s159">He was not taken thanks to that woman who warned him.</span> <span id="s160">And he came home about three days later.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q. Let me just go back for a moment, when you were in Breslau did you ever see signs Juden Unerwuenscht.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A. Oh sure.</span> <span id="s163">Many signs.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q.</span> <span id="s165">Did your husband feel, due to these signs and his practice falling away, the pressure to emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A. Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q.</span> <span id="s168">When did you apply for a visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A.</span> <span id="s170">We applied very early for a visa.</span> <span id="s171">My mother-in-law had very distant relatives—they had a very big factory here—Kleinert—they made the shields and Mr. Kleinert gave a visa for my husband.</span> <span id="s172">And it was usually like that—if the husband went to America, he was allowed to write for his wife to come, too, and she got the visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q. Was America the first place you considered?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s175">My husband went to Cuba but I came directly to the United States because I had the American visa already from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q. I meant whether America was the only place you considered going?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s178">We wanted to go to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q.</span> <span id="s180">Why did you choose the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A.</span> <span id="s182">We thought that this would be the land of milk and honey—this is the best land.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q. Your husband had been quite successful in Germany.</span> <span id="s184">Do you remember his feelings when his business started going down?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A. Of course, he was depressed and it was really terrible.</span> <span id="s186">In the end, nobody came anymore and the only way was out.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q.</span> <span id="s188">You mentioned that you arranged for your husband to get out first.</span> <span id="s189">He had his affidavit and how did he arrange to leave for Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A.</span> <span id="s191">At that time I don’t know how he got passage for himself and for my daughter and I brought him to Hamburg to say goodbye to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q.</span> <span id="s193">That must have been a very difficult day for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A. Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s195">Crying a lot—to say goodbye to him and my daughter because I didn’t know if I ever see him again.</span> <span id="s196">But in all the excitement, I didn’t forget to take all my jewelry and slip it into his suitcase on the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q. Was he only able to leave with the 10 RM?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s199">He took very little along.</span> <span id="s200">I think I arrived here with $3.50.</span> <span id="s201">That was what they allowed to take out.</span> <span id="s202">And later on, when I packed and when my husband was gone already, I was ready to go, I brought my furniture with me but I had to pay a duty so that I could take my own furniture out.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q.</span> <span id="s204">When your husband had booked passage for Cuba, was that the only way…?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A.</span> <span id="s206">He wanted to go with his brothers and through his brother who had some connections, he got the visa to go to Cuba with his daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q.</span> <span id="s208">After your husband left, how did you manage?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A.</span> <span id="s210">We were separated for about 9 months.</span> <span id="s211">I lived with my parents and so it wasn’t so bad—I wasn’t alone and with my youngest daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q.</span> <span id="s213">How did your parents, who were getting older…?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A.</span> <span id="s215">They weren’t too old.</span> <span id="s216">They were 64 and 66 at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q.</span> <span id="s218">Did they try to emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A.</span> <span id="s220">You know how people are—when it comes to money, my father was a self-made man.</span> <span id="s221">He started out with nothing and became a very wealthy man.</span> <span id="s222">He had his house and his factory.</span> <span id="s223">So he was not so eager to leave.</span> <span id="s224">He got an affidavit very early and put it away and when he needed it, it wasn’t good anymore and they put him at the end of the list.</span> <span id="s225">There was no hope that he could come direct to America so when we were in America—when we both were here, we sent my parents a vista and paid $500.</span> <span id="s226">for the visa which was a lot of money at that time but unfortunately, they didn’t let them out anymore.</span> <span id="s227">It was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q.</span> <span id="s229">How did you emigrate to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A.</span> <span id="s231">That was quite interesting.</span> <span id="s232">I left I think September 5th, 1940.</span> <span id="s233">The only way was via Russia and Japan to come to America and the Hilfsverein in Breslau helped me to arrange that adventurous trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q. September 1940 was a year after the war broke out.</span> <span id="s235">What were things like for you in Breslau during that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A.</span> <span id="s237">It was very bad.</span> <span id="s238">It was actually for nobody enough to eat.</span> <span id="s239">I remember we once got a goose and had to close the windows so that nobody would smell it—that we have something to eat, and wouldn’t come and take it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q. Were you afraid to go on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A. No, it wasn’t that bad yet but shortly after I left, they started wearing that yellow star.</span> <span id="s242">I didn’t have to but very shortly after I left, they started.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q. Were your children still able to go to the Jewish school, your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s245">My daughter went to the Jewish school, not a private school anymore but the Jews had a Jewish school where they got their lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q. Was she at all frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A.</span> <span id="s248">She was not too frightened because she was among Jews—Jewish teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q.</span> <span id="s250">How did you explain all this to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A. I didn’t have to explain.</span> <span id="s252">She lived through it all and she was a smart child and she noticed everything and this was a daily conversation, you know between us and parents.</span> <span id="s253">I didn’t have to explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q. Children like to belong and when she heard things like Juden Unerwuenscht, how…</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A.</span> <span id="s256">She took it for granted already that we must be something different.</span> <span id="s257">We didn’t look different but she must have felt it that we were different from the crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q.</span> <span id="s259">How did you arrange for your emigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A.</span> <span id="s261">The Hifsverein helped me.</span> <span id="s262">The trip was paid for by me in Breslau—the whole trip was paid and they gave us a date and they gave us a time table—what to do and when to leave, where to go and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q. Including trains and…</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A. Including trains.</span> <span id="s265">The trip was paid for by me in Breslau to the Hilfsverein.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q. On the day that you left, what were your feelings…</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A. My feelings—I cannot describe it anymore because it was so sad to say goodbye to my parents.</span> <span id="s268">Fortunately, there was a visitor, an uncle was there so they were not completely alone when I left.</span> <span id="s269">It was such a terrible feeling to say goodbye and my father cried and my mother cried and we all cried and I just told them they will come soon and they shouldn’t worry so much, I will see to it that they will come.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q.</span> <span id="s271">Did you believe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A. Yes, I believed it at the time and I made all the efforts as I said before, I bought the visas for $500.</span> <span id="s273">which, again I repeat myself, was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s274">You could buy a house that time for that kind of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q.</span> <span id="s276">Did the Germans make it difficult t for you in any way to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A. No.</span> <span id="s278">This trip was arranged and I had no…from Breslau, if there were many people from Breslau who left with me…we were completely separated until the border when we had to cross the German border, then everybody was there.</span> <span id="s279">I went alone with my daughter to Berlin and from Berlin we went to Konigsberg and from there to the border which was not very far.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q. Was this a German train?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A. No, that train went over Vilna to Moscow.</span> <span id="s282">In Moscow we met people who—we had to wait for the trans-Siberian express.</span> <span id="s283">The trans-Siberian express left twice a week only so we had to wait for two days for that express and we met a lot of people who used the same route.</span> <span id="s284">And they brought us to a very fine hotel in Moscow and we even did some sightseeing.</span> <span id="s285">It was a beautiful city with broad avenues—of course, they only showed us the beautiful things in Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q. Were you able to take any money along to pay not for the hotels and the train but for food or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A. No, we didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s288">Later on, I will tell you how we got to a little money.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q.</span> <span id="s290">When you were in Moscow, and traveling, how did you manage to get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A. Well, there was a dining car in the train and we could get our three meals a day.</span> <span id="s292">This was all part of what we had paid to the Hilfsverein.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q. From Moscow how did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A. From Moscow, that was very interesting, that was a completely different train.</span> <span id="s295">There was always one place short.</span> <span id="s296">I guess we were about 80 – 100 people left at the same time.</span> <span id="s297">And if we were 100 people, there were 99 seats—one was short.</span> <span id="s298">And you can imagine how people were running for their seats.</span> <span id="s299">It started awful—that trip—until Moscow, we had second-class—upholstered class.</span> <span id="s300">And we thought it would go on like this.</span> <span id="s301">But when we came to the trans-Siberian express we noticed that we had holtz classe and my daughter and I had the seats in the very last compartment—the very last wagon.</span> <span id="s302">So this was a terrible thing because these last wagons were only connected with the trans-Siberian express through a walk and two chains were on either side to hold on.</span> <span id="s303">It was really dangerous, to go to the dining car for instance.</span> <span id="s304">Later on, I made the acquaintance of the leader of the intourist and he was a very kind young man and helped us to get into the main train and there were had separate compartments, my daughter and I. I slept with a woman and two young men and arranged it very nicely.</span> <span id="s305">First the women went inside and got undressed—we never got completely undressed.</span> <span id="s306">We just kept on our underwear and wore pajamas and then came the young men and slept on the upper berths.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q.</span> <span id="s308">You said holts classe.</span> <span id="s309">How would you describe this?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A.</span> <span id="s311">It was very primitive, very old cars, very primitive.</span> <span id="s312">It was just impossible to spend there two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q. Were there bathroom facilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A. Yes, but you can imagine with 100 people and the usual travelers—the Russians—how busy these bathrooms were always.</span> <span id="s315">The dining room—the facilities were also very primitive.</span> <span id="s316">They couldn’t do better even if they wanted.</span> <span id="s317">If you looked through a glass of tea, it was cloudy.</span> <span id="s318">But we didn’t complain because we were not spoiled from what we had in Germany and we were happy to be there and we made friends and the trip was quite nice and interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q. Were you able to get off the train at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A. No, that was very dangerous to get off the train.</span> <span id="s321">People certainly wanted to stretch their legs a little bit when the train stopped after three or four hours when there was a stop.</span> <span id="s322">But the trains started very slowly and you didn’t hear a whistle—nothing.</span> <span id="s323">And all of a sudden, these people had to run to catch the train and get on.</span> <span id="s324">I never went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q.</span> <span id="s326">How were you able to make yourself understood?</span> <span id="s327">The people running the trains were Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A. Yes, but they spoke German.</span> <span id="s329">And there were a few Russians who traveled with us—doctors, engineers and highly educated people and I must say they were lovely, they were wonderful people and they mostly spoke German.</span> <span id="s330">And of course, the leader of the whole transport from Intourist, he also spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q.</span> <span id="s332">What route did you follow from Moscow?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A.</span> <span id="s334">We went through Tomsk, Omsk, Novosibirsk which is in the Urals, then you come to Asia.</span> <span id="s335">After Novosibirsk we traveled hours and hours and hours until the train stopped.</span> <span id="s336">And then we came to that famous Baikal Sea.</span> <span id="s337">We traveled for a whole day and made only half of that sea.</span> <span id="s338">You can imagine how big this was.</span> <span id="s339">But the landscape was very beautiful in Siberia.</span> <span id="s340">It was September and everything was still green, the woods and forests and it is a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s341">Very few houses you saw and when we stopped in one of those little—few stops, the peasants came and offered us to buy some apples and whatever they had—they didn’t have much but we didn’t have money to buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q. Was your end stop to be Vladivostok?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A. No, we went a different way.</span> <span id="s344">We went to the Manchukuo border.</span> <span id="s345">Manchukuo isn’t anymore.</span> <span id="s346">It is Korea and China—that time the Japanese, they took the land—they just marched in and made Manchukuo out of a big part of China and the capital was Harbin.</span> <span id="s347">When we came to Manchukuo, there is this what I wrote which I could read quickly what happened in Manchuli.</span> <span id="s348">Manchuli was the first city in Manchukuo.</span> <span id="s349">Der erste ort war Manchuli…</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q.</span> <span id="s351">You mention that the women got holtz…</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A. Little pieces of wood, like a cushion.</span> <span id="s353">It was for the frissure because the Japanese have a very artful hairstyle and so it doesn’t go to pieces right away, they sleep with a cushion—a pillow filled with little pieces of wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q.</span> <span id="s355">How did your daughter react to this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A. Well, she took this in good spirit like a kid, new impressions.</span> <span id="s357">There were other children on the train, too, and I hardly saw her during the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q.</span> <span id="s359">You mentioned that you were sleeping 10 together.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A. Yes, five in each direction—you know, heads together.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q. Men and women together?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A. Sure.</span> <span id="s363">We never undressed completely.</span> <span id="s364">You’d be surprised how good you can sleep without changing clothes and very often, I noticed that I went to bed with my shoes still on.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q.</span> <span id="s366">How were these beds set up?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A.</span> <span id="s368">They were against the wall, the beds, and in the evening we let them out and we had cushions and blankets.</span> <span id="s369">They were young boys and we always said it has to be clean here.</span> <span id="s370">Everything you have to keep law and order here in our compartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q.</span> <span id="s372">What did the other people say about the hotels in Machuli?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A.</span> <span id="s374">They thought it was terrible.</span> <span id="s375">Bedbugs and other pleasant things.</span> <span id="s376">This was the only clean place—that his why he brought us here.</span> <span id="s377">We just happened to be standing there on the corner and waiting and finally he came.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q.</span> <span id="s379">When you arrived in Harbin…</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A. Let me just tell you a little episode from Harbin.</span> <span id="s381">When we arrived in Harbin, there were people there already who left Germany and settled in Harbin.</span> <span id="s382">They greeted us when we came and my daughter found a girl she had gone to school with and they were very friendly and brought us to a hotel and we got dinner and they were very helpful and I bought tea, I don’t know how I paid for it—but I bought tea and sent it from Harbin to my parents in Breslau.</span> <span id="s383">That was the only thing I could send.</span> <span id="s384">I remember my daughter had a sore throat and I said for heaven sakes, what are we going to do now?</span> <span id="s385">There was a doctor there—a German doctor and he fixed her up somewhere outside in a corner—her fixed her up and she was alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q.</span> <span id="s387">Did they help you while you were in Harbin?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A.</span> <span id="s389">We didn’t sleep in Harbin.</span> <span id="s390">We arrived in the morning and left in the evening.</span> <span id="s391">But they were very friendly and helpful but we had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q. Where did you go from Harbin?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A. From Harbin we went to Manchuli.</span> <span id="s394">And that was very funny.</span> <span id="s395">In Manchuli they took away the sleeping facilities—the tickets for sleeping cars—and gave us money instead.</span> <span id="s396">The Hilfsverein or whoever it was, which authority it was, I don’t know, took away our sleeping cards and we couldn’t sleep anymore for several days—only sitting up.</span> <span id="s397">But we had a little money so then we didn’t travel like schnorrers (beggars).</span> <span id="s398">We had money in our hands—maybe if it was a lot, maybe it was ten dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q. Were you able to use this money in Manchuko?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A. No, we didn’t spend money.</span> <span id="s401">Everything was paid up.</span> <span id="s402">And when we left Manchuko, we went to what is now South Korea and we arrived in Pusan and there we waited for a boat to bring us to Japan.</span> <span id="s403">The boat was there and it was really a wonder—the sea was quiet.</span> <span id="s404">It is usually a very stormy sea and we came to Shimonoseki.</span> <span id="s405">Shimonoseki was one of the places which was bombed from the A-bomb.</span> <span id="s406">And there a train was waiting to bring us to Kobe.</span> <span id="s407">In the meantime, I was so tired from sitting up for three nights at least, that I said I stay in Kobe and I don’t want to travel any further.</span> <span id="s408">I want to sleep, I want to sleep.</span> <span id="s409">The people said don’t do that, don’t do that, don’t separate yourself from us because we don’t know what will happen to you.</span> <span id="s410">And in Kobe, I met a friend who was waiting for a boat which would bring her to Manila.</span> <span id="s411">Then from Kobe we went to Yokohama.</span> <span id="s412">Japan is such a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s413">We saw the Fujiyama.</span> <span id="s414">It is such a beautiful country—it is like a fairy tale.</span> <span id="s415">We boarded the train from Kobe to Yokohama then and there we made friends already and in Yokohama, we went out—we went out to eat and we felt like menchen (people) again.</span> <span id="s416">Yokohama was a beautiful city and there we got the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q.</span> <span id="s418">Did you have a deadline—did you have to make a certain boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A.</span> <span id="s420">We better made it because we had to cling to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q. I meant was there a certain date by which you had to be in Yokohama?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A. Yes, definitely yes.</span> <span id="s423">We couldn’t take another boat, we had to take that boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q. Was your visa only in effect up to a certain date?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A. Probably.</span> <span id="s426">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s427">I mean there was no rush to go there because the trip took us four week—from Breslau to Seattle—four weeks so there was no other way to go and we had to stick together.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q.</span> <span id="s429">What kind of boat was it that you boarded in Yokohama for America?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A.</span> <span id="s431">It was a Japanese boat—the worst you can imagine.</span> <span id="s432">We had—there was tourist class and there was second class.</span> <span id="s433">We were tourist class, my daughter and I.</span> <span id="s434">It was down, you had to go down.</span> <span id="s435">This board was loaded with watermelons—but there was a reason for it.</span> <span id="s436">They needed the space—the watermelons they disposed in America and they loaded the boat with iron and scrap metal—things they needed later to declare war on America.</span> <span id="s437">They loaded it with material in America—but we had watermelons.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q.</span> <span id="s439">What kind of facilities were there on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A.</span> <span id="s441">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s442">I got seasick the very same evening.</span> <span id="s443">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s444">I was seasick for a few days.</span> <span id="s445">I hardly wanted to get up and it was just awful.</span> <span id="s446">Finally a gentleman came down, very nice man, and said get dressed and come up.</span> <span id="s447">So we went up, my daughter, a child is not so seasick.</span> <span id="s448">But I went up and he put me up there on the deck and I felt much better there.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q.</span> <span id="s450">What about the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A.</span> <span id="s452">The food was horrible.</span> <span id="s453">It was unbelievably bad.</span> <span id="s454">But this man arranged that I could eat in the second class and then it was much better.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q. Was it Japanese food?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A.</span> <span id="s457">It was a mixture of everything.</span> <span id="s458">I don’t know that it was Japanese food.</span> <span id="s459">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s460">The Japanese food I didn’t like when I was in Manchuko, in Kobe, in Yokohama—it was kinds of raw fish that they eat and things we were not used to.</span> <span id="s461">But of course, in second class the food was much better.</span> <span id="s462">I was so happy that I could eat there.</span> <span id="s463">Then I wasn’t seasick anymore.</span> <span id="s464">We got used to it and finally, we approached the American coast and this I never will forget.</span> <span id="s465">We were heading for Vancouver and it was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s466">There were all these little islands and I must repeat myself, it was like a fairy tale.</span> <span id="s467">Pine trees, wonderful pine trees.</span> <span id="s468">But when we came to Vancouver, we couldn’t leave the boat because we didn’t have a Canadian visa—we had to stay on board.</span> <span id="s469">Then we came to Seattle, which was our destination.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q.</span> <span id="s471">One thing before we go on to your life in America.</span> <span id="s472">How did you find out about arranging for this trip with the Hilfsverein?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A. I got a kind of pamphlet where everything was written down.</span> <span id="s474">I got it from the Hilfsverein and they had everything written down, where we would stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q.</span> <span id="s476">But how did you know that this was available through the Hilfsverein?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A.</span> <span id="s478">That was easy.</span> <span id="s479">Everybody went there for information, for everything.</span> <span id="s480">And they advised me that that was the only way—the only possibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q.</span> <span id="s482">When you arrived in Seattle, were you planning to come right to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s484">My husband lived in New York and he unpacked the life van I had sent with our furniture.</span> <span id="s485">So, we were in Seattle for a few days until the money arrived to bring us to New York.</span> <span id="s486">This the Hilfsverein didn’t pay anymore.</span> <span id="s487">My husband had to raise the money, somehow and sent us the money and we went for three days and four nights in the train from Seattle to New York—there were no planes then.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q. I’m sure you didn’t want to see another train for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A. No.</span> <span id="s490">I arrived in Penn Station.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Tape Turned</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q.</span> <span id="s493">After having crossed Europe, Asia and now America, what were your impressions of America?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A. I was stunned.</span> <span id="s495">The greatest impression I had was when I went to a supermarket and saw the meat there and the fruit and saw everything and later on, I saw the bread and everything in the wastebasket and I couldn’t understand that this would—I really couldn’t understand how people could throw food away.</span> <span id="s496">I said, my gosh, that must be the land of waste, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q.</span> <span id="s498">When did you first go into a supermarket?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A.</span> <span id="s500">In Seattle, we could move freely around.</span> <span id="s501">We went for walks.</span> <span id="s502">Seattle is a beautiful city, as a matter of fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q.</span> <span id="s504">How did you make yourself understood?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A. I spoke English.</span> <span id="s506">I learned it in school.</span> <span id="s507">I also spoke French fluently but unfortunately, I forgot a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q.</span> <span id="s509">So English was not a problem for you…</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A. Well, it was a problem, you know.</span> <span id="s511">Today I am not perfect.</span> <span id="s512">I’m sometimes searching for words, for the right expression.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q. I want to ask you something in terms of your husband.</span> <span id="s514">When did he go to Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A.</span> <span id="s516">He emigrated shortly after the Kristallnacht—no he emigrated in February, 1939 and he was in Cuba for nine months and then he came to New York.</span> <span id="s517">And I arrived in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q.</span> <span id="s519">How did your husband manage to support himself during the early time in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A. Shall I tell you the truth?</span> <span id="s521">I sold things which I sent here.</span> <span id="s522">He was not the youngest man anymore.</span> <span id="s523">He used to be a lawyer.</span> <span id="s524">It was very hard for him to find a job.</span> <span id="s525">He sold—when I came I didn’t find my silver, my beautiful china.</span> <span id="s526">He lived off that—he had to live.</span> <span id="s527">He sold the Bechstein baby grand which I had sent—he sold that.</span> <span id="s528">Well, I don’t blame him and I didn’t have so much to clean anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q.</span> <span id="s530">You were able to send that in a lift?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s532">And strangely enough, it arrived in August very shortly before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s533">Everything came in very good condition—not a cup was broken.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q.</span> <span id="s535">How did your husband feel—he had been very successful in Europe…?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A.</span> <span id="s537">He was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s538">He was VERY unhappy.</span> <span id="s539">He really didn’t know what to do first and the Council of Jewish Women, what we called the Hilfsverein over there, I still remember they were on Times Square was the office and whenever I go—which happens very very seldom to Times Square, I have the funny feeling that we went up there and we hoped to get a job but nothing doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q.</span> <span id="s541">Did your husband have any possibility of going back to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A. My husband was fifty-five years old when he arrived here and he had terrible trouble with the language.</span> <span id="s543">We went to Mr. Kleinert, the man who gave my husband the affidavit, and we hoped that he would give him a job but he did not.</span> <span id="s544">He had a factory somewhere in Astoria but he did not.</span> <span id="s545">He was good enough to give him the affidavit but this was it.</span> <span id="s546">And I talked to Mr. Kleinert and I said to him “don’t you think it would be better if we leave New York?”</span> <span id="s547">because there is actually no chance for my husband to find a job here.</span> <span id="s548">He said you’re a very smart girl and he arranged it somehow and the Council proposed that we should go to Indianapolis, Indiana—that the money was just on the street—that you just have to bend down and pick it up—it was the right place to go.</span> <span id="s549">So after three months in New York and I tried to make a little money by helping out people so we left with our furniture—Mr. Kleinert paid for that—and came to Indianapolis, Indiana.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q.</span> <span id="s551">How had you tried to help out?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A. Well, a woman moved in the building and I helped her put the furniture and I worked in her apartment for a whole day—she was out and in the evening, she came back and she gave me one dollar and the way I looked at the dollar—she said this seems to be the first dollar you saw or you earned.</span> <span id="s553">And I said yes, you are right, it is the first dollar.</span> <span id="s554">But I didn’t complain—money was rare.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q.</span> <span id="s556">Did your husband object to your working?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A. No.</span> <span id="s558">Later on I went, we used to live in Elmhurst, he had an apartment in Elmhurst.</span> <span id="s559">Then we took a roomer in, a friend of us and we gave him a room and that helped a little bit to pay the rent.</span> <span id="s560">But it was—I couldn’t find a job and I was dissatisfied.</span> <span id="s561">I wanted to leave New York and then we went to Indianapolis and we stood there for three years.</span> <span id="s562">The Council or whatever it was, from the Jewish community, gave me a job with a gentleman—I should cook for him, I should clean the house.</span> <span id="s563">I did it for a few weeks but he was a very unpleasant man—he was a refugee as a matter of fact, from Nuremberg—he came here with plenty of money—he had bought a house right away.</span> <span id="s564">He was very unfriendly.</span> <span id="s565">I had to cook and eat in the kitchen while he ate in the dining room, etc.</span> <span id="s566">So, I said to the man who got me the job, “Listen, this is not a job for me.</span> <span id="s567">I want to work.</span> <span id="s568">I want to do something.”</span> <span id="s569">He said I have a job for you.</span> <span id="s570">You will work for as a biller.</span> <span id="s571">Do you know what a biller is?</span> <span id="s572">Somebody who writes invoices.</span> <span id="s573">I said to him do you think I can do this?</span> <span id="s574">He said you will do it.</span> <span id="s575">I know a company who is looking for a biller.</span> <span id="s576">Well, I was in this country four months.</span> <span id="s577">So I went to this gentleman, Mr. Silverman.</span> <span id="s578">He was a very nice man and he said can you do some figuring?</span> <span id="s579">Oh yes, I said.</span> <span id="s580">This was my worst thing in school but I said “Oh yes, I can.”</span> <span id="s581">So, you can start tomorrow.</span> <span id="s582">I was very happy.</span> <span id="s583">He also asked me can you type?</span> <span id="s584">Yes, I can type.</span> <span id="s585">I did the typing with three fingers.</span> <span id="s586">I came the next day and everything was very nice but I couldn’t read the orders I had to type—the invoices.</span> <span id="s587">I couldn’t read especially—this was very funny—my boss, his wife, two sisters married two brothers and only the man was—he wanted me to stay and he helped me to learn and to do it.</span> <span id="s588">And very often I went by bus from where we lived with tears rolling down my face because these three others were so horrible.</span> <span id="s589">But this man kept me for some reason and I made it!</span> <span id="s590">I made it!</span> <span id="s591">I came home—I made eighteen dollars a week.</span> <span id="s592">I came home once, my husband said our troubles are over!</span> <span id="s593">I said what is the matter?</span> <span id="s594">I rented a restaurant.</span> <span id="s595">You will do the cooking and I’m going to help you out—it is a very beautiful restaurant near the railroad station and business is excellent.</span> <span id="s596">I said I have to give up my job (dejected).</span> <span id="s597">He said yes, you have to give up your job because we want to work on our own now.</span> <span id="s598">So, the next day I went to work and I said to Mr. Silverman, I’m very sorry but I have to quit.</span> <span id="s599">My husband rented a restaurant and he needs me.</span> <span id="s600">Well, he was very mad—he was so annoyed.</span> <span id="s601">Finally, he brought me where I had to be—I wrote beautiful invoices—no mistakes and on a billing machine and I quit.</span> <span id="s602">The day I quit, there was nobody from the bosses to be seen, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s603">I just left.</span> <span id="s604">They were so mad at me.</span> <span id="s605">After all the trouble they went through, I had to quit.</span> <span id="s606">Well, this restaurant we had three weeks.</span> <span id="s607">We had it for three weeks.</span> <span id="s608">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s609">I don’t want to go closer into it.</span> <span id="s610">It was simply awful.</span> <span id="s611">We couldn’t manage that and nobody came in—no customer came in anymore.</span> <span id="s612">After three weeks, we gave up.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q.</span> <span id="s614">What kind of experience did you have to cook in something like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A. I could cook.</span> <span id="s616">The food wasn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s617">But you need experience to do something like this and we didn’t have the experience.</span> <span id="s618">So the customers, one after the other, left and finally we had to give up.</span> <span id="s619">So, in the meantime, I went to the Jewish Council and said, listen, I cannot find a job where I cannot type properly.</span> <span id="s620">So they arranged it that I went to business school and I learned how to type with ten fingers.</span> <span id="s621">They paid for it and I looked a little bit as they taught comptometry because I needed it.</span> <span id="s622">The multiplication was what I needed and I was very interested and I said this I can do, too.</span> <span id="s623">So, anyway, I looked for a job and I found a beautiful job with the American Optical Company.</span> <span id="s624">This was a nationwide company and it was really a dream of a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q.</span> <span id="s626">What was your husband doing while you were doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A. My husband changed jobs in the meantime.</span> <span id="s628">First, he had a job—somebody gave him a job and he wasn’t very good in jobs—I’ll tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s629">When a boss told him, you have to take a package and bring it there and there, to a company he took the package where it was going and went home.</span> <span id="s630">He couldn’t lower himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q.</span> <span id="s632">It must have been very difficult for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A.</span> <span id="s634">It was.</span> <span id="s635">Actually, I worked all the time and my children—babysitting was a little money.</span> <span id="s636">And they had little jobs.</span> <span id="s637">One worked in a drug store—behind the counter a little bit.</span> <span id="s638">It was terribly hard time.</span> <span id="s639">I had several good jobs then and I always quit these jobs and bettered myself.</span> <span id="s640">My last job was with Mayflower, the moving company.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q.</span> <span id="s642">This job with American Optical was in Indianapolis?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A. Yes, they were all in Indianapolis.</span> <span id="s644">Mayflower, too.</span> <span id="s645">And in Mayflower—the first day, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s646">I didn’t understand too much what my boss said but he probably said—this was the first time that a biller could write an invoice.</span> <span id="s647">And I was pretty good there.</span> <span id="s648">I must say myself.</span> <span id="s649">But the people in Mayflower were real anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s650">We were three Jews.</span> <span id="s651">There were about 200 employees and we were three Jews and they let us know.</span> <span id="s652">They were very mean.</span> <span id="s653">I did a good job there and they couldn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s654">It was very unpleasant to work there and since I wrote invoices for people who moved from California to Chicago or from Chicago to Louisiana or whatever, I started getting so involved that I said to my husband I’m going to write my own invoice now—from Indianapolis back to New York and that’s what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q.</span> <span id="s656">Why did you want to come back to New York since it was you who…</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A.</span> <span id="s658">We had friends here, my sister lived here and I saw this is not the place for us.</span> <span id="s659">The other refugees were very happy there.</span> <span id="s660">They came from small towns: West Deutsche Juden and they were happy there but I felt I do not belong there and I wasn’t happy there.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q.</span> <span id="s662">How did your husband feel about going back to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A. Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s664">It was good.</span> <span id="s665">So we came back to New York and my husband found a nice apartment.</span> <span id="s666">I was delighted when I came here because he left a few—maybe two weeks earlier to look for an apartment until we took our furniture back again to New York and we moved to Washington Heights where we had a beautiful five room apartment on 172nd Street close to Ft. Washington Avenue.</span> <span id="s667">Our friends lived there and that’s why we moved there.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q.</span> <span id="s669">When you came back to New York, did both of you start to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A. Well, my husband had the same trouble.</span> <span id="s671">He couldn’t find a job.</span> <span id="s672">I found a job right away.</span> <span id="s673">I worked as a biller and he met a man and they made a business together—he opened up a store but no success whatsoever.</span> <span id="s674">Finally, in 1950, he found a job with Duparquet—that was an outfitting company for restaurants.</span> <span id="s675">My husband found a job there—there was an ad in the paper and when he got there, he saw a lot of young, able, good-looking young men sitting there waiting to be called and he put down his resume—he had a beautiful handwriting, my husband, and they gave him the job.</span> <span id="s676">He said, excuse me, but I would like to know why did you give me the job when there were so many young men outside sitting there waiting?</span> <span id="s677">They said we had experience with young men—they have their minds someplace else and we want a man who will stick to his job.</span> <span id="s678">And he had this job from—about 5 or 6 years and he was very happy in this job.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q.</span> <span id="s680">The reason I asked you so many questions about your husband is that law is basically a non-transferable profession and…</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A. Correct.</span> <span id="s682">Many made it—they made the examination and were admitted to the bar, many but they probably were younger or maybe they were stronger, maybe they mastered the language better than my husband.</span> <span id="s683">I don’t think he could have worked as a lawyer here.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q.</span> <span id="s685">A lawyer was a very respected position in Germany and it must be very difficult to come…</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A.</span> <span id="s687">It was very hard for him.</span> <span id="s688">He had to lower himself and he didn’t want to do that—he fought it.</span> <span id="s689">And then after 1953, 1955, the German restitution started.</span> <span id="s690">My husband got his first cases through relatives and friends and we built up a nice practice and I helped him since I could type and I didn’t forget my German and we both worked together.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q.</span> <span id="s692">During all this time, your daughters were still of school age.</span> <span id="s693">How did your daughters adjust to the American schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A. Well, my oldest daughter got married very early.</span> <span id="s695">She married a man in Indianapolis.</span> <span id="s696">As a matter of fact, my husband introduced him because they had worked together in the same place but it was not a very happy marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q. Was he of German Jewish background?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A. No, he was a gentile and we found out later, he was an alcoholic.</span> <span id="s699">She covered up for many, many years.</span> <span id="s700">She has three beautiful children—two are married already and she divorced him a short time ago.</span> <span id="s701">The other one came to New York and I worked for 11 years in Russeks, Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s702">They had furs and suits and coats and I did pretty well there.</span> <span id="s703">And she worked as a buyer assistant in other stores and went to California.</span> <span id="s704">In California she met a boy from Breslau and they got married and lived happily ever after.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q.</span> <span id="s706">When they were in school, do you remember them having any problems with language or…</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A. Well, you know how fast kids grasp the language.</span> <span id="s708">And in Indianapolis, the principal was so kind and so understanding.</span> <span id="s709">She graduated from high school after 2.5 years in this country.</span> <span id="s710">She wanted to study but she had an interview with a teacher and when she saw that she came 2.5 years before and wanted to go to college, she said “my dear child, it would be better if you find a husband and marry somebody.”</span> <span id="s711">And until today, she is sorry that she did not study because she had the stuff in her.</span> <span id="s712">This was the younger one.</span> <span id="s713">The older one is an artist.</span> <span id="s714">She is a painter and does beautiful embroidery.</span> <span id="s715">She has a business of her own now.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q.</span> <span id="s717">When we spoke about the restitution before, I didn’t ask you how you felt about the Wiedergutmachung (restitution).</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A. Well, it helped a lot until today the people can live like menchen (human beings).</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Without restitution, the elderly people, they cannot live on Social Security.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q. Was your husband able to build up a practice doing this work with restitution?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s722">We went to Europe every year and we went to the authorities, to the ampter and I think that was a very good idea.</span> <span id="s723">We could accomplish much more that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q.</span> <span id="s725">How did it feel for you the first time you went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A.</span> <span id="s727">The first time it was so strange.</span> <span id="s728">You saw an enemy in every German.</span> <span id="s729">But later on, unfortunately, you get used to it.</span> <span id="s730">I must say when we worked there with the authorities, they were very nice and accommodating to us and we accomplished a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q.</span> <span id="s732">When you say you got used to it, did you find your attitudes changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A. No, my attitude didn’t change.</span> <span id="s734">My attitude was the same and is the same today.</span> <span id="s735">Once a man who worked in that restitution office said to me “Mrs. Shutz, why don’t you come back to Germany?”</span> <span id="s736">I said “to be thrown out once is enough.”</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q.</span> <span id="s738">Did he answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q.</span> <span id="s741">In looking back, what do you think was the biggest adjustment that you had to make?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A. Well, I had to work (laughs) but I’m not sorry because I loved to work.</span> <span id="s743">And now, my husband passed away and I’m alone and I brought most of the restitution cases which were still pending to an end.</span> <span id="s744">Now, it’s—I fell a littler uberflussich.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q.</span> <span id="s746">But in the beginning you thought it was the work.</span> <span id="s747">The Aufbau printed an article in 1944 about Frauen stellen sich un talking about women who thought they would be housewives and…</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A.</span> <span id="s749">They were not even housewives.</span> <span id="s750">They had a cook and they had another maid.</span> <span id="s751">They didn’t work in Europe and here, I had a full time job, I went marketing, I cooked, I kept the house, everything was wonderful.</span> <span id="s752">And I think we all, we Jewish women, accomplished something.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q.</span> <span id="s754">What did you do for some recreation in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A. Sleeping (laughs).</span> <span id="s756">I was tired.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q.</span> <span id="s758">You had mentioned a subscription to the opera in Breslau…</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s760">The first years, I didn’t know what a theater looked like from the inside—only from the outside.</span> <span id="s761">Later on, of course, we went to the opera and I go to the theater.</span> <span id="s762">I’m a music lover—WQXR is always on.</span> <span id="s763">TV is not my main pet but once in a while, there are good things to watch but I love music.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q.</span> <span id="s765">Did you join any groups or organizations when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s767">I am a life member at the Hadassah but, unfortunately, I go there very seldom.</span> <span id="s768">I love the Hebrew Tabernacle.</span> <span id="s769">We were members there for many years when we lived there.</span> <span id="s770">Unfortunately, they moved further up and I moved further down and it is for me very hard to go there Friday night or Saturday morning but it is a wonderful temple.</span> <span id="s771">I go to another temple here in my neighborhood and I don’t like the service.</span> <span id="s772">I don’t like the songs.</span> <span id="s773">The melodies which were so familiar to me, Cantor Ehrenberg, I miss, Rabbi Lehman, I miss so for the last holidays I bought ticket at the Hebrew Tabernacle.</span> <span id="s774">It takes a long time to go there but it pays—it’s a wonderful service and the people are—I meet so many friends there and I really feel home there.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q. I have that feeling, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A.</span> <span id="s777">They know you and there is always a friendly hello from Rabbi Lehman and it is a wonderful place.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q. Do you consider yourself today more a part of the American mainstream or more a part of the German Jewish community in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A.</span> <span id="s780">The German Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q. Are most of your friends from this community?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q.</span> <span id="s784">Why do you think this is so?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A. Well, it is a feeling—the language brings us together again.</span> <span id="s786">I have American friends, too, but it is not the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q. Do you think you were a different parent from American parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s789">Sure.</span> <span id="s790">I would have a different outlook in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q.</span> <span id="s792">What do you think the difference would be?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A.</span> <span id="s794">It is really hard to explain.</span> <span id="s795">There is something different between a European Jew and an American Jew—there is something different.</span> <span id="s796">I cannot explain.</span> <span id="s797">I don’t want to say it’s better or worse—it is different.</span> <span id="s798">I have American relatives here.</span> <span id="s799">We couldn’t find a mutual background, you know.</span> <span id="s800">We could not.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q. Have you ever told this story to your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A. No.</span> <span id="s803">Maybe my daughter told her daughter.</span> <span id="s804">But one lives in Florida and one in California so I have very little occasion to talk to them about my background and my emigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q.</span> <span id="s806">When your daughters were dating, did they date mostly American boys even though you said your daughter married this boy from Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A. Both dated American men.</span> <span id="s808">Every time came another boy up to the apartment but she couldn’t fine the right one until she found the boy from Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s810">PAGE 21</span></p></body></html>
