were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was born in a little village by the name of Botos, B-o-t-o-s, Hungarian village.</span> <span id="s20">It means the place in which you trade, in Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Place in which you trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: In which you trade, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: So where is that near?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: That is presently in northern Serbia, just south of a town that the Hungarians call Szabadka.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Is there another way to spell Botos?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: B-o-t-o-s, the Serbs spell it with a little hook on the S.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: But it means absolutely nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s32">And how big a town was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Oh, about 1500 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: So, really little.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: We had a big -- we had a big estate, my family had a big estate and we were -- during the summer we were in Botos and my mom just -- she was highly pregnant and she developed her pains, and suddenly I was just popped out at the wrong time and the wrong place.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Right.</span> <span id="s38">And -- but very seriously speaking, my mom had given birth, she was a very tiny lady.</span> <span id="s39">My dad was six foot two, 180 pounds, my mom was never more than 95 pounds, and after she gave birth to my brother, who was three years older, she was told never again to conceive because she had great problems with my brother.</span> <span id="s40">And somehow I -- I happened, and -- I had that from my grandmother.</span> <span id="s41">She was told by everybody to abort, to abort, to abort, because she’d die in the process.</span> <span id="s42">And she said no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s43">So I popped out, she survived, but she was so weak she never recovered.</span> <span id="s44">And eventually, five years later she died of galloping pneumonia, because she had no strength left.</span> <span id="s45">So from --</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Galloping pneumonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Yeah, galloping pneumonia.</span> <span id="s48">She was gone in six weeks because she had no defensive mechanism left.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: And I was feeling guilty --</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: -- so you were five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: You were five years old when she di --</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: I was five years old, yeah, and I was feeling guilty for many years, because of my mother dying so soon and leaving me.</span> <span id="s55">The big tragedy in my life was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Did your father remarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: You see -- my father eventually remarried, about 25 years later.</span> <span id="s58">Looking, looking, and looking from av -- as I was growing up he was always looking, and eventually found a woman.</span> <span id="s59">Of all of the races in the world, he found a German woman and got married to her in 1955.</span> <span id="s60">So from 1930 when my mom died, on the 14th of May, he was not married.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Yeah, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: So he married in 1955.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: You were --</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: By that time he was a refugee, and having met that German in Austria, he decided to move to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Because she had the job and he was still looking for a job, because he took refuge, you know, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Anyway, it was in Botos and we were living in Suboditsa in Szabadka and then we were living in Modbaskirk where my grandmother, my father’s mother, had all kinds of properties.</span> <span id="s69">But we originally come from Tameshwar.</span> <span id="s70">Tameshwar is Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: And after --</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: That was where your father was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: That’s right, where my father was born in a village, a now big estate next to Tameshwar called Bukavitz.</span> <span id="s75">We had a big, big horse spread.</span> <span id="s76">[indecipherable] raising horses for racing and raising horses for the guard of the emperor.</span> <span id="s77">At that time there was still an emperor before 1918.</span> <span id="s78">In mid 1918 with the Treaty of Trianon, that part of Austria-Hungary, Hungary fell to Romania.</span> <span id="s79">The second part fell to the so-called Yugoslavs, eventually it was lost.</span> <span id="s80">And the third part was retained by Hungary.</span> <span id="s81">And in 1941 when the Nazis attacked Yugoslavia, Hungary quickly recouped two of the three parts --</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: That [indecipherable] right.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: -- including the Barcika, borders within the Barcika.</span> <span id="s84">So it reverted back to Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: So most of my education except three years, I have in Hungaria.</span> <span id="s87">I had had no education in German whatsoever because we had nothing to do -- we were Hungarian bourgeoisie of Huguenot background.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: And your father’s name was Cornell?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Cornelius, Cornell.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Cornell.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Cornell Marie.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Cornell Marie.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: And so he comes to --</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: And my grandfather’s name --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: -- was Jean Joseph.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Still following the French tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: So my grandfather was still three-quarters French.</span> <span id="s102">My grandmother was Austrian-German.</span> <span id="s103">She was Madame Fultilga.</span> <span id="s104">Constantine Fultilga.</span> <span id="s105">And my mother was Hungarian, as Hungarian as they come.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And from Szeged.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: That’s right, from Szeged.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: From Szeged.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Which was also small --</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Oh, she was a tiny little lady, so I still -- I mean, I’m a grown-up male --</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Do you remember -- do you remember her as a --</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: -- do you remember her as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: I remember my mom, but I remember her mainly very, very ill lying in bed, and there being pl -- less and less of her, except she had my face, she had dark eyes, dark hair and kind of -- I remember her nose becoming -- I didn't know what it meant, dying, I mean I was five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: But she was lying there and just suddenly she was just there, she was dead.</span> <span id="s118">And I -- I remember about two or three weeks before she eventually died, she stood up and baked for me and my brother -- and there is a fruit which is like a big pear, but it’s not pear, they call it quitten in German.</span> <span id="s119">It makes marvelous jam, but it is not liquid jam, it is [indecipherable] jam and you can cut it into slices, and it melts on your tongue.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: So she stood up for that, very painfully she was doing that, with the helper, Sophie, was our lady for all purposes.</span> <span id="s122">She had been with the family for two generations.</span> <span id="s123">It -- even at my time she already about 60 years old.</span> <span id="s124">She eventually died at about 92 or 93, she had always been in the family.</span> <span id="s125">And she and my mom made that quitten [indecipherable] they’d call it.</span> <span id="s126">And I grabbed it and sliced it up and brought it out to the street to my -- for my friends --</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: -- because it was a delicacy and I remember my mom looking at me with -- very sad I understand, but I [indecipherable] I ha -- I made that for you.</span> <span id="s129">And I just kept on smiling.</span> <span id="s130">And I was called, as a child, naturally in Hungarian, the smiling country.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: The smiling country.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Mosoly ország.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Mosoly ország, because before my mom died I had to smile just to cope with that problem of her illness, and after she died, my dad tells me I was smiling at everybody, hoping that somebody would touch me and be good to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: And Mosoly ország in Hungarian is a very poetic term.</span> <span id="s137">It doesn’t exist in any other languages.</span> <span id="s138">Ország means world, country.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Mosoly means smiling.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Smile --</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Smiling [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Smiling country.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: And I still retain -- and my grandson, the second son of my son --</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: -- is exactly the same with the smiling.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Exactly the same kind of -- were you close with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: I was very close to my dad.</span> <span id="s149">My dad was sportsman, a horseman.</span> <span id="s150">He taught me very early horsemanship and sportsmanship and I hit it off --</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: So he was really --</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: -- really well with my dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: And my brother was more independent.</span> <span id="s155">Do-Don’t forget please that in the 1920’s and 30’s, fathers were absolute rulers in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: As had been their fathers.</span> <span id="s158">And the father would count -- the mother’s words were listened to, but they nev-never really amounted to much, except they had to be faithful to their -- to their husbands, right --</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: To the husbands, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: -- remain [indecipherable] right.</span> <span id="s161">And my father always thought he knew exactly what my brother and I would have to do.</span> <span id="s162">My father kept on telling me that I would have to become a doctor of jurisprudence, and then I would have to go to the Hungarian minister of external affairs to become a diplomat.</span> <span id="s163">And he was -- we had big places in which to live.</span> <span id="s164">My brother the room and the bathroom, I had my room and my bathroom.</span> <span id="s165">And my room was the diplomat en zimmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: That means the diplomat’s room.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: My brother was the engineer’s room, although my brother had no interest in engineering at all, so he and my dad were always fighting about.</span> <span id="s170">My brother was pigheaded, he was born in June, June 22nd, and he said, I want to be a merchant, I want to be a merchant, and I don’t want to be a -- my dad said, but in ou-our family there are no merchants.</span> <span id="s171">And my brother said, well, we’ll see about that.</span> <span id="s172">And -- and I don’t know if you’re interested in that, but my poor brother managed school just barely, out of spite.</span> <span id="s173">He was very, very bright.</span> <span id="s174">Was brighter than I would ever hope to be.</span> <span id="s175">And he barely studied and somehow he made it, so with my father’s position, who eventually recognized that my brother was not qualified to be in the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s176">Gymnasium is the Hungarian term for university preparatory, secondary education, [speaks Hungarian here], you see.</span> <span id="s177">My brother was eventually put into the [indecipherable] Akadémia, into the commercial academy, happy like a lark.</span> <span id="s178">Fell in love with his ma -- language teacher, did a no-no, was expelled from school, and promptly talked my father into getting him an apprenticeship in one of Austria’s famous coffee peddling chains, Meiml, and becoming Meiml, M-e-i-m-l.</span> <span id="s179">Great coffee in Vienna.</span> <span id="s180">If you go to Vienna, go to a Meiml coffee shop, is to -- second to none.</span> <span id="s181">And they also specialize in special imports, fruit and vegetable imports from the tropics, so my brother’s dream was suddenly fulfilled.</span> <span id="s182">He was an apprentice, high class evide -- Meiml is high class, high class apprentice at Meiml and said eventually I’m going to take over the store.</span> <span id="s183">And I recall by the time my brother was around, what four -- 17 - 18 years old -- he was born ’22, so it must have been 1939 I think, right?</span> <span id="s184">Suddenly he kept on a pyramid great oranges, one at a time.</span> <span id="s185">And I was Baylor at home.</span> <span id="s186">Baylor is annelbare, okay?</span> <span id="s187">But baylor in Hungarian is much cuter, and annelbare sounds hard.</span> <span id="s188">Baylor is somebody that you know of.</span> <span id="s189">The white one.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Baylor -- in Slavic Baylor means white collar, okay, so anyway -- and my pet name was Urchika.</span> <span id="s192">Urchika means the younger brother.</span> <span id="s193">The elder brother is called Bandiko.</span> <span id="s194">So when my brother came home --</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: So who called you Urchika?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Sorry?</span> <span id="s197">Urchika --</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Urchika.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: I was ur -- Urchika.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Urchika.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: And who called you that, your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: My -- everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: The whole family, I was Urchika, and because it was a status symbol.</span> <span id="s206">I was the second son.</span> <span id="s207">The second sons had no rights, they would inherit nothing.</span> <span id="s208">But they were cute [indecipherable] and the brother was Bandiko.</span> <span id="s209">Bandiko in Hungarian means the young [indecipherable] while he was growing up.</span> <span id="s210">At 15 - 16 he slowly became Bandi, the one expecting to inherit everything --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Every --</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: -- and therefore carry on the names and the tradition, except he jumped off the tradition wagon, wanted to become a merchant, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: And he brought home, I have to say [indecipherable] means, here you are, Urchika, a great orange for you.</span> <span id="s215">Oh I loved my brother.</span> <span id="s216">And then he fell in love.</span> <span id="s217">Whatever I knew, I was -- he was 19, I was 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Totally innocent, unlike the boys and the girls today, I was just a dreaming little boy, wanting to work [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: But he wasn’t so innocent.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: My brother was a bit more experienced.</span> <span id="s222">He got expelled from school because he fell in love with a -- there was a beautiful Hungarian teacher [indecipherable] she was teaching French and he was enchanted by her upper structure.</span> <span id="s223">And somewhere along the line, during the intermission, he [indecipherable] dared stick his hand up, and with the no-no.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: So he was kicked out?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: But he eventually got [indecipherable] it was recognized as a juvenile prank, you see, and she kind of liked him, too.</span> <span id="s228">Anyway, he then fell in love with a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s229">And that was something very serious.</span> <span id="s230">I remember her hair, it was so shiny, dark jet black and big, big, big, big eyes.</span> <span id="s231">And I think she was the love of his -- she would have been the love of his life.</span> <span id="s232">And that was in 1940, I remember, and suddenly I didn't get the oranges, she got the oranges</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: She got the --</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: [indecipherable] and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: So tell m --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: So in the -- th-the Germans, or you --</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Let’s go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Let’s go back to your -- your father.</span> <span id="s240">You said you -- that you were close to your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: My father -- my father was a confirmed monarchist, Austria Hungarian style.</span> <span id="s242">He had been to the military academy, the -- like the Sandhurst equivalent was in Vienna Neustadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: And in Budapest, it was two stages, one year each, and he was second lieutenant in 19 -- early 1918.</span> <span id="s245">He fought in the first World War, a second lieutenant, and was hoping to have a career, because we had -- our family had had established solid linkages with the family, the royal family, with the imperial family because they were -- my family was in horse breeding, especially horses to be picked from which the grenadier guard horses would be picked --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: -- for the guard of the Kaiser.</span> <span id="s248">And he was hoping to enter the -- the -- he was the only child of his grandmother, but the fifth child on my grandfather, because my grandfather, Lallier grandfather’s first wife died --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: -- after giving birth to --</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Four --</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: -- four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: And then he married -- my grandfather married my father’s mother, with whom sh -- sh -- he had only one child, my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: And since the other four children were two daughters and two sons, they’d already by tradition taken on their professional training.</span> <span id="s257">My father would have been the one to join the army, and become a soldier, right?</span> <span id="s258">But he had also finished university, in terms of a law degree equivalent, but he never got a law degree.</span> <span id="s259">So he was a second lieutenant and the one disturbing news I hear, which had great influence over him was that after Hungary capitulated and the Béla Kun regime took power, my father demilitarized, was still wearing the officer’s uniform without the insignia, was accosted by a bunch of commies in the -- the central part of Budapest, was put up against the wall to be shot on the spot by the communists.</span> <span id="s260">And he tells me the League of Nations representative, [indecipherable] Pallavicini, from Italy originally, happened to have been driving through and happened to witness the almost killing of my dad and some other former officers, and saved him.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: So my father didn’t get shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: And eventually the Béla Kun regime was -- was defeated by Horthy -- not the nicest of all nice in the world, but highly more -- much more acceptable to [indecipherable] traditionally than the commies ever would.</span> <span id="s265">My father became an avid communist hater.</span> <span id="s266">All his life he was a communist hater, and especially after the Soviets took power.</span> <span id="s267">And during the second World War, be Tito taking power.</span> <span id="s268">And the Romanians falling to communism.</span> <span id="s269">My father knew that we’d lose everything and we lost everything.</span> <span id="s270">We lost the possessions in wa -- in -- in Romania, we lost the possessions in Hungary, albeit late in 1940, except for a villa.</span> <span id="s271">And do you know Hungary at all?</span> <span id="s272">Lake Balaton?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Lake Balaton used to have great, great inland sea.</span> <span id="s275">We had a beautiful little country house right on the lake, and lost everything what is not in Serbia today.</span> <span id="s276">And we lost even one particular very i-important little domain down on the Adriatic Sea.</span> <span id="s277">We lost everything.</span> <span id="s278">And the most painful loss was evidently the horse breeding, because not only did we lose that, but with the Soviets advancing 1944, they destroyed the whole thing, it was just [indecipherable] in Romania, and stooped -- stole all the remaining horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: So we were left -- my grandmother was left only with two factories and one large estate, which we then lost to the Titoists.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: So we are what we consider -- they would have called us higher bourgeoisie.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: In Hungarian terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: So you were quite well off.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: We were very well off, yeah, but that’s why -- that’s why you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Yeah, but where were the hor -- where were the horses?</span> <span id="s288">I mean, why wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: They were at Tameshwar.</span> <span id="s290">Tameshwar --</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Tameshwar.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: -- is Tymiswar --</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Right --</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: -- today.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: And di -- whe -- and my dad was born on the Salas, the village by the name of Bukavitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: And the whole estate, the major estate of the horses was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Was that close enough to Botos so he would just --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Ah, no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: It wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Oh, a -- about -- let’s see, no, but that would be about four hours car drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: So what was he doing in Botos?</span> <span id="s304">A: He -- after the war, th -- we had a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Ah no, dur -- bef-before.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: You mean, after the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Yes, after the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: It’s a very important question, that.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Hungary having disintegrated, and big parts of Hungary having been chopped off, people living in the chopped off areas had to make a choice of citizenship.</span> <span id="s311">My father never wanted to give Austrian hi -- Austro-Hungarian citizenship, but Austro-Hungary didn’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s312">It was either Austria or Hungaria, or Romania, or -- they were still calling themselves the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slavines.</span> <span id="s313">I think only in 1929 did they became Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s314">Never loving each other, even killing each other in -- in Belgrade Parliament --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: -- would you believe that?</span> <span id="s317">Anyway, so he was traveling back and forth to try to take care of the estates, but with the estates being in [indecipherable] because of expropriation rights, especially minorities who had visibly remained Austro-Hungarian in spirit.</span> <span id="s318">My father was one of those traveling back and forth, who remained Austro-Hungarians committed to the crown that didn’t exist, committed to the [indecipherable] in Budapest that didn’t exist, but loving Horthy, because Horthy was claimed by the Hungarians to become the personal representative of the crown, the Hungarians still hoping that one of the sons of Oto, the last Kaiser, would eventually be invited back in.</span> <span id="s319">Which never happened, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: So moving from one place to another, he sometimes took jobs.</span> <span id="s322">He spoke his five or six local languages, was [indecipherable] useful.</span> <span id="s323">So he worked for awhile.</span> <span id="s324">For the Hungarians he worked in administration.</span> <span id="s325">For the Romanians he didn’t work, he -- [whisper]</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: He said what?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: For the rom -- he’d never work for the Romanians.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: The Romanians, he wouldn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Gossip has it that if you want to go to a really corrupt country anywhere in Europe, you don’t have to go further than Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Right?</span> <span id="s332">And he also worked for the Serbs in Dubocka where I was born --</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: -- you see.</span> <span id="s335">And his last post there was, from what I remember, was -- you know kuntai, a -- in the United States you have the states and the states have some divisions.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Of the main subdivisions, of te -- 10 - 15 - 20, we lived just on one or two towns.</span> <span id="s338">And back home did have a chief administrative [indecipherable] officer, which is called a landrat in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: There’s no such title, but I would call him a -- a -- a legal officer, chief legal administrative officer of the whole region, containing up to 20 villages of one or two towns.</span> <span id="s341">Th-That was his last job.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: You see, and it qualified him as a civil servant, but he never got any promotion, even though he was -- my dad was, intellectually, a very self possessed person.</span> <span id="s344">Highly trained -- you know, it’s in the blood after all generation [indecipherable] and some of these [indecipherable] for some time bloomed forth a very fast thinker, very energetic, great sportsman, great writer.</span> <span id="s345">He thought he was great in everything, including his hating the communists.</span> <span id="s346">But his hatred of communists didn’t prevent us from losing everything.</span> <span id="s347">I’ve learned not to hate anything.</span> <span id="s348">But it’s easy if you have nothing, how can you -- you either hate everything or you hate nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Did you grow up in Botos?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: I -- no, I was wa -- I think I grew -- was in Botos three years, and then we also had a smaller place in a place where my mom died.</span> <span id="s351">Where did she die?</span> <span id="s352">Parage, P-a-r-a-g-e.</span> <span id="s353">Parage in Hungarian, I don’t know what it means.</span> <span id="s354">I -- it’s just a name on that tiny village.</span> <span id="s355">We had another place there and she was -- you know I -- wait now, I -- now I remember, actually.</span> <span id="s356">In Parage we had a house, several hectares of land and a -- a well 200 meters deep.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: That’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Now that’s a lot of da -- depth, right?</span> <span id="s359">And how do I remember that?</span> <span id="s360">At me -- watermelon time, our male servant, Ilya was his name, he was a Slav, kept on lowering the watermelons 200 meters down in the rope to have them ice cold before bringing them up.</span> <span id="s361">And I remember that because my mom’s illness was somehow linked with that deep well, but I’ve never found to what extent.</span> <span id="s362">I remember the water was enormously cold.</span> <span id="s363">My grandmother sometime splashed my brother and I.</span> <span id="s364">She was in that time there too.</span> <span id="s365">And I [indecipherable] frigid.</span> <span id="s366">So maybe -- did she take her bath in ice cold water, which Ilya had just brought her in a some -- something like that, she developed galloping pneumonia, she was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: She died in Parage, she was buried in Parage.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: I see, and swe --</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Even though we had no linkages with Parage whatsoever except that little place, which we eventually lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s372">And after Parage, then where?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: After Parage we went to Brimuk, which is another Hungarian village in the Bauska.</span> <span id="s374">And from Brimuk he then -- he was transferred over, he went back to Tameshwar for two years, which was about ‘32 to ‘34, and then he went back to our remaining properties in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s375">That was in the Barnot.</span> <span id="s376">Barcika is in the middle, Barnot is to the east of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: [indecipherable] the Serbs call that Petrovgrad then, today they call it Zrenjanin, in which we had two factories.</span> <span id="s379">And those were, because of its -- this possession’s gradual by the heir countries of parts of Hungary.</span> <span id="s380">We had lost everything in Romania and we had lost the thing over at the Adriatic, right?</span> <span id="s381">There still remained one house in Vienna, I remember that in the 19 district.</span> <span id="s382">And we remained within those two factories and those two factories were the last remnant because some -- some of the other possessions that we had had, because of the -- the -- the Great Depression.</span> <span id="s383">We lost part of that because of the Great Depression, including participation a particular [indecipherable] if I remember, in Tameshwar.</span> <span id="s384">I think I even have a photo of something that looks like a [indecipherable] building.</span> <span id="s385">And so we were hanging onto those -- hanging onto those two factories, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: And what -- what -- what did those factories produce?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: They were -- one produced textiles and the other one producing valves and -- what do you attach valves to?</span> <span id="s388">Cylinders.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Cylinders.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Valves and cylinders.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: So there’s a vast network of --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: It was a nast vetwork</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: -- [indecipherable] family --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: -- of the capitalistic investment viable during the course of the Austro-Hungarian empire, because it was a solidly established 32 million dollar -- 32 million peoples’ market.</span> <span id="s395">And with the disintegration of all that, the market potential had disappeared.</span> <span id="s396">The Serbs would never trade with the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s397">Through Romanians nobody would trade because they never pay.</span> <span id="s398">The Austrians had no money left, so the whole system gradually disintegrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Like you’re hanging on your good -- then you could declare bankruptcy.</span> <span id="s401">All I [indecipherable] personally, what I saved from that is knowing how to ride a horse, even had my own horse for awhile, and memories of what a great life it would have been if it hadn’t been for that stupid Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Because we had -- we had -- you know, in choosing where to live, you recognize that people are people are people, and that people, being individualistic, have a right in their own nationhood.</span> <span id="s404">And one who believes that [indecipherable] if they believe they’re distinct enough and if they believe that they can maintain themselves without leeching off other countries, neighboring countries, then they rightly hold -- need a nationhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Right?</span> <span id="s407">But in my father’s eyes, it was the empire or nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Right?</span> <span id="s410">He never had any chance of any promotions anywhere, right?</span> <span id="s411">And I think he left this whole area as a refugee because A, the commies would have gotten him, they’d have [indecipherable] right?</span> <span id="s412">He had a gran -- he had a mother who was a very distinguished lady of society, and she’s -- he just couldn’t st-stand the risk of Tito Hungarian communism getting hold of my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: You know?</span> <span id="s415">So he escaped to Austria and --</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: With her?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: -- and [indecipherable] toward the end of the war, and then eventually [indecipherable] he met that German, fine looking.</span> <span id="s418">I think sh -- one -- she’s one of the few good Germans [indecipherable] she -- met her, fell in love with her, had his mother with him all the time.</span> <span id="s419">Had enough means to establish himself.</span> <span id="s420">And because of his languages and the legal training, he eventually won a post with the German federal government.</span> <span id="s421">Now, I resented that very much.</span> <span id="s422">Actually, if you want to know something really specific, my father was a -- a German speaking Austrian, speaking German like an Austrian, just like me.</span> <span id="s423">But he has already established credentials at a time when West Germany needed men who would go through these Denazification rituals -- I call them rituals on purpose because some people thought that it was foolish because they let the big Nazis go and ritualize the little Nazis had never done anything to anybody.</span> <span id="s424">And my father was, for awhile, I think 12 months in the area of Bavaria, a Denazification judge.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Now was it that because he was known to become -- been an anti-communist all his life and by 1947 the Cold War had broken out?</span> <span id="s427">Or was it because of his special legal knowledge, or was it because of his languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: But one way or the other he was the -- he was the -- the [indecipherable] local for Denazification president and he was doing that for 11 months.</span> <span id="s430">And I -- I had difficulties with that because he was not a German.</span> <span id="s431">And difficulties with the notion of his living in Germany.</span> <span id="s432">Why wouldn’t he have stayed in Austria?</span> <span id="s433">And he said to me -- we talked about it several times after I found him, you see, because don’t forget I was prisoner of war for a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: British prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s436">So eventually I -- after they let me go in August 1946, so I was putting in a lot of to finally -- finally I discovered he was in [indecipherable] why do you have to go to Germany?</span> <span id="s437">And he said, because I love her.</span> <span id="s438">I said, don’t you forget everything else?</span> <span id="s439">Don’t you forget what has happened?</span> <span id="s440">He says, in Austria communists lived -- the communists were right in Vienna and I’m -- I was afraid.</span> <span id="s441">They almost killed me once, I wanted to be safe enough, and well, Germany was safe enough.</span> <span id="s442">So I visited him three times in the course of 30 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: And I had my personal reasons for not feeling home [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s445">She was a great lady, Edith, but my father and I didn’t -- you bu -- beautifully put -- said question, my father and I were very close.</span> <span id="s446">Spiritual very close, mentally very sharp, very close, sportsmanlike very close.</span> <span id="s447">And we were kind of principled.</span> <span id="s448">My brother was more a merchant [indecipherable] but live and let live.</span> <span id="s449">And we went -- we went apart because of that.</span> <span id="s450">And he also told me -- I told him, look, I’ve had enough of this [speaks Hungarian] in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s451">[Hungarian] means real pig [indecipherable] I’m going to go to Canada.</span> <span id="s452">Adalbert, you are the only one I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Now it’s you who is number one.</span> <span id="s455">I said, so what, because my broth -- well, your brother is dead.</span> <span id="s456">So I said, what do I do with that, I’m number one, we have nothing left.</span> <span id="s457">He says, oh yeah, you have pride left, you have family tradition left and you will do what I want you to do.</span> <span id="s458">So I said, what do you want me to do?</span> <span id="s459">You stay in Germany, and go to university in Germany and try to become a diplomat.</span> <span id="s460">Me?</span> <span id="s461">A diplomat in the German -- no.</span> <span id="s462">I said, Dad, no.</span> <span id="s463">I prefer anything to that.</span> <span id="s464">His eyes popped out and said [indecipherable] you want to emigrate?</span> <span id="s465">You lose your civilization if you go to America.</span> <span id="s466">I says, oh really?</span> <span id="s467">Six months later I was [indecipherable] and he never talked to me again for five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s469">We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Very -- End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Let me go -- let me go back --</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: So I told you about my brother and h-he loved that Jewish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: And yeah, well, they forgot to mention.</span> <span id="s476">So the Germans, as I said, just to update that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: -- April 1941, the Nazis came in, took possession of the Barnot, gave Barcika and Barnya back to the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s479">The bridges were already built for the Hungarians, then we had to come in the Barnot, we were living in Montbachkirche, and we were all waiting and I was already anticipating going to Budapest to study, because I finished my -- was about finishing my high school, very well finishing my high school.</span> <span id="s480">And suddenly the bridges were torn off and the Germans said, we will remain occupiers of the Barnot for the time being.</span> <span id="s481">And that’s how that [indecipherable] division was created out of this -- that peasant [indecipherable] w-we were called [indecipherable] all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s482">And within six months, the Jewish people disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: From Barnot?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yeah, and from the world, yeah.</span> <span id="s485">And including the little raven, shiny haired beauty that my br-brother was so terribly in love.</span> <span id="s486">How can I say terribly in love, delightfully love in with.</span> <span id="s487">And upon inquiring, my father told me that he had learned from the Germans that they were picked up for their better safekeeping.</span> <span id="s488">Put up in some brick factories, usually.</span> <span id="s489">The main brick factory was in Poncho, which was Ponchoway in Hungarian, just off the -- off the Danube river, on the -- north of the Danube river, from whence they suddenly disappeared around September, October 1941.</span> <span id="s490">And we never heard of the [indecipherable] again.</span> <span id="s491">But we had not heard anything, shooting or gassing or anything, they were just gone, you see.</span> <span id="s492">[indecipherable] was the first case of a massive enleve mon, in French.</span> <span id="s493">Enleve mon means the picking up en masse and they transport them, carting them away [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s494">But not the Jews were first ones to have been -- how do I know that?</span> <span id="s495">My father had, wherever -- whenever he was in Bachkirche, he had a card round.</span> <span id="s496">Every Tuesday night they were playing cards, one of the four guys, four guys, everything.</span> <span id="s497">They were drinking, they were smoking, they were banging the table like the way men were supposed to do to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s498">One of them was a mathematics teacher by name of -- by nam-ame-ame -- by the name of Frankel, he was a Jewish guy.</span> <span id="s499">And he always managed winning.</span> <span id="s500">It made my father very angry.</span> <span id="s501">But they kept on playing for years.</span> <span id="s502">Now how do I know that?</span> <span id="s503">I was the one serving them the wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: I see, right.</span> <span id="s505">And he used to take it --</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: And then Frank -- Frank was a great math teacher, was my math teacher.</span> <span id="s507">He had the ge -- built me -- geometric models from potatoes.</span> <span

in my mind was a very influential creator of curiosity.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: He was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: So why don’t you -- when you -- let’s go back to when you were a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: What did you like in school?</span> <span id="s516">You liked mathematics.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: I like -- oh, I -- I loved every -- I’m a linguist by -- by -- by -- by -- by -- by [indecipherable] by-by -- by birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: And I love mathematics.</span> <span id="s520">I’m a great chess player.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: I’m told I’m an A level chess player.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: I know I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: But I never joined a chess club because I hated the smoking and drinking --</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: -- you see.</span> <span id="s529">And I -- I was the Magill

Why?</span> <span id="s541">Because so many guys in the war decimated, they were pulled back from the front, the first thing they did, half dead, pulled back from the front, went to the whorehouses.</span> <span id="s542">So they were always caught in between having [indecipherable] because the food was also terrible.</span> <span id="s543">And yet they lined themselves up.</span> <span id="s544">For miles they were lined up for a whorehouse of five or six or seven women, right?</span> <span id="s545">Horrendous experience.</span> <span id="s546">When I saw this at ma -- I

id="s548">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: And we got married to each other in Vienna, right, in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Totally innocent.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: And yet loving each other, believing we just couldn’t live without each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: And she said -- I said, but what do we do now, after the wedding reception, she said, just let -- in Hungarian, lets nature take its course.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: That is sweet.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Had two babies with my wife, you know.</span> <span id="s558">Henrietta.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: And was she Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: She was German speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: She was German speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s563">Her grandmother was Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: But her father was German Volksdeutsche, yeah.</span> <span id="s566">And I married her in Vienna.</span> <span id="s567">And -- and I must also say she was blonde, blue eyed, which is curious for me because when I was destined or selected to go on officer’s training in the Waffen SS, there still was a requisite that to be a real Waffen SS officer you had to be blonde, blue eyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: And [indecipherable] 80, and all those things.</span> <span id="s570">And I was just the opposite of that, looking like a Gypsy amongst all those blondes.</span> <span id="s571">And I had to go to a special commission, a racial investigation commission.</span> <span id="s572">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s573">And they looked at me and said, you don’t qualify, just the color of your hair, the color of your eyes.</span> <span id="s574">And th-the other said, but we need young man who knows ports and have been in the war [indecipherable] anything?</span> <span id="s575">So they checked my -- they checked my protruding brain, oh good brain capacity.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Why would Adolf worry about good brain ca -- brain capacity [indecipherable] good, impressive brain capacity, fine bone structure.</span> <span id="s578">Too French, but with a bit of training, the bones will be okay.</span> <span id="s579">Fine muscle structure, but his outside looks have to be improved upon.</span> <span id="s580">So they passed me with the condition that within three or four years I’d have to marry a light blonde German.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: With whom I would have to procreate four children, watch this one, one of whom would be purely blonde, an improvement of the race.</span> <span id="s583">Another one would be half blonde, also an improvement, but two would remain hopeless, they said.</span> <span id="s584">Hopelessly non-German looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: [indecipherable] non-German looking, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: And it was th -- several times in my life in those -- those terrible three years in which I was really feeling abused and angry, as I said, who are they to tell me what kind of woman I should marry?</span> <span id="s587">I mean it -- you know, this was really trespassing upon my personal is -- guess what?</span> <span id="s588">I was released from POW camp, made it to Vienna as fast as possible to go back to school, right, at the university because I’d had my gymnasium, right?</span> <span id="s589">And who do I see at the -- round street corner just marching away, a little blonde kid with her mother.</span> <span id="s590">And I look in the [indecipherable] went around the corner, never had a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s591">Something compelled me to trace myself back [indecipherable] and that was that little blonde blue-eyed kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: My two children are blonde blue eyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Blonde and blue eyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: My looks have improved.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: But, by my voluntary choice, that’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: That’s different.</span> <span id="s599">When you were raised, were you raised as a Catholic or Protestant?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I was raised by my grandmother going to Catholic church, but on Protestant principles.</span> <span id="s601">She said, we have to go to church, there is no Protestant church in the area, but we pray to the Protestant God [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Was that confusing to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: You knew exactly what it meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: -- no, to me -- to me -- you could -- what appealed to me, you could stand up tall and raise your eyes to the heavens and talk to your God, hoping to talk to -- directly by talk to.</span> <span id="s608">To me the pope was not essential.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: To me -- because I had to learn the little catechism, you know the catechism?</span> <span id="s611">Catechism was what the pope wanted us to believe, not letting us be free to choose what we wanted to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: So I had no use for the catechism.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: And between the two of us, I’m very critical of the 10 commandments, that they were -- the way they were spelled out.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: But we have a personal responsibility to God, but it also gives us the right and the [indecipherable] to ask, God, where are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Didn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s620">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: So, did you ti --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: -- don’t ask me questions about religion, I’m -- at the present time --</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: But when you were raised as a kid --</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Re -- organized religion is an organized attack by the ones who know how to use people, to brainwash people --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: -- for self profiteering purposes.</span> <span id="s627">It’s a dismal use, dismal you -- it’s not right.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: But you didn’t have this --</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: And what was happening with Catholic clergy is just atrocious [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: But you didn’t feel this as a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: No, as a -- as a kid I was -- I was happy to stand tall.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Because my -- my grandmother was an individualist.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So did you -- did your grandmother sort of take over --</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: She had -- yeah -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: -- partly raising you after your mother passed?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: -- and after my mom died, my grandmother was the ruling influence in our lives, but too much emphasis on discipline --</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: -- too much emphasis on tradition, but great emphasis on respect for ladies.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Obviously ladies --</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Was this your mother’s mother, or your father’s mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: My father’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Oh yeah, she was a lady of stature.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: As my grandfather wouldn’t have married her, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: She says [indecipherable] Baylor, you have to make sure to learn how to distinguish between a lady and just an ordinary woman.</span> <span id="s650">Trouble is, in Vienna, the ladies were in the [indecipherable] district, the ordinary women were in the second district.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: See, that’s the only way you --</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: And she said, eventually she said, there is nothing wrong learning how to -- going to the girls in the second district.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s656">You never did --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: But she would -- and my grandmother hired two professional educators.</span> <span id="s658">I was six years old, my brother was nine years old, that we had had for about seven years each.</span> <span id="s659">One of them was six foot something, big moustache, legs like that and she didn't like my jumpy attitude.</span> <span id="s660">I was a fast learner, I wanted to learn fast, to play games fast, and eventually it was so bad she couldn’t corre -- she tied my legs to the chair [indecipherable] onto the chair, said you will now sit for an hour because I want you to sit for an hour and do exactly what I want you, I said, but I’ve already finished.</span> <span id="s661">That’s not the is-issue.</span> <span id="s662">You have to follow me, you have to -- I am the one to educate you, to bring you up, therefore, you have to learn discipline.</span> <span id="s663">Oh, I hated her.</span> <span id="s664">And then -- but -- at night she said, never go out in the dark, because there’s a guy waiting for you with the knife.</span> <span id="s665">She was terrified of the dark.</span> <span id="s666">Eventually my father let her go.</span> <span id="s667">The other woman was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: So does this mean you --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: The other woman was a loving girl, a loving woman by the name of Anna Fayis, also complete -- very Hungarian.</span> <span id="s670">She really made a Hungarian out of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s671">She was from -- she was also from Szeged, right.</span> <span id="s672">Blonde woman, she was an educator, very tough but very fair, and very decent.</span> <span id="s673">She didn't mistreat us.</span> <span id="s674">But she was almost like a mother substitute, except my father was loafing around, so she could kind of not handle my father, you see [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s675">But she was a very strong influence and she survived the war and went back to Hungary and I corresponded with her until 1963, when she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: So did this --</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: And from her -- her, I was able to retrieve some of those photographs there.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Because she had somehow managed to save some of the things that the commies had taken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Some of the photographs, right.</span> <span id="s681">So did this mean you didn’t go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Thi -- thi -- did this mean you didn’t go to school, that you were home --</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: No, no, no, I didn’t -- no, I -- I did go --</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: You went to school as well?</span> <span id="s686">A: -- I greet -- did go to a high, high -- the Hungarian school was a very [indecipherable] school.</span> <span id="s687">I have a matriculation --</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: -- from a Hungarian secondary school, which was a good enough school to give me immediate admission to the university in Budapest --</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: -- which was the most famous university, [indecipherable] university in Prague, and the Vienna University in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: And eventually, after I was released from prisoner of war, I went to Vienna with that certificate, I was admitted immediately to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: To that school, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: -- university to study, guess what, law.</span> <span id="s696">I always told my father, I don’t want to study law, I don’t want to study law, I don’t want to study diplomacy, I want to study [indecipherable] political science.</span> <span id="s697">He said, you will study law [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s698">So eventually I took --</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: So you stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: -- took up law and political science, but then I dropped law, I found law -- law is boring.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Anyway, I have a very good --</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: But you liked st --</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: -- high school condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: -- but you liked studying as a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Oh, I love -- I loved studying because, first of all, my brain was very flexible.</span> <span id="s707">I don’t know whether it’s that French stimulus or a Hungarian -- it’s a -- some kind of a mix of the French and the Hungarian that keeps you jumping all the time.</span> <span id="s708">Everybody says, Lally, your metabolism is fantastic.</span> <span id="s709">You never sit back and do nothing.</span> <span id="s710">Absolutely right.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Now, what I know is what nobody else knows.</span> <span id="s713">You know why I always keep on jumping?</span> <span id="s714">When the Germans marched into Austria -- Austria was a leisurely people.</span> <span id="s715">On the whole most of them are good-willed people, they’re a lot of fun, kind of like the French is and the -- the Italian.</span> <span id="s716">So they went Nazi for awhile because they needed jobs and maybe because of Hitler and all that, but on the whole they are a more leisurely people than the ever -- the Germans would ever hope to be.</span> <span id="s717">The Germans quickly built [indecipherable] and mortars into the behinds of every one of us, right, to make us move like the Germans.</span> <span id="s718">I think they forgot to take one out.</span> <span id="s719">Keeps on making me jumpy.</span> <span id="s720">But I was a good student and a very -- I loved the Latin.</span> <span id="s721">At that time they still had six years of Latin, four years of Greek, and I loved the -- the -- the classicists.</span> <span id="s722">Greek mythology has great significant in my life.</span> <span id="s723">I really believe in Venus.</span> <span id="s724">I also believe in Pallas Athena because to me the ideal lady is a combination of Venus and Pallas Athena, you see.</span> <span id="s725">Brain-wise and otherwise.</span> <span id="s726">And also loved games, so in order to be able to do everything within the constraints of a disciplinary upbringing, I had to be fast in learning to get away from those ropes.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: To get it -- right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: And how to be good at sports, to have an [indecipherable] with my dad, that was kind of de-emphasizing studies, he really wanted to just play soccer, obviously, being a left wing and the -- in the high school soccer team, also playing soc -- ping pong and also playing chess.</span> <span id="s729">My father taught me how to play chess.</span> <span id="s730">After two years he stopped, he said, I can’t stand it any more, you keep on winning all the time.</span> <span id="s731">Very [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s732">So I was a fast learner and with the languages, you grew up with the Hungarian and with the Slavic, and with the Romanian and with the German and with the -- whatever French there had been in the family still [indecipherable] my -- my grandmother, father’s mother always called an umbrella a parapree.</span> <span id="s733">A strange term in Austria, right?</span> <span id="s734">But that’s the way it was, so I wer -- grew up with five languages and I still commanding -- have added to that English and some Russian because when I was at Columbia University I was taken up into a special program in which my capacities, like music capacities, will be brought to full bloom by [indecipherable] and they -- they were going to employ me by the Rand Corporation to become a -- some kind of a spy about eastern Europe, understandably so.</span> <span id="s735">The Americans want to pick the brain that can instantaneously prove useful.</span> <span id="s736">They knew, the Americans, about my forced induction in that, but th-they forgave me.</span> <span id="s737">And I have to tell you that --</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Right, right --</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: -- that’s a latter part of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: -- you’re right.</span> <span id="s741">So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: I -- I loved studying.</span> <span id="s743">But back home the limits of studying was within the context of your socioeconomic structure.</span> <span id="s744">You needed to know how to understand that, but don’t worry about things outside of that.</span> <span id="s745">It was not universal education.</span> <span id="s746">It was parochial [indecipherable] empire in U.S. education.</span> <span id="s747">The Kaiser is on the top and you always have to bow to them.</span> <span id="s748">Somewhere along the line I dropped that.</span> <span id="s749">Why do I have to bow to a Kaiser if I don’t have to bow if I want talk to God?</span> <span id="s750">And Canada and Magill broadened my attitude to become a Universalist attitude, the essential foundation being peace among humans.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Because all humans have red blood.</span> <span id="s753">It makes no sense at all to shed human lifes, or -- blood is equally red, why -- why -- why shed it?</span> <span id="s754">That’s -- that’s me today.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Was there a lot of racism and anti-Semitism when --</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Oh no -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: -- when you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: -- the -- the -- in the Hungarian society, the -- the austro -- the Austro-Hungarian empire during the reign of Franz Joseph the second promoted Jewish people to very visible posts in industry, even in banking [indecipherable] for exam -- we had the Austria branch of the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s759">And they even gave them barisees exceptionally with appropriate financial payments.</span> <span id="s760">If we wanted [indecipherable] graf, a count, you had to pay three times more than you’d had to pay.</span> <span id="s761">But there were quite a few very successful Jewish businessman who had become barons and were living -- and their ladies -- living a [indecipherable] lifestyles, with free entry to the [indecipherable] and to all the privileges, to parliament and all that.</span> <span id="s762">But amongst the masses, especially in the east, the most part there was there the [indecipherable] there was always greater anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: The Hungarian peasantry was very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s765">That’s an issue that hasn’t been fully explored yet.</span> <span id="s766">The Jewish people, the Jewish potentates, I call them potentates in Hungary, right, they were not enemies of Hungarian ordinary peasants, because the peasants were living in a feudal system.</span> <span id="s767">The big enemies of Hungarian peasants were the Hungarian aristocrats.</span> <span id="s768">The Hungarian aristocrats were explicitly anti-Semitic, unlike the Viennese aristocracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: You see, by then, any feudal system, remember, five, 600 years ago had its basic principles resting on the Jews killed Jesus, therefore we have to exterminate the Jews and we have to keep them in place.</span> <span id="s771">We have to let them prosper then we’ll rob them blind.</span> <span id="s772">So a necessary evil, it has to be fully controlled.</span> <span id="s773">That is a feudal system.</span> <span id="s774">With the enlightenment period, this emphasis on the Jews killed Jesus, therefore we have to kill the Jews has disappeared [indecipherable] in particular in Italy, and of course, particularly amongst the more educated classes of the German speaking Protestants, right?</span> <span id="s775">But the Catholics were hanging onto that well until [indecipherable], it’s the truth, you see, so you’re raised in a situation like that, you see Frankel, the mathematic teacher playing a -- pleasurably yelling as much and drinking as much, and I-I knew he was Jewish, but he was member of a group, of an in-group of the higher bourgeoisie, and behaving like it too.</span> <span id="s776">Like the guys had all the rights, the guys have all the powers.</span> <span id="s777">They could misbehave, they can be drunk, right?</span> <span id="s778">Get into all kinds of mischief and yet they were excused because they are men, and presumed to be just.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: But was there a --</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: -- was there a difference in class?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: So if your father would think about a different class of Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Ah well, the -- the -- no, no, the -- the -- we never knew of the existence of just the ordinary poor Jewish people who were Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: We were with the cultured Jewish people.</span> <span id="s787">Li -- never brought up the question in my mind, except many years after the second World War of how much discrimination there must have been between the Jewish people who had arrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: -- in the uppermost classes and the little Orthodox bearded ones still living in the villages in Poland and Hungary.</span> <span id="s790">I remember one instance in New York City, I’ll tell you about that later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: A Mr. Rosenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: You must have heard that name Rosenberg, one of the greatest [indecipherable] in New York City ever, who was a German Jew, who was able to get away with special arrangements with the Nazis, with all of his paintings, set himself up in New York City, right?</span> <span id="s795">Had a glorious daughter, brought -- bringing her up on the -- on the west side, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Bringing her up in the -- spoke only -- he was Prussian German.</span> <span id="s798">As Prussian German as any Prussian German would want to be, brought up his daughter in America speaking the Prussian German accent.</span> <span id="s799">I met her when I was at Columbia University and living in International House, she was a frequent visitor because she had a guy there that she knew, was -- she was musically inclined.</span> <span id="s800">His daughter fell in love with the creator of the song, the boots are for -- the boots are for --</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Marching, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: -- stomping, or the boots are -- anyway, the guy who wrote that was a little Jewish guy [indecipherable] from Poland.</span> <span

never ge -- never get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Brought up [indecipherable] but to answer your question, class-wise, if you’re at a certain elite level, Jewish or not, made no difference at all, just like in England.</span> <span id="s806">There are in British parliament from Jewish lords, I know, successful bankers, successful businessmen who I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: So you were not raised in the situation -- your -- your --</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: No, I was not in a situation in which you would say a Jew is all good or bad.</span> <span id="s809">We didn’t know about the poor Jews in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: They were simply nonexistent.</span> <span id="s812">And the ones that are socially acceptable, they were just like everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: But when you’re a early teen --</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: And you know what’s an interesting thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: The Jewish people that I knew of a certain rank, they were Hungarian nationalists, or Austrian nationalists, or Serbian nationalists or Romanian nationalists, even though they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s817">But the Hungarian Jews was really Hungarian.</span> <span id="s818">What else could they be?</span> <span id="s819">So la --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: When you say they were nationalists --</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: -- what do -- what do you -- what do you mean when they -- when you say they were nationalists --</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Well, they -- they are --</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: -- do you mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: -- the -- the -- the -- Hor -- the -- Horthy’s regime was very much in support of Hungarian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: You see?</span> <span id="s828">By the way, the interesting statistic is also Béla Kun was a Jewish Hungarian, but he had gone communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: So maybe he had gone communist because he thought that somebody had to do something liberational for the little Jewish people who were poor, barely living in the modern [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s831">I know -- I never studied that, but th-the -- a very serious question arose in my mind some years ago, and I been looking at that.</span> <span id="s832">I have caught in Vienna many years ago when I was visiting a display of Austrian Jews who had per -- been persecuted by the Nazis, who had disappeared, who had been killed.</span> <span id="s833">As again, the Austrian Jews had been able to get away.</span> <span id="s834">80 percent of the Austrian Jewish intelligentsia was allowed to get away.</span> <span id="s835">The poor Austrian Jews, literally almost all of them perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Cause they couldn’t leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: [indecipherable] because they were not able to get away.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: But at the same time, seems like it’s some kind of an imbalance.</span> <span id="s840">How come Rosenberg was able to get away with everything, and tens of thousand of poorly Jews are killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: It just -- something is lacking there, som-some feeling of responsible -- responsibility is lacking.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Did you feel a change once Hitler became chancellor in Germany in ’33?</span> <span id="s844">Did something change in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Well, they were all [indecipherable] they were all -- except -- except for the ones who were caught as having been anti-Hitler, those who had been able to get away anyway, right, to the anti-Hitler areas.</span> <span id="s846">But the ones who stayed inside, mostly they were caught and executed.</span> <span id="s847">The others were solidly marching, e-even the Austrian.</span> <span id="s848">He gave us jobs, he is wa -- our own li-life and blood.</span> <span id="s849">He gave us hope, he is keeping the commies away and Cardinal Innitzer, who was the chief Cardinal of Austria during -- at the beginning of Hitler’s era, I remember the main platz of Vienna -- the main platz, the main square of Vienna, the -- the German troops, including the Austrian divisions were lined up, waiting for the blessing of Innitzer, which bri – Innitzer willingly and happily gave them, sending them to eastern front to save us from -- civilization from -- from the godless communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: But what --</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: And they were marching in line because the Catholic church officially never disapproved of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s853">But what did you feel like as a kid?</span> <span id="s854">What -- what you --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: I was a kid when Hitler came to power --</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Right, you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: -- it was 1933, I was eight years old --</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Right --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: -- I didn’t know anything about anything --</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Right, but when you became --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: At 16 -- 16, my main preoccupation was to get as a student to Budapest and study in Budapest.</span> <span id="s862">And then in terms of my -- the original ideas, join the Hungarian external affairs department, become a Hungarian diplomat.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Right, I’m -- I understand that, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: And everything else I have no concern for.</span> <span id="s865">The

the -- the --oh yes, the -- one the thing I remember, everybody in the late -- in the mid and late 30’s, every man was suddenly wearing some kind of a uniform.</span> <span id="s868">And everybody wearing a uniform, marching together, were trying out yell everybody else.</span> <span id="s869">There were no weapons.</span> <span id="s870">There were just brutal encounters and -- between the uniformed communists, uniformed blackists, which was the Austrian National Traditional party, and the uniformed retro -- the socialists, but not as red as the communist redshirts, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: They were beating each other up, and then the Austrian Nazis, the brownshirts rounding them up.</span> <span id="s873">There was a melee in the streets virtually all the time, especially 1935 - ’36 - ’37, when Dollfuss was assassinated, right?</span> <span id="s874">Where the Nazis were -- become numerous enough to want to take power by force, right?</span> <span id="s875">Everybody is -- were out in the street yelling and qui -- and -- an-and beating each other up.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: And what’s happening to you and your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: To?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: I mean -- to you and your friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: To me and my friends --</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: I -- I mean, I -- are -- is -- is there something --</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: -- well, I was then -- I was then in my -- Motsbachkiruk was like a little peaceful enclave.</span> <span id="s882">You mustn’t forg -- we mustn’t forget that.</span> <span id="s883">A northern -- southern Hungary and northern Yugoslavia and westernmost Romania were an agricultural society.</span> <span id="s884">In an agricultural society you have three or four intelligentsia on the top, like the ones who run the district [indecipherable] education.</span> <span id="s885">You have then the professional groups, you had -- and then you have the merchants, and then you have the priests and then you have the peasants, right?</span> <span id="s886">And they’re all kind of falling in step with the needs of an agricultural society.</span> <span id="s887">Rebirth in -- in March, April, planting the crops, gathering the crops, having the crops gathered in September, having a great feast, all of them drinking themselves to death and then stopping for the winter and waiting for the renewal on following March.</span> <span id="s888">International happenings like Hitler and communism, they’re too far away to worry about, except the members of the intelligentsia and of the property class.</span> <span id="s889">My father was always worried about the communists taking away everything.</span> <span id="s890">He didn't worry about Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: But the --</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Because Hitler’s system was a capitalist system.</span> <span id="s893">State capitalist system.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s895">So he didn’t worry about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Right?</span> <span id="s897">Hitler would only dispossess people if they became anti-Hitlerian, but he will let German capitalists prosper, just look at the Krups and all the others, how rich they got.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s899">Okay, let’s change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: I think when we were stopping I was asking you about anti-Semitism in Hungary --</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: -- and whether it was class based.</span> <span id="s905">Do you recall some of the laws tha-that Hungary started promulgating against the Jews in ’38 and ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: After -- no.</span> <span id="s907">No, hu -- no, under how -- hung -- under -- for a while -- well, I was very young then, but I was aspiring to go to -- to university in Budapest.</span> <span id="s908">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: No, I’m just asking if you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: -- I do not recall --</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: You don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: -- I don’t -- do not recall any quote unquote anti-Jewish laws before the Germans would gradually force Horth-Horthy into doing that.</span> <span id="s913">And that would have been 1943 - 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: So you don’t -- you don’t recall the -- the laws that were restricting Jewish professions, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: No, I don’t recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: I don’t recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: I do recall laws of marginalization in which Hungary insisted that every non-Hungarian name and person carrying that name should, just like in French [indecipherable] that, and adopt to the national language, the language of the nation.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: And in the course of that change their name to a Hungarian sounding name.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s923">But you don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: And many of the Jewish people were then taking on Jew -- Hungarian --</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Hungarian names.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: -- sounding names.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s928">Okay, but you don’t recall [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: So what did they do?</span> <span id="s930">Instead of calling Kirschbaum, they called themselves the Hungarian equivalent of Kirschbaum, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: What did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Kir-Kirschbaum is a cherry tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Right?</span> <span id="s935">Would have been a typical name, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: You see.</span> <span id="s938">But I don’t -- not before -- I think it was only 1943 I think, that the Nylas party, the Hungarian Arrow Cross --</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Right, Arrow Cross party, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: -- oh, what was the guy’s name?</span> <span id="s941">I’ll remember the name in a minute.</span> <span id="s942">The Nylas party emerged and with the Nylas party emerging, underwriting Hitler’s anti-Jewish policies, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: It could never been a Nazi party because Hungarians don’t qualify as -- as ethnic Germans, right, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: But the Arrow Cross part -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: The Nylas party [indecipherable] the Nylas party, eventually they took power.</span> <span id="s947">Then the massive edicts against the Jewish population, leading to the wholesale -- wholesale transportation to the camps in 1944, was very viciously started and conducted.</span> <span id="s948">And the Hungarian gendarmerie were a very, very important factor in rounding them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s950">Were you reading the newspapers when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yeah, I-I was reading newspapers, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: But not a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Well -- well yeah, I was reading the sports pages a lot.</span> <span id="s954">I still -- I still remember the three Hungarian gold medal winners at the 1936 Olympics.</span> <span id="s955">Che --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Oh yeah, the three of them.</span> <span id="s958">In swimming, and -- on the 100 meter swimming, in the discus throwing [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s959">Oh, I was also taught by the 1928 Olympia medal -- gold medal winner in the saber, I was taught how to fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s962">So [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: So in ’36 you’re only 11 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yeah, but they -- you start early.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: But you -- you’re paying attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: You start early, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: So did --</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: I remember -- I remember the names in sports.</span> <span id="s969">I remember some names in -- in politics, but I’d -- I don’t remember before 1939 - ’40, I don’t remember having read intensively international politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Because as I told you, peasant society, we were well off.</span> <span id="s972">We had saved the two factories, we were giving jobs.</span> <span id="s973">My granny was contented.</span> <span id="s974">I was having my regular vacations in our house in [indecipherable] had seen that little Hungarian girl, kind of feeling more and more like a little guy growing up and I was watching my brother.</span> <span id="s975">It was a nice little life.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Was a -- right, and it was a bit protected in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: And I had the possibility of eventually landing in Budapest if I get a job --</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: -- and acting like typical Hungarian [indecipherable] a man of the -- not saloons, mans of the -- the -- the ball scene.</span> <span id="s980">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s981">Did you go to the movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: I did go to the movies, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Did you like the movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: -- I -- well, the one movie I saw, I was about 11 years old [speaks Hungarian here].</span> <span id="s985">The boys of [indecipherable] in Budapest, which was a tragic story of a Hungarian little girl from the village, typical of feudal society, desperately wanted to get away, getting away from this to the city, working in a textile factory, and being raped by the foreman.</span> <span id="s986">And I had no idea what that meant, I was 11 years old, but they showed the various scenes in which he was kind of being very crude and rude to her and I burst out crying.</span> <span id="s987">And then the little boys got together, having heard of that, and decided to beat up the bastard [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: The --</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Beat up the man who did it to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Uh-huh, who did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: And he gave her after the fact, just a bar of soap, and she looked totally destroyed.</span> <span id="s992">And that movie I thought will shatter my heart.</span> <span id="s993">I felt so terrible about any man doing something like that to a little girl, in a setting which I was raised to believe again that little girls from the good families are untouchable until you are married to them.</span> <span id="s994">There’s nothing wrong with the little girls in the second district, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: And I broke out crying.</span> <span id="s997">My dad was in the movie, he pulled me out and said, boys don’t cry about things like that.</span> <span id="s998">I didn’t really understand what it was about, but -- and -- but then we -- I saw Tom Mix several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Tom Mix --</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: You wouldn’t know, you are too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: -- right.</span> <span id="s1002">No, no, I do know Tom Mix.</span> <span id="s1003">I do know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Tom Mix was my big hero --</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: -- right, and I loved that big black hat that he was wearing, right, all black and white.</span> <span id="s1007">So he was the ultimate proof that the good in the United States shall always prevail --</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Always prevail, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: -- over the bad.</span> <span id="s1010">And somehow I said, oh gee, I wish they had a Tom Mix right here, to teach that bastard a lesson, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: And we saw -- we had American comics, which were eventually prohibited.</span> <span id="s1013">And amongst the comics I liked Flash Gordon and Mandrake the Magician, you see.</span> <span id="s1014">So there was that American freedom of spirit --</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: -- beckoning, but not forceful enough for us to have wanted to say from our class, I have to drop everything and we’ll go to America --</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: [indecipherable] right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: -- be part -- part and parcel of that spirit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Did you see the 1936 Olympics on film on the news?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: I saw the Olympics on film, oh yeah, oh boy, it wa -- was so [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: What did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: On film, yes, because there was no television --</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: -- you see, and I -- I was [indecipherable] the three Hungarian [indecipherable] why don’t I remember the German [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s1025">We had nothing to do with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: But let me ask you something, when you watch this -- the -- the 1936 Olympics --</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: The film?</span> <span id="s1028">I was very impressionable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: What did you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: I was -- I was overwhelmed by the notion that systems in the world, the American system -- I glorified Owens.</span> <span id="s1031">All my friends loved Jesse Owens, and they all criticized Hitler for not personally pinning a special medal on Jesse Ow --</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Right, and what did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: -- because he -- they -- it was not a matter of righteousness, it was a matter of, there is something in America which should allow even a black man -- and the rumor had it that the blacks didn’t have it easy in America in the 1920’s - ‘30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: You should allow some specific black men to have the specialized training to make use of their natural talents.</span> <span id="s1036">And that was kind of almost like a renaissance type of belief, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: And did you ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: If you have the talent, you’re worthwhile being developed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: All systems would have that.</span> <span id="s1041">The East Germans made use of that premise too, but -- so we loved Jesse Owens.</span> <span id="s1042">We had no feeling for the German athletes, but we necessarily rooted for the Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1043">And would you believe it?</span> <span id="s1044">A nation of 10 million had -- were third best amongst the gold medal winners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: They were our national heroes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: So what did -- what did you think of the fact that Hitler didn’t pin the medal on Jesse Owens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Oh, he didn’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1049">Hitler was to me an alien figure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: He was an alien figure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: You know, I remember my dad was rooting like crazy, yelling like -- my dad was a very [indecipherable] civil gentleman, he -- he got carried away when the Hungarians were winning the gold medals.</span> <span id="s1052">He said absolutely nothing when the Germans were winning their medals, and I think the Germans came first best there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: First best, they had the largest number of medals, but [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: And what were you hearing about Hitler from your father and from other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Oh, th-the fi -- the film -- I think I saw the film a year later and for what I’ve seen through it, and it may influence my reasoning, it was one of the most creative films ever as a documentary, bringing you all kinds of new nuances of moviemaking, including attempts at early [indecipherable] things like that.</span> <span id="s1057">And the glorification scenes of the flags and all that.</span> <span id="s1058">There’s a lot of glorification of flags in the United States today, so maybe the Americans learned from her, right, how to do all those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: You’re talking about Leni Riefen --</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: But the -- the politics of it -- the politics of it remain hidden in the background, you know why?</span> <span id="s1061">Because Berlin was selected unanimously to become the site of the 1936 Olympics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: And all the democratic nations, having underwritten that, my family had no reason to question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: It was 1936.</span> <span id="s1066">Hitler had already shown his muscle.</span> <span id="s1067">The Zargebeit have got back, the [indecipherable] have gotten back.</span> <span id="s1068">He -- the Austrian [indecipherable] is already working on, right?</span> <span id="s1069">And there were all kinds of Nazi things, plots all over the world, right, even United States [indecipherable] starting to show its ugly head, right?</span> <span id="s1070">So we had all the major -- there were [indecipherable] countries approving of that.</span> <span id="s1071">You would say, well, things are normal.</span> <span id="s1072">Hitler seems to be accepted, it’s a sporting event --</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: So that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: -- maybe just like the one now in China, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: And if it’s a sporting event, whatever excesses there may have been against the Jewish population, right, the Kristallnacht in 1934, that would have been a singular bad experience in history, but it will never reoccur.</span> <span id="s1077">The opinion was the world was at peace with Hitler because he hadn’t yet --</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Kris-Kristallnacht --</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: -- pulled the rug under any of the other [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: -- right, Kristallnacht doesn’t occur until ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: It’s in 1938, I was 11 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: You see, and th-the movie, I remember the movie, it really glorified, I thought as a kid, the exceptional human contents of exceptionally gifted athletes, and kind of an ideal to which you would aspire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: You’re talking about Leni Rie --</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: It never dawned upon me, the Aryan thing, never dawned upon me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: You’re talking about Leni Riefenstahl’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: That’s right --</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: -- film about the Olympics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Now, if we had been told then, warned then, that is actually a Riefenstahl type of propaganda on behalf of Nazis --</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: -- I’d have had, maybe, as a fairly creative thinking 11 year old, a second thought.</span> <span id="s1094">I never discovered behind that -- beyond -- behind that, the intent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Now, was it an attempt to -- by Hitler, through Riefenstahl to blind everybody?</span> <span id="s1097">Was she an instrument of Nazi political power manipulation?</span> <span id="s1098">Well, she was then about -- about 25 -- 28 years old, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1099">She could have fallen under the spell of Hitler and done exactly what Hitler wanted her to do without anybody else catching on.</span> <span id="s1100">Now how do I rem -- how do I look at the Olympics these days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: No, I really want to know what -- what it was like for you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: What I would have done?</span> <span id="s1103">If I had been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: Beca -- beca -- no, I mean who -- who -- when you were 11 years old.</span> <span id="s1105">You were thinking about sports --</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: No, but oh, if -- if -- if I had been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: -- so it’s not a political issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: -- oh I’d -- I would have loved to have been 17 - 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: T -- so that you could have gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: As good as I was and I would have loved to be part of the scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Now, would I have loved that because I had dark hair and brown eyes, and winning the -- winning the [indecipherable] championship in world Ping Pong, not because I was dark haired, but because I would have been best at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: And that’s exactly the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Wanting to be best at something has nothing to do with race or creed.</span> <span id="s1117">You have the talent, develop it, but it doesn’t make you better than anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: When the Germans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Oh, I’d have loved to have been part of that movie, why not, glorifying sport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Of that movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: You were in -- you’re in -- you’re -- as long as you’re engaged in sport, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: You cannot -- you’re not supposed to -- not engage in sex at the same time, right?</span> <span id="s1124">Nor are you engaged in racism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1126">But clearly there was a racist element in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Oh, but surely it was, on hindsight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1129">But -- but that’s not what you noticed then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: No, no, I didn’t notice that, I was just carried away with the Hungarians having an incredible performance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: But you saw something about Jesse Owens, you and your friends.</span> <span id="s1132">You saw that -- that Hitler would not put on -- give him the medal, cause he was so angry that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Well, at the -- the -- please don’t forget, at the level of 11 year olds, the German yo-youth were already in the Hitler youth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: We were boy scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: In Hungary there were boy scouts, there were no Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s1138">Actually, in Hungary there never were any Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s1139">In the Banar there were Volksdeutsche Hitler youths equivalent, but that’s a very -- way secondary, lower com -- con-consideration.</span> <span id="s1140">So if you’re a boy scout, you’re a Universalist, you kind of look at the Hitler youth we knew, but there were no movies about the Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s1141">You’ll notice all placards, you received placards [indecipherable] say, well they are doing the same, they said they all look so blonde.</span> <span id="s1142">Why do they all look so blonde?</span> <span id="s1143">But they didn’t go beyond that.</span> <span id="s1144">We were Hungarians on the -- of all kinds of mixed.</span> <span id="s1145">You have light blondes, dark blondes, you have Slavic looking types, you have Gypsy looking types, all kinds of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: So in ’38 when the -- when Hitler -- when there’s the anschluss --</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Took Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: -- in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Wh-What do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: It had no import on us --</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: No import.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: -- except my -- my grandmother was saying oh, now business will become a bit better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Will become better?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1156">Well, when Hitler invaded Austria, I [indecipherable] in the world invaded consciously, not liberated okay, it’s a big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Ri-Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: An German -- Austrian German would say liberated.</span> <span id="s1159">[indecipherable] invaded Austria, occupied Austria --</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: But there was no war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: -- our business was improving, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: But there was no war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: There was no war, right, but there was massive unemployment.</span> <span id="s1164">And Austria had needed access to the German market --</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: -- who were fully employed under the auspices of the state.</span> <span id="s1167">Exports, subsidies, you name it, Hitler had that.</span> <span id="s1168">Chalke had worked on the policies magnificently.</span> <span id="s1169">All of a sudden Germans are getting money and gold from all over the place, but they weren't satisfied, right?</span> <span id="s1170">And part of that over-spilled into Austria, part of that into the agricultural economies, because the agriculture economy needed machinery.</span> <span id="s1171">In exchange for the machinery, they delivered to the Germans [indecipherable] for butter and whipping cream.</span> <span id="s1172">I remember after the Germans came into Vienna, six weeks after there was no whipping cream left in Vienna, which was a major catastrophe, don’t laugh at me.</span> <span id="s1173">The Germans took it all.</span> <span id="s1174">But they paid for in cash.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: So what happens to the Jews in Austria --</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: So business improved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Do you know th -- do you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: What -- what happened -- do you -- do you hear, as a ki -- you’re what, 14 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: No, that was 1938?</span> <span id="s1181">I was 13 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: 13 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Almost 14, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: 14.</span> <span id="s1185">Do you hear about what happens to the Jews when it -- when the Germans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Oh no, there was -- well, in Austria -- I was not in Vienna itself in 1938, but there was a disquiet.</span> <span id="s1187">Mr. Frank expressed -- sometimes he came with very sad face to his -- to card games with my dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: And it lasted for about two years, and then it suddenly just gone, I’ve t -- I’ve told you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Right, he was disappearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: But we heard from friend in Vienna that the Jewish people had disappeared in the course of June, July 1938, literally overnight.</span> <span id="s1192">And all those ghastly scenes about the broomsticks, you know, having to clean the streets --</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: -- you know, wash the roads [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: -- underneath, that those excesses had happened, but the observation there is that sa -- I remember some of the Austria monarchists saying quite critically, if the allies hadn’t destroyed Austria-Hungary, the Jewish pogroms would never have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Well, how about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: -- because the Jewish population was at peace during the r-reign of Joseph -- Franz Joseph the second, was at peace with the community at large.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: But ha -- that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: -- and were fully [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: -- how was that an --</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: -- that, but only at the level of the higher bourgeoisie.</span> <span id="s1203">So they were in Hungary, even though less so, because the Hungarian aristocracy was very opposed to the Jewish rising influence in financial services especially, right.</span> <span id="s1204">But with the disintegration of the empire, right, somebody was made the scapegoat, and Hitler succeeded, I think -- I’m just jumping here -- succeeded in convincing the only Austrian working class person without a job that Hitler’s proposition that the German Jews has benefited from the first World War equally applied in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Namely that there was Austrian Jewish person who had benefited from the first World War.</span> <span id="s1207">But that is absolute nonsense, because with Austria-Hungary being destroyed, everybody lost.</span> <span id="s1208">But Hitler and the Nazis in Austria were able to exploit that.</span> <span id="s1209">And as you would expect, manipulating those uneducated brains into ou-outbur -- outbursts of hatred, led to the scenes of the Austrian mob forcing -- with the policemen just looking on, right, forcing the Jewish persons, including the highly intelligentsia Jewish person, including the very skilled doctor, and [indecipherable] to kneel on the streets and clean on the streets in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: And then there were no hue and cry.</span> <span id="s1212">By the time there was no hue and cry when the Jews suddenly disappeared because anti-Semitism, latent amongst the peoples, masses at large, was brought on very forcefully by Hitler’s own presence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: And is your father surprised at what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: My father was lucky.</span> <span id="s1215">My father was -- he was, I think -- how should I answer that?</span> <span id="s1216">Frank was a very good friend of his.</span> <span id="s1217">I remember there was a Jewish dentist [indecipherable] Beshker, who was a very good friend of his.</span> <span id="s1218">My father said previous, as I mentioned to you, that Hitler would be -- would be a good means to keep communism at bay and help us save our properties.</span> <span id="s1219">But then with respect to the Jews, I think he was contented to know -- too contented to really believe that when the Jews of the Banar disappeared, that what the Germans had claiming, including the Volksdeutsche German representative, that they were being rounded up for their own safekeeping, that’s where it stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: And w-what if --</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: I think he fell into that trap, if we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Did you -- did you fall into it as well, given that he said that to you, that you thought, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Well, I -- I b -- I -- I believe -- I -- I still feel aggrieved about what happened to that little Jewish girl that my brother was in love with.</span> <span id="s1224">And I re -- I ca -- I saw my brother crying many, many, many times, and I never saw him smiling ever again.</span> <span id="s1225">But I thought that was a singular case of a boy loving a girl, without referring to the girl being a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s1226">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1228">And di -- so, did you talk with your broth --</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: So I was -- I was -- well, let’s see now, this would have been 1941, in June ’41 I was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s1230">We had -- I had no Jewish guys actually at all in the Hungarian school, but we couldn’t have had that because they had disappeared in the summer of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1232">So did that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: No, let me just see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: -- was that shocking to you, that these, all of these people just were -- disappeared?</span> <span id="s1235">Or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Shocking?</span> <span id="s1237">Well, absolu -- I’d have to go back in my memory cells.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: What -- what about that disturbed me -- well, also kind of made me feel neutral?</span> <span id="s1240">I think I -- I must have kind of felt well, that’s the way things are these days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: If they say -- and we knew that the superior force had come in, if that is the way things are happening, that is part the way -- ay -- oh, you, I have the answer.</span> <span id="s1243">I was much more concerned about the Germans, the Nazi Germans coming in and hanging hundreds of Serbs accused of being communists, all over the main market squares in Montbachkirche, in Boch, in -- there are three major cities in the Banar.</span> <span id="s1244">Montbachkirche, Notchkinken and Ponchua, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: They were hanging hundreds of Serbs, rounding up in the streets, without any cause whatsoever, and let them hang there for days, with placards saying this is how people will end their lives if they raise their fists, or whatever, do something against the occupational force of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1247">I was so perturbed about that, visibly in front of our eyes, that the disappearance of the Jewish people was not really knowing where they’re gone to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: You didn’t see it, you couldn’t see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: There was no rumors about their [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: There was no knowledge of concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: There wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: I think the much greater evil was the hanging of all these Serbs --</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: -- because they were left hanging there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: So there are no rumors about concentration camps in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: There were nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Nothing at all.</span> <span id="s1260">Nothing at all.</span> <span id="s1261">Only noise -- [indecipherable] got to mean something very bad eventually, after the fact.</span> <span id="s1262">Namely, the [indecipherable] kills.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: They were rounded up, as I mentioned to you already in Montbachkirche, Libriken and in Ponchua.</span> <span id="s1265">So somehow they got over the [indecipherable] linked with the idea of -- that’s from where they were eventually disappeared, and nobody knows where.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: But there was no talk at all about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1268">Don’t forget, the only concentration camp existing, the earliest one was Dachau 1936, and Dachau was not for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1269">The Jewish camps, I think, were being opened up -- Flossenbürg 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Well, there are -- there are Jews who go, but those are not the first Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: -- in ’33.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1274">So actually the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- regretfully of cour -- in the -- the extermination camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Were much -- there later.</span> <span id="s1276">Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: -- were only 1941 - ’42 - ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: But the -- the -- the general concentration camp system, which is huge in Germany by the time ’39 comes, and 1940 comes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Yeah, but it was -- that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Do you hear about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: It was -- it -- it goes back to that but th-the -- the -- f-from what I’ve read since then including Charter’s book on Hitler and all that, the -- the main intention of the early concentration camps is to make it a point to which to -- into -- which to enclose completely, the enemies of the state political.</span> <span id="s1282">Communists, reactionaries, anti-Nazis, generally speaking.</span> <span id="s1283">And eventually the unterklass, namely the Gypsies, in that order, and only eventually the Jewish people, in camps of their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: But what do you hear w -- that’s what you read later, but what do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: -- hear when you’re growing up, about those camps, anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: No, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: You don’t hear anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: -- knew nothing about it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: No difference.</span> <span id="s1292">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1293">Actually, I was -- I was drafted in 17 -- in -- in June -- June 1st, 1942.</span> <span id="s1294">I was in the Balkans, in the Prinz Eugen division all this time, until September 1944.</span> <span id="s1295">In September 194 -- the Soviets broke through Romania into Serbia and their -- our division was massacred, being put up against the [indecipherable] 90 percent of the personnel we lost fighting the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1296">In that time being in Yugoslavia, I knew nothing, I’d seen nothing about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1297">The first concentration camp I did see is on my way to the officers’ school.</span> <span id="s1298">We were supposed to be -- this was early in January 1945 -- supposed to be in Nuremburg.</span> <span id="s1299">Nuremburg was bombed the hell out of on the 11th and 12th of January, so we were rerouted towards the end of January to Leitmeritz.</span> <span id="s1300">And on the way to Leitmeritz in the Czech repu -- northwestern Czech Republic, we are -- there was only one road leading to Leitmeritz, and on the right hand side the road was Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1301">And remember sitting in the lorries, about 10 - 20 of us in the lorry, and we were told at a certain moment on the road, now you must look to the left, you’re not allowed to look to the right.</span> <span id="s1302">And army being the army, we looked to the left, but some of them, why don’t we look to the left?</span> <span id="s1303">Because there are Jewish people there, not supposed to -- you are not allowed to look at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: I remember that, that was end of January, around 20th of January, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: ’45, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: And that’s when this notion of Jewish people, huh, concentration camp came up in the mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Right?</span> <span id="s1310">And then we talked to each other and some of them who had been in the Soviet Union on the eastern front for several years had come across concentration camp in eastern Europe, in Poland, right?</span> <span id="s1311">And that day they interconnected as ah-ha, this must be a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1312">Only eventually did we learn that it was Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: But Theresienstadt was a, quote unquote, model concentration camp, to which the Red Cross dignitaries were invited, showing them off, even Jewish plays, Jewish theater, Jewish opera, Jewish musicians and things like that.</span> <span id="s1315">Nobody talked of the [indecipherable] of the small fortress, which was the extermination part of Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: And what about going to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Many people from Theresienstadt were sent to Auschwitz and gassed, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Oh -- oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1320">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: So what happens to you in 1939 when you find out now -- now you are 14 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Yeah, I’m 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: No -- 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Yeah, 14.</span> <span id="s1325">1939, 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: You’re 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: And the Germans attack Poland and begin setting up ghettos.</span> <span id="s1329">Do you know anything --</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Well, first of all, your -- maybe we shouldn’t leave Austria.</span> <span id="s1331">Don’t forget, my dad was an Austrian Royalist Monarchist who was looking down at Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1333">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: But with the absorption of Austria --</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: -- but he would say that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Wait, wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: With the absorption of Austria into Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: -- an impossible combination happened in the mind of one, who was an Austrian Royalist, namely, throughout 800 years of history, Austria had never been subjugated to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: And a real Austro-Hungarian would never want any part of Germany, because that’s the way history was.</span> <span id="s1343">Either you’re a German -- an Austrian Imperialist, or a German Imperialist, and you will never forget that Bismarck, upon being asked personally by the Kaiser representative in 1898 if he would concern that Austro-Hungary join Germany, the new Reich in an economic union, said Austro-Hungary will never qualify for a deve -- for an economic union because they are an underdeveloped, backward country.</span> <span id="s1344">A real Austro-Hungarian would never forgive the Germans for that.</span> <span id="s1345">And my father never did.</span> <span id="s1346">At the same time he said, well, Hitler is Austrian.</span> <span id="s1347">Why don’t you look at it from the point of view of Austria bringing Germany into the fold?</span> <span id="s1348">Ridiculous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: How can a little country absorb a huge country and not grow ill over that, right?</span> <span id="s1351">So in a certain sense my father’s attitude as a Royalist, in my eyes, was compromised.</span> <span id="s1352">I didn’t know how to explain it then, but I see it today.</span> <span id="s1353">But at the base of that was my father’s hatred of Bolshevism, because don’t forget, in the -- in the si -- the trigger for my dad actually was reawakening him to the threat of Bolshevism in the -- the civil war in Spain.</span> <span id="s1354">There is official knowledge that they burned about 300 churches, the communists, three major cathedrals, violated at least 10,000 nuns and killed 5,000 priests and bishops.</span> <span id="s1355">Now, we had no use for Catholicism, but as a Christian you would say, if communists can do that in that country, they’re a threat for all of European civilization, because Spain was part and parcel of western civilization, for the better, worse, the everything, in spite of the horrible things they did in South America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: We’re going to have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Yes, I’m sorry, we’re going to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: Very, very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: You know, you might be asking this question, how about the economics of Hitler?</span> <span id="s1363">How many people got to support Hitler amongst the previous so-called high bourgeois circles?</span> <span id="s1364">Because he was jobs, he was economics, he was foreign currency and he was international power.</span> <span id="s1365">Most of them did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Y-You rolling?</span> <span id="s1367">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: So what place did greed play?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: I don’t know, does -- does -- did it play a lot?</span> <span id="s1370">Did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Well, I just tell you that, sure.</span> <span id="s1372">From the Hitlerian policies of full employment, everybody who had suffered from [indecipherable] unemployment would benefit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: So the job creation prevailed over -- from the mental principles of morality.</span> <span id="s1375">Never look beyond the day after tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1376">Everybody was cashing in, especially on foreign exchange.</span> <span id="s1377">Even the Jewish people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: But now -- now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: -- early in the Hitler regime were cashing in on foreign exchange.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: And Hitler forbade them to exchange in foreign exchange dealings, right?</span> <span id="s1382">Cause he wanted the so-called pure Germans to have full control over foreign exchange [indecipherable] supporting the national interest because the Jewish people would then take the foreign exchange and then deposit it abroad, right?</span> <span id="s1383">So the first distinction, actually racial discrimination, actually [indecipherable] openly professed that against the Jews, was [indecipherable] recognition, that the money, foreign exchange, has to be kept at home, and those who sabotage that had to be imprisoned or even hanged.</span> <span id="s1384">So Kristallnacht was just a small example of what was really happening in the background, and that has never been researched.</span> <span id="s1385">And eventually the Jewish people fell into step, you see?</span> <span id="s1386">They had to give up their own disposition of foreign exchanges, they had to report like everybody else, but they had lost the trust, because some had been able to manage to deposit substantial dollar accounts, right?</span> <span id="s1387">So the German Germans got mad, right, and went after them because they were Jews, not because they were capitalist financiers.</span> <span id="s1388">So the greed -- and everyone was on the bandwagon.</span> <span id="s1389">Land prices were going up, so you bought land prices cheap, reselling them at higher values.</span> <span id="s1390">There were certain guarantees by the Hitler regime.</span> <span id="s1391">If your direct recourse as a high ranking party member you could that -- get all the financial funding you wanted to get to -- to -- to do this [indecipherable] right?</span> <span id="s1392">It paid there for bec -- to become a party member and move up high in the rank because you were a talented foreign exchange administrator.</span> <span id="s1393">You got these medals of this and that and everything else.</span> <span id="s1394">And with the greed, there was the greed for Jewish accumulations of currency, Jewish accumulations of -- of the fine arts especially, and the disappearance, in a very short period of time, period around -- when was that, 1930 -- 1940 - 1941, of all those very famous [indecipherable] in Berlin, Jewish art dealers, right, with the Germans sequestering all that, even though they let go guys like -- like Rosen-Rosenbaum -- Rosenthal, right?</span> <span id="s1395">So with that greed, the greed became massive, plunder, all the [indecipherable] Jewish properties to start, then the properties of the Polish aristocracy, and then looking beyond that, the plundering of westernmost Russia.</span> <span id="s1396">Great cause for invasion, the invasion wasn’t about eradicating communism.</span> <span id="s1397">The invasion was the Germans, the -- Hitler needed all the raw materials he could lay his hands on, and whatever world there was, including the -- including the wealth creation in the -- in the Ukraine under -- under top level agricultural soil.</span> <span id="s1398">Plunder was at the base of it.</span> <span id="s1399">Typical medieval warfare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: So, in 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: And everybody jumped in the bandwagon.</span> <span id="s1402">My grandmother made a profit [indecipherable] the extra jobs and the extra contracts, right?</span> <span id="s1403">So the question of morality?</span> <span id="s1404">Hitler didn’t say he wanted all that because he was going to major -- wage a major war.</span> <span id="s1405">Oh, by the way, have you noticed something interesting?</span> <span id="s1406">That great courageous, purely racist superior German nation was only winning wars against little countries that were little and totally unarmed.</span> <span id="s1407">So where is the big heroism?</span> <span id="s1408">Killing all the you -- the Poles in six weeks?</span> <span id="s1409">The ger -- the Yugoslavs in four weeks?</span> <span id="s1410">Hungarians, just walked over, Romania walked over.</span> <span id="s1411">Big deal.</span> <span id="s1412">The Frenchies were unprepared, right?</span> <span id="s1413">And they were comparatively a much smaller country, right, smaller industrial capacity and that.</span> <span id="s1414">So what about -- many of the Germans today still claim -- oh my God, I know from the trial, most of the Germans have -- Viel trial, most of the German opinion hasn’t changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: We are a heroic nation, look at us tha -- to some of them, it’s the -- some of the veteran -- we were fighting the whole world.</span> <span id="s1417">No other nation could have been able to do it.</span> <span id="s1418">How stupid.</span> <span id="s1419">But nobody knew that in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: So if -- in -- between --</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: You know the domino effect?</span> <span id="s1422">Hitler was the first practitioner of the domino effect --</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Domino effect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: -- the countries that had no problem [indecipherable] sorry, I may have gone off the tangent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: Between 1939 and 1941, so ’39 the Germans attack, the Nazis attack Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: And then in ’41 they attack the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1428">What’s happening to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Well, the -- first of all Austria, Austria my f --</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Well, that’s ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: -- my dad -- my dad learned how to live with that.</span> <span id="s1432">He was a realist, but he sa -- quietly he remained an Austrian Imperial [indecipherable] of the Kaiser.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: But I’m asking about you, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: And that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: -- but -- but you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: And openly -- openly, like many others he said, we need Hitler because we can use him.</span> <span id="s1437">Okay --</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: But what happens to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: This applies 1940 just as much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: -- but what happens to you between 1939 and 1941, before --</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: Same opinion, the same opinion --</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: The same opinion as your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: -- got even more prevalent because Hitler had brought law and order, he had kicked out the communists, or imprisoned the communists, or exterminated the communists except for the few who were getting away to the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1444">And the bourge -- bourgeoisie, I think if I can generalize like that, from my own family’s point of view, they were saying well, at least he has given us jobs, he has given us law and order and he has given us the perception that the commies have diminished their influence in central Europe, and that the possibility of a Spanish civil war reoccurring, destroying the aristocracy and the -- the bourgeoisie -- our bourgeoisie in central Europe has been -- has been put to -- brought to a halt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: And did you want Germany to come into Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: I was never a German watcher, my -- my dream was always to go to Budapest and play the first fiddle somewhere along the line in Hungarian foreign policy, which would have been a very difficult thing to do because the Hungarians hate the Romanians.</span> <span id="s1447">The Hungarians hate the thought -- my God, the Hungarians hate the Gypsies, and many Hungarians hated the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: So being a Hungarian diplomat, it may -- may not have been a wise choice at all, on hindsight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: But that thought is what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: But that’s what you were thinking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: -- was my ability to get away from the peasant way of life and don’t forget I had two uncles in Budapest and they had very important government posts, so I’d be like in good hands in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: And my father always said [speaks foreign language here] You have got to become a somebody, you’ve got to become a somebody because you are number one, right, after the war and I said -- well I’ve already mentioned that to you, see.</span> <span id="s1456">And before the war, to become a number one [indecipherable] you had to go to Budapest, which was the capital city closest to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1457">And then it was hort -- Horthy was, for me, until 1944, when the [indecipherable] replaced him, a person that I could trust because he had [indecipherable] of Béla Kun, he had provided Hungary with enough economic benefits for association with the Germans and the re-association with the Austrians.</span> <span id="s1458">And he also kept the riffraff, Romanian riffraff and things like that kind of at bay.</span> <span id="s1459">So I could live with the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1461">But when -- when the Germans attack Russia in 1941, before you get into the Waffen SS --</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: Before that Yugoslavia comes in, don’t forget please, April 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: That changed everything.</span> <span id="s1465">The real -- that -- the German attack on northern Yugoslavia and the marching through Romania demonstrated to me that the German power was overwhelming and it couldn’t care less about the individualism and the natural character of the smaller nation.</span> <span id="s1466">They would just march in, right, occupy them and brutalize them.</span> <span id="s1467">And with the first hanging of these dozens and dozens of Serbs, and letting them be hanging there on the market for days and days and days, demonstrate to me that there was something about the Germans that you had to be frightened of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: So you become frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: But the only way -- I became in that sense anti-Nazi -- anti-German German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: But that was no different because most Austrians throughout the history were anti-German, right?</span> <span id="s1472">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: But that wasn’t true now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: -- the feeling that f -- the feeling strengthened to me.</span> <span id="s1475">So I was looking at Budapest even more, saying that the Serbs had been defeated, they have become impotent, where else can I go?</span> <span id="s1476">I’d -- I was just about to finish my high school education so I was hanging onto the dream of going to Budapest and shedding this Barcika and Barnard be -- and being in the core country of marginalization.</span> <span id="s1477">I would have been happy with that.</span> <span id="s1478">My education was getting to it, and the influence of Anna Fayish, was a lady the second [indecipherable] that raised me, right, was strictly a -- Baylor, you go to Budapest, you’ll be okay.</span> <span id="s1479">And I thought going to Budapest I’d be able to kind of hide from all these things.</span> <span id="s1480">And the first thing you know they drafted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Well, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1482">How -- how do you accommodate for both thinking that when the Nazis come in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: -- they do things to individuals --</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: -- that your -- you’re no longer safe as an individual any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Not any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: And -- and the world in which you want to live by then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: You see, but don’t -- don’t forget, at that time being an individual still meant something in -- in -- in -- in soci -- societal layers in which you could claim to have some residual rights, if you were V.I.P., cooperating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1490">You were guaranteed as long as you cooperated.</span> <span id="s1491">If you were somebody highly critical of the Germans, or [indecipherable] to the Serbs, they pick you up and shoot you.</span> <span id="s1492">So -- and there was no in between.</span> <span id="s1493">You were either there or here.</span> <span id="s1494">To be in the middle and have no opinion at all would be perhaps true of the peasants who were working.</span> <span id="s1495">If you were in the bourgeoisie, one way or the other you were visible, right?</span> <span id="s1496">You were out in the open and you necessarily were expected to wield an opinion.</span> <span id="s1497">Now, the opinion couldn’t be like -- I have -- I have not seen i-in the Barnard where I was living then, any Hungarian leader marching in the street and telling the Germans it is wrong for you to hang all the Serbs.</span> <span id="s1498">They were keeping their mouth shut.</span> <span id="s1499">I have never seen a Protestant or a Catholic preacher, priest or bishop, and there were several bishops in a large area, going out and telling German [indecipherable] German, you mustn’t do that, it’s inhuman.</span> <span id="s1500">So they were hold their mouth shut as far as possible if they had no dependents and linkages with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: But the ones in industry, the ones who were delivering wheat, the ones who were delivering the wines to the Germans, they necessarily were okay under economic advantage.</span> <span id="s1503">And you know, in circumstances like that, unless you have economic survival, you have no survival.</span> <span id="s1504">Now, this is a horrendous statement to make.</span> <span id="s1505">If the economic survival depends on your -- is the outcome of your unwillingness to pinpoint the evil, and come out and say it is wrong.</span> <span id="s1506">Cause if you had done that, they shoot you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: So there was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: So it was absolute power.</span> <span id="s1509">I was faced for the first time in my life with this.</span> <span id="s1510">I didn’t know the concept.</span> <span id="s1511">I know now the concept of what is absolute power.</span> <span id="s1512">I’m not saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely.</span> <span id="s1513">It’s one of the aberrations.</span> <span id="s1514">But, I was faced with absolute power, and seeling -- seeing all those dead ones, the disappearance of the Jewish people, the quiet and furtive disappearance was a -- o-of lesser significance.</span> <span id="s1515">Not because they were Jewish people, but because it was invisible, if right in front of your nose, what horrendous thing the Germans could do.</span> <span id="s1516">At the same time they were all marching.</span> <span id="s1517">I remember the black uniforms in -- in Montbachkirche, the t -- main town hall was a great old traditional building, Austrian style.</span> <span id="s1518">Beautiful all kind of statues and beautiful columns and that -- and they were -- the main gate was about 10 feet wide and there was a German black uniform left and right, beautiful blonde, and a -- they were handing -- selling [indecipherable] white -- white whatever you call it, a piece of the leather strips of that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: [indecipherable] wait th -- one -- one second, one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: Absolute power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: What -- can you hold?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1523">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: They looked as an example of absolute power in practice.</span> <span id="s1526">You were terrified just looking at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: And then some b -- would be partisan Serbs killed one of them.</span> <span id="s1529">In return Germans rounded up 200 and hanged them on the following day.</span> <span id="s1530">Just picking them up in the street of Montbachkirche.</span> <span id="s1531">Hang them up on the main square.</span> <span id="s1532">And then you’re a 17 year old kid, or a 16 year old kid, you say well, what is happening?</span> <span id="s1533">I know there was one moment in which my brother and I, with all this mixing of things, we put on -- we -- I was able to obtain a little French flag, and I put the French flag on my lapel because I wasn’t a German, I wasn’t really a Hungarian in Hungary, I was a Hungarian living in the Barnard at that time.</span> <span id="s1534">I certainly wasn’t a Serb, I don’t want to look as a Romanian, which I possibly do.</span> <span id="s1535">I wanted to say I’m special, I’m French.</span> <span id="s1536">Trouble is, the French had already been defeated, so it didn’t really mean much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: But it was my brother’s and I kind of demonstration of something that we’re, hey, we’re a bit different, right?</span> <span id="s1539">We are neither this, nor this, nor that.</span> <span id="s1540">And certainly not German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: And what did your brother think of all this that was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Oh, he was so happy in the store, the -- because in terms of purchasing power, the -- I remember the [indecipherable] store had greater and greater difficulties getting oranges, and getting all the select merchandise because once th-the Germans came in, all these so-called necessities for the bourgeoisie were disappearing, and ration cards were -- ensued, right?</span> <span id="s1543">So my brother’s concern was how do I help keep a store afloat that has become the meaning in my life?</span> <span id="s1544">And how do I get oranges to my lady friend -- lady friend in the old traditional sense, right?</span> <span id="s1545">Maybe touching, maybe [indecipherable] but nothing more than that [indecipherable] the girl that I love, where oranges cannot be any more obtained because of the German embargo on everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: You see?</span> <span id="s1548">So it was looking -- it was looking very miserable, and I told you I had seen him cry quite a few times after she disappeared --</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Would you -- would you have called yourself apolitical at that time, in a way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: I was -- well, if apolitical by definition means you have no interest in politics, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: I was surrounded too much by the first indications of absolute terror, not to take time out and think about the consequences.</span> <span id="s1553">But having nowhere to turn, having nowhere to go, in that desperate situation I was looking more and more at Budapest as my safe haven, sort of imagining that Hitler would never do it to Horthy.</span> <span id="s1554">And two years later he did.</span> <span id="s1555">And I remember that the Germans established a local police by the name of some kind of a national guard populated or -- or peopled by Volksdeutsche and the chief of that was a -- a lawyer trained in Dubocka, in the adjacent province, a Dr. Wright, who had gotten his PhD [indecipherable] in German, in Nazi Germany became -- came back down -- if you look at the typical Nazi, what do you see?</span> <span id="s1556">A huge chin, a small forehead, a big belly, strong legs, eyes bulging forward like that, and cruelty in the face.</span> <span id="s1557">He declared himself general of the police, right.</span> <span id="s1558">He came to our home in March or April 1942 and said, Colonel, if you try -- I’ve gone on record with that, even in German court -- Colonel, if you try to hide your brother -- your son -- your two sons, you will be declared magaroni.</span> <span id="s1559">Your sons, don’t try to get them over to Hungary, we’ll hide -- we’ll find them, we’ll put them up against the wall, we’ll shoot them.</span> <span id="s1560">And made my father shut up.</span> <span id="s1561">And our name got onto the list.</span> <span id="s1562">And I’m often -- I’ve often wondered, I still wonder, if I had been the father, being told that by a brutal looking Volksdeutsche nobody whose son is a general of the police, what would I have done?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: So what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: He did nothing.</span> <span id="s1565">He lived through seeing our names put on, then he talked to us, he said, you know, the time has come to let you know that communism has become a threat.</span> <span id="s1566">Look at all these partisans killing all these Germans.</span> <span id="s1567">You have an obligation going back to the empire, to keep the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1568">And that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: So that meant you had to join --</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: He gave up on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1572">So that, were you then conscripted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: He gave up on us, yeah.</span> <span id="s1574">I [indecipherable] very often, and I’ve often wondered -- and my brother said, absolutely I will not go, and my father said look, if you don’t want the whole catastrophe of the whole family, because Wright was a -- oh Wright was, by the way, c-caught by the partisans early in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Who was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Irwin Wright, Dr. Wright.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: The con -- so-called -- self declaimed general [indecipherable] police [indecipherable] were caught and unceremoniously hanged for repeated brutality and -- and crimes against humankind.</span> <span id="s1579">He personally was involved in many tortures of presumed partisan leaders.</span> <span id="s1580">I remember those stories kind of, kind of.</span> <span id="s1581">He deserved what he was getting, but it was Wright who really caused [indecipherable] my brother’s eventual dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: You see.</span> <span id="s1584">And -- but again, I -- I’m -- I -- I’m -- I’m against people ca -- getting some criminal types and hanging them on the tree, but I think the partisans were absolutely right to hang him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: I’ll go on official record, I told the German judges that.</span> <span id="s1587">See, he was -- he was -- he was -- he was -- he was a criminal, not just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: So why did -- why did this guy -- oh, there he is.</span> <span id="s1589">Okay.</span> <span id="s1590">[tape break] I’ll check it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1593">All right, we’re ready.</span> <span id="s1594">You [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: So, just to let you know that even though I’ve always suffered with this -- this notion that since I don’t have a PhD in philosophy, I’ll never be first class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: But at least I’m linked to somebody who is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Okay, we go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: Tell me, why did this guy Wright go to your father to say that he better -- that you two -- that you two boys would be put on the list.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Because my father was a visible member of the community, equally at home in the Hungarians speaking and the German speaking, having a mother who was Austrian German and therefore, by the Hitlerian laws had given offspring to a half German, who had given offspring to quarter Germans, because Austria had been absorbed into Germany, had become Germanized, and in terms of the racial profile you had to go back seven generations to prove that you were Aryan, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: We were qualified, classified as half Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: But it sounds fe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: Wait, wait, wait --</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Yes, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: -- as half Germans.</span> <span id="s1608">And since they needed everybody to get the 27,000 Volksdeutsche recruit --</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: -- to fill in the numbers of our division, they had to reach out for persons well beyond the pure Germanism of the really simple Volksdeutsche, who were a hundred percent Germanic, right?</span> <span id="s1611">And since my father was a visible member of the community, going to him, to gave an example -- he [indecipherable] Wright was g -- was given example to others --</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: -- who were like of mixed blood, to make sure.</span> <span id="s1614">And depending on how my father would behave, they would then also fall into step.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: So my father, as I already mentioned to you, proved that [indecipherable] morally, he said you’re obliged to, because Austria-Hungary was always there to defend western civilization from the [indecipherable] from Asia, right, so the war ca -- secondly the church approves of tha-that, the church demands that, God demands that, and thirdly I’ll tell you, there is no choice, period.</span> <span id="s1617">And there was no way out.</span> <span id="s1618">There was nowhere to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1620">So do you receive a notice to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: Ah yes, yes, it was a notice, yeah.</span> <span id="s1622">After Wright came I think the notice came about a week after, saying that the notice was a formal notice of induction and the notice of you shall present yourself -- my brother was, I think, on the first of May and I was on the first of June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: And were you in the same division?</span> <span id="s1624">The Prince Eugen division?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Were you in the same division?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Yeah, in the same division, yeah.</span> <span id="s1628">It was strictly that the whole Barnard was used for the setting up of the Prince Eugen division, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: And the Prince Eugen has very special significance in Austria’s history, because it was he who beat the chur -- the Turks, and expanded the Austrian bi -- b-boundaries to include the -- that whole area into Austria-Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Right -- right around the Danube river, beyond where the Romanian boundary is today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: So your -- your brother and yourself both get letters --</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: -- at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: Everybody, everybody --</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Everybody gets letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: -- everybody -- I think actually letters were sent out to those who had better schooling, because we, the graduates of -- even though I was in Hungarian school -- so it had no business in using me at all, because it was the induction of the Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s1639">The Volksdeutsche were all linked with the Volksdeutsche shul -- schools that were established after the Germans came in, and they were established with the Germans in using the -- the Nazi oriented leadership of the Volksdeutsche then, to set up German schools following the right German examples.</span> <span id="s1640">And those who were in that school when [indecipherable] German speaking.</span> <span id="s1641">I was in Hungarian school and they drafted me even though I was -- and my brother had already finished high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: But you were considered Volksdeutsche in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: Yeah, ah -- th-they were -- in their declaration they had to refer to me as Volksdeutsche as they would have had no right whatsoever to draft me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: So I am an honorary Volksdeutsche, declared so by the Hitler regime.</span> <span id="s1646">Big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: Spoke some German, but the German was not -- I can show you all my photos, all my photos the back wall -- on th-the back page they have Hungarian language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: But did you spea --</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: I knew German, but I was by now means -- I was very far from being -- and I didn't understand German German.</span> <span id="s1651">They are completely different [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: That’s why I was demoted [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: And where were -- where were you and your brother sent at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: My brother went first.</span> <span id="s1656">He was already in the -- he was -- he was forced to go to the artillery regiment.</span> <span id="s1657">I re -- I remember him, remembering visiting when he was in [indecipherable], he was about 80 kilometers above where I was and I remember seeing the -- the barracks where he was.</span> <span id="s1658">He was inside the barracks, holding on desperately to the steel partitions, looking like the guy, I’ve got to get away, I’ve got to get away.</span> <span id="s1659">And I was cry.</span> <span id="s1660">And I went with my father, my father said nothing, just stony face, but I saw in my brother’s eyes that he was so terribly unhappy.</span> <span id="s1661">He ran away three times, and he took phone calls from my dad every time and the third time they almost shot him, but then, upon repeated phone calls, they decided they would demote him from the signals into a punishment battalion.</span> <span id="s1662">And he stayed with that until he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: And what is -- what is a punishment battalion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: Punish battalion is a battalion which was set up specifically for those who don’t -- don’t perform military duty according to regulations.</span> <span id="s1665">Those who have been captured trying to escape, or known to have been wanting to escape, or those who have been escaped and then captured.</span> <span id="s1666">And it’s -- the survival rate was then maybe 10 percent.</span> <span id="s1667">And I remember my brother’s face, I remember my brother’s face, I think he came there when I was visiting also in the -- that was a kind of second -- around the 25th of December 1944, when I was being brought up with a couple of other officer candidates from these front lines in the Balkans through a little village on the Danube river, where he was stationed with his battalion.</span> <span id="s1668">And I had found out where he was and we saw ourselves maybe for a half an hour and we talked about what can we do, where can we go.</span> <span id="s1669">And he told me look, you’ll be behind the front, you better go because it’ll save your life.</span> <span id="s1670">And he said, as far as I’m concerned there’s nothing I can do because there’s nowhere that I can run to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: And I left him there, I -- feeling terribly guilty not -- not to have stayed longer, but we couldn’t stay together longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: Was he able --</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Not to stay longer, to -- to find a way out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: My main reason for going to officer school was it was safely behind the lines [indecipherable] and the chances of survival were 90 percent.</span> <span id="s1677">I -- I simply had to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: And you had a choice of what kind of regiment you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: Well, you can -- no, if they -- they say that you are picked to go, you have to go, but there are many reasons why they would go.</span> <span id="s1680">Some would fall in the river, say oh thank you very much, I want to die for Hitler, I want to be an officer for Hitler.</span> <span id="s1681">Others will just stand there, you know, say nothing.</span> <span id="s1682">Command is a [indecipherable] command, and their system was a command system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: I said -- I said nothing, I just said yes.</span> <span id="s1685">I was actually surprised because I wasn’t fitting in and I’d been demoted once for not understanding the German well enough, and yet somehow they, I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: So how do you get demoted fr --</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: -- oh, you know why they picked me?</span> <span id="s1688">I had -- I was one of the few remaining who had high school graduation, and by the law of induction into officer training, you were still expect to have had at least high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: And I had happened to have had high school, so they put me into, and there were seven or eight of us picked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: You --</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Seven or eight out of 42 graduates, all of whom had perished.</span> <span id="s1693">All the others had already died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: What was training like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: Training?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1697">Was there any?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: I mentioned to you my love of sports.</span> <span id="s1699">And I found myself in a nation, in UNRRA [indecipherable] bossed around by those eight foot tall Germans with shoulders like that, waistlines like that, legs like that, being able to run a hundred yards in five seconds or at least so they claim.</span> <span id="s1700">And I said to myself -- oh, by the way, by that time I’d already been called Gypsy, Balkanaiser, pork eater, bacon eater, you name it [indecipherable] just because of my looks.</span> <span id="s1701">There’s something -- and they told me you’ve got to be able to prove something, that you’re equal and competitive, at least in something.</span> <span id="s1702">So I took them on with their marching 10 kilometers in 40 minutes, with fully -- things loaded, I never lagged behind.</span> <span id="s1703">In no time -- I’m very [indecipherable] my hands [indecipherable] I was -- in no time I was very, very good at the Morse code.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Oh, well, I was in signals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: Wireless.</span> <span id="s1708">You see, there were signals wire, telephone, civil Morse code.</span> <span id="s1709">Oh, I outdid the Volk Germans.</span> <span id="s1710">There was one Volk German guy by the name of -- what was the name?</span> <span id="s1711">I should know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1712">Anyway, one, the real Volksdeutsche, who terribly wants to be like a Reichsdeutsche.</span> <span id="s1713">His hair was [indecipherable] like that, he was reddish blonde, blue eyes, big nose sticking out, big shoulders, and [indecipherable] Nicholas his name was.</span> <span id="s1714">And he always said, Lally, you’re a magaroni, you just can’t do -- you just can’t to it.</span> <span id="s1715">And I looked and I said, you know Nicholas, I proved to you that as a magaroni I can do it.</span> <span id="s1716">So ou -- I beat him every time in our speedwriting, in the -- in the signals.</span> <span id="s1717">That was fun.</span> <span id="s1718">And I beat him every time in long marches, and I beat him every place else.</span> <span id="s1719">Here was my personal challenge to prove to me that even though in their eyes I was only a Gypsy kind of a looking guy, deep inside myself I was a man, I was a human being, you know?</span> <span id="s1720">And they were all smoking [indecipherable] and they were all womanizing.</span> <span id="s1721">Our jackets, the military jackets had a small pocket on the inside, inside of the left.</span> <span id="s1722">Condoms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: I have no idea where they bought the condom, but -- so the -- the commanding sergeant comes and says, this weekend you will be allowed to go out.</span> <span id="s1725">There are two of them in there, make sure that you use them because I’ll -- I’ll check on you if you did or not because for the fuehrer you’ve got to procreate children.</span> <span id="s1726">No questions about who the girl will be, no question if they would be willing or not, no question married or not, you’ve got to do it.</span> <span id="s1727">And I had a -- gained a good friend, Walter Meyhallowicz, whose grandfather had been Serb, but who had been Germanized because of two German mothers marrying into the clan.</span> <span id="s1728">He was a tall guy, black, black, black, like a Gypsy looking.</span> <span id="s1729">So we kind of stuck together because we were -- both looked [indecipherable] right?</span> <span id="s1730">So I looked at -- Walter said, what are we going to do with that, he says.</span> <span id="s1731">He was two years older, I don’t know if he had experience or not.</span> <span id="s1732">So he said, we’ll find us a new -- End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: So the sports kept me -- helped me keep myself in good shape, and I was also somehow, even though I’d been raised very pr -- in a very protective environment -- we had a maid, we had a junior maid, we had the [indecipherable], the Jack of all trades man.</span> <span id="s1735">We were not allowed to do physical labor.</span> <span id="s1736">I was never allowed to go to the kitchen because [indecipherable] all that stuff, right?</span> <span id="s1737">I didn’t know -- I didn’t learn how to fend for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: No, I hadn’t.</span> <span id="s1740">But then, in the army your rations aren’t really adequate if you want to keep your body in good shape.</span> <span id="s1741">So somewhere along the line observing others, and there was an older Volksdeutsche, a ba -- farmer, who really knew how to find potatoes and things like that, so I was learning very, very quickly.</span> <span id="s1742">And on the front I always knew how to have a few extra morsels of bread in my pocket, like to chew at.</span> <span id="s1743">And I always knew how to have extra newspapers to wrap around my feet, because the German boots were totally pervious to cold [indecipherable] you had frozen feet in no time.</span> <span id="s1744">But we discovered if you wrap them in paper on top at -- on top of the sock, your chances were 90 percent better of not getting your toes freeze -- fro-frozen off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: And with that you somehow learned how to handle life, even in the most difficult circumstances.</span> <span id="s1747">And again, not smoking was a very great contributor to being able to develop some kind of resistance against the terrible cold in Yugoslavia, and then also on the southeastern front; 40 below zero in that, you know?</span> <span id="s1748">And it -- I had this extra energy also because of the [indecipherable] rations.</span> <span id="s1749">To go through the darkest times and always kind of wanting to show that even though you guys think I’m an untermen -- in my eyes I’m not an untermenschen.</span> <span id="s1750">I didn't want to prove that I was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1751">I would never want to be a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1752">I didn’t look like one, right?</span> <span id="s1753">Or behave like one.</span> <span id="s1754">But I wanted to prove I’m a human being, I shouldn’t be looked down at.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: And a very as -- na -- strong motivating factor was that we were compelled to read the “Mein Kampf”.</span> <span id="s1757">We were compelled to read the what, the f -- the mi -- m-me -- me -- mama -- “The Mythos of the 20th Century,” by Rosenberg, right?</span> <span id="s1758">And we were compelled to enjoy indoctrination every day, all with the same thing, heil Hitler this, heil Hitler that.</span> <span id="s1759">But they will never have an opportunity to do anything with the brains that we still had for purposes of learning.</span> <span id="s1760">And somewhere in my mind there was -- an increasing part of my brain had became completely aloof against their attempts to take my mind over completely and make me completely embrace their serial ideology.</span> <span id="s1761">And one of the clinching moments came when the officer investigating my racial purity told me who I would have to get married to.</span> <span id="s1762">Cause it may not be important to you, it may not be important overall within the context of the Holocaust, but somewhere in my mind there was enough of a defensive mechanism in which the I wanted to be me, and in which there was still enough scope left for the brain to fill in the void and to undo the damage caused to the other part, whichever it was, the left or the right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: And the killing in the panzergraben was a second major determining for that.</span> <span id="s1765">You see, I still ask myself how come I knew, after witnessing all that killing, after losing most of my friends in the war, after witnessing some of the atrocities, including some -- a couple of Germans had their genital parts cut off by partisan female.</span> <span id="s1766">Another partisan female had a big stick stuck into her [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1767">After witnessing all that and becoming completely immune to any perception of morality, how come I knew when Viel was doing the killing, that it was wrong?</span> <span id="s1768">But I knew it was wrong, but I was so terribly scared at the same time.</span> <span id="s1769">I knew it was wrong.</span> <span id="s1770">I was scared.</span> <span id="s1771">So I was just petrified.</span> <span id="s1772">What do you do with that?</span> <span id="s1773">So, just like my dad when Dr. Wright came, I decided nothing -- I decided I do nothing, because I wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s1774">And I talked to Rabbi Poupko about that, a very senior conservative rabbi in Montreal.</span> <span id="s1775">I asked him, what would you have done, Rabbi?</span> <span id="s1776">He l-liked my testimony, he liked my -- he said, Adal -- al -- Lallier, you really have courage.</span> <span id="s1777">I said, it’s not courage, it is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1778">Well, I say it’s courage.</span> <span id="s1779">I say, what would you have done?</span> <span id="s1780">He said, in the eyes of the Jewish interpretation of God, one’s own life always comes first.</span> <span id="s1781">Now, I don’t know if he told me that, if it’s true or not, or if he told me that to appease me, to decrease my pain or my agony, but he told me, you were absolutely right trying to si -- preserve your life, assuming that would have become a creative life.</span> <span id="s1782">You didn’t want to waste that.</span> <span id="s1783">And he said, the fact alone that you finally decided to speak up proves that you were right in keeping your mouth shut, because if you hadn’t, they would you put a -- put you up on the spot and shot you.</span> <span id="s1784">So, good excuse, but I still did nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: Why didn’t my father try to get us away?</span> <span id="s1787">Maybe because he wouldn’t have had -- oh who -- who -- wh-who -- I don’t know, there were no airplane, there were no flights out.</span> <span id="s1788">Would have to be -- I don’t know, there were no boats on which to go, we were in the central Europe.</span> <span id="s1789">So how do you get away over three or four, 500 kilometers of -- of territory that belonged to the Hitler Germans?</span> <span id="s1790">How do you do it?</span> <span id="s1791">I-I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Well, let’s go back and tal -- and tell me a little bit more about what the -- the training, the ideoli -- ideological training was like.</span> <span id="s1793">You were all forced to read “Mein Kampf.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: We were all -- we were given lectures, ideological lectures.</span> <span id="s1795">Weltanschauung, you can write that down, but the term is well known.</span> <span id="s1796">Weltanschauung.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: You know that from philosophy, right.</span> <span id="s1799">Weltanschauung was an obligatory course throughout the four and a half months training of Pinuna.</span> <span id="s1800">And the weltanschauung is really teaching us how to take the oath of fealty to Hitler, not question anything about that and -- and to exercise com-complete commitment to the oath, even willingness to die for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: And what was the oath?</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: And that was -- we had the physical training -- I -- I liked the physical training.</span> <span id="s1803">But what I liked about the physical training is to find out that I too, coming from the nowhere, could do it almost as well, even better than some of the German Germans did.</span> <span id="s1804">And that’s where the Olympian image rose in my mind, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: But were you feeling conflicted being in -- in what is a Nazi group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: No, no, I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: I mean the Waffen SS is a Nazi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: -- I was -- no, no, they were Walter Meyhollowicz was a may -- racially mixed.</span> <span id="s1809">He never became a Lowd Nicholas.</span> <span id="s1810">Lowd Nicholas couldn’t become a Nazi fast enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: I -- well, yeah, well I don’t -- I don’t mean that everybo -- every person like you was a Nazi, but it’s a Nazi division.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s1814">Did that feel very conflicting to you to be in something like that?</span> <span id="s1815">I mean, were you yourself torn --</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: You mean -- no, I -- that -- no, th-the -- already -- I’ve come a -- already on record saying that when they finally -- and I’m kind of jumping now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: -- eventually the oath of fealty was taken for the division as a whole --</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: -- and for the signals [indecipherable] battalion as a whole.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: And I have reasons to believe that I was the only one who said quietly, so that no one would hear me, instead of I swear the honor of Hitler, I sweared the Miklós Hort-Horthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: So I -- I pled my f-f -- oath of allegiance to a guy that I believed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: But not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: See, in that sense I was an exception.</span> <span id="s1827">And alone saying Horthy, I was not professing myself on behalf of Nazism, but Horthy-ism.</span> <span id="s1828">But Horthy-ism too, on hindsight, was a semi-feudal Fascistic state -- state of mind, with an absolute dictator on the top.</span> <span id="s1829">But it was not based on racial impurities or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: -- racial discrimination and that.</span> <span id="s1832">It was just Hungarianism, but I was very -- I was feeling happy with that, but I was also feeling happy that nobody had overheard me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1834">But you also had to read Rosenberg, who was clearly a racist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: Oh, on Rosenberg we were not read, but we were read excerpts to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: -- during the weltanschauung.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: So did you then learn what the racial feeling of Nazism was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: Well, we were -- we were being told.</span> <span id="s1840">Learning means you are taught how to think for yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: No, no, not necessarily.</span> <span id="s1842">I mean, sometimes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: Oh well, my interpretation --</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: -- it can be bad learning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: I brought you a printout of my appointment as a full professor --</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: -- in which I speak about the teacher and learning.</span> <span id="s1848">Anyway, to use that term in quotation marks then, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: Well, they’re trying -- they were t-telling us --</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: What --</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: -- how to see things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: And the only way to see things properly was the way they were telling us.</span> <span id="s1855">I remember a philosophy professor [indecipherable] some years ago, appearing and saying Lallier, when I go to my classroom I tell them, I am the one who knows it all, on th -- only to listen to me.</span> <span id="s1856">I’ll examine you on those questions and you’ll know it all.</span> <span id="s1857">So I’m the one that you have to repeat in order to pass.</span> <span id="s1858">Same thing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: But this guy was in a democrat -- by the way, he happens to be an American who didn’t want to go to Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: Did most of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Anyways, he ra -- he raised that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: -- did the most of the guys with you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: Did most of the guys with you in the regiment -- in the division rather, believe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Well, I-I have to be specific on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: -- what they were t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: First of all, not all graduates of the ha -- German high school were of intellectual or bourgeois stock.</span> <span id="s1869">About 80 percent of them were a peasant stock.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: So they knew th -- knew the stuff they had to learn to earn their diploma, but they were not really literate persons who could think for themselves.</span> <span id="s1872">And I say that -- most of those of the peasant stock fell completely, wholesale for what the Nazis were feeding them.</span> <span id="s1873">And Lowd was one par -- very particular example.</span> <span id="s1874">You see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: Was there a Waffen SS song?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: Be -- sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: By the way, was there a Waffen SS song that was sung?</span> <span id="s1878">Something like if others prove I’m tr --</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: The Waffen SS by that time had become a propaganda tool by which they were hoping to entice the physically more capable and mentally more alert to volunteer for service on behalf of -- and I’m being very formal in that -- on behalf of defending western civilization against godless commu -- see, I still have it in my blood.</span> <span id="s1880">At the same time, since the really noble ones fit in that perfect image were being killed in Russia left, right and center, they badly needed replacements, so in no time, by mid-1940 th-the standards were being reduced.</span> <span id="s1881">No more [indecipherable] 76.</span> <span id="s1882">No more shoulders like that, waistlines 32, feet like that and [indecipherable] like that and blonde and all that.</span> <span id="s1883">They were taking left, right and center.</span> <span id="s1884">And more and more of the small Mediterranean, Gypsy looking types were got -- gotten in.</span> <span id="s1885">More and more compromising admissions by people of half blood, that first of all, you had to have half blood, then you had to have quarter blood, the-then you said, unless there was a Jewish grandmother you’ll be taken whatever your blood com -- blood combination is.</span> <span id="s1886">But one restriction remained.</span> <span id="s1887">You shouldn’t have had a Jewish grandmother.</span> <span id="s1888">And even that restriction was eventually raised, right?</span> <span id="s1889">O-Or erased.</span> <span id="s1890">But I remember you had to go back seven generations to prove it -- prove that you’re pure Aryan.</span> <span id="s1891">But all that -- most of that had fallen by wayside mid-1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: And the existence of the Waffen SS [indecipherable] commissione [indecipherable] was only [indecipherable], which even today’s Waffen SS veterans’ paper keeps on emphasizing.</span> <span id="s1894">They have a publication, every month calling -- calling it “The Volunteer.”</span> <span id="s1895">And they still believe that fact is a -- a hundred percent of those who have been in the Waffen SS were volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: Were volunteers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: 20 percent were perhaps volunteers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: So you still get their newsletter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: So I was feeling -- I -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: Yeah -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: But I have an American friend who interestingly is somehow enamored with -- a very highly positioned federal -- federal employee in the western part of the United States, very highly positioned, who had written a history on the milder, non-criminal parts of the Waffen SS, namely the -- the signals formations, and til -- for what I recall, the signal formations never even ever raised a weapon against anybody, because my job -- our job was to be there and play with this thing.</span> <span id="s1902">There may have been shooting at [indecipherable] once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1903">Anyway, he wrote a book about the Waffen SS signals [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1904">And it is from that -- and he asked me to read through that, I met him through somebody else.</span> <span id="s1905">And out of that I retrieved [indecipherable] information, the list of those who had been in the concentration camps, and I didn’t tell him that, it’s none of his business.</span> <span id="s1906">I mean, I’m free to do with that, unless I want to republish the whole thing, in which case I’d have to mention his name, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: So did they ti --</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: -- he is an American, he’s -- I find him a bit strange.</span> <span id="s1911">He is not a Nazi, but he believes a -- he fall -- fell for that slogan that the Waffen SS [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1912">I’ve been writing innumerous proof to the contrary, but he is an [indecipherable] and -- but he had made a significant contribution exploring a subject, and being able to distinguish the evil ones from the not so committed ones to the ones who were there against their will, but who somehow seemed to have survived the war, even though serving against their will or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: Did they teach you to s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: But he hasn’t written me since my last letter in which I -- I told him, absolutely told him, you finally have to get away from the lie that the Volksdeutsche were volunteers.</span> <span id="s1915">He would normally write me four times -- once every four weeks, but I haven’t heard of him for the past eight weeks, so maybe he found that my attitude was becoming too pushy [indecipherable] speaking the truth.</span> <span id="s1916">But he’s an o -- he’s an okay guy.</span> <span id="s1917">He’s an okay American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Did they -- did they teach you to shoot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: And he told me he’s going to vote for -- for Obama, so I don’t know if that makes him more okay or not.</span> <span id="s1920">Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: Did they teach you to shoot?</span> <span id="s1922">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1923">We also -- we had the signals training, we had the ideological training, we had the physical training, which I absolutely was very happy with, and we have the skills training.</span> <span id="s1924">The -- all the weapons you can possibly imagine in -- from the pistols, for would be officers eventually, it’s essential training.</span> <span id="s1925">You had the carbine, which carbine question came up during the court, because I insisted it was the [indecipherable] carbine and some of the Nazi Germans counter-insisted that the Waffen SS had never had [indecipherable] carbine, but the judge graciously -- Winkler, took my explanation, having discovered through some not Nazi experts that they were Czech carbines, which we may have been using then, or he may have been able to use.</span> <span id="s1926">And we had the Mitryettes, and we had especially the Sturmgewehr.</span> <span id="s1927">Sturmgewehr was a 1944 production, very similar to the Soviet AK 457 which could spit out, I think 57 bullets, smaller bullets, in about three seconds, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1928">And then we had also shooting with -- with -- what you call those little pipes?</span> <span id="s1929">Mortars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: And we had grenade shooting and we had special training ones, they became quite frequently distributed, the anti-tank weapons.</span> <span id="s1932">The Panzerakate and they call it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: But you were not -- you were not then put into a regiment to shoot, you were -- you were -- you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: No, no, no, I was not in an infantry regiment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: I was strictly tied to the headquarters of the division communicate -- in communications.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: And where was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: Only two times was I engaged in active two week warfare --</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: And where was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: -- against the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: Against the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: That was -- yeah, again, that was in October 1944, in which we hadn’t really learned -- we had followed the partisans, we had not -- not been engaged at the headquarters level in facing any [indecipherable] formations with T -- T34 tanks and the whole bit the Soviets were throwing at us, and in three days of fighting we lost 90 percent of everything.</span> <span id="s1943">We lost 90 percent of our trucks.</span> <span id="s1944">My truck was the only one to have survived the -- the massacre [indecipherable] because I was skillful enough -- I was the driver -- I was skillful enough to hide it behind a church, and I was lucky enough to have escaped being directly shot at by -- I was -- had to cross a bridge, and that -- right to bridge there were dozens of German vehicles destroyed by anti-tank fire, and I was next in line to be shot at.</span> <span id="s1945">And I had my five guys including my [indecipherable] in the truck, and I was driving like a madman, trying to hit the bridge, but before I made a sharp turn, I decided to stop just for a brief moment, I don’t know what made me stop.</span> <span id="s1946">And at that moment I stopped the shot of the anti-tank weapon buzzed by the front of the windshield of the car.</span> <span id="s1947">And then I just so -- noticed that, they needed about 17 seconds for a second shot and I accelerated and got away.</span> <span id="s1948">I was the only funkwagen who was saved from the whole division.</span> <span id="s1949">The division had 37 of wireless communication trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: And they were all --</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: They all got perished and about 2500 guys died in three days, including a guy by the name of Lisi, who stuck his neck out in front of the truck, was hit in chest on with the grenade, he just disintegrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: He was one of the very gifted high school graduates and he was a bourgeois son, he was a very nice guy who was -- who was there I think for defending his motherland and his father’s properties from communism, and he was not a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1954">But Lowd Nicholas was a Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: And where -- after your tra -- how ma -- how many weeks were you in training?</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: We were trained until for the first of June -- actually, 15th of June, first of June I was drafted, 15th of June we were sent up to [indecipherable] and we were sent back down, totally contrary to our expectations because we thought we’d be engaging against the Soviets, they sent us down to Serbia to fight the partisans who had by that time become very numerous.</span> <span id="s1957">Because as you know, Hitler’s having invaded the Soviet Union, Tito immediately declared war on the Germans under horrendous, horrendous circumstances for the partisans because they were nobodies, they had nothing, and yet they survived somehow.</span> <span id="s1958">Tito is to me a -- a remarkable man, the way he took on the Nazis, but he also let his people suffer because it was because of the odd -- killing of some odd German soldier, the Germans were hanging hundreds and hundreds of innocent Serb civilians.</span> <span id="s1959">And Tito added to power, exterminated the whole Yugoslav -- the whole -- the entire Yugoslav bourgeoisie.</span> <span id="s1960">You see, Tito is a major was criminal, but without Tito the war couldn’t have been won the way it has won, so I’m kind of caught in between.</span> <span id="s1961">One of my big images about that he -- from the war is an image that I retrieved from a book written by one of Tito’s p-primary assistants [indecipherable] Angelis.</span> <span id="s1962">You may have heard of Milo Angelis.</span> <span id="s1963">He had a book on wartime memora -- memor -- memor -- memoirs in which on one particular cage -- page, there is a Serb young man about 18 years old, with a typical Serb cap, dressed like a poor peasant, standing under the gallows with that German officers surrounding him.</span> <span id="s1964">And just before he died, he raised his hand like that, and he died like that.</span> <span id="s1965">Now, if I ever wanted to have a photo over which I’d cry about the absolute courage in the face of actual power, that guy is my hero in my mind.</span> <span id="s1966">He was a total anti-Nazi, he who died because he believed that what Germans were doing was wrong.</span> <span id="s1967">Trouble is his death was caused by T-Tito’s partisan killing one or two Germans.</span> <span id="s1968">And this guy was rounded up in a small village chacha and hanged with many of the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: But you want to blame ti --</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: An unforgettable picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: -- you want to blame Tito and not the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: Do you want to blame Tito and not the Waffen SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: No, no, no, I am blaming the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: They had no right to capture the 200, right?</span> <span id="s1977">At the same time, amongst the 200, there was one who dared raised his fist and tell the Germans face to face before they hanged him, but they didn’t prove merciful.</span> <span id="s1978">They’re being told [indecipherable] that you’re dead wrong, you’re killers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: When --</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: I should send you that picture, perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1982">When -- when you were in the Waffen SS in yu -- in the former Yugoslavia --</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: -- in Serbia, did you know what Pri-Prince Eugen regiments were doing, the division was doing in Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: Oh, well, in the -- in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: I mean, what sort of reports --</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: -- we were the center of communication and our major task was to communicate between the various parts of the division, the various battalions and regiments about how to arrange the warfare against the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: But it was only --</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: So it was strictly, strictly for two and a half years, from September 1942 to October 1944, we were engaged strictly against the partisans, under murderous circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: We had no idea, because we are too far away in the center, no idea what atrocities were being committed by the various -- by the two regiments, or the two battalions, the various battalions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: So you didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: But we did drive through villages that had been completely destroyed, and we knew that that is the price that the Serbs were -- most of the partisans were Serbs, right -- the Serbs were payi -- paying for what they were trying to do to the Germans and those were the [indecipherable] that the German Nazis were imposing upon them, finding two or three partisan that -- even burn the whole village.</span> <span id="s1994">And that was a fact of life of war, but that’s the way I -- my interpretation was, that is what the war is about.</span> <span id="s1995">But deep inside myself I always knew that the Germans had no business being in the Balkans, because I had carried forward, for me, the recognition when the Germans occupied Austria, it was upsetting history upside-down.</span> <span id="s1996">The Germans had no business being in Austria, but the fact is, it was absolute power and I’d become part and parcel of the absolute power.</span> <span id="s1997">So in a certain sense I was directly underwriting the absolute power by communicating messages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">A: But since I didn’t see the destruction and dying in front of my eyes, this -- I kind of -- th-they remained kind of aloof of that.</span> <span id="s2000">So I was only a communicator and not an executor.</span> <span id="s2001">But all of that came forcefully, right in front of my eyes because of Viel and his killing in the panzergraben.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: So do you think in the -- some way you became numb during that period in Serbia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Yeah, one th -- one -- one becomes -- you see one death your -- you vom -- excuse me, you -- you vomit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: You see two de -- two dead, you vomit maybe a couple of times later.</span> <span id="s2006">You see 10 dead --</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: You stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: -- you have a look and say, well [indecipherable] this is my friend.</span> <span id="s2009">And if the friend is still alive, you quickly go there and hope that you can talk to him or soothe him, or talk to him or his mother or something like that to make him die in peace.</span> <span id="s2010">If you see a hundred dead, hanging, which I had before they drafted me --</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: -- you’d see, well, if these were my people, what would I do with them?</span> <span id="s2013">I’d take them off the hangers, I suppose and I’d give them a decent burial, that’s all that we can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: What happened to all those people in the church, burned to the stake, who felt that it was wrong?</span> <span id="s2016">They had no choice just to bury them quietly, didn’t they?</span> <span id="s2017">I’m not absolving Nazis of their guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: But the hanging, the burning, how far back does that go into history?</span> <span id="s2020">And why would an educated nation like the Germans, the highest proportion of PhDs of any of the nations of that time, follow a pattern of medieval savagery?</span> <span id="s2021">How does one explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: Because a PhD doesn’t protect you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: Yeah, well, well -- well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: -- clearly.</span> <span id="s2025">So you -- you were in the Waffen SS in the Prince Eugen re-regiment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: Yeah, I was in the Waffen SS --</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: Was that in ’42 to f --</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: -- but please don’t forget, the Waffen SS was the seventh division.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A: We still were given the Waffen SS blood group tattooed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: Oh, you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: But we were never given a Waffen SS number, because to be truly a Waffen SS officer, you have to have your number.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: No number, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: So if you would call that a gross act of discrimination, call it that.</span> <span id="s2035">I don’t view it like that, only [indecipherable] say it as a proof, they needed cannon fodder --</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: -- they got the cannon fodder by force, without giving them equal legal protection.</span> <span id="s2038">They had even promised German citizenship.</span> <span id="s2039">None of the surviving members of the Prince Eugen got the citizenship unless they qualified by living in Germany after the war for five years.</span> <span id="s2040">So did they treat the [indecipherable] as untermenschen?</span> <span id="s2041">I want to go on official record, they treated the -- Reichs Germans treated the Volksdeutsche definitely as untermenschen and repeatedly called them speck-fresser, bacon eaters and sigoina and balkinazer, including myself.</span> <span id="s2042">And it was so bad that the highest commander with -- of the Waffen SS, the SS [indecipherable] haupter eventually had to pass an order all the way down asking the officers to finally put a stop to these discriminating references to the Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s2043">And why that command?</span> <span id="s2044">Because they still had a hundred thousand Volksdeutsche that they haven’t drafted yet and that they didn’t want to lose.</span> <span id="s2045">The bodies, they were needed to fight th-the Soviets in the conditions of increasing despair.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Now, you were promoted twice, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: Well, I was promoted with everybody else, first to Sturmin and then to [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: I wasn’t promoted out of ranks.</span> <span id="s2050">Actually, my first promotion, so-called, was delayed because after they were sent down -- I was very good in signaling, in my Morse codes, so I was picked to be amongst the first group to be sent on to Serbia.</span> <span id="s2051">And I was standing -- like I was sent on two weeks before the second group was to follow, it was a stage, kind of transportation of troops, 20,000 plus men.</span> <span id="s2052">And I was up standing night guard over my teraf -- my -- my -- my Morse code machine, and suddenly a phone call came in by somebody with a guttural German and gave me a command that I didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s2053">And you can’t say, excuse me please, would you repeat that?</span> <span id="s2054">And I said, Jawohl, and I did nothing.</span> <span id="s2055">The following day the sergeant in charge called me and says, Lallier, as of immediately, you are demoted to become a muli-fuehrer.</span> <span id="s2056">A muli-fuehrer was a -- a mule attendant.</span> <span id="s2057">So, with my glorious knowl-knowledge of m -- the Morse codes, whatever they would be, it would have been useful, I found myself in a stall with about 300 muli -- mules and mule attendants, about 30 of them, none of them having finished even elementary school.</span> <span id="s2058">All of them having great hands, great backs, great understanding of their -- of their animals, but I must maybe worriedly say, because it sound like discrimination, not much of a developed brain power.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: We have to stop there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: You were a muli-fuehrer after SS man?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: So you were a muli-fuehrer for six weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: No, I was a SS man while being a muli-fuehrer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Oh, you were both at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: There was no promotion.</span> <span id="s2068">If you’re a muli-fuehrer you get no promotion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: Until November 1942.</span> <span id="s2071">And then they picked me up because they thought I may have some brains because they must have looked at my high school certificate graduate [indecipherable] so put me into training as a truck driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: As a truck driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2075">In 1942, when you were -- between ’42 and ’44 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: -- the end of ’44, you were f --</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: I was in the Balkans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: -- in the Balkans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: Did you hear anything about what was going on in the east?</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: No, there was no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: Did you -- did you know about killing centers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: -- no, we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">A: -- so busy fighting the Titoists who were becoming more and more numerous because of the German stupid policies of fighting the whole population.</span> <span id="s2087">We had the position like in Iraq.</span> <span id="s2088">In ord -- in -- in order to -- instead of making the population love you by being good to them and not hanging them, they did exactly the opposite, right?</span> <span id="s2089">It became slow work, and the German command always referred to the partisans as bandits.</span> <span id="s2090">Bandits who are f -- waging illegal warfare, totally contrary to international agreements, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: And disagreement about the bandits, international, goes back about 150 years, without the question ever being asked first, well what are the countries doing in those countries in which these bandits emerged in the first place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2094">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">A: I am very concerned about, you know, international diplomacy, because that thing about banditry in occupied countries is a direct consequence of the imperial party -- including [indecipherable] Austria-Hungary, having conspired to look at local uprises against foreign domination as an illegal act at the mercy of countries that occupied the country.</span> <span id="s2096">It’s not right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: Anyway, so we were there fighting the partisans, totally pursuing this Iraqi type of policy, I must say honestly in -- in Iraq and -- and in a -- and in a -- in -- in Vietnam formerly, and it was hopeless because the more you hang the more young people would say, we don’t want these bloody bastards and we were part and parcel of the bastards.</span> <span id="s2099">So eventually we had to keep on retreating, retreating and treating because the Germans were doing badly, justifiably so, and the Soviets finally, the U-Ukrainian front, about three million men broke through 150,000 German line, some of it being kept open by the Prince Eugen, two or 3,000 remaining men, so we were retreating like mad.</span> <span id="s2100">I still had my -- my communication truck.</span> <span id="s2101">I was taking care of the truck because if you have a truck you can get away much faster than running for your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: So slowly but steadily we moved towards Croatia, the then Croatia, today Croatia.</span> <span id="s2104">And once we reached the rina dri -- th-the river Drina, I got the call with the six other guys from the remnants of the graduates, the high school graduates that we’ll be commanded as of tomorrow to go through Vienna to Nuremberg to officers’ school.</span> <span id="s2105">Oh, I never got any medals, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: You were commanded to go to officers’ school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: And what was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: I was -- yeah, I was picked up, this was mid-December 1944, on the -- on taking back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: So the German are -- the Germans are losing but you’re now sent to officers’ school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: And why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: Don’t forget -- no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: What did -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: -- don’t forget, we were fighting the Soviets --</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: -- we were being heavily decimated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: There were only six or seven high school graduates left.</span> <span id="s2120">The German officers corps in the Waffen SS was heavily depleted --</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2122">So they wanted to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: -- by all those [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2124">So they needed any garbage.</span> <span id="s2125">And for the first time they declared themselves that even Volksdeutsche so-called, an honorary Volksdeutsche would be picked --</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: To what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: -- as possible candidate, but they were put in through the first phase very rigorously is to sort them out, if they would found -- be found unqualified to become German officers, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: So do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: And so I was one of the six or seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q: So you go to officers’ school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: Well, yeah, th-they call it cadet school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: Cadet school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Oh, the cadet school was supposed to have been in Nuremberg, so we took -- we took a train ride from Croatia through Zagreb to Vienna, from Vienna to Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s2136">We arrived in Nuremberg two days after 2,000 allied planes had bombed the whole city to the smithereens, killing 35,000 unsuspecting pro-Nazi Nurembergese, right?</span> <span id="s2137">And we stayed there for two days picking up -- they used phosphor bombs.</span> <span id="s2138">Would you want to know what a body looks like after it got burned up?</span> <span id="s2139">No, I wouldn’t -- I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s2140">Facial features remain exactly the same except they are charcoal black.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: And the bodies are [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2143">So we were picking them by the thousands and putting them into a pyre and burning eventually to the -- into ashes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: And after two days the clearance came.</span> <span id="s2146">Oh, they also dropped the bomb and a -- an air mine, which was a new invention.</span> <span id="s2147">An air mine can destroy by air pressure, a thousand people in an area of about 100 square feet, and they dropped an air mine onto the SS luncheon barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: There were about a thousand SS personnel and all of them died with their eyes blown out of their heads because of the air pressure, and we had to clean up that mess.</span> <span id="s2150">Anyway, the -- we weren’t in the area, that was two days before.</span> <span id="s2151">And then we were told we would go by lorry from Nuremberg directly into Chekia to go to Leitmeritz, because the officers’ school, including the first stage, namely the cadet qualification part would have been delodged from Nuremberg, which was totally destroyed, to Leitmeritz, which was safely in the background from all activities, even though the Soviets had broken through, they were still 200 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s2152">So Walter and I, he was in the group, he looked at me and I looked at him, says, gee, we’ll finally be safe.</span> <span id="s2153">We’ll finally survive.</span> <span id="s2154">And then, on the way over, about 12 kilometers outside of Leitmeritz on the -- still on the western side, the [indecipherable] from the west, suddenly we’re told, augen nach links.</span> <span id="s2155">Eyes to the left.</span> <span id="s2156">Varoon, why?</span> <span id="s2157">Juden -- I remember the off suf -- off sub officer --</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: They said Juden?</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: Yeah, just said Juden.</span> <span id="s2160">[speaks German here].</span> <span id="s2161">You are not allowed to look.</span> <span id="s2162">To retain our purity as Aryan officer candidates, I suppose, right?</span> <span id="s2163">You mustn’t look at the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">Q: Yes, but Waffen SS were also in concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: Well yes, but not the real Waffen SS.</span> <span id="s2166">The concentration camp guards, not Waffen SS, they were special guards, if you know the SS [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: But there were Waffen SS personnel --</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: -- amongst them who had been wounded, who had even volunteered, or who had been otherwise assigned in administrative posts.</span> <span id="s2171">If you go through the lists you will discover that, right, right?</span> <span id="s2172">Q: But you couldn’t let --</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: So I -- I beg your pardon ma’am, SS, concentration camp guards were members of the Allgemeine SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: The Waffen SS were supposedly, 99 percent of the time, 99 percent of their -- of their per -- presence as soldiers, preoccupied to fight in the east and the west.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: But you’re being ironic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: But about 600 of them over the course of the three, four years of the war did do service in the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Do you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: And we went directly to the officers’ school, and the first time it hits us, Juden, the question came up between Walter and I, what’s that?</span> <span id="s2180">And being young men who had survived three years of partisan warfare, we’d say [indecipherable] Juden?</span> <span id="s2181">Why aren’t we allowed to look?</span> <span id="s2182">And we arrived in Leitmeritz with that question, and eventually -- that was end of January 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: By mid-March we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: What did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: The concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: You knew that it was a camp, I get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">A: Because on the 18th of March, we arise in the morning at five o’clock and told, you are going to go on guard duty, eight to nine kilometers away.</span> <span id="s2189">You’ve got to line up immediately with weapons which we will distribute to you, because weapons were not generally distributed unless you were on the front lines, right, we’ll give the weapons to you, we will board the lorries and we’ll drive westward to pick up prisoners.</span> <span id="s2190">And after driving for about three-quarters of an hour we suddenly see a fortress-like building.</span> <span id="s2191">Manifesto, small fortress.</span> <span id="s2192">And all kinds of activities in front around six -- 6:30 in the morning on the 18th, right?</span> <span id="s2193">And Waffen -- and SS guards coming out and prisoners -- and prisoner of war coming out.</span> <span id="s2194">I think all of them, with the Jewish and -- you see, and then we said to ourself, what’s that?</span> <span id="s2195">And then Viel, who was our commanding officer, concentration camp Theresienstadt, our duty is to supervise 1500 to 2,000 inmates digging an anti-tank ditch, which the high command thought would have to be dug to hold back the Soviet tanks from a breakthrough.</span> <span id="s2196">Suddenly, two things realized upon us.</span> <span id="s2197">Number one, we had to supervise prisoners, which is not what officers are trained to do.</span> <span id="s2198">Officer training is to become officers to fight the commies.</span> <span id="s2199">Not being [indecipherable] you looked at those people they were ragged, they were kind of -- th-th-th--their -- their -- their -- to -- clothing was kind of all torn up, they were starving looking, they were t-totally inwarded looking.</span> <span id="s2200">They were kind -- barely able to walk.</span> <span id="s2201">And we were -- forgive me for saying that -- we were representatives of a mighty ideology, right, fighting the communists and that, we should be on the front.</span> <span id="s2202">And serious questions were raised, but you were given the command, so they were coming out, 1500 to 2,000 of them and we were si -- surrounded and marched with them where the commanding officer was -- told him to march.</span> <span id="s2203">Concentration camp, for the first time.</span> <span id="s2204">And only then did we know that there were actually two concentration camps, Theresienstadt, the model camp, which the Germans were showing off to the Red Cross volunteers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: But that’s only for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: And the smaller --</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: It’s -- it’s only a model for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: Well -- well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: -- get technical now.</span> <span id="s2211">All I remember is that I had read a book by a guy name of Adler, who was in Theresienstadt, who was able to survive that, who wrote a couple of chapters in the book, “Theresienstadt” --</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: -- a reference to the Red Cross commissioners being told and being displayed the Jewish people happy like a lark.</span> <span id="s2214">And -- but we didn’t know about that.</span> <span id="s2215">But what we did know is that there was the Theresienstadt with about 10 to 15 thousand persons and the kleine feste with two to 2,000 to 2,500.</span> <span id="s2216">And the kleine feste, one rumor had it, were destined to be exterminated, but they also contained non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2217">Some Soviet prisoner of war who had gotten -- got even some Britishers, I also understand even an Australian was locked up in the kleine feste.</span> <span id="s2218">Anyway, it was the killing grounds, and it is those people that we are to supervise.</span> <span id="s2219">So we did.</span> <span id="s2220">On the first day nothing untoward happened.</span> <span id="s2221">They had equipment, it is not true that they did it with their hands and -- and then [indecipherable] had the appropriate shovels and that, but we were spaced every 20 meters on both sides of the ditch, get -- becoming deeper and deeper.</span> <span id="s2222">But on the second day we were brought back and that’s at -- now, lunch at two o’clock, Viel suddenly started shooting, where I was standing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: Viel started shooting.</span> <span id="s2224">Did y --</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: Ah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2226">We were -- we had talked about the service [indecipherable] guard service, and very, very unhappy because some of the soldiers claimed they had gotten medals of heroism fighting the commies and that and suddenly they’re only prison guards.</span> <span id="s2227">It was not compatible which wa -- what we thought was the eth -- ethics of the international recognized ethical form of behavioral officers.</span> <span id="s2228">But we didn’t ask any questions.</span> <span id="s2229">The questions would be asked on the following day in the evening when, after having witnessed and/or heard the killing and pointed at Viel through the testimony of at least two of us, we decided getting back to Leitmeritz, to the high school for girls where we were stationed with the preliminary station of the officers’ school, when we decided to send a delegation to the commanding officer, and not demanding, asking for an explanation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: So in the training, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: -- th-the cadet stage of officer training, we had weapons training, specialized weapons, the new Sturmgewehr, which is the assault weapons, I’ve mentioned them to you.</span> <span id="s2236">And -- but we each had to learn how to.</span> <span id="s2237">We had training with bazookas because the Soviets had been breaking through, the tanks -- we didn’t have me -- Germans didn’t have enough tanks left.</span> <span id="s2238">And since they had broken through the Carpathians the bazookas were our last means of defense and the bazookas were the long, long pipes, as well as the Panzerfausts, we learned that.</span> <span id="s2239">And we were also being taught officers’ strategy in military tactics at the lowest possible level.</span> <span id="s2240">That is, we were being elevated to recognizing that being a soldier is not quite like being an officer.</span> <span id="s2241">An officer has to provide leadership.</span> <span id="s2242">We’ve given -- we were given ideological education, not any more Nazi ideology, but repeatedly they emphasized respect for international law, respect for warli -- war making practices, respect for war cri -- no, disrespect for war criminality.</span> <span id="s2243">We were told that an officer’s duty is to prevent war criminal act from happening, right, and an officer will eventually get married and become a noble representative of a new Germany, no more Nazi Germany, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: This is -- the is the -- this is the late training?</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: All that in the perio -- yeah, in the prem -- between January and end of March 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: ’45, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: And this they say.</span> <span id="s2248">And we also had, because we were being trained to become eventually, members of the officers’ school for signals officers, we were being given technical education.</span> <span id="s2249">We had to bypass some very serious technical questions concerning telecommunications, communications and radio wireless equipment, right?</span> <span id="s2250">And that’s where mathematics came in, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">A: So I was able to handle that, right?</span> <span id="s2253">Not because of Nazism, it was strictly a profession, right?</span> <span id="s2254">So -- and all that within the context of most of us having been happy not to be on the front any more, but having higher chances of survival, as was indicated by the dislodging of certain other officers’ school to safer and safer areas, right?</span> <span id="s2255">So we were all trying to hang on, I was trying to hang on, I didn’t want to fail and be sent back, which happened to several of us, right?</span> <span id="s2256">In the -- Walter Meyhollowicz failed.</span> <span id="s2257">He couldn’t handle it any more because I think he was so big he would have needed 300 orders of potatoes, he was starving.</span> <span id="s2258">So he failed the exam, was sent away to the front, the Soviets captured him.</span> <span id="s2259">He spent 10 years as a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union, and somehow managed surviving, can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s2260">Anyway, so -- and then suddenly we found ourselves on the second day witnessing a plain act of murder.</span> <span id="s2261">We got together -- sh-sh-sh -- in the evening, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: So it’s -- re -- re-explain that time.</span> <span id="s2263">You’re standing on the side of those --</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: I-I’ll -- I’ll come back --</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">A: -- to -- one minute, Joan, let me just finish this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: So, and Barouka Kuno, a fair minded soldier, he was not a Nazi, he was from the tri -- he was a Sudetendeutsche.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">A: He was one of the three who was sent to present his petition to the commanding officer of the school, and we’d get the answer two days later.</span> <span id="s2271">Now, I’ll stop here, I’ll go back.</span> <span id="s2272">Okay, so on the second day we went back, we were brought by white truck.</span> <span id="s2273">A number of prisoners, we didn’t count them, I estimate between 1500 to 2,000.</span> <span id="s2274">At the same time the ti -- the ditch was supposed to be two kilometers long.</span> <span id="s2275">Now, two kilometers long is 2,000 meters.</span> <span id="s2276">If you have 2,000 prisoners half starving, how can they possibly dig with just to shovel one meters worth of 20 meters across and up to two meters deep?</span> <span id="s2277">So something -- my numbers may not be correct, or maybe the Germans were thinking that these guys were ready to work their butts off, hoping to survive.</span> <span id="s2278">Anyway, so we were again posted every 20 meters.</span> <span id="s2279">I was on the right hand side, another guy was on the left hand side [indecipherable] both sides, and we had the weapons in our hands, and just watching them.</span> <span id="s2280">Now, I was very close to a group of seven, and one of the seven -- like, they were a bit separate from the others, and the ditch was maybe about a meter deep, something like that, but unequally so.</span> <span id="s2281">And the officer group was standing a bit higher up, about 20 meters away, with Viel among them, including the commanding officer of the school, and they were kind of chatting and looking and chatting and I was standing.</span> <span id="s2282">I had to look this way, not that way, because once you’re told where to guard your post you couldn’t move even a foot of that.</span> <span id="s2283">And if you had to make a pee you have to ask for permission to leave or to turn around.</span> <span id="s2284">And suddenly I -- I noticed that big, big guy with a big dark red beard, and just urging the others on to work, to work, to work.</span> <span id="s2285">And one of the guys was -- the first one who got killed was a tiny little guy, almost no face left, like blue eyes, a little sparse hair, no chest, barely moving, t-tiny, maybe around 50-ish.</span> <span id="s2286">And suddenly, I look -- I look at that, I hear something, there is Viel.</span> <span id="s2287">Oh, we had put our weapons away for lunch, then we got our weapons back, but there were still some pyramids there because lunches were taken in sequence.</span> <span id="s2288">So Viel goes to a pyramid, grabs a rifle, and there could be more than three, could be four or five.</span> <span id="s2289">So one of the witnesses said oh, when you grab a rifle of the three, the others four fall down.</span> <span id="s2290">He took one of the four or five, stood up straight, aimed that and I said to myself, what -- wh -- I didn’t know the word what the hell is happening, excuse me, what’s happening.</span> <span id="s2291">And I said, well maybe he’s just limbering up or something.</span> <span id="s2292">It was a muddy day for -- you know, springtime, mud in the river -- gri -- ditch.</span> <span id="s2293">Raises the weapon and aims towards me.</span> <span id="s2294">I didn’t even duck because I said, what will -- and suddenly, he aims -- it doesn’t take long to aim.</span> <span id="s2295">And so I hear the shot and the little guy just falls down.</span> <span id="s2296">Didn’t even just hear the pop, falls down.</span> <span id="s2297">He kind of fell down forward, and the military law is, if you hit the chest or the heart, you always fall forward, you never fall backward.</span> <span id="s2298">Okay, so second shot, second guy falls down.</span> <span id="s2299">And then a third shot, the big guy.</span> <span id="s2300">And the big guy had stood up straight and he was looking at the officer, and the officer was looking at him.</span> <span id="s2301">The big guy had the shovel, the officer had the gun.</span> <span id="s2302">So the officer pulled the trigger, hits the big guy, the big guy falls down, stands up, raises his hand.</span> <span id="s2303">Viel aims, shoots the second time, the big guy falls down.</span> <span id="s2304">Stands up -- no more raised arm, stands up, still keeps on staring at Viel.</span> <span id="s2305">Big guy.</span> <span id="s2306">Legs like that.</span> <span id="s2307">He must have been a capo because he looked better fed than the other guys.</span> <span id="s2308">Viel, third time, plomp.</span> <span id="s2309">Was in the face, whatever, fall down in the mud.</span> <span id="s2310">Three shots, plus two shots, five shots, three dead guys.</span> <span id="s2311">Foosh.</span> <span id="s2312">Five shots.</span> <span id="s2313">Carbine is not empty yet.</span> <span id="s2314">Keeps on shooting, all the seven guys dead.</span> <span id="s2315">He missed one shot, right?</span> <span id="s2316">Puts the gun back, the carbine, goes back to the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2317">The officers had looked, turned around, joined the group, continued the discussion.</span> <span id="s2318">Seven dead guys.</span> <span id="s2319">A little while later, I’m standing there, I’m looking at the [indecipherable] I’m looking at the guy behind me, in front of me [indecipherable] the thing.</span> <span id="s2320">What the -- what -- what happened?</span> <span id="s2321">What happened?</span> <span id="s2322">Deep inside myself I was like a stone.</span> <span id="s2323">Unable to bel -- unable to think.</span> <span id="s2324">Wha -- I thought I’d a -- I had an active mind, my mind never falls asleep.</span> <span id="s2325">I just -- petrified.</span> <span id="s2326">I had never seen a dead Jew in my life.</span> <span id="s2327">Suddenly I see seven dead Jew -- I never wanted to see a dead Jew.</span> <span id="s2328">That’s not why I was in war.</span> <span id="s2329">All I was in war, to keep the commies off central Europe.</span> <span id="s2330">Some of the commies were Jewish commissars.</span> <span id="s2331">There was, as you well know, Hitler’s personal command to kill the Jewish commissars, right?</span> <span id="s2332">Never seen one, alive or dead.</span> <span id="s2333">There were seven Jews.</span> <span id="s2334">Say nothing, continue my guard duty.</span> <span id="s2335">Didn’t di -- don’t step off the thing, cause you’re not allowed.</span> <span id="s2336">But -- I hear a noise.</span> <span id="s2337">A two wheeler.</span> <span id="s2338">A death cart.</span> <span id="s2339">Typical of concentration camps, I found later on.</span> <span id="s2340">Okay?</span> <span id="s2341">Four guys were pushing, prisoners, Jewish, death guard -- it s-seemed like standard procedure.</span> <span id="s2342">They’d appeared from the nowhere, they were coming closer and closer, nobody touched them, nobody told them anything.</span> <span id="s2343">Came to the ditch -- went to the ditch, put the cart -- I think they even got it somehow into the ditch and grabbed the little guy who had died first, no problem, two guys lift him up, bango on the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2344">Grabbed the second guy -- they needed all four of them to lift up the heavy guy.</span> <span id="s2345">They had problems lifting up the heavy guy, so finally the [indecipherable] got him and the one, two three, all seven, turned the cart around, marched away.</span> <span id="s2346">Death cart.</span> <span id="s2347">Standard instrument of picking up the dead during the Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s2348">Now, not even the commies in the Spanish Civil War were doing things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">Q: Were there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">A: So, we were officer candidates.</span> <span id="s2351">We had been told repeatedly, abide by international law concerning warfare, abide by this, abide by that.</span> <span id="s2352">The rules -- an officer’s thing is to prevent things like that happening.</span> <span id="s2353">My own leader of inspection did the killing.</span> <span id="s2354">And it was my own, I was part of the officers’ school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">Q: So he was training you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">A: Why did he do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: Was he a German German?</span> <span id="s2359">Was he a Nazi German?</span> <span id="s2360">Had he lost his mind?</span> <span id="s2361">Or, my [indecipherable] finale -- my latest conclusion; he had been so brainwashed by his own system that we [indecipherable] because he had been made officer in the Dachau camp in 1938 -- he had been so brainwashed to have believed, like many Nazis, they had become master of life or death of the untermensche, and that he was responsible to no one.</span> <span id="s2362">And the tragedy over that is evidently the tragedy of seven dead Jewish people, innocent as they were, especially, but tragedy that nobody brought it to trial.</span> <span id="s2363">Two days later, the officer of commanding school said, what has happened, has happened.</span> <span id="s2364">If you survive the war, if you win the war, we are not accountable.</span> <span id="s2365">If you lose the war, you’re going to be dead anyway.</span> <span id="s2366">So you got away scot-free.</span> <span id="s2367">And we in our deep ourselves, including Barouka, who claimed in Ravensburg that he had been in the hospital, he had never been there, and the judge accused him -- accused him of lying directly into the face of modern German democratic law, right?</span> <span id="s2368">Even Barouka said it was wrong, what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: Who was Barouka?</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: This is no -- Barouka Kuno, one of the witnesses --</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: -- who was quite close to me.</span> <span id="s2373">He was a decent guy.</span> <span id="s2374">I was counting on him to back me up.</span> <span id="s2375">Suddenly he looks at me, he says, Lallier, you were a traitor.</span> <span id="s2376">This never happened.</span> <span id="s2377">So -- so, we went through the last four weeks of the war, totally, totally having -- I had totally lost belief in any trace of humanity on the part of the Germans.</span> <span id="s2378">So just look at the sequence.</span> <span id="s2379">Hanging all those Serbs.</span> <span id="s2380">Massacring the partisan women.</span> <span id="s2381">There was one more [indecipherable] massacring the partisan women.</span> <span id="s2382">Anyway, I’ll -- I’ll become -- come to they murdered -- killing -- oh, t-talking about human rights and that.</span> <span id="s2383">And that -- oh yes, killing all kinds of partisan, burning the villages, and then seeing this guy killing seven unarmed, half starved people in their tattered rags, could only have meant that the guy had suffered dementia, which is legally excusable, they put a guy like that in a nuthouse, right?</span> <span id="s2384">Or the ultimate evil condition of believing that his destiny was to be the ultimate judge over the life or death of people, especially [indecipherable] defenseless people.</span> <span id="s2385">So he, to me -- Viel was the -- remains the ultimate example of the evil that the Nazi system can inculcate in human minds, making them believe at the individual level that not only Adolf, but they as their emissaries had the right to kill on sight, without being accountable to anybody.</span> <span id="s2386">Now, counter argument, as I learned from the critics at Ravensburg, a Waffen SS officer will never do a killing like that unless he’s ordered to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Q: Who said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A: The defense lawyer.</span> <span id="s2389">Now, he raised the question that was Viel ordered by the superior officers in -- still living in Prague to do the killing to find out how the cadets would react.</span> <span id="s2390">Would they react like true Nazis and clap?</span> <span id="s2391">Or would those be weeded out who may have negative inclinations.</span> <span id="s2392">Because the SS officer corps will need to have undoubtedly component members who are ultimate Nazis to whom what Hitler says is the absolute right.</span> <span id="s2393">I have no answer to that because the commanding officer eventually lost his life, the last day of the war in Prague, but the question was raised at the court, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">Q: Well, let me ask you something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">Q: Either way, whether Viel did it on his own, or he did it because he was ordered, does it really make a difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2398">yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">A: Because in all armies, if the order is given, you have no choice but to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: Do you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: Including the American Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: Do you have a choice if you think it’s a war -- if it’s a war crime?</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: Please look at Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: I don’t want to look at Vietnam --</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: I want to look at Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: -- I’m looking at this, I’m looking at what constitutes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: I would say that in the German order --</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">A: -- of military conduct, and war conduct, the order has to come from a superior officer, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q: But you were -- you said you were -- you were -- been trained -- you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">A: We were questioning --</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: No, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: We were -- I say, there were two choices.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">Q: But what’s a war crime?</span> <span id="s2416">Tell me what a w --</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: A war crime?</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: -- wh-what were you car -- what were you trained is a war crime?</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: War crime is what Viel did to those seven Jews, that’s a war crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: I can’t give you a purer, clearer --</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q: No, I understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A: -- definition of war crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: But you were also just being taught.</span> <span id="s2425">You were going to cadet school from January -- from Mar -- what is it, March 19?</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: That’s a -- from Jan -- end of January to mid-March.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: March of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: That war crimes -- an office -- an officer’s duty, to prevent --</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: Prevent any war s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: -- any [indecipherable] from committing a war crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2432">So isn’t he committing a war crime?</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: He, in our eyes was committing what we would today call a war crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: But wouldn’t you have called that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: At that time I called it murder.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: Wa -- but still, it’s the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: It’s the same, a war crime is a murder, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s2439">A: Well, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: No.</span> <span id="s2442">A -- a war crime is a murder in a situation in which a war is properly conducted in the Judeo-Christian interpretation, according to the laws of Judeo-Christianity, in which you kind of go contrary to the laws and do the killing, even though the war crime legal setting would not allow you to, or not order you to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Q: Well, let me have th -- let me ask s -- to you in another way.</span> <span id="s2444">Did you now begin to believe that what the Nazis were doing, or the Germans were doing under the Nazi regime was committing war crimes wholesale?</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: Well that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: Is that what you finally believed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">A: It was a wholesale -- I was going to conclude that particular example, and the hangings in Yugoslavia, and that partisan little woman, and the others who were -- oh yeah, the hero, my little Serbian hero, were an expression of the endemic attitude of the German Nazis to kill on sight without any feelings of accountability.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">Q: And is that what you finally believed [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">A: And -- and that’s what I finally believe and that is why I have difficulties with the modern German system, because at court most of them doubted my honesty of the testimony.</span> <span id="s2450">Most of them called me a traitor.</span> <span id="s2451">Now, what is that an indication of?</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">Q: Well, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">A: They’re trying to white -- they were trying to whitewash poor Viel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: Well let me -- okay, let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s2455">You -- when you were captured, right, at the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2457">By the Brits.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: By the Brits.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">Q: You told an office --</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">A: I -- I prudently arranged to be captured by the Brits.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Q: By the -- I -- oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">A: Because they were closest to my home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">Q: I see, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2467">Okay.</span> <span id="s2468">So you’re captured by the Brits, and you tell some officer --</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">Q: -- British officer, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Q: What you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2474">Not only him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">Q: Not only him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">A: Also to the -- to the s -- C.I.C. guy Brown, Major Brown [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">Q: Who was an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A: -- and also to the -- to general -- two star American General Wood at the UNRRA in Vienna, and also to my personal self-appointed confessor, the abbot of the Benedictine monastery, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">Q: All right, so you -- you tell four or five people.</span> <span id="s2480">It’s a number of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">A: I told one, two, three, four people, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">Q: Four people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2485">And you’re 20 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">A: I was -- the first one that I talked to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: 21 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: -- I was waiter.</span> <span id="s2489">The first one, the -- the Brit was in the summer 1945, I was 20 plus three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2491">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">A: And by that time I had confirmed my first feeling that I experienced while I was looking at the killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">Q: Which was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">A: That it was wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">A: Now, wrong means, in the strict sense of definitions, war crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">A: Crime against humanity is even better.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">Q: So -- so is that one of the first times that -- that a moral clarity came to you during --</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">A: That came at the moment if I were -- in which I suddenly matured into recognizing that all the previous moments --</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">Q: Was wrong -- were wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">A: -- were exactly the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">Q: Exactly the same, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">A: Endemic.</span> <span id="s2505">You know the term endemic?</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">A: I’ve been learning English all my life, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: Yes, yes, endemic is a good word.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: -- endemic to the Nazi Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2511">When --</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">A: Should I say to the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">Q: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s2514">I don’t think that’s fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">A: Because we now have to have full understanding --</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: Right, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: -- that the Germans suffered under Hitler, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: No, no, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: They were the major people suffered under Hitler, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">Q: No, that’s now why.</span> <span id="s2521">It’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">A: They hated him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: I’m not talking about the Germans who lived at the time, but to -- to condemn all Germans who lived afterwards --</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: Why didn’t the ju -- why didn't the judge in Ravensburg lock up the seven or eight who said I was lying?</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q: You can’t just lock up people because they say you’re lying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: Please [indecipherable] mine idea is not speaking the truth in front of court --</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">Q: No, it’s -- you can’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">Q: You can’t do that.</span> <span id="s2532">So, when did you find out, between 1945 and by the time you leave Europe in 1951, when do you find out --</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">A: Yeah, October 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: Right, when do you find out about the gassings?</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">A: The gassing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">A: Why are we suddenly stopping the war crimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">Q: No, no, I’m going to go back to the war crimes.</span> <span id="s2539">First I want to know -- I want --</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">A: You will?</span> <span id="s2541">You promise?</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: Yes, I promise you.</span> <span id="s2543">I want to get some sense of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: Very -- I was working -- I was working, I didn’t know about the gassing until I finally got hold of the Vienna [indecipherable] in which 1940 -- when was the Vienna [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s2545">I was in a POW -- no, actually, I found out in the pre -- British POW camp, in the course of the winter 1945.</span> <span id="s2546">There was a Jewish guy who had worn a British uniform, who went around -- it was an officers’ camp, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">Q: Mm-hm, mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">A: Went around in Graz, Wetzelsberg, okay?</span> <span id="s2549">And I wa -- have to tell you about that too.</span> <span id="s2550">Very close to Tito Yugoslavia and very close to the Brits being terribly worried that Tito is -- will o-occupy that part of Austria and declare them Europea -- the Yugoslav sovereign territory communist, and the Brits didn’t want any of that.</span> <span id="s2551">So what did they do?</span> <span id="s2552">They fed us -- made us do all kinds of military and non-military exercises, even told us -- not me specifically, there were senior officers that they’d have to keep us physically ready to once again take up fighting against the Tito, and brother did we ever hate Tito.</span> <span id="s2553">Giving us the weapons to get Tito’s attempts to come to the north and push him all the way back.</span> <span id="s2554">So we had a pretty good time learning English at the same time.</span> <span id="s2555">And I say those British officers were wise officers, and the one who went around asking was a Jewish Austrian who went around wanting to know if any of us had been to a concentration camp, and if anyone’s of -- of -- had ever seen people, Jewish people being gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">A: Now, I don’t know what the others told them, but I could only tell him that I myself never did see because I was never close enough in the Polish area where those things were happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">Q: But that was new for you to hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">A: Yes, that was news to me to hear and it only confirmed -- the term endemic is very late in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">A: But I would now say it only confirmed what I was getting the impression then, Nazi Germany was about.</span> <span id="s2562">The absolute right to kill or gas, without accou -- without accountability.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: And they were a Christian nation, equally Catholic and Protestant, which in itself raises many other questions.</span> <span id="s2565">They were not all mitleifer, you know the term mitleifer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">Q: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">A: In Denazification a key term that excused you for having been a major con -- mitleifer is one who happily --</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">Q: Run along.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">A: -- runs along.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">A: Everything the benefits.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A: And 90 percent were declared mitleifers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">A: I was declared a juvenile.</span> <span id="s2576">I didn’t even qualify mitleifer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">Q: A juvenile, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">Q: -- cause you were a kid, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">A: I -- I have my Denazification document.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">Q: But did that -- you know, it’s one thing to see one person committing a war crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">Q: It’s another to think about a policy that becomes when millions of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">A: Well, it’s a leap -- it’s a leap of -- not leap of faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">Q: It’s a leap.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">A: It’s a leap of -- of mal-intent, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">Q: So quantity and quality matter here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">A: You know, it is a -- both matter.</span> <span id="s2589">I -- I was kind of -- could go off completely on that tangent.</span> <span id="s2590">Doesn’t in true human loving.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">Q: Excuse me?</span> <span id="s2592">That --</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A: In true human loving, quality and quantity are very closely interlinked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: Yes, they are interconnected.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: Right, and the purer the loving, the closer they’re intertwined right?</span> <span id="s2596">Okay.</span> <span id="s2597">At any age, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">Q: Yeah, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: Okay, so let’s go back to that.</span> <span id="s2602">The -- it takes a bit of training in philosophy to be able to answer the question of individual acts of crime, generally I prefer crimes against humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s2605">Even though Holocaust is a very exceptional kind of crime against humanity, okay?</span> <span id="s2606">Between individual acts of crime against humanity and a whole system gearing individuals to that.</span> <span id="s2607">And there the conclusion is simple.</span> <span id="s2608">Remember the lady who wrote the book on Proletarianism?</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2610">You mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">A: Wasn’t her --</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">Q: -- Hannah Arendt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">A: -- conclusion --</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">A: -- that for an individual to act criminally, the whole system must be set up on a criminal base.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">A: So there is your answer.</span> <span id="s2618">Viel, you could say, couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s2619">He had been convinced by his superior that what he was doing was right.</span> <span id="s2620">But that -- wait, wait -- that, in any military strategy will then put the blame on --</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">A: -- the commander in chief --</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">Q: Commander in chief, not the -- not the individual.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">A: -- of the United States armed forces, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">Q: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">A: Well, that’s not how it works.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">A: Because in simpler terms, at any level you’ve got to have a direct command from the next superior officer, which means to say it never gets to the top.</span> <span id="s2629">But in the Hitler system, the Wannsee conference was the top.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: And types like Viel, deranged completely of -- not deranged, hateful completely, or not, or maybe hurting from a sev -- very severe stomach wound that he was still suffering with, may have been said to have lost his mind.</span> <span id="s2632">I looked into his eyes, they showed absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s2633">They didn’t show lust to kill.</span> <span id="s2634">I think that the guillotine manipulators must have had the same look of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">Q: Of nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">A: -- absolutely no feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">A: It’s not human being that we are killing, chicken that -- even chick -- killing chickens would be wa -- awaken some feelings in you.</span> <span id="s2639">So, was he an executor on his own behalf, or was he only executing what the system had told him was right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">Q: Did you have a class --</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">A: Did I accuse the system in Ravensburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">A: I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2645">That was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q: That was later, many years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">A: That was later.</span> <span id="s2649">At the same time, it had to be said.</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2651">We’re going to have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: So was he ordered, or did he do it on his own?</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">Q: Well, that we --</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">A: And there is no answer to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">Q: -- we may never know.</span> <span id="s2659">We’ll never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: No, well see, but again, military discipline tells you he couldn’t have done it on his own because B, he would also have reduced the efficiency of the anti-tank diggers, by reducing their numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2662">Di --</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: And one of the arguments of the defense was exactly that.</span> <span id="s2664">Lallier is lying, because no officer will go contrary to the need to keep efficiency as high as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">A: I found that a very contrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">Q: Wa-Was anyone else shocked, in that ditch?</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">A: Oh, they were sh -- oh, there were reports from the Czech legal proceedings following the whole catastrophe of the small fortress of Theresienstadt in which tens of thousands of people, Jewish people mainly, lost their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">Q: Now what I ne --</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">A: It is a continuum, a continual --</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">A: -- killings during the seven or eight days of the digging of the ditch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">Q: But, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">A: But we were there only for two days --</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">A: -- and on the first day I heard nothing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">A: -- in my section.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2680">So you don’t know when a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">A: And two kilometers is long enough not to be able to hear clearly, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">Q: From somebody else, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">A: And in my section -- this killing happened in my section on the second day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: But court proceedings which to pred -- demonstrate that many people -- I even have a listing of the seven dead, plus others who were killed somewhere else at different times --</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">A: -- at the same ditch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">A: Endemic.</span> <span id="s2690">So ki-kil -- he -- Viel wasn’t the only one, but the Czech courts tried several of them, and hanged several.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: In 1948 or 1940 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">A: -- no, 1950 - ’51.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">Q: When you went back to this cadet training --</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q: -- the second da -- after that second say when you saw the killing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: -- did you ask about the killing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: No, I went back with -- I went back on the following day, requisitioning a bicycle from a public stand off the main church in Leitmeritz with another cadet offi -- cadet o -- candidate by the name of Schultz, Sep Schultz, a real Nazi-like Volksdeutsche, to go back and find out if it’s really true what happened, right?</span> <span id="s2701">And we went into the klanifesto, into the small fortress to ask some questions, and we were allowed to go in because we were fully uniformed, right?</span> <span id="s2702">So we went around and we came across a couple of subalterns who looked at us like as equal because we were not yet officers and who showed us, well this is the wall against which the shooting is done.</span> <span id="s2703">That is the wall in which [indecipherable] and the wall against which some of the hanging is done.</span> <span id="s2704">This is where some of them perished trying to jump across the fence.</span> <span id="s2705">And we discovered that it really was an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s2706">But we never went to higher command, because given our lower -- lower rank, we were just happy to have been tolerated in there asking a few questions.</span> <span id="s2707">And we decided that -- we didn’t just quietly disappear, but it strengthened our resolve in waiting for the answer by the commander of the school, right, to really find out what we got to be involved in against our -- our perception that officer candidates don’t do things like that, are not ordered to do things like that.</span> <span id="s2708">Now, the second question is, why would we have been sent there in the first place?</span> <span id="s2709">There were other military uniform -- military units in the area.</span> <span id="s2710">And I’m coming back to the main thesis.</span> <span id="s2711">I think I’m right in presuming that the real Nazis in the Waffen SS command wanted to give a last minute test to our affiliation with Nazism as an ideology.</span> <span id="s2712">They wanted to find out which of us would continue falling into step and which of us could be considered untrusty and maybe put up against the wall.</span> <span id="s2713">And you know what, given the devilnish -- devilish -- devilness of the system, it’s a plausible intellectual question.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">Q: Is there -- is there a problem?</span> <span id="s2715">Wait one second.</span> <span id="s2716">[interruption] So you’re asking the quest --</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">A: So the second interesting question is, was it possibly aimed at testing the cadets for their allegiance to Nazism, separating those who continue believing in Hitler’s absolute ideas about the right to kill from those who would have had some doubts.</span> <span id="s2718">And hoping to sort out those who would have some doubts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">Q: But then wouldn’t you have seen this happening more generally?</span> <span id="s2720">Why just you f -- why just you?</span> <span id="s2721">It’s only two of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">A: I-In -- in a tot -- i-in a totalitarian system it is very difficult to distinguish between generally and non-generally.</span> <span id="s2723">The system in its totality exists and under each many interpretations --</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">A: -- right, will be imposed upon people.</span> <span id="s2726">And it could well be that in the whole Waffen SS, attempts like that were being made throughout the war, but I can only talk about our own experience, and within our own experience.</span> <span id="s2727">This clash di -- in our deepest inside between discovering what is wrong, about which we could do nothing, and trying to make sense of why it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">A: And I’m still trying to make sense as to why anyone, supposedly an officer, supposedly abiding by international agreement and warfare and on and on and on, not committing crimes against humanity, why would a person li -- do that?</span> <span id="s2730">He didn’t sound -- look like one who had gone crazy.</span> <span id="s2731">So, a cold blooded killer?</span> <span id="s2732">In Nazism there was no such thing as a cold blooded killer.</span> <span id="s2733">Viel --</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: Who -- how do you know there weren’t a variety of kinds of killers under Nazism --</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: Well, I would only --</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">Q: -- some cold blooded.</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A: -- I would only -- I would only look at Viel and I would recall during the hangs of the Serbs, the presence of German officers from the Wehrmacht, who were standing there and looking at the shooters and executioners the way the other members of the officers’ school were standing there looking at Viel doing the shooting.</span> <span id="s2738">Irresponsive.</span> <span id="s2739">Would you call that irresponsive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: What, if they didn’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">A: Showing no -- showing no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: No, showing no emotions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: -- emotions, right.</span> <span id="s2744">Morally -- what the [indecipherable] morally untouchable is the wrong term.</span> <span id="s2745">Lacking any morality --</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: Morality, maybe --</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: -- is the term.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: -- maybe.</span> <span id="s2749">You know, you said, this was off camera, you said your father taught you fairness, but not humaneness.</span> <span id="s2750">You think that’s true?</span> <span id="s2751">Do you think it took you a lifet --</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">A: My father taught me that humaneness can only live in a system of a discipline committed to tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">Q: Nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">A: Nothing else.</span> <span id="s2755">He was an inveterate traditionalist --</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">Q: Traditionalist, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">A: -- who had failed, even after the war to recognize, that even Austro-Hungary, in many respects, was not a noble entity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">A: But he needed intellectual refuge in a world -- in most [indecipherable] much worse than Austro-Hungary had ever been.</span> <span id="s2760">Austro-Hungary was a haven of righteousness under the eyes of that beautiful looking white beard and white [indecipherable] Kaiser, right, who la -- loved his wife that he had so tragically lost.</span> <span id="s2761">You see, he never saw beyond that.</span> <span id="s2762">Why would he else -- why else would he tell me, Adalbert, if you ever go to America, you lose your civilization.</span> <span id="s2763">To him civilization meant something that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">Q: Something else --</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">A: -- had existed before 1980.</span> <span id="s2766">Would he care for the freedom and equality of Serbs on crosses [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s2767">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Q: So, it would have --</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">A: He never seemed to care about the blatant discrimination against the Jewish people, because he is a standard example to say well, one of my friends is a Jewish guy, he teaches mathematics.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: So it didn’t really get to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">Q: What the -- the Nazis had done.</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">A: Well, he was hoping, like many of the others in the higher bourgeoisie that Hitler could be very useful safeguarding the rights of the higher bourgeoisie to exempt higher status --</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q: So whatever crimes might have been committed were not -- either they weren't necessarily crimes, or they were necessary crimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">A: Well, they -- they would say there are no crimes -- there are -- nothing can be regarded a crime that is done -- undertaken in order to preserve the system that you believe is the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2779">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">A: And don’t forget, as a Christian person, he couldn’t possibly propose that what the pa -- Pope said do and done to one and a half million women burning them at the stake, that that was an ultimate evil.</span> <span id="s2781">And he was a Protestant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2783">When you told these people what you had seen --</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q: -- these four people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">Q: What did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">A: By the Brits, he said --</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">Q: The Brits.</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">A: -- he said look, I have a job to do.</span> <span id="s2791">I remember it [indecipherable] job to do.</span> <span id="s2792">I have to take care of you guys and I have to keep you in good shape.</span> <span id="s2793">He was Scots, I think.</span> <span id="s2794">I found it very funny for guys to be wearing skirts, you know, but I liked them, I liked them.</span> <span id="s2795">Gave me a chance to learn English as fast as possible.</span> <span id="s2796">And he says, I have a job to do.</span> <span id="s2797">Don’t ask me, don’t bother me, don’t bother -- he said, bother, he said [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2798">So I said, but sir, you know -- said, oh, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2799">[indecipherable] said, okay, I’ll report it.</span> <span id="s2800">Remember [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2801">Major Brown, C.I.C, Bamberg, 1946, October, November.</span> <span id="s2802">They send me back to Bamberg because I had become homeless.</span> <span id="s2803">I had lost my Austrian citizenship because I hadn’t been born in Austria, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2804">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">A: And I was -- I served in the German army, without, thank God, getting the German citizenship.</span> <span id="s2806">But they sent me to Bamberg because as a so-called Volksdeutsche, they couldn’t send me back to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s2807">I wouldn’t have gone back to Yugoslavia, right.</span> <span id="s2808">So I went back to -- I went up to Bamberg against my will and a year later I couldn’t stand it any more, I went down to Vienna, crossing the border illegally and that was that.</span> <span id="s2809">Oh, I even wrote a letter to the Austrian president saying that as a former Austrian, I beg your pardon, but I do wish to live in Austria.</span> <span id="s2810">Could you please accommodate me with a permission to cross the boundary illegally?</span> <span id="s2811">And would you believe it, I got a letter from President’s of Austria office saying Lallier, you are welcome because so many of you young ones died, we badly need replacements.</span> <span id="s2812">Never asked any questions, right?</span> <span id="s2813">Anyway, so in Bamberg I had to report to the C.I.C as per my release, I have to be entrusted to American or British authority for reeducation.</span> <span id="s2814">Cause they must have recognized that I had a brain that might be potentially useful for reexamination.</span> <span id="s2815">So that [indecipherable] me, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">A: So I went to Brown and Brown turned out to be a German emigrant.</span> <span id="s2818">Spoke fluent German, oh he spoke such a beautiful Rhineland German, it was a pleasure to talk to the guy.</span> <span id="s2819">And o-over the course of time -- met him quite a few times -- the Germans gave me no job because I had been in the Waffen SS [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2820">Suddenly they said well, SS [indecipherable] welcome.</span> <span id="s2821">I have to wait until the [indecipherable] which I got in [indecipherable] not from my father.</span> <span id="s2822">And -- so there was no inside work on that.</span> <span id="s2823">And so eventually we talked about the -- America.</span> <span id="s2824">I took to the guy, he was very intelligent.</span> <span id="s2825">I liked his ways and he was so leisurely.</span> <span id="s2826">He was so different, not [indecipherable] officer German, I -- Major, I said wow, Major is staff officer.</span> <span id="s2827">You know, we are [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2828">And he liked me, he said Lallier, you are -- in German [speaks German] I can reeducate you, do you like America?</span> <span id="s2829">I said, I know nothing.</span> <span id="s2830">I know a bit about the British, but I did see American soldiers and officers lie on their stomach playing dice.</span> <span id="s2831">He says, oh yeah, we love doing that.</span> <span id="s2832">Would you like to do that?</span> <span id="s2833">It was a sale, right?</span> <span id="s2834">He said then, a little while later, and would you like to work for us?</span> <span id="s2835">And I said, yes please, I need job.</span> <span id="s2836">I need job badly.</span> <span id="s2837">So he gave me a job as a stoveman in an American infantry company stationed in Bamberg.</span> <span id="s2838">And stoveman was the most dangerous job in the army because they used gasoline stoves and every third of them was expected to explode into the stovemen’s faces, right?</span> <span id="s2839">And I said, stoveman?</span> <span id="s2840">Sounds good to me.</span> <span id="s2841">All the food you can eat, he said.</span> <span id="s2842">So I got the job as a stoveman.</span> <span id="s2843">I did a very good job.</span> <span id="s2844">Not even one stove exploded while I was working in Bamberg for nine months.</span> <span id="s2845">And he was pleased, he says, you seem highly useful, your English is getting better, your German and other languages, how about working for us?</span> <span id="s2846">I said, doing what?</span> <span id="s2847">He says, well, certain things we like to find out.</span> <span id="s2848">You were in the Waffen SS for instance.</span> <span id="s2849">What if we sent you to Switzerland to explore the escape routes of some higher SS officials through Switzerland to Latin America.</span> <span id="s2850">And I’m a humble guy, I [indecipherable] thinking of generals and colonels and all this.</span> <span id="s2851">I said, why should I do that?</span> <span id="s2852">He said, because you seem like a guy who can cross boundaries and fact find without being caught, and -- would you like to do that?</span> <span id="s2853">I said, well, why not?</span> <span id="s2854">Where should I go?</span> <span id="s2855">He said, well, go to Switzerland, try to get across the border.</span> <span id="s2856">Make sure that they don’t catch you because the Swiss will put you in jail for being Waffen SS [indecipherable] and I’ll give you 200 American dollars.</span> <span id="s2857">And try to fact find in the Basel area if there may have been someone on the streets, through which some of these Waffen S -- these SS [indecipherable] he emphasized strongly, seem to have go -- escaped and then to Latin America.</span> <span id="s2858">So, he said, I’ll give you two weeks to find out and report back to me.</span> <span id="s2859">And I -- I found it very amusing, here I am a nobody -- oh, and he said, and if you do a good job on the other assignments, I’ll try to get you a visa to emigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s2860">Now, I am a living example of an early shift United States policy in 19 -- late 1946, by which time the Cold War had began.</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">Q: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">A: The Cold War --</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">A: -- had began.</span> <span id="s2865">I’m looking at some so-called criminal elements in the German army, and enabling them even to come to the United States on behalf of the mo -- of defending democracy for a greater cause which might prevail over the presumed war criminal tha -- d-during th --</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">Q: This -- and they al -- they allowed -- they allowed --</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">A: -- mind [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">Q: -- inveterate Nazis to come in, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">A: -- you see.</span> <span id="s2870">Oh well, I was -- veterate or not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">Q: You were not that, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">A: -- I certainly wasn’t venerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">A: Anyway, he was smiling at me and said, would you like to emigrate to United States eventually?</span> <span id="s2875">I said, well, I have no home, I don’t know yet, but I had just fallen in love with my wife, eventual wife --</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">A: -- said no, not yet.</span> <span id="s2878">And he said, well, but I-I will inter -- look at that.</span> <span id="s2879">Then he said, if you need any other type of employment, if things go well I will give you a highest recommendation as a re-educable person.</span> <span id="s2880">I was 21 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">A: Not yet in the prime, okay?</span> <span id="s2883">So I went to -- across the border, swam across the river.</span> <span id="s2884">Boy, that Rhine river is terribly cold.</span> <span id="s2885">Boy, is it ever a fast river [indecipherable] on the other side.</span> <span id="s2886">Went to the next monastery, I won’t tell you where.</span> <span id="s2887">I promised I would never talk about that.</span> <span id="s2888">And th-that why a -- Austrian is a bit like Swiss, kind of pretending that I am kind of a sta -- refugee of some sort, I was going around and fact finding and I did discover that one of the monasteries had been quite instrumental on behalf of Catholicism --</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">A: -- not Protestantism --</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">A: -- to ferret out some of those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">A: Most of those facts have since become quite well known, including the persons involved, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">A: And I got my evidence, I went back to, and I said to Mr. -- Herr Brown, I said Herr Brown -- I didn’t call him Major -- Herr Brown, I have the evidence, and he took careful note of that, and then I became serious, and I -- look, I have a problem.</span> <span id="s2897">I don’t want to stay here, I want to go back home.</span> <span id="s2898">I can’t go back home, cause Tito is still there.</span> <span id="s2899">I want to go back to Austria to study, but I need your help, I said.</span> <span id="s2900">And I also need to talk to you about something that had happened.</span> <span id="s2901">And this was -- by that time it was June -- no, March 19 -- oh, February 1948.</span> <span id="s2902">So I had been with the [indecipherable] often working in that American company [indecipherable] company.</span> <span id="s2903">And by the time he had told me about the American presidency, election for demo -- oh, I loved it, I just swallowed America wholesale.</span> <span id="s2904">And he was delighted.</span> <span id="s2905">And I said, look, I’ve to tell you about the thing that had happened.</span> <span id="s2906">In ’48, the Czech Republic was falling to communist hands.</span> <span id="s2907">Hungary had fallen into communist hands so the threat was evidently the thing that we had tried to fight against.</span> <span id="s2908">Soviet Union expanded and become reality.</span> <span id="s2909">And [indecipherable] look, the Soviets are expanding, I’m feeling terrible, I’ve lost my home, I don’t want to go to America, what do I do?</span> <span id="s2910">And I said, what do I do especially?</span> <span id="s2911">I have to confess to you that I had witnessed that murder.</span> <span id="s2912">What murder?</span> <span id="s2913">In the Panzergraben.</span> <span id="s2914">Oh, you witnessed a murder in the Panzergraben.</span> <span id="s2915">I said yes.</span> <span id="s2916">Well, who?</span> <span id="s2917">I said -- I gave him the story exactly, the big body guy, Viel and all that.</span> <span id="s2918">He looks at me and says, I believe you.</span> <span id="s2919">And I said, you better believe me because I don’t believe it was right and I’ve got to clear my conscience because I believe it was wrong and I believe the guy should be apprehended, and I named the name.</span> <span id="s2920">He sits back and says, Lallier.</span> <span id="s2921">Lally.</span> <span id="s2922">The Cold War is on.</span> <span id="s2923">I am glad that you are saying that because I can -- I’m counting on you.</span> <span id="s2924">We need guys like you cause you never know about the Cold War.</span> <span id="s2925">And he says, our policy is to report these things about what the Nazi had done, to higher levels.</span> <span id="s2926">My job here is to reeducate you, and talking to you to pass on any useful information about you to the higher ups.</span> <span id="s2927">I will report what you have just said, but there is nothing more that I can do about that because I am not a war crime discrimination -- I am not a war crime investigator.</span> <span id="s2928">So what -- I left it in his hands.</span> <span id="s2929">In March 1948, I crossed the boundary, went to Vienna, found a little job, found my little eventual wife and decided that I would approach -- I’d heard from friends about the United Nations refugee organization in Vienna.</span> <span id="s2930">I went there in person [indecipherable] I remember.</span> <span id="s2931">And I learned that the commanding officer was a general, two star general by the name of Wood.</span> <span id="s2932">And by that time I had handled a British major in the col -- in the prisoner of war camp, I’d handled a C.I.C. major, and once you have handled a C.I. major, you can talk face to face to an American general.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2935">So I found myself speaking very fa -- low level English, asking for an interview with the chief of the mission [indecipherable] mission in Vienna, and they almost fell over.</span> <span id="s2936">And I said, please, I speak languages, please, I know many refugees, please, I know many Jewish refugees, please, I want to talk General Wood.</span> <span id="s2937">And would you believe it?</span> <span id="s2938">General Wood received me.</span> <span id="s2939">There was another proof that the American system will have even generals lying on their bellies, playing the dice, hoping to win.</span> <span id="s2940">So with me, play the dice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">A: I went to General Wood’s office, bowed to him, no [indecipherable] any more, right, bow to him.</span> <span id="s2943">Adalbert Lallier, looking for a job.</span> <span id="s2944">He says, what languages?</span> <span id="s2945">I said Hungarian.</span> <span id="s2946">Good.</span> <span id="s2947">I said, Serbo-Croatia.</span> <span id="s2948">Good.</span> <span id="s2949">I said, little Czech.</span> <span id="s2950">Oh, he says, very good.</span> <span id="s2951">We can use you.</span> <span id="s2952">English, he listened to me, he said, you learn fast.</span> <span id="s2953">I said, also French.</span> <span id="s2954">He says, oh Monsieur Delong will be your boss.</span> <span id="s2955">He’ll love you.</span> <span id="s2956">Right?</span> <span id="s2957">But he said, right now I cannot take you because I need to find out who you are.</span> <span id="s2958">So, I said please, please, I need job badly.</span> <span id="s2959">Anything is better than cleaning stoves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">A: Two days later I pass by, I am invited back to General Wood’s office, he says, I just got a clearance from the C.I.C. Bamberg.</span> <span id="s2962">A guy by the name of Brown, he says.</span> <span id="s2963">Not his real name.</span> <span id="s2964">I said, I know.</span> <span id="s2965">He said I should give you any job.</span> <span id="s2966">He said Lallier can handle any job, you can trust him.</span> <span id="s2967">Right?</span> <span id="s2968">So he gave me a job, two weeks as a volunteer without pay to clean up all their backward records on all immigrants through the Vienna refugee center for the past two years.</span> <span id="s2969">And he said, unless you can do it in two weeks, I won’t take you.</span> <span id="s2970">I can tell you one thing, in my life, it was not only the Jewish dimension, because by that time I had talked to [indecipherable] cause I was hanging around waiting for the job, th-the ones with the beards, ones with the smile, ones who pretended they were -- had been jewelers in Budapest, most of them Hungarians, because they were escaping en masse.</span> <span id="s2971">And so I had heard of the fortunes and misfortunes and I decided Lallier, God has sent you, God.</span> <span id="s2972">There were times and still are believes -- [indecipherable] in which I believe God is, period.</span> <span id="s2973">Okay?</span> <span id="s2974">God wants me here.</span> <span id="s2975">So I worked for two weeks without sleeping an hour and got himself a filing system from the AA to the ZZ in all countries, including the American emigration part, not just the Canadian part.</span> <span id="s2976">Oh, he was so impressed, he said, I’ll give you a back pay for two weeks in Austrian shillings.</span> <span id="s2977">I think he gave me a thousand shillings for two weeks.</span> <span id="s2978">And he says, I appoint you as of immediately, chief of the Canadian desk.</span> <span id="s2979">And I never asked him, as a Canadian should, what business have you as an American to appoint me to the Canadian desk?</span> <span id="s2980">I was so happy.</span> <span id="s2981">I had my own second, even brought her a picture, I think, Mrs. -- Madame Friedman, oh, if I had -- hadn’t met my wife, Madame Friedman would have been a great substitute.</span> <span id="s2982">Never had anything with her, though, she was young married too.</span> <span id="s2983">Anyway, so I got my secretary and in no time I was wielding all my languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">Q: And you were in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2985">A: Taking on the refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">Q: -- an-and you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">A: And I was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: So you were working in the international refugee work commission?</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: -- I got the job from 19 -- I think October 1950, or July -- August 1950 to Septem -- to October 1951, in charge of the Canada desk, fully authorized to interview candidates, report to Mr. Delong for a second confirmation of acceptance and then proceed on my own to bring the refugees to Salzburg, being the Canadian desk, to present them to the Canadian consul generals, and there were two consul general.</span> <span id="s2990">They were a St. Laurent, who happened to be a then nephew of Canada’s Prime Minister then, and a Mr. Klassen from Toronto.</span> <span id="s2991">And upon my first presentation of my first case, who happened to have been Jewish, we took a liking to each other, because I was well staged, I had the documentation and I wanted these poor refugees to come to Canada, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">Q: I’m going to have to stop you, however.</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">A: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">Q: Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">A: Again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">A: Gee, it goes fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">Q: Every -- it goes very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">End of Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">Beginning Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3001">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">A: General Wood also told me -- I had my report from C.I.C. Bamberg, from Mr. -- from Mr. Brown, concluding --</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">Q: Where is -- where is C.I.C. --</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">A: C.I. -- no, no, General Wood told me, upon giving me the job --</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">Q: I understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">A: -- that he had received the report from Mr. Brown.</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">Q: Yes, and where is Mr. Brown?</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">A: In Bamberg.</span> <span id="s3009">He was the C.I.C --</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">Q: Bombeck?</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">A: Bamberg, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">Q: Bamberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">A: That is B-a-m-b-e-r-g.</span></p> <p><span id="s3014">Q: Ah, okay.</span> <span id="s3015">Bamberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s3016">A: To whom I had to report for reeducation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">A: And he said under all I am pleased, and I know that your statement about the killing was passed onto higher authorities, leave it in our hands.</span> <span id="s3019">But to you it is now to prove that you can do the job, because we’re so behind that we desperately need a guy with your languages, but it’s to you -- for you to prove that you can do it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3020">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">A: -- and that you deserve my trust.</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">A: I think that is the first time in my life, in my then life that anyone looked at me, man or female, male or female, eyeball to eyeball, believing that I could do things right.</span> <span id="s3024">And you don’t know the feeling of liberation.</span> <span id="s3025">Through General Wood, I just absolutely loved America.</span> <span id="s3026">Absolutely loved America --</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">A: -- because at that time that I first asked myself, why did I have to have this terrible episode on the side of the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">A: Cause it makes no sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s3031">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">A: Intelligent design.</span> <span id="s3033">It certainly doesn’t seem to have been, does it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3034">Q: Been very intelligent.</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">A: I lost my brother -- I lost my brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3037">A: -- don’t forget.</span> <span id="s3038">I haven’t even mentioned that yet.</span> <span id="s3039">Anyway, so I worked my head off the first presentation went very well.</span> <span id="s3040">I -- I had an Austrian identity card, so I had no problem crossing the Soviet demarcation line, which was very, very, very tough, and often had to ferry the refugees illegally, giving them false identification papers.</span> <span id="s3041">Most of them turned out to be Hungarian Jewish.</span> <span id="s3042">Some je -- Czech Jewish, a very few Yugoslav Jewish.</span> <span id="s3043">I [indecipherable] about 300 of them.</span> <span id="s3044">And often the Jewish people were, as you would expect, jewelers, merchants, silk producers, merchant general, one banker.</span> <span id="s3045">None of them agriculture, none of the textile laborers, but owners of textile mills.</span></p> <p><span id="s3046">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3047">A: Canada at that time needed cheap labor.</span> <span id="s3048">They needed shoe workers, textile workers, so there I went --</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">Q: Changing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3050">A: -- looking at their documents --</span></p> <p><span id="s3051">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3052">A: -- and, textile worker, shoe worker, woodworker, ba -- anything you say, I would put in.</span> <span id="s3053">Some of them looked so brilliantly, other than workers, but the consul general were just happy to have -- because Canada suddenly was losing, as they did United States, their restrictive policies as [indecipherable] Jewish people.</span> <span id="s3054">Unfortunately at the same time, and it is not very well known, they were also lifting the total restrictions on members, former members of the German armed forces, including the Waffen SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">Q: The Canadians were.</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">A: Canadians and the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">A: Into Canada alone, more than 2500 former Waffen SS members of the Ukrainian division were transported over by special agreement with the Brits, who had captured them and kept in Britain, not knowing what to do with them because the Soviets had shot everybody else upon being returned, you see, so with special agreement, Jewish people were being let in, but the Nazis were also being let in, or the presumed Nazis, right?</span> <span id="s3059">Including some of whom, from the real eastern Europe, who had turned out to have been members without saying so, right, of some concentration camp and Einsatz commandos, right?</span> <span id="s3060">So I’m looking at that parallel, wondering about the Canadian approaches between 1947 and 1949.</span> <span id="s3061">Was it just to get as many bodies as possible to replace the lost bodies during the war, right?</span> <span id="s3062">And kind of wanting to be equal.</span> <span id="s3063">So many Jewish people, so many non-Jew, I don’t know, but the fact is that I did tell the Canadian consuls upon several visits who I was because they had to look at my background to find me trustworthy, right?</span> <span id="s3064">They knew about the incident about the killing and they thought I was okay, I was doing a good job and eventually they told me, quite soon, Lallier, you too will have to come to Canada, we need guys like you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">A: Your wife is -- you’re married -- you’re already -- your wife is pregnant.</span> <span id="s3067">So we look at the past, we know you have committed nothing wrong.</span> <span id="s3068">Come on over as soon as you can.</span> <span id="s3069">And the [indecipherable] to Vienna was being abolished at the end of 1951, so I decided in October 1951 to come over here after getting the -- I had my big row with my father about that, right?</span> <span id="s3070">He didn't want me to go.</span> <span id="s3071">So I went anyway.</span> <span id="s3072">So I came over on the second of October 1951, after having falsified or not falsified -- hundreds of doc -- immigration documents, and brought personally quite a few of them across the Soviet demarcation line, often at the threat of being captured by the Soviets.</span> <span id="s3073">But I knew my way around the bridge baca -- you know, the Linz bridge was the key thing.</span> <span id="s3074">You could only ferret people over without proper identification during the lunch hour, because on the east side of Linz was a big steel factory which the cho -- Soviets had reopened right?</span> <span id="s3075">And during the lunch hour, because feeding was poor on the east Soviet side, thousands of workers crossed the bridge and went to the western side where the food was much better, American zone.</span> <span id="s3076">So it is there that I ferreted out many, including Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Goldsmith, who had been a very preeminent jeweler in -- in Budapest and who eventually got to Montreal and opened up the -- the coffee shop, which had become very famous as a little coffee shop, on Drummond Street.</span> <span id="s3077">Anyway, so they wanted me and the Americans, in the meantime, didn’t let me loose.</span> <span id="s3078">The general said, Mr. Lallier, I understand you also work under special conditions and special cases.</span> <span id="s3079">I says, well what do you have to offer?</span> <span id="s3080">By that time I had my baby, you see, my daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">A: And he says, well, there is a guy in Czechoslovakia by the name of Ruberchinsky.</span> <span id="s3083">He is a chief expert on tensile wires.</span> <span id="s3084">I had no idea what tensile wires were.</span> <span id="s3085">Now I know.</span> <span id="s3086">Those are wires, stretched wires that use as guidelines for precision shooting long distance cannons.</span> <span id="s3087">The Americans has no experts like that.</span> <span id="s3088">Ruberchinsky they -- absolutely they needed to get away from these Sovietized Czechs, who wanted absolutely to keep him there for the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s3089">He says, if you ferret Ruberchinsky t -- out to the west and into our safe hands, to the ameri -- American zone in Vienna, I guarantee you an immigration visa for the United States as a refugee.</span> <span id="s3090">And boy was that ever a challenge.</span> <span id="s3091">I knew the boundary area, I knew some peasants.</span> <span id="s3092">Peasants are good to know.</span> <span id="s3093">I know that from my boy -- life as a child, you see.</span> <span id="s3094">And I knew -- had some contacts on the Czech side of the boundary.</span> <span id="s3095">By that time it had become communist, you see, this was, my God, early 1951, and they needed Ruberchinsky and I got Ruberchinsky through contacts and I arranged Ruberchinsky to be brought by lorry and then by oxcart to the boundary and then [indecipherable] I crossed the boundary into a quick Austrian ready available cab.</span> <span id="s3096">We went to Vienna, I deposited him in the office of General Wood and he almost fell over.</span> <span id="s3097">And I had for -- had phoned the Canadian consulate and said, I have a guy here from the Czech Republic -- from Czechoslovakia who is a tensile experts, wouldn’t Canada use them?</span> <span id="s3098">And they said, we want them.</span> <span id="s3099">So there was a tug of war between --</span></p> <p><span id="s3100">Q: Between the two.</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">A: -- the American and the -- and the American offered him a huge factory, right, already made, right to take over.</span> <span id="s3102">And then I asked -- so Ruberchinsky got his American visa in no time, and General Wood looked at me and said, you know, Lallier, I know about your past, but you really, really have done a good job of getting yourself reeducated, right?</span> <span id="s3103">You know, I’m really happy about that.</span> <span id="s3104">I’m really happy about that.</span> <span id="s3105">Anyway, so Ruberchinsky went to the United States and I decided I would come to Canada because -- I’ll be honest about that, some of the American presence had become so militaristic that I got to be concerned a bit about the message of true democracy on the one hand, which I lovingly embraced, and the military regime perpetuating itself because of the feeling of universal power.</span> <span id="s3106">And having experienced the German attempt to universal military power, I decided I’d had enough of that.</span> <span id="s3107">No more C.I.C..</span> <span id="s3108">I had a couple of minor jobs, one of them included somebody else that I had been able to bring through the Soviet zone in Vienna across the -- you know Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s3109">Q: A little.</span></p> <p><span id="s3110">A: Th-The Danube -- the Danube canal is in the middle of the tho -- town --</span></p> <p><span id="s3111">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3112">A: -- the nine district, right?</span> <span id="s3113">And I had brought him to the demarcation line and the Soviets had somehow g-gotten hold of that, and the Americans were waiting on this side, so I was able with the American to pull the co guy, with the last bit of our strength across the demarcation line to save him from the west and he was almost -- he almost died with fright because the Soviets were hanging onto his legs on the other side.</span> <span id="s3114">So then I decided I’d had enough.</span> <span id="s3115">My wife says, look, I want peace and quiet; my daughter had been born.</span> <span id="s3116">So I came to Canada and -- wanting to study.</span> <span id="s3117">My credentials were good, my English was much better, my French was okay for Quebec, even though Quebec’s accent is different from the French [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3118">And I was a Protestant, so in Quebec I found that Protestants were not really welcome, so I kind of deemphasized that.</span> <span id="s3119">There was no immigration of French Protestants into Quebec from 1529 to 1929, can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s3120">That’s another thing that I didn’t know about.</span> <span id="s3121">Anyway, so I found meni -- menial jobs.</span> <span id="s3122">I worked in a color dye factory, I worked in a -- in the gold mine.</span> <span id="s3123">I worked as a shoe cleaner, I worked in a -- as a vacuum cleaner salesman.</span> <span id="s3124">And I worked as a car washer.</span> <span id="s3125">And let’s see, I worked one more dirty job, in a barrel factory, I was a hole puncher.</span> <span id="s3126">Concerned, cause I had learned a bit about democracy.</span> <span id="s3127">I had been told about Jefferson.</span> <span id="s3128">I had been told about the Constitution.</span> <span id="s3129">I had been told about the duality of Canada, and my mind was so empty.</span> <span id="s3130">I had known nothing about the systems.</span> <span id="s3131">That kind of pleased my soul.</span> <span id="s3132">And I was married, I had responsibility for the family.</span> <span id="s3133">My wife was a haute couturiere, she had no problem finding a job.</span> <span id="s3134">So I decided I would work with Steinbergs as a store manager for awhile to get money and go back to school.</span> <span id="s3135">I went to the French university for admission, speaking in European French and having to answer -- one of the first questions was what religion are you?</span> <span id="s3136">You are from Europe.</span> <span id="s3137">I said well, look, I’m of [indecipherable] origin.</span> <span id="s3138">He said Protestants study at McGill.</span> <span id="s3139">We cannot accept Protestants.</span> <span id="s3140">And that was that.</span> <span id="s3141">So my desire to match my heart with some of the French blood rest -- remaining in it, with the French heart of Canadian, didn’t work.</span> <span id="s3142">I went to McGill speaking colloquial English.</span> <span id="s3143">Good for selling vacuum cleaners, but not good for studying Burke and Hume and Locke.</span> <span id="s3144">And looked at the guy -- who looked Jewish, you know guys who look Jewish, who happen to be Jewish, right?</span> <span id="s3145">You see it on their eyes.</span> <span id="s3146">I said -- Solean was his name, Dean Solean, the first Jewish administrator at McGill in 1954.</span> <span id="s3147">Okay, big, big difference.</span> <span id="s3148">There had been no Jewish administrators before then, so McGill was kind of opening up.</span> <span id="s3149">I said please, Austria born, speaking all kinds of languages, working for [indecipherable] America, please, I want to finish college.</span> <span id="s3150">What certification do you have?</span> <span id="s3151">Well, I ha -- in Vienna I studied two years at the university -- and that’s very impressive.</span> <span id="s3152">It’s like three years over here.</span> <span id="s3153">So he looked at that, he says, look Lallier, I will accept you for a B.A. in economics and political science, and I’ll put you into honors economics.</span> <span id="s3154">Oh, I felt so pleased.</span> <span id="s3155">You know what honors economics is?</span> <span id="s3156">It’s a special degree, undergrad, leading you direct into graduate school.</span> <span id="s3157">I phoned my wife and said, oh my dear, I haven’t even started, but already I have honors.</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">A: So I said yes, honors, oh wow.</span> <span id="s3160">He says, but you first must spend another year learning English, because if I take you right now you’ll fail, and I don’t want you to fail, I see that you don’t want to fail.</span> <span id="s3161">So I ya -- I said, so what do I do?</span> <span id="s3162">And there was something that I will never forget.</span> <span id="s3163">Dean Solean looks at me, jee -- Jewish Canadian, free to have the first dean job at McGill, in a society in which the Jewish people were not easily accepted.</span> <span id="s3164">Tells me, you know, Mr. Lallier, Canada’s a great, free country.</span> <span id="s3165">Do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s3166">But come back the first of September 1954, I’ll take you.</span> <span id="s3167">And I said, great, free country.</span> <span id="s3168">Nobody ever in my life had told me it’s a great free country, you’re free to what to do.</span> <span id="s3169">My conversion to democracy and human freedom and individual freedom started blooming, but deep inside, the shame of what I had witnessed never died.</span> <span id="s3170">So I went to McGill [indecipherable] learning English day and night, I was working 70 words a day, and with that good mind of mine it’s working well, even s-started to write in, the [indecipherable] professor was very, very, very protective of me and encouraging.</span> <span id="s3171">And I landed with a very high quality B honors economics, political science.</span> <span id="s3172">Wrote out a few letters of reco -- of application.</span> <span id="s3173">Lo and behold Columbia took me without restrictions, but with the restriction to study in the Russian Institute.</span> <span id="s3174">Why?</span> <span id="s3175">Lallier, we know that you know languages, we badly need you for your east European languages to be trained as a specialist in Soviet affairs, but you have to learn Russian.</span> <span id="s3176">And I had a Russian teacher at Columbia who was a young lady refugee from Leningrad.</span> <span id="s3177">I don’t know how she made it, oh she was so beautiful, I was studying Russian day and night, including some coffee sessions with the young lady, right, I remember that.</span> <span id="s3178">And I felt I was really taking to Russian, everybody was pleased.</span> <span id="s3179">So I got my Master’s degree in economics in one year, which was unusual.</span> <span id="s3180">I had my Russian [indecipherable] certificate in one additional year, which is unusual.</span> <span id="s3181">And I was fully qualified for my Ph.D. in economics.</span> <span id="s3182">All of that in two years.</span> <span id="s3183">And then I got tired.</span> <span id="s3184">The United States got the war in the Vietnam.</span> <span id="s3185">I was suffering under this blatant expression of militarism under false philosophic and moral premises of [indecipherable] theory and all of that stuff, and I’d become a person who had highly admired Jefferson, on the one hand, in spite of his dubious background lately, right, but also Locke.</span> <span id="s3186">I’m a [indecipherable] by conviction.</span> <span id="s3187">And I decided I would come back to Canada, take up a teaching post, fini -- post, fish -- finish my doctorate somewhere along the line, but prefer a country of peace.</span> <span id="s3188">Even though the country was supplying all the napalm the -- America needed to bomb the hell out of Vietnam.</span> <span id="s3189">So I came back home, came across some of my refugees that I brought here, including the guy who had opened the coffee shop, who gave me a permanent table like in Vienna.</span> <span id="s3190">Adalbert, whenever you come -- in Hungarian -- this is your table, I give you my personal services.</span> <span id="s3191">And he was very grateful.</span> <span id="s3192">And some others I kept contact with, who was very grateful, and I had no problem getting my citizenship, even being invited to speak at a citizenship ceremony in both languages -- both official languages, no Austrian any more, did that.</span> <span id="s3193">Recognizing the French Canadian identity, but also the need of English Canada to remain strong and united, so they liked that.</span> <span id="s3194">So that was 1957.</span> <span id="s3195">I went to the United States, lived in New York for three years, 1960 to 1963.</span> <span id="s3196">Had a very good time on Broadway, working part time in a -- in a p -- in a -- in a chicken and sparerib store, a Jewish store on Broadway just off Columbia in which the owner told me, when you sell expensive cheeses, always leave your thumb on the scale.</span> <span id="s3197">And I told him, I can’t do that.</span> <span id="s3198">He says, if you want the job you’d better do that, but also got a ska -- part-time ta -- I was very good at Columbia, actually, had an A average, at the graduate level.</span> <span id="s3199">And the professor that chaired then said lall -- Lallier, you’re really a very smart kid, he said, even though you’re a bit older than the average kid, he says, I recommend you for a teaching job at Brooklyn College.</span> <span id="s3200">So he got me a Brooklyn summer job [indecipherable] college, 1962 in the summer -- 1961 in the summer.</span> <span id="s3201">And he said, I prefer you to stay in the United States and you don’t need to have your doctorate in economics because with your advanced degrees, graduate degrees in international politics, I want you to work for the Rand Corporation.</span> <span id="s3202">And the Rand Corporation is the air force’s secret service, I wa -- didn't want that.</span> <span id="s3203">And I hope, I beg you to understand why I made up my mind that I would not continue living in the States.</span> <span id="s3204">I love America for its ideals, for its honesty, for the greatest of, especially President Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s3205">Not so much the subsequent ones.</span> <span id="s3206">And for the liberating me, for a chance to develop my mind.</span> <span id="s3207">But I prefer maybe being a small country member, because small countries can always prevent themselves from stepping under the toes.</span> <span id="s3208">Big countries, by their size alone, cannot do that.</span> <span id="s3209">I’m a friend of the United States, I am very highly respective of you for giving me the honor of having this discussion and making my confession once again, hoping to convince you that when I applied that job -- for that job in General Woods’s office, God had given me a mandate, and I’m very serious about that, to try to undo, not so much my feelings of guilt, cause you can’t do feelings of unguilt if you cannot prevent the killing of innocent people, but trying to do my best to ease the suffering of many of the Jewish refugees, especially those from Hungary and the Czechia -- and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s3210">And I think I have been able to follow through on my mandate in doing that, and thereby easing my pangs of conscience, hoping that eventually the maker, in the Christian tradition St. Peter, will look at me and say, oh Adalbert you old rascal, you didn’t do anything, did you?</span> <span id="s3211">But you at least tried to redeem yourself and to help a people badly needed help [indecipherable] crucial time.</span> <span id="s3212">It wasn’t thousands of them, it was maybe just a couple of hundred.</span> <span id="s3213">And the couple of hundred have had children, some of them I know even eight to 10 children.</span> <span id="s3214">And it seems that they have forgiven me for doing nothing, even Rabbi Poupko.</span> <span id="s3215">My conscience is still not pleased, because when you have to be a man, you have to be a man, even though it costs your life.</span> <span id="s3216">I’ve had moment -- in English you have the statement, if a man is a chicken, he is not a man.</span> <span id="s3217">At that moment I was a chicken.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">Q: What do --</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">A: I’m still -- I’m still ashamed of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">Q: What do you think you could have done?</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s3222">Q: What could you have done?</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">A: I don’t reflect about that, it’s a matter of just sentimentality.</span> <span id="s3224">The Rabbi Poupko tells me, if you had decided to talk, you wouldn’t be here witness to a crime, and a criminal would remain unpunished, and maybe a whole system would therefore remain unpunished.</span> <span id="s3225">So in a certain sense, he’d say, Lallier, be practical about thing.</span> <span id="s3226">You may have decided not to talk because you knew you had a higher purpose than that.</span> <span id="s3227">You had to become a witness to something awful that had happened, and that was what your life was about.</span> <span id="s3228">But even though it intellectually sounds -- sounds very satisfying, to stand there and to look at the man killing, right in front of my face, seven innocent people one at a time, it’s a horrendous experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s3229">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">A: It makes you lose your belief in God -- believe in God, because God would never allow a thing like that to happen.</span> <span id="s3231">And it makes you lose your belief in basic simple human dignity.</span></p> <p><span id="s3232">Q: Is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3233">A: Now, the happy thing about that is maybe the -- not happy, the positive about that is I didn’t know those seven people.</span> <span id="s3234">I know they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s3235">But if I had been able to discover who they were, in the eyes of some, their names alone would recreate them as human beings who had been there with a purpose, who had never fulfilled a purpose.</span> <span id="s3236">Because if you say -- there’s a big difference between seven de -- and not the seven dead Jews, and saying Mr. Cour and Mr. Steinberg and Mr. Sweinberg and Mr. That or Mr. This and That.</span> <span id="s3237">They are human beings in their identities as they were.</span> <span id="s3238">Their lives are recreated.</span> <span id="s3239">One can even proceed and find out who they were, what they had done, what they had achieved for the good or the bad.</span> <span id="s3240">And if they had had relatives or not [indecipherable] or not.</span> <span id="s3241">And lo and behold, after the trial, two persons came forth, one claiming to be the granddaughter of the grandfather which she hadn’t known what had happened to except that he had died somewhere in the -- in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s3242">Q: How did -- how did you find out what the names of those seven people were?</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">A: Oh, through -- through the documentary.</span> <span id="s3244">Oh no, that I found out going myself and my -- I was sent as a Canadian delegate to the Czech Republic as a expert in financial -- international finance to Prague through Casel, which is an arm of the Canadian development -- international development agencies, to help some of the Czech bankers democratize their procedures and bring them up to par in terms of capitalistic banking practices.</span> <span id="s3245">I spent six weeks in Prague consulting with two very senior bankers, both of whom by -- were, by the way, communist party members, but who had mellowed down to capitalistic practices and wanting to learn about them.</span> <span id="s3246">So I was teaching them how a Canadian banker practices, and I spent six weeks there, and on the second week I le -- decided I’d go back to Leitmeritz, I’d go back to Theresienstadt for the second time to fact find and to reminisce.</span> <span id="s3247">And I went back and I found the site.</span> <span id="s3248">I found the masses of graves and gravestones and all that.</span> <span id="s3249">And that’s when I decided I would not continue living with myself with that feeling of shame unless I finally spoke up and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">Q: And that’s what made you speak up?</span></p> <p><span id="s3251">A: -- made my confession.</span> <span id="s3252">And I came back from Prague in August 1997, and in December, on December first, I arranged with Rambam and with a friend lawyer of mine who happens to be Hungarian Jewish, who cord -- who had known me for many years and with Rabbi Poupko to make my of-official confession about what had happened.</span> <span id="s3253">And the rest follows all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">Q: I read a report, but I had no idea whether it’s true, that you spoke to a former Waffen SS person, to ask about --</span></p> <p><span id="s3255">A: Oh yes, oh yes, no, no.</span> <span id="s3256">I had written -- no, no, that was after that, because once you have come out into the open, there are certain repercussions, but also legal requisites, namely, I had to make up my mind, do I sue, or do I not sue.</span> <span id="s3257">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3258">Q: No, I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s3259">A: Or do I [indecipherable] the Germans to sue.</span></p> <p><span id="s3260">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">A: Right?</span> <span id="s3262">But to sue is a procedure going through, at the first stage, the consul general of Germany, of the modern, democratic, decent Germany, and go for two or three interviews so they can squeeze me, if it’s veracity or not, or if I’m lying --</span></p> <p><span id="s3263">Q: No, no, I was a -- I was asking -- what I read was that you asked a former Waffen SS person --</span></p> <p><span id="s3264">A: No, no -- yeah, th -- but I’ll come to that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3265">Q: -- permission -- ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3266">A: -- no, no, no, but I’ll -- I-I’ll -- I’ll come to that.</span> <span id="s3267">Not for permission, misinterpretation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3268">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3269">A: But -- but in following through the legal preparation, legal proceedings as to how to go about, officially I had to find out from the senior, still living, the Waffen SS highest commander, what his post-war view were, namely, when I wrote -- I think it was 1998, okay, about a killing of this sort.</span> <span id="s3270">So on the one hand I wanted to feel him out.</span> <span id="s3271">On the other hand I wanted to play this -- this red herring of military hierarchy and the level of responsibility.</span> <span id="s3272">So I wrote him a personal letter, he was General Kumm, he was the second [indecipherable] general of my division, but it took him away from [indecipherable] and he wasn’t hanged because of that.</span> <span id="s3273">The seven other commanders were all hanged by the Titoists, and I think justifiably so, including a German Field Marshall.</span> <span id="s3274">So I wrote to Kumm and surprisingly got an answer.</span> <span id="s3275">I said, I have to account for you as the highest remaining Waffen SS ranking officer -- he was a brigadier, at the brigadier level, to account for you for the deed by Julius Viel then and then, involving seven Jews that they killed in the Panzergraben.</span> <span id="s3276">And -- not for permission, okay, I want you to tell me if, from what you know about military discipline and military command structures if this can be looked at as a war crime.</span> <span id="s3277">He wrote me a letter, personal letter, signing it.</span> <span id="s3278">I have original letter in his own handwriting, from a Waffen SS brigadier who has since died about two years ago at the age of 92.</span> <span id="s3279">He says, Dr. Lallier, because I put in my full credential to make it [indecipherable], he said, Dr. Lallier, I am reporting received of your letter, your inquiry, and all that I can say is that in my view -- I’m translating now from the German -- in my view, any Waffen SS man or Waffen SS officer who commits a war crime ceases being member of the Waffen SS.</span> <span id="s3280">Which means to say, he says, that friendship ends amongst Waffen SS officers, where war crimes are committed.</span></p> <p><span id="s3281">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3282">A: Now, an interesting statement, because he himself was commander of the division in which many what we call today war crimes had been committed.</span></p> <p><span id="s3283">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3284">A: Now, had he learned anything in his long [indecipherable] life in which the Americans never touched him, he never was in prison, because he was Germany’s major s -- expert in partisan warfare, which the Americans were trying to learn about as much as we can, as we well know, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3285">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3286">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s3287">Now -- or, did he have any other intentions like finding a cheap way of apologizing?</span> <span id="s3288">But he in fact told me, you go ahead, because a war crime is a war crime, you have my blessing.</span> <span id="s3289">I didn’t need his blessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3290">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3291">A: But I needed him to reveal himself.</span> <span id="s3292">And you know, given the command structure, once a brigadier tells me it’s a war crime, the ones below him cannot say it’s not a war crime.</span> <span id="s3293">There is a trouble with that.</span> <span id="s3294">Everybody below him who were at court --</span></p> <p><span id="s3295">Q: Said it was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3296">A: -- told me I was lying.</span></p> <p><span id="s3297">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3298">Stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3299">End of Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3300">Beginning Tape 10</span></p> <p><span id="s3301">Q: When you decided to sue this man --</span></p> <p><span id="s3302">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3303">[indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3304">Q: -- right, so Viel could go -- is it Feel, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3305">A: Viel.</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">Q: Viel.</span></p> <p><span id="s3307">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3308">The Germans use that V as a ff --</span></p> <p><span id="s3309">Q: As a ff.</span></p> <p><span id="s3310">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3311">Q: Is that the first time your family found out about that you had been in these kinds of situations?</span></p> <p><span id="s3312">A: Ah, I had -- well, my -- I had really no family.</span> <span id="s3313">My family was my wife --</span></p> <p><span id="s3314">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3315">And your two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3316">A: And my fi -- my wife had already di -- died.</span></p> <p><span id="s3317">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3318">A: She died in 1975 with a brain tumor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">Q: And had you said anything to her about --</span></p> <p><span id="s3320">A: I never discussed my wife -- with my wife my military --</span></p> <p><span id="s3321">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3322">A: -- experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s3323">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3324">A: Because our love was a pure love and I -- I don’t want to -- she knew that I had been in the Prinz Eugen, but she also knew herself, being half Volksdeutsche that conditions was that -- th-those of ca -- total, total oppression and total one handedness on the part of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s3325">Q: And was she Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s3326">A: She was happy, she loved me for being able to get away with my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3327">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">A: And you know, she is also -- I remember -- you remember I told you I was try -- I was raised in a cir -- circumstances of giving true ladyship ultimate consideration as a person, as a civilian, as a civil gentleman, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3329">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3330">A: And I’ve been able to convince her she -- that she was the greatest lady in my life.</span> <span id="s3331">And I think really very happily with that concept.</span> <span id="s3332">In return, she gave me love and the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3333">Q: And sh -- you had two children with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3334">A: You see [indecipherable] but my children are ya -- my children know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3335">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3336">But they fa --</span></p> <p><span id="s3337">A: My son I told, but he is 10 years younger than my daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3338">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3339">A: But my daughter I didn’t tell about because she had had some upheavals in her life, I didn't want to burden her with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3340">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3341">A: But after I came out with the confession, she came and said, Dad, you were absolutely right, I am completely on your side.</span></p> <p><span id="s3342">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s3343">Why do you call it a confession, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s3344">A: Because, as a Christian --</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">Q: Since it isn’t your act.</span></p> <p><span id="s3346">A: -- as a Christian, to feel in a situation which you desperately need to talk to somebody who will listen to you with feeling and with anticipation of being able to do something for you, you empty your soul.</span> <span id="s3347">You empty your soul to get rid of the feeling of the sin that you had committed.</span> <span id="s3348">And it is only upon m-matching the minds, he, the confessor, believe that you are honest.</span> <span id="s3349">You, the confessee are giving an honest information.</span> <span id="s3350">There’s a higher level of togetherness in which the forgiveness is given by the authority who is raised in the culture, then educated to understand and to give you forgiveness.</span> <span id="s3351">I’m not a Catholic, I wouldn't believe in having to go to church to confess my little [indecipherable] that and the priest would tell me -- tell me all about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3353">A: You see, I’m not that, but I did go to [indecipherable] who was -- who was a Pryor of the Benedictines, which had been my school and ho-hoping for understanding, but his answer was -- and when I told him about the crime, he says, Adalbert, you have got to build your postwar life.</span> <span id="s3354">What has happened had happened, he says, you cannot change that, it’s in God’s hands.</span> <span id="s3355">Now this is not an answer that I would consider satisfactory, right?</span> <span id="s3356">But at the same time the urge to go to somebody who is a potentate, I use the term potentate.</span> <span id="s3357">What is a potentate?</span> <span id="s3358">Kind of somebody assigned by God to fill in the particular command position where human needs are looked at and decided positively creative.</span></p> <p><span id="s3359">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">A: I wanted to empty my soul for somebody to say, Lallier, we recognize your agony.</span> <span id="s3361">We cannot forgive you, we are not God, but we’ll pass on the message that on the whole you have tried to be -- to be -- to become and remain a good guy.</span> <span id="s3362">Confession.</span> <span id="s3363">I want to die, I’m 83 years old almost, with somebody coming to my coffin and say, at least you gave me that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s3364">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3365">A: Simple as that.</span> <span id="s3366">And I-I -- I have living witnesses [indecipherable] the kids, Evan and Frederick, I’m trying to keep the candles lit.</span> <span id="s3367">The Jewish people are special people.</span> <span id="s3368">They suffered a great deal at the hands of the Catholics, it wasn’t right, all of it under the false premises that Jesus had been killed.</span> <span id="s3369">I asked myself often that, did Jesus deserve being declared a God?</span> <span id="s3370">I prefer the Jewish version, he was one of the prophets whose image as somebody, changed unto a godlike image, for whatever extra powers that might involve or imply.</span> <span id="s3371">So that’s not in the right way, I don’t even know if Jesus would have wanted to be declared a God.</span> <span id="s3372">So I’m much closer to the Jewish interpretation of God, it’s the one thing that I have problems with, the notion the Jewish God is kind of desperately absolutist.</span> <span id="s3373">Like we can bargain for everything, but God is the absolute command, we’d never even dare contemplate to make a counter-proposal.</span> <span id="s3374">God to me is somebody I can talk to, God is somebody will -- who will understand because God by nature is good.</span> <span id="s3375">God is not a command person.</span> <span id="s3376">God is a guide.</span> <span id="s3377">And God created Eve and Adam, I don’t know in which sequence, was it a guide who would eventually --</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3379">A: -- knowingly put their hands together?</span></p> <p><span id="s3380">Q: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3381">There are two stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s3382">A: He may have been jealous of Adam, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3383">Q: You know, when you talk about confession, it -- it’s -- it’s interesting to me because you didn’t -- I don’t know whether you’ve f -- th -- whether your -- I don’t know exactly what your guilt feelings are, maybe you don’t either.</span> <span id="s3384">In some ways you feel guilty because you feel you were a coward, you didn’t do something.</span> <span id="s3385">But you also didn’t do something against somebody.</span> <span id="s3386">I mean, you didn't kill -- you didn’t kill these Jews.</span> <span id="s3387">But it also feels as if your feeling of guilt spans larger than that one incident --</span></p> <p><span id="s3388">A: Oh, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s3389">Q: -- that’s it’s m -- that it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3390">A: -- no, th-th-th-th - it -- clearly, the one incident is the sample, which demonstrates to you that the incident itself took place in a context in which the broader reality --</span></p> <p><span id="s3391">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3392">A: -- reconfirmed the evilness of that reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s3393">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3394">A: It’s the one particular example of an evil empire that I was part of.</span> <span id="s3395">I don’t know why, but I was part of that.</span> <span id="s3396">And the -- the feeling of guilt was, in a certain sense, arose from the feeling of impotence -- after impo --- feeling la -- impo -- I’d so desperately want to do something, but I’m unable to do anything because I’m totally petrified in my state.</span> <span id="s3397">Now, what do you do with that?</span> <span id="s3398">You just swallow hard, just swallow hard and by swallowing hard you get to believe that if you had done something, they may not have gotten killed.</span> <span id="s3399">And Rabbi Poupko, I told you Rabbi Poupko exactly, Rabbi said Lallier, that doesn’t follow, if you had done something they may not have killed.</span> <span id="s3400">Because if you had done something about the first one getting killed, they’d kil -- they’d have killed you and the other six anyway.</span> <span id="s3401">But I cannot accept that because again, th-th-the harder view, a man being a man, in a context of a civil society in which killing is murder.</span> <span id="s3402">And racially induced killing is the ultimate crime, let’s say.</span> <span id="s3403">Extermination of a whole people.</span> <span id="s3404">What does a man do with that?</span> <span id="s3405">Do I grab the gun?</span> <span id="s3406">I didn’t grab the gun.</span> <span id="s3407">And I watched the other six.</span> <span id="s3408">So, by doing nothing, Viel was able to do whatever he had wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s3409">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3410">A: And that’s where the pain is.</span></p> <p><span id="s3411">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3412">A: That’s where the pain is.</span> <span id="s3413">And that’s where the confession comes from.</span></p> <p><span id="s3414">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3415">Are you angry at people at Concordance College for not --</span></p> <p><span id="s3416">A: Oh, Concordia, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s3417">Q: From Con-Concordia, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s3418">A: I’ve become -- you’re looking at me, I’ve tried to be a man of peace, using a Locke high discourse.</span></p> <p><span id="s3419">Q: Whose discourse?</span></p> <p><span id="s3420">A: Locke.</span></p> <p><span id="s3421">Q: Locke’s discourse?</span></p> <p><span id="s3422">A: Locke high discourse.</span></p> <p><span id="s3423">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3424">A: And his proposition that even in most difficult circumstances, negotiation is far preferred to shedding the red blood of the opponent.</span> <span id="s3425">I believe that since we all are red blooded, we have no reason to say she is Jewish, she is Muslim, she is Christian, she is this, she is that, cause we are all red blooded people, which may be where the problem is, right?</span> <span id="s3426">And I’ve convinced myself being red blooded means eventually we’ll recognize that shedding our red blood reciprocally is making no sense whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3427">Q: But when I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3428">A: It’s the same blood.</span> <span id="s3429">I shed your blood, I’m also shedding my blood at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3430">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3431">A: So negotiation is much better, but negotiation means trust and confidence and the time to achieve, hopefully, a positive end.</span> <span id="s3432">You see?</span> <span id="s3433">See [indecipherable] I’m a realist, I will die having my positive belief that the recognition -- that we all have the same -- we all share in the same red blood, will put an end to the killing because it [indecipherable] recognize since is our blood as well as yours, shedding it is not just sinful, it makes absolutely no sense, solves no problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s3434">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3435">But what I mean is is there seem to be some people at Concordia who don’t -- who don’t believe --</span></p> <p><span id="s3436">A: Well, there are five guys -- five guys, who including MacIntosh for some reason didn’t like me, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3437">You can’t like everybody all the time, some dislike me, some [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3438">He wanted to be the authority of the department, he used four junior professors to sign that letter with him that I was a war criminal, and that my confession was only the tip of the iceberg.</span> <span id="s3439">Totally complete nonsense, right?</span> <span id="s3440">At the same time, he acted hatefully without ever talking to me about fact.</span> <span id="s3441">He only went by what he read in the paper, and he had been a [indecipherable] colleague of mine with whom I’d coop -- cooperated on many occasions, so I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s3442">Maybe -- he may be a Scots Canadian, one of his -- whose relatives may have died at the hand of a Nazi during the war, I don’t know, I didn’t inquire.</span> <span id="s3443">But -- but to proceed from that with a general accusation, which by the way the university has strongly apologized for in writing in the newspapers, right?</span> <span id="s3444">There is a big difference, I think.</span> <span id="s3445">He is an uncompromiser.</span> <span id="s3446">I would have -- I would have been happy to talk to him and give him my personal rendition, including the rendition of my suffering, hoping that he would say, well Lallier, you were caught in a bind.</span> <span id="s3447">I don’t know what I would have done if I had been you, but I-I don’t know, but I can see you -- that you weren’t a contributing cause to that killing.</span> <span id="s3448">But what [indecipherable] me specifically, his being the chair of the promotions department, he used his power of the chair to induce four young professor who needed his recommendation to get a promotion and tenure, which they thought they would only get if they cosigned the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3449">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3450">A: And that’s where human unfairness to the highest degree comes to play, and in my view academics don’t behave like that.</span> <span id="s3451">At the same time, look at the academics.</span></p> <p><span id="s3452">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">A: Look at the guy who told you -- remember what I told you some little while ago?</span> <span id="s3454">But -- I am God, all you need to do is know what I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3455">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3456">A: So he was a hateful person [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3457">He just happens to be a hateful person.</span> <span id="s3458">In my [indecipherable] I say St. Peter will make him burn.</span></p> <p><span id="s3459">Q: Do you feel less guilty?</span></p> <p><span id="s3460">A: I feel -- I feel, let’s say, about Concordia, I was pulled out from my teaching at a very bad time in my life.</span> <span id="s3461">It was a time in which I had really convinced myself that I had become as a teacher a -- an incessant contributor to convincing students that developing their own ability to reason was the only way to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3462">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3463">A: And you develop your reason, but always inculcating them with this need to ask question, to confirm fact.</span> <span id="s3464">And to become critics of whatever fact [indecipherable] represent, namely, to think for themselves.</span> <span id="s3465">In my whole life since I was released from the British P.O.W. camp, was an attempt to catch up with those four years that I had lost completely, right?</span> <span id="s3466">And develop a mind that I could use on benefit -- for the benefit of the development of mind of young ones equally capable of giving a sharp eye, and if necessary a critical look at ings -- what things is, in the honest desire to find solutions along the peaceful planes of finding solution.</span> <span id="s3467">I think ultimate intellectualism, not ism as a [indecipherable] ul-ultimate levels of intellectual reasoning are the only way to bring about world peace.</span> <span id="s3468">Because i-in the mind that one recognizes that which brings up possible, and that it is possible to achieve all kinds of ends without shedding human blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s3469">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3470">A: And Jewish people with this dispro -- not disproportionate, remarkably high proportion of philosophers and [indecipherable] not just Einstein, but a whole bunch of other, including the atom bomb makers, the-they -- they have an exceptional gift.</span> <span id="s3471">I don’t know how many of the refugees that I was able to bring over here, whatever the pretext, have had children like that, but I’m happy that quite a few of them had eight or nine to 10 children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3472">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much for being willing to talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s3473">A: Great, great talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s3474">Q: -- to talk with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3475">A: But please don’t forget, for three years I served the evil empire.</span> <span id="s3476">And part of that was a conviction naturally, an honest conviction that serving that empire would put a halt to what I still believe is an empire equally as equal -- equally equal -- equally as evil, namely godless Bolsheviks.</span></p> <p><span id="s3477">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3478">A: I don’t know what my contribution any worth.</span> <span id="s3479">I’ll have to watch my students and see what becomes of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3480">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3481">A: And I admi -- my -- the gratitude is on my part because for a lady like you I must say that, respectfully speaking, to fly all the way from Washington to Montreal, even though weather conditions are [indecipherable] as you had anticipated, right, it -- it -- it -- it is very impressive and it also honors me beyond what I deserve.</span></p> <p><span id="s3482">Q: I thank you for that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3483">A: Really, I really, really --</span></p> <p><span id="s3484">Q: -- thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3485">A: -- I admire you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3486">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3487">A: -- for many, many respects, and especially our contact [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3488">Q: Wait a -- you don’t want to -- you don’t want to get up yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s3489">A: Okay -- well, I do -- I had to stand up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3490">Q: I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s3491">No, no, it’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3492">A: It’s a sign of respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s3493">Q: It’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3494">A: If I were asking to dance, I’d have to stand up and bow.</span></p> <p><span id="s3495">Q: You’d have to stand up, right.</span> <span id="s3496">Well, thank
