<span id="s18">I’m – I’m wa – I went to school in – in Belgium, in Flemish school.</span> <span id="s19">The only language I spoke when I was a kid was Flemish and Yiddish, Yiddish, because – and then I lived there since 1940 and – and in 1940 the war broke out.</span> <span id="s20">And I – when the war broke out, I saw the – the mobilization, the – the Belgians were trying to defend the country and they were mobilizing the people on the street, and were mobilizing the horses, everything.</span> <span id="s21">And they – they were preparing for the – for this – for the war.</span> <span

the tickets for all – for the entire family to go to France, and the next day we left Antwerp, we left everything and we went to Brussels.</span> <span id="s24">And in Brussels, there were like a – a lot of people mar – was a – was a rush to the railroad station, and up the – we – we had to go from the La Gare du Nord to La Gare du Midi in Brussels to go to France.</span> <span id="s25">And it was

all kind of things.</span> <span id="s27">And we went to – and the train took off, and the – everything was in the – in the – on alert, no?</span> <span id="s28">And a lot of people had gas masks.</span> <span id="s29">The f – the Flemish people, the Belgian people had gas mak – gas masks, but the – the Jewish population, they were considered as foreigners, because their parents were not born in Belgium, so they didn’t issue them gas masks, so we were without gas masks.</span> <span id="s30">And the train was supposed to go to Paris, but Paris was already in a state of alert, and everything was closed up, so the train passed by Paris and went to the south of France.</span> <span id="s31">And our – and on the – on the way, after we left Paris, the – there – the German planes o-overflew the – the – th-the train and bombed – and bombed.</span> <span id="s32">And one train got hi – the tr – one of the c-car of the train got hit, so they distr – dislocated the train and they left this, th-the bad part of the train, they removed it from the rails and they reconnected the train, and we – and wa – and we ke – and we kept going towards south of France, where wa – south of France.</span> <span id="s33">And on the – on the – on the road, the train stopped a couple times, and they gave us food.</span> <span id="s34">They ga – they gave us bread and little can of pâté de foie, pâté de foie they gave us, and that was our food until we got to Toulouse, to Toulouse.</span> <span id="s35">In Toulouse th-the train took another road, another, and we went to [indecipherable] that’s near Montpellier.</span> <span id="s36">And up there we – we got off the train, and the people were – made dinners for us.</span> <span id="s37">They had like – outside – outside the railroad

where depot where they – where they kept merchandise.</span> <span id="s39">They removed the merchandise and they made mattresses so we could sleep.</span> <span id="s40">So we slept there and they – they fed us, and they gave us – they helped us, they gave us clothes and everything.</span> <span id="s41">And we stayed there for about maybe two weeks.</span> <span id="s42">And then the French army was in retreat.</span> <span id="s43">The French army was in retreat and the French army came into town and they took over the school.</span> <span id="s44">And they made food, and they fed us too.</span> <span id="s45">The French army fed us too.</span> <span id="s46">And then I saw – then they had big lines, and the – them – the f – the French government made an armistice with the German, half of France wer – France wa – became divided.</span> <span id="s47">Half of France went over to the Germans, and the other fr – part of France was free, was a part of France which was free.</span> <span id="s48">And we remained in the free part.</span> <span id="s49">And then the French army, they wanted the – they gave all the weapons, they rounded up all the weapons from the French soldiers, and they turned the – they put it on a little truck, and they – and it went to the – to the armistice line.</span> <span id="s50">They gave it to the Germans, the weapons, they surrendered, the French

id="s52">And – and then we remained in France there, and the free French, and – and then a lot of – a couple weeks later, a lot of – a lot of people th – the – went back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s53">They repatriated a lot of people because they had the armistice, so they had no more war, so they repatriated a lot of people.</span> <span id="s54">So most of the Flemish people, the Christians went back to Belgium, and some – and the Jews remained in France.</span> <span id="s55">Some Jews went back too, you know?</span> <span id="s56">And my family remained in France, so we – we decided to go to Toulouse to look for an apartment.</span> <span id="s57">And when we went to Toulouse we got arrested in the streets, from the French gendarme.</span> <span id="s58">They arrested us in the street, and they asked us a paper.</span> <span id="s59">And my father showed the paper and th-the poli – the gendarme said, oh, they are Polish, they are Polonais.</span> <span id="s60">We said wa – they asked us what we are doing, we looking for [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s61">So he says yeah, Po-Polonais, so he says, the wi – the woman is Polonais too, because she is married to him, she must be Polish too.</span> <span id="s62">So my mother didn’t want – didn’t want to be Polish.</span> <span id="s63">So she start f – arguing with the police that she’s not Polish.</span> <span id="s64">So my father said, in Jewish, he says, don’t – leave it alone, because they don’t understand the difference anyway, between Polish and Russian, they’re French, you know?</span> <span id="s65">So she insisted she didn’t want to be Polish, so it started a fight.</span> <span id="s66">So the pa – the gendarmes said, wh-what is going on, what they fight?</span> <span id="s67">So we – we said, because she don’t want to be Polish.</span> <span id="s68">Oh, she says, okay, so – so that ended the argument and they took us to a – to a special camp, it used to be called reci – Recebedou.</span> <span id="s69">And in that camp, they would treat us very nice, they gave us even hot chocolate for the kids, we – they gave a hot chocolate and everything.</span> <span id="s70">And we stayed there about maybe a – a couple weeks in that camp, and they gave us where to sleep and food and everything, because it was for the foreigners.</span> <span id="s71">The French kept the foreigners on the side, they didn’t want to be – they – mixed with the foreigners, the foreigners, they had their own place for the foreigners, they had camps for the foreigners.</span> <span id="s72">And then from Recebedou, they took us to a camp, it’s called Brenz(ph), n-a-r-b, in th – France, and it was an island.</span> <span id="s73">You had to cross a bridge to get there.</span> <span id="s74">And on that island was surrounded with – with rivers, very strong rivers.</span> <span id="s75">You couldn’t swim in the river.</span> <span id="s76">When you threw a piece of wood, the piece of wood just – the river used to take away a piece of wood and break it, you know, it was like very, very strong river.</span> <span id="s77">So we stayed in that camp of Brenz(ph), we stayed maybe four or – four or five months.</span> <span id="s78">And from – from Brenz(ph) they took us to Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s79">They – they may – had trains coming in and they loaded all the people.</span> <span id="s80">It was like a – wagons, you know, for the horses, like, and they took us to Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s81">And the Rivesaltes was by the coast, by the sea.</span> <span id="s82">And – and Rivesaltes was a – a strong camp with – with a – a wire, you know, it was – and had guards with rifles and everything.</span> <span id="s83">And – and Rivesaltes is separate the women from the men.</span> <span id="s84">The women went to a different part of the camp and the men to a different camp.</span> <span id="s85">And there was no school or nothing, and we – the

me, he went to Montélimar, to a private school.</span> <span id="s215">So – so then, a little bit later is – Cossionair(ph), the father was a commander in the French army, and he was a prisoner in Germany, and the German government released a lot of – a lot of French prisoners, all the officers, they were released.</span> <span id="s216">So he came back and we had to pick him up in Montélimar, we had to pick him up.</span> <span id="s217">And when we picked him up, he came with other prisoners, but their uniforms were all torn up, they only had one uniform.</span> <span id="s218">And when they were in camp in Germany, they wore that uniform.</span> <span id="s219">So when he came home, his to – his uniform was all torn up.</span> <span id="s220">And I remember that, that we picked him up and we brought him back home.</span> <span id="s221">At home he took off his uniform and he wore regular clothes, and he could play piano.</span> <span id="s222">On the weekend he played piano, was a – was a nice atmosphere in the house.</span> <span id="s223">And then – a-a-and then in the – in the – in the summer, some other kids came to – to stay with us.</span> <span id="s224">All are kids from French officers, from French officers.</span> <span id="s225">They came for the summer because their parents were busy, so they came, they had like a vacation with us, you know.</span> <span id="s226">And the house was very nice, around the house was a lot of chestnut trees, chestnut trees.</span> <span id="s227">And we used to – we used to take the chestnut and eat the chestnut.</span> <span id="s228">And – and we used to play games outside, you know, with a ball, you know, the – called ba-balloon prisonnier; was a special game we used to play.</span> <span id="s229">Th-They had two party, like the two camps, and the ca – the guys in the middle, they were in the middle and we had to hit them with the ball, you know, yeah, it was like a football, you know, like a big ball.</span> <span id="s230">And it was very nice there, but th-the – I got along very good there with the – the – the – the big boy who used to come back for – in the summer, he had no school.</span> <span id="s231">He was – he wanted to be the boss of everybody, and if you didn’t listen to him, you had friction with him.</span> <span id="s232">I used to get into fights with him sometimes, you know.</span> <span id="s233">Bernard, his name was.</span> <span id="s234">But – and then later, maybe a couple weeks later, a kid came from – he was a son of a French officer, a navy officer, and he slept in my room.</span> <span id="s235">And he – I got friendly with him, and he saw that I have friction with Bernard.</span> <span id="s236">So he said, well – well, what does he want from you?</span> <span id="s237">I say, he wants to be the boss.</span> <span id="s238">He said, leave him up to me, you know.</span> <span id="s239">Because there was a – a girl came from Paris, and she – Bernard used to – used to be like his cousin, but the gi – the fr – the kid from the French officer who came – stayed with us, he liked – he tried to make conversation with the girl, and Bernard got mad at him.</span> <span id="s240">So that caused – caused friction, so he had a fight with Bernard, and after that Bernard became like a – like a lamb, he didn’t – he had no more power, you know, because he took over the power, know?</span> <span id="s241">And he was my friend, he slept with me in the room, you know.</span> <span id="s242">And we used to – we used to get a – a ba – a wash once a week, the – a – a shower.</span> <span id="s243">The – the dau – the sister of Mademoiselle Milan(ph) used to be in charge of lam – washing the kids once a week, you know, we used to get the shower.</span> <span id="s244">And the rest of the week we washed – washed our teeth by hand, you know, with cold water.</span> <span id="s245">And – and I stayed by Mademoiselle Milan(ph) like about almost two years, you know, almost two years I stayed with her.</span> <span id="s246">And my father used to write to me letters.</span> <span id="s247">It was in the – in Yiddish, but not written in Hebrew, was written in Latin, know?</span> <span id="s248">[indecipherable] So I used to get those letters from him, and then – and – and then they deci – my mother got out of the camp and she joined my father in Tresse, and I was then – I was – they brought me back to – they send me back to Tresse.</span> <span id="s249">And when I left, I didn’t see Mademoiselle Milan(ph).</span> <span id="s250">She was a – because she actually thought I was her son after a while.</span> <span id="s251">She’s a – knit things for me, sweaters and everything.</span> <span id="s252">And when I left, I left with a sister-in-law of a sister, who came to stay with us, and she took me to Marseilles, to [indecipherable] and I met my mother there, at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s253">She came to Marseilles to pick me up with Lucie.</span> <span id="s254">And my mother couldn’t speak French, and I couldn’t – I had forgotten the Jewish – Yiddish, you know, I’d forgotten Yiddish.</span> <span id="s255">So I couldn’t – I had a hard time speaking to my mother.</span> <span id="s256">I spoke in French and Lucie translated.</span> <span id="s257">Lucie learned French, you know, she [indecipherable] and Lucie translated to my mother, and it took me a couple weeks to get back to the language, to Yiddish, to speak, because my mother didn’t speak Flemish, she spoke only Yiddish.</span> <span id="s258">I spoke Flemish because I learned Flemish as a kid in Belgium in school.</span> <span id="s259">So – so I came – I came to Tresse, and in Tresse – I – I went to school in Tresse.</span> <span id="s260">And I had to – I – my Mademoiselle Milan(ph), they spoke of – her – th-they had a Parisian accent in their French.</span> <span id="s261">So when they heard the Parisian accent, the kids used to make fun of me like I’m a Parisian.</span> <span id="s262">So it took me months to get back to – to get – to get back the accent of – to get the Marseilles accent, you know, like the kids in school.</span> <span id="s263">And then I was part of the kids in school, you know, the – the French accent.</span> <span id="s264">So then a – ash – in tre – in Tresse I stayed, since I came back from Madame Milan(ph), maybe four or five months, and then the ozay(ph) came to us, and they took me and Lucie and they took us to San Raphael to – for – for the summer, for two months.</span> <span id="s265">So I went to [indecipherable] in San Raphael in the – in the – I forgot the name of the – of the camp in San Raphael.</span> <span id="s266">You – you remember the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A2: Villa Marianne.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yeah, Villa Marianna(ph).</span> <span id="s269">And up there was a nice villa, where every day we used to go to the beach to swim.</span> <span id="s270">But we had no food, it was hu – we were hungry.</span> <span id="s271">And at the beach, we used to wait for – French couples used to come on the beach, and they used to have melon.</span> <span id="s272">And when they li – left the place where they stayed, the blanket and everything, they left the melon, you know, cut, the melon.</span> <span id="s273">And when they cut the melon, they just cut the top, and there was like melon left.</span> <span id="s274">So we used to take that and eat that.</span> <span id="s275">That was – that was a – a big thing to us to grab the melon from the people when they le – when they left.</span> <span id="s276">And in San Raphael, we – we used to go to school, we had to march to school, maybe about four miles every day to school.</span> <span id="s277">We had to march in – in steps.</span> <span id="s278">If you didn’t march in steps, the – the cadres(ph) who used to wa-watch you, they used to hit you, you know?</span> <span id="s279">One day I had the fight with one of the cadres(ph).</span> <span id="s280">Because I wasn’t in step, he got mad at me and we had a big fight.</span> <span id="s281">And another cadre(ph) came and he fou – he helped him hit me, you know, like – had like a big fight with him.</span> <span id="s282">And in school, we used to eat lunch in school, we used to br – they used to give us a sandwich in school, used to – used to take with us a sandwich.</span> <span id="s283">And in school there was the kids who came from the farms, and they had big sandwiches.</span> <span id="s284">So we used to give them marbles sometime and they used to give us a sandwich, because they were not hungry, the kids from the farms.</span> <span id="s285">So I used to have a kid who used to give me his sandwich.</span> <span id="s286">And I used to give him marbles, different things, bells.</span> <span id="s287">And then finally one day he came to school, he wouldn’t give us his sandwich.</span> <span id="s288">Cause the sandwich, I used to split it with my other buddies from the – from the – from the Villa Marianna(ph).</span> <span id="s289">So – so he [indecipherable] I say, why didn – why didn’t you give us sandwich?</span> <span id="s290">He said, my mother says I shouldn’t give to m – the sandwich to strange kids, because you people are not French, she say, you know, like he was a little racist.</span> <span id="s291">So – so, when he threw away the sandwich, I got him, and it was like a big barrel in the yard, and I – I pushed his head in the barrel, you know, in order to get the sandwich.</span> <span id="s292">So he told his mother that I roughed him up, because we took the sandwich from him.</span> <span id="s293">So the mother came to school.</span> <span id="s294">In those days there was no gasoline, they had horses, and the mother had a nice carriage with a horse like a racing horse, and she had a whip, an umbrella, and she had her – her father on the carriage too.</span> <span id="s295">But the father was senile, he was very old.</span> <span id="s296">He was on the horse too.</span> <span id="s297">And she went to the principal, and sh-she argued with the principal that we beat him up, the kids from the Villa Marianna(ph) beat him up.</span> <span id="s298">So I had to go to see the principal.</span> <span id="s299">So the – the principal said to me, what’s the matter?</span> <span id="s300">How come you hit him beca – and took his sandwich?</span> <span id="s301">So I said no, he gave us his sandwich, then he didn’t want to give us his sandwich no more.</span> <span id="s302">So we – we were hungry, so we took the san – so the principal explained to the mother that the kids in – in the – in the home, they don’t have too much food, so they dependent on that sandwich.</span> <span id="s303">And he – he gave a – he gave them the sandwich and then he stopped giving us the sandwich.</span> <span id="s304">So the principal made before that, all that stuff happened, he made conversation with me, and he was in the second World War in Belgium as a soldier, a French soldier.</span> <span id="s305">And he was very friendly with me because h-he knew Belgium.</span> <span id="s306">So he explained to the mother that she gotta speak to the son, it’s not – they’re not malicious kids, they’re like hungry, you know?</span> <span id="s307">So the mother changed – changed, and she told the kid to give us a sandwich.</span> <span id="s308">So, since that time, we used to get a sandwich from the kid.</span> <span id="s309">It was a big, big country bread.</span> <span id="s310">Th-The French used to make bread, round bread like that, like the Italian country bread, y’know?</span> <span id="s311">And the m – he used to give us a sandwich, and ri – in the beginning we didn’t want to take a sandwich, we didn’t want no trouble with him.</span> <span id="s312">He said, no, no, no, the principal knows about it, you can take the sandwich and have your sandwich.</span> <span id="s313">My mother said I should give you the sandwich.</span> <span id="s314">So there was a – a success there with the sandwich, you know, in that school.</span> <span id="s315">And then a – and then a – at – I stayed there maybe another month, and then I went back to Tresse, to my – to my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s316">And – and I used to – I used to go see my father in the mountains, you know, where he used to cut the woods?</span> <span id="s317">And that became like the – the resistance.</span> <span id="s318">It became like a stronghold of the resistance.</span> <span id="s319">And then one day – my mother used to give me food to bring to my father, you know, like food that she made that he liked.</span> <span id="s320">And I w – I was on the way to leave town to go to the mountains, a German patrol were in town, German troops.</span> <span id="s321">And the patrol, they went with me for awhile, you know, and they ask me where I’m going.</span> <span id="s322">I said to, you know, my grandmother, I’m going to see my grandmother.</span> <span id="s323">So, th-they walked a little bit with me.</span> <span id="s324">Maybe somebody squealed that I’m going to see my father.</span> <span id="s325">So – so the – the German patrol, the German officer heard like noise in the bushes, because there was a lot of lizards there and even snakes.</span> <span id="s326">So he says in German, I understood what he said, he says [speaks German here].</span> <span id="s327">Let’s – let’s go back.</span> <span id="s328">Let’s not go with them, because it’s dangerous areas, like a jungle, he said.</span> <span id="s329">[speaks German] It means it’s like a jungle.</span> <span id="s330">So he – th-the German patrol stayed in town, they ac – they walked a little bit with me, maybe 200 meters, and then they went back.</span> <span id="s331">So I went by myself up to the mountain.</span> <span id="s332">It was a big climb, was like maybe four or five hours until I got up there.</span> <span id="s333">And at that time, they derailed a German train.</span> <span id="s334">And when they derailed the German train, there were sardines, they captured a lot of sardines and weapons.</span> <span id="s335">There was trains going to Italy that they derailed.</span> <span id="s336">And there were – there were – the train had sardines and sweet milk, because the German women who used to go to Italy to meet their husbands, who were in the German army, used to have sweet milk for their babies.</span> <span id="s337">And when they derailed the train, the French resistance captured a lot of sardines and the sweet milk.</span> <span id="s338">So up there I used to eat bread with sweet milk and sardines.</span> <span id="s339">And then my father gave me some sardines in a jar, in a jar, sardines, because he didn’t want me to bring the cans in town, then th – th – if they find the cans, they will know that they derailed the train.</span> <span id="s340">So he says, and when you’re finished eating the sardines, you bury the jar.</span> <span id="s341">So I did that, I buried the jar.</span> <span id="s342">But I didn’t bury the jar deep enough, so the next week, German troops came and they surrounded the town, and they made – they took us all on the Place de la Gare in the town, and they used to search the houses for the – search the houses for weapons, because they know in the town there’s resistance who derailed the train.</span> <span id="s343">So th – so I buried that – the jar on the – on my landlady’s yard, next to us where we lived.</span> <span id="s344">And he used – he went with the dog on the yard, and the dog smelled the sardines, so the dog was barking.</span> <span id="s345">So he didn’t want to dig up the yard, you know, the sardine there, so he says to the dog, du verrückt hund.</span> <span id="s346">It means, you crazy dog, why are you smelling here?</span> <span id="s347">[indecipherable] and he kicked the dog.</span> <span id="s348">And – and the dog cried a little bit, and he l – he left with the dog.</span> <span id="s349">But if he would every undug that place, he would have find the jar from the sardine, and that could have been dangerous.</span> <span id="s350">So the Germans, all day they kept the people prisoner, and they searched the houses, but they didn’t find nothing, so they left, they left.</span> <span id="s351">And then – and then we st – in the town we ast – we – we stayed under the German occupation.</span> <span id="s352">And they came – they didn’t come all the time, the German, they came once in awhile, and they – but a lot of Germans went through town to go to Italy, the German convoys.</span> <span id="s353">They went to Italy to fight the war, they were fighting the Americans and the British in there.</span> <span id="s354">And then they landed in Normandy.</span> <span id="s355">They landed in Normandy and then – the south of France was still occupied until August – until July the 15th, they landed in San Tropez, and they – and they came up towards – towards Tresse, but they stayed on the national road.</span> <span id="s356">Tresse was liberated by the resistance.</span> <span id="s357">And then the [indecipherable] papers [indecipherable] you called, that the people should go to the mountains, should go to the mountains because the town is gonna have – can be fighting in the town.</span> <span id="s358">So the entire population went to the mountains, the civilian population.</span> <span id="s359">But the people went to the mountain, they had food with them.</span> <span id="s360">And then we went too, my mother, my two sisters, my father was in the mountain, he didn’t go with us.</span> <span id="s361">So we went to the mountains.</span> <span id="s362">So we stayed there about two days, and we had no more food, so my mother says, take the wheel carriage from your sister, you know, the carriage, and go to town an-and get us – bring some food.</span> <span id="s363">In the – in the closet, I got some chi-chi beans, you know, some the beans, and – and some melons.</span> <span id="s364">And take it, take it o – so we have enough food until – until the liberation, you know.</span> <span id="s365">So I got to town, and as I got to town with a friend of mine, a kid, he came with me, the town was all empty.</span> <span id="s366">It was like a no man – like a – like you see from the – in the town of the cowboys where everybody’s gone.</span> <span id="s367">So we got to town, and we got to the house and we loaded the wagon with the food, the melons and the – and the beans, and as we want to go get out of the house, two German armored cars come in, and they – and they go – they o – they – all the bars were locked, yeah, so they go to one the bars, restaurant, and they ripped the doors open.</span> <span id="s368">They ripped the doors open and they take out the drink and they put the table outside and they start drinking, the Germans, you know?</span> <span id="s369">And they were the Germans who were supposed to protect the town, maybe about 30 Germans with – had – with the machine guns, the – all, you know, ready to – to fight the war.</span> <span id="s370">So my friend say, what we gonna do now?</span> <span id="s371">We can’t get out.</span> <span id="s372">He said, we stay here until night time, at night time, we’ll get out of the town at night time.</span> <span id="s373">So we stayed there until it got dark.</span> <span id="s374">And as I walked out, the – the carriage made noise, because there was no oil.</span> <span id="s375">It made eh, eh, eh.</span> <span id="s376">So – so he says, what are we gonna do, it makes too much noise.</span> <span id="s377">So we – we picked up the carriage and we dragged it a little bit, but then we let it down again, and it made noise.</span> <span id="s378">The Germans heard the noise, they came running with the machine guns in the dark.</span> <span id="s379">We saw them.</span> <span id="s380">As kids, you can see good at night.</span> <span id="s381">So – so w-we walked up the hill, we had to – from the fountain, we had to walk the hill towards the mountain.</span> <span id="s382">So we saw the German pointing at us, and he – he starts shooting.</span> <span id="s383">So we left the carriage go.</span> <span id="s384">The carriage went against a tree, th – and broke and the melon starts rolling.</span> <span id="s385">So the German starts shooting at the melons, he didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s386">He starts shooting at the melon, and we escaped, you know, we got up in the mountain, we came back to the woods.</span> <span id="s387">So the kid told the French families that we went down and there is full of Germans.</span> <span id="s388">So they said, what are you doing in town?</span> <span id="s389">So he explains to them, we didn’t have enough food.</span> <span id="s390">Said, why didn’t you ask us?</span> <span id="s391">So they gave us food, know?</span> <span id="s392">And overnight, at night, there was a big for – a fight between the Americans and the Germans, like artillery and everything.</span> <span id="s393">And then – and then the next day they told us that the – the town is liberated.</span> <span id="s394">So we didn’t know, we thought we were the only two in the town, but there were the – the resistance was in town too, and they killed all the Germans, the 30 Germans, and they lined them up on the sidewalk like sardines, they’re sardines.</span> <span id="s395">And they took everything away from them in a blanket.</span> <span id="s396">You know, their possession, their rings, their lighters, their – their rifles, everything, their machine guns.</span> <span id="s397">They’re the Schmeisser machine gun, that was the – the best machine gun.</span> <span id="s398">And they took everything away, and they were all dead.</span> <span id="s399">And then they – they buried them outside the town, you know, they buried all the Germans, and when we came down from the mountains, they were all dead, y’know?</span> <span id="s400">And – and then they captured about hundred – 200 Germans, prisoners who surrendered to the – from the – from another part of the town.</span> <span id="s401">And they had them prisoner, and the resistance had to interrogate them.</span> <span id="s402">Every German was interrogated.</span> <span id="s403">There was [indecipherable] from the resistance just to write everything down.</span> <span id="s404">So they used to use me as translator, know, and interrogate all these German, everything was written down, all the – where they’re born, how m – how many years in the army and everything.</span> <span id="s405">And then one German, he was very scared, and he said that he comes from a socialist family, because he noticed that the resistance had the h-hammer and the sickle on their he – on their y – beret, you know?</span> <span id="s406">So – so he says to – to me, we c – I – we – I come from a socialist family, don’t kill us, don’t kill us.</span> <span id="s407">So he was afraid the French resistance would kill him.</span> <span id="s408">So I told him, he says, yeah, today they’re all socialists, you know?</span> <span id="s409">And before, they were all Nazis, now they’re socialists, the guy – the officer of the resistance said.</span> <span id="s410">And then – and then as I interrogate the Germans, they took away this guy was very scared, and we interrogate them separately.</span> <span id="s411">And he says, the officer of the resistance, he says, ask him where the officers are.</span> <span id="s412">He said the officers, they in the wood, they wouldn’t surrender.</span> <span id="s413">He say, in which wood?</span> <span id="s414">He say, in the same wood where you captured us.</span> <span id="s415">So we surrounded the woods, and – and the offer – one officer came out, they had no food, he came out to eat some grapes outside the woods were – were grapes.</span> <span id="s416">And that was the time when the grapes are ripe, you know, August.</span> <span id="s417">So he – he took in the helmet some grapes and he came back.</span> <span id="s418">And they told him to stop, he wouldn’t stop, so they shot him.</span> <span id="s419">So the other officer came out, he said, Hans, Hans, was ist los?</span> <span id="s420">It mean, Hans, Hans, what happened?</span> <span id="s421">So they – so they told him to stop, so he wouldn’t stop, they shot him too.</span> <span id="s422">So they brought back the two German officers on the truck.</span> <span id="s423">The French truck, by the wheels they have like a – like a – the wheel is separated from the motor.</span> <span id="s424">There’s like a separation.</span> <span id="s425">So they put one officer this way, and one officer that way, and they brought them back to town.</span> <span id="s426">And they were bleeding all on the road, y’know, because when they got shot?</span> <span id="s427">And in town, the people were touching them with branches, you know, the – was like a big news, that the officers got shot, know?</span> <span id="s428">And then – yeah, see?</span> <span id="s429">Again?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: I’m sorry, we’re –</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: It’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: [indecipherable] one more time, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Beginning File Three</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Were they dead, the – the soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Well, finished with the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Yeah, let’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Well, no, but you talked about the soldiers and how the people touched them with branches.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Were they already dead, or were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: They were dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: They were dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: They were dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Just wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: We’re all set.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yeah?</span> <span id="s451">So they touched them with branches, and they were on the truck.</span> <span id="s452">Then the – the French resistance took off the boots.</span> <span id="s453">The boots were leather, and leather was like gold in those days.</span> <span id="s454">So most of the kids were barefooted, there was no – we had no shoes.</span> <span id="s455">So they gave me the boots to make su – to give it to the shoemaker to make some – some shoes.</span> <span id="s456">So they gave me the boots, and one boot was full of blood.</span> <span id="s457">So we – I tried to wash it with my friend by the fountain with powder and everything, but we couldn’t get it clean.</span> <span id="s458">We couldn’t get it clean, so that boot we had to throw away.</span> <span id="s459">But the three other boots, I gave to a Spanish shoemaker who lived in the town, he was from the Civil War, he was very good sa – sh – shoemaker.</span> <span id="s460">He made me sandals for me and Lucie, you know?</span> <span id="s461">Sandals.</span> <span id="s462">And the sole, he used the sole from the – the belt from the mines, you know, the rubber belts that they used in the mine for the coal?</span> <span id="s463">He used.</span> <span id="s464">And the top was all leather from the boots.</span> <span id="s465">And he kept the leather, leftover leather he kept it for himself to make shoes, so he didn’t – it didn’t cost us nothing, the sandals.</span> <span id="s466">So he made sandals for me and Lucie and we had the sandals way back to Belgium we had those sandals.</span> <span id="s467">They were made like unbelievable.</span> <span id="s468">And that was the – the profit because through me they got the German officers.</span> <span id="s469">If not they wouldn’t know the German officers were in the woods, you know?</span> <span id="s470">So – and then the – they had the German prisoners, they didn’t kill them.</span> <span id="s471">They turn them over to the Americans much later, know?</span> <span id="s472">They use them.</span> <span id="s473">Because I met some of those German soldiers who were – that I interrogate, I met them later in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s474">They used to clean the beach, the mines on the beach.</span> <span id="s475">And then in Marseilles – I came to live in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s476">From Tresse I went to live in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s477">In Marseilles there was no room, there was no apartments.</span> <span id="s478">Through a friend of my father, from the resistance, he – he was – became like the mayor of – of the [indecipherable] Marseilles, and he got a apartment for us, next to the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s479">And – and he s – and this – this – this fellow was like the mayor of that district up there, he told my father – my mother was still in town in Tresse, she didn’t come yet to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s480">And then later she came to Marseilles, but before she came to Marseilles, he send me to Septème.</span> <span id="s481">Septème is a little town not too far from Marseilles by Aix-en-Provence.</span> <span id="s482">And I stayed by the mayor of Septème, you know, because he was from the resistance too.</span> <span id="s483">And the mayor from Septème, I slept in his house and I became friendly with his son.</span> <span id="s484">And the son used to – used to go hunting for rabbits and everything, I became his friend.</span> <span id="s485">In those d – in that time, France was like a civil war.</span> <span id="s486">The French were fighting the French.</span> <span id="s487">The French from the resistance were fighting the French who were with the Germans in the second World War with Vichy.</span> <span id="s488">And – and in the next town where I stayed, the – the French people from Vichy killed the mayor – killed the mayor.</span> <span id="s489">So he was the – the son of the mayor was afraid they’re gonna come and kill his ow – his father, so we slept all night with a rifle, he had rifles.</span> <span id="s490">We slept all night with the rifles underneath the bed.</span> <span id="s491">And I was scared, I thought something’s gonna happen.</span> <span id="s492">So I didn’t sleep all night, I fell asleep in the morning, you know, in the morning.</span> <span id="s493">And then – and then all the woods were cleaned from the – the guys from – the people wi – with the Germans, you know, the Vichy, they cleaned all the woods, and there was – everything was good, you know, there was no more enemies in the woods, because they cleaned the woods.</span> <span id="s494">They used to clean all the woods, the resistance.</span> <span id="s495">More resistance came from Marseilles, and they helped cleaning the woods, yeah.</span> <span id="s496">And then I went back to Marseilles where – then my mother came from the town, and I start living in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s497">And in Marseilles, I ma – we were playing soccer, you know, by the railroad station.</span> <span id="s498">And the ball went across the fence, to a place where – where ja – there were German prisoners.</span> <span id="s499">German prisoners.</span> <span id="s500">So my friends used to know that I speak German, they used to say, Andre, go get the – go get the ball for – so I went to ge – ask them for the ball.</span> <span id="s501">He says, I’ll give you the ball if you do me one favor, the German prisoner says.</span> <span id="s502">Th-Th – well, I got it from Americans, yeah, and the Americans said, don’t speak too much to them, know?</span> <span id="s503">I said was just want to get the ball.</span> <span id="s504">Oh.</span> <span id="s505">So at that time I couldn’t speak English, you know, we had like explained to him.</span> <span id="s506">So we got the ball and he says he wants – he wants I should buy him some beer.</span> <span id="s507">He says, I have no money, he said, but I give you my gold ring.</span> <span id="s508">He took out – he took his wedding ring, a heavy gold ring, and he gave me the gold ring.</span> <span id="s509">And I am gonna take the ring, I figure [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s510">So – so I – then my buddies, they said to me in French, what does he want?</span> <span id="s511">I say, he wants a – a couple bottles of beer.</span> <span id="s512">He wants to give the ring.</span> <span id="s513">So they said, take the ring, take the ring from the guy, you know.</span> <span id="s514">They’re my buddies, you know, so I took the ring, and I bought him – I bought him some beer.</span> <span id="s515">I bought him with some beer and I kept the ring, I took the ring home, I gave the ring to my mother.</span> <span id="s516">And my mother had the ring th – the rest of her life she had the ring, yeah.</span> <span id="s517">And then later I took out the inscription, the German inscription in the ring.</span> <span id="s518">And it is just a – th-they – like once they were prisoners, the Germans, they were like – they were like helpless, you know.</span> <span id="s519">So then from – later from Marseilles, we went back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s520">We went back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s521">We lived there about one year in Marseilles, and we went back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s522">And from Belgium we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s523">My aunt made the papers for us, she insisted we should come there.</span> <span id="s524">And my mother didn’t – didn’t saw her aunt – my – her sister since the Russian revolution she didn’t see her sister.</span> <span id="s525">Her sister lived in the United States.</span> <span id="s526">Because originally she came to Belgium when she was a young girl to take the ship t – for United States, and then she met my father, she remained in Belgium, you know.</span> <span id="s527">She got married, she went in Belgium.</span> <span id="s528">And – and my father didn’t want to go to the States, but he had a lot of arguments with her, finally he gave in and he wen – we came to the States.</span> <span id="s529">And that’s how I ended up in the States, yeah.</span> <span id="s530">And in the States, I lived here about two years, I got drafted in the American Army, you know, and they send me to Korea.</span> <span id="s531">From Korea they send me to Germany, because I spoke German, they se – they said, they send me to Germany on occupation duty.</span> <span id="s532">And I came out of the army, I-I stayed in the United States because my parents lived here, and th – and that’s the story, yeah.</span> <span id="s533">What else?</span> <span id="s534">Is it –</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: When – how was it when you arrived in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: When I arrived in the United States, it was tough because I couldn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s537">Took me time to learn English.</span> <span id="s538">And it’s a good thing I – I had a trade, you know, I start working right away.</span> <span id="s539">I-I learned to be a jeweler in Belgium, you know.</span> <span id="s540">And I start working as a jeweler.</span> <span id="s541">But I looked younger than my age, and they wouldn’t hire me.</span> <span id="s542">They wouldn’t hire me, they didn’t believe me that – and then finally they hired me and I start working.</span> <span id="s543">And then I got drafted, you know.</span> <span id="s544">And I don’t know, what else?</span> <span id="s545">That’s it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Do you have a family here in –</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Yeah, ye-ah.</span> <span id="s548">I got – when I came out of the army, I – I – I go – I got married to somebody born from here, you know, an American wo-woman.</span> <span id="s549">And I live with her twe – 20 years, I got two daughters with her.</span> <span id="s550">And then later, after we divorced, I met my second wife, which is from Guatemala, you know, and I’m married her now 10 years, I think.</span> <span id="s551">I learned to speak Spanish [indecipherable] in our country, you know.</span> <span id="s552">That’s it, that’s it, I-I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Do you have anything else you’d like to add about the war or being at Rivesaltes?</span> <span id="s554">Do you have some other things you might want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yeah, one thing, yeah.</span> <span id="s556">When [indecipherable] so in – when I lived in Tresse, my mother got a letter from a woman living in Marseilles, that she knew from camp.</span> <span id="s557">And the woman says, there’s no food here, maybe you people can bring us some food.</span> <span id="s558">In Marseilles there was no food.</span> <span id="s559">So my mother made like a par – like a package of food, and I took the bus to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s560">In those days, there was only one bus going to tr – Marseilles, and one bus coming home.</span> <span id="s561">That’s the communication there was there, from the town to – to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s562">So I came to Marseilles and I looked – I left a – the package in the consigne in the – by the bus stop there was a consigne.</span> <span id="s563">You leave the package, and when – when you’re ready, you go there, you take it out and you gi – bring it to the people.</span> <span id="s564">And I looked for the people.</span> <span id="s565">So I came to the house where the people live, and I see the – the apartment is empty, nobody lives there.</span> <span id="s566">So, I – there was a kid playing in front of the door, marbles, so play marbles with him.</span> <span id="s567">I said to him, where are the people who live here?</span> <span id="s568">He said oh, he said, the French police took them a couple days ago.</span> <span id="s569">He says they – he says, because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s570">I said, no kidding, you know, like I made believe I don’t know what – I say, what is that?</span> <span id="s571">He say, yeah, they believe in another religion.</span> <span id="s572">He say, they’re not like us.</span> <span id="s573">So he said to me, where you from?</span> <span id="s574">I say, I’m from Notre-Dame de la Garde in Marseilles, you know, the mountain, the church.</span> <span id="s575">He says, oh, play with me marbles, and then next time I’ll come to you.</span> <span id="s576">I want to play marbles in your neighborhood.</span> <span id="s577">So I play marbles with him, and then I saw that – so I said, well I got to – I got to go.</span> <span id="s578">He said, I’ll go with you.</span> <span id="s579">I said, no, I want to – I got to see my grandmother.</span> <span id="s580">If my grandmother knows that I played around, she’s gonna get mad at me.</span> <span id="s581">He say, I’ll see you next time.</span> <span id="s582">He said, yeah, I’ll come and meet you in Notre-Dame de la Garde.</span> <span id="s583">So I-I went back to the rail – to the bus stop, and I know I can’t deliver the – the package.</span> <span id="s584">So I stayed in the town, and the town was full of Germans.</span> <span id="s585">They were all going to Africa in those days, they were fighting in Africa.</span> <span id="s586">That was like in 1940 – end of 1942.</span> <span id="s587">And the town was full of Germans, and then there was two Italian ships leaving, with the Italian troops.</span> <span id="s588">And the Italian people came there with their babies to say goodbye to this – to the soldiers.</span> <span id="s589">And they were holding up the babies to the – to show the soldiers, the Italian soldiers that – their baby – and they were yelling, bambino, bambino.</span> <span id="s590">And the – and the German soldiers were guarding the harbor and they were laughing, they were making fun of the Italians because the bambino, you know, they were showing the babies, you know.</span> <span id="s591">And I wi – I witnessed this then, know, in Marseilles, you know.</span> <span id="s592">And th-the Germans were buying things in the harbor and everything, because they were also leaving on ships to north Africa, you know.</span> <span id="s593">That was the closest I came to the – to the German troops going to Africa, you know, and Marseilles, yeah.</span> <span id="s594">And then at night I went back to my town.</span> <span id="s595">And when I went back to my town, the – a patrol came up on the b – on the bus and checked everything.</span> <span id="s596">And he showed me – he said to me, what are you doing with the food?</span> <span id="s597">They notice I got food.</span> <span id="s598">I say, yeah, I say, I’m – my grandmother gave me some food to bring to my mother, you know.</span> <span id="s599">Yeah, you had to know what to say to them, yeah, because they couldn’t speak – they couldn’t speak French.</span> <span id="s600">That was the only thing which saved everything, because the French couldn’t speak German and the Germans couldn’t speak French.</span> <span id="s601">There was sometime one guy who could speak a couple words, but he didn’t know – you say grandmother, he knew was grosmutter, yeah.</span> <span id="s602">Oh, grosmutter, grosmutter, yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s603">So was a – there was a look, because they couldn’t – they couldn’t communicate, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: There were other people in Tresse from north Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: From north Africa?</span> <span id="s606">There was a doctor from north Africa, a Jewish doctor from north Africa.</span> <span id="s607">There were no other people in Tresse [indecipherable] that I know, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: You talked to me about résidents [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: You said about somebody was under house arrest.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Oh yeah, that was the – the – the – in – in Tresse, when we came to Tresse, the woman was our landlady, she owned the Hotel de France.</span> <span id="s612">And in the Hotel de France was three prisoners.</span> <span id="s613">The king of Morocco, ben Yusef, Bourguiba, who wanted to – to have freedom for Tunisia, and there was a guy, Ali, his last name I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s614">And he was – there were three Arab chiefs who wanted independence from France and the French wouldn’t give them independence, and they kept them there as prisoners.</span> <span id="s615">Résidents Français.</span> <span id="s616">Every day they had to sign by the police, by the gendarme, and they were prisoners there.</span> <span id="s617">And being that I lived next to the hotel, she – the woman who owned the hotel was our – our landlady too.</span> <span id="s618">Her name was Madame Laville(ph), and she was very friendly with us.</span> <span id="s619">I used to go to the garden with her, with a donkey and a – a carriage.</span> <span id="s620">And then we used to come back from the garden, she had a garden outside the si – the town, she has a couple miles of – of vin, you know, what’s her name?</span> <span id="s621">Grapes, a couple miles of grapes she used to own.</span> <span id="s622">And she used to – we used to bring back grapes or peaches.</span> <span id="s623">And she said to me, the peaches bring to Bourguiba.</span> <span id="s624">The grapes bring to ben Yusef, the king of Morocco, and the cherries, whatever, the other stuff, she said, bring it to Ali.</span> <span id="s625">They had their own rooms, I used to bring it to them.</span> <span id="s626">And the king of Morocco, he had a man watching him.</span> <span id="s627">He had like another ma – Arab watching him.</span> <span id="s628">And the women who used to clean the room, they told me that he was blonde.</span> <span id="s629">He wore a little hat so you didn’t see his hair, so they told us that he is blonde, he is the only guy, he’s a blonde guy.</span> <span id="s630">So we didn’t believe [indecipherable] and he was watching the king, ben Yusef.</span> <span id="s631">Ben Yusef couldn’t speak French, he only spoke Arabic.</span> <span id="s632">Bourguiba spoke French and he helped me with my homework, yeah.</span> <span id="s633">And later, one of my friends became the mayor of Gassin, in France, next to San Tropez.</span> <span id="s634">And we went to ga – when I went to Gassin to s – meet my friend – he used to come to New York to see me too – he said to me, I want to write to Bourguiba, I wrote to Bourguiba, he won’t answer me.</span> <span id="s635">But if I write a letter, you sign it, he will answer you.</span> <span id="s636">So he wrote a letter to his office, and I signed it, and Bourguiba answered the letter, that’s the letter I showed you there, that you have now.</span> <span id="s637">Yeah.</span> <span id="s638">So – yeah, that’s it now, that’s about it now.</span> <span id="s639">There’s a – that’s it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Well, I want to thank you
