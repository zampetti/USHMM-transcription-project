Beginning Tape One
Question: Good morning, Fred.
Answer: Good morning.
Q: It’s very nice to meet you finally.
A: My pleasure.
Q: Tell me what -- when were you born?
A: In -- I was born in 1925.
Q: And the month?
A: It’s a -- February 18th.
Q: Febru -- February 18th?
A: Yes.
Q: And where were you born?
A: I was born in Frankfurt am Main, because there are two Frankfurts in Germany.
Q: Right. And what was your name?
A: The name originally, of my parents, I believe was L-o-w-y, with an umlaut on the O, which was converted to L-o-e-w-y.
Q: Right. And your birth name was Manfred, not --
A: Manfred.
Q: -- and -- and you then became F-Fred.
A: Freddie, and then Fred.
Q: And then Fred.
A: Freddie in the resistance [indecipherable]
Q: You were Freddie in the resistance?
A: Yes.
Q: Uh-huh. Now you were born in 1925, but your -- your father moved to Alsace in 1926, is that right?
A: That is correct.
Q: But you didn’t move then?
A: We moved about one or two years later. My father opened up a business over there, and we moved in afterwards.
Q: And do you know why he moved? I mean, did you hear later, as -- when you got older, why he left Germany?
A: Well, it’s an opportunity, you know, because Germany had [indecipherable] so he had opportunity to go there. But he didn’t know anyone, but he had a partner over there by the name of Camille Ernst, E-r-n-s-t.
Q: Right.
A: And th-this was a -- I guess, a metals recycling plant.
Q: And what was he doing when he was in Germany? What was his work? The same kind of work?
A: Actually, before he went there, he went to Israel. He was sent -- oh, Palestine at that time, to found a kibbutz, which was called Mahane Israel.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Mahane, M-a-h-a-n-e, Israel. I went on vacation there, years later, and I found the place again. It had been damaged because there was a combat going on there in 1948.
Q: Right.
A: So I have pictures with the walls all shot up, yeah.
Q: So he went there in the 20’s, in the early 20’s, before you were born?
A: Yes, in -- about ’22 or ’23.
Q: Right.
A: Somewhere like that.
Q: And what -- so that he didn’t have a business in Germany, when he came back, he decided to go to Alsace, you think?
A: I am not sure that time, because -- I do know that -- the funny part I heard is that he was once on the train traveling, and then he bought a home, sight unseen, from someone on the train. That -- so I guess he must have had money at the time, and if he had any occupation, I would not know.
Q: Right.
A: That’s the kind of a person he was, I mean, makes decisions on the spur of the moment.
Q: Right. Did you take after him?
A: No.
Q: No?
A: Sometimes I wish I did.
Q: Uh-huh. So when you moved to Alsace, you lived in a small town called sal --
A: Selestat.
Q: Selestat.
A: Yes. And that is where he went into business with Camille Ernst.
Q: Right. Which turned out much later to be very important.
A: Absolutely.
Q: Yes.
A: Yes.
Q: Now, what is metal recycling, do you know? Do --
A: All -- bot -- all iron, you know, is just like what they do over here nowadays, it’s -- material can be reused again.
Q: Right.
A: I guess they were ahead of his time, because they -- this is very popular now.
Q: So then he would sell it?
A: Yes.
Q: Sell the -- sell this --
A: I was too young to remember that --
Q: Right.
A: -- except I went to -- with him once to a place where there’s -- was all storage, is big storage area.
Q: Uh-huh. Were you fairly well off? Did you -- I mean, were you comfortable --
A: Oh yes.
Q: -- economically?
A: Yes, I’d say yes.
Q: You lived in a home or an apartment?
A: We had an apartment over there, yes.
Q: And you were -- you had a room with your brother, Max?
A: Correct, yes.
Q: And Max was how much older than you?
A: Three years older, he was born in 1922.
Q: In ’22?
A: Yes.
Q: And your sister?
A: My sister was born in 1920, five years older than me.
Q: Oh, I see, so she’s the eldest?
A: Yes.
Q: And your parents then were married when? In 1919?
A: In 1919, that is correct.
Q: 1919.
A: Yes.
Q: Right. So let’s talk a little about li -- what it was like when you were a kid at h -- at home.
A: Well, I guess --
Q: Do you remember?
A: One thing I remember very well, and it is, I used to go to school in Selestat, Collège Koeberle it was called, and some kids used to pick on me to the point where I did not want to go to school, and I was hiding near the house, in the house, actually, under the stairway, until a neighbor found me over there and reported me to my mom. So she took me to school at that time. I-It -- it -- it went on for a few days before she caught me.
Q: Really?
A: Yes.
Q: So you would stay there all day and then when it was time for kids to come home, you’d come out?
A: Correct.
Q: And your mother hadn’t figured this out?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: Because I was hidden under the staircase.
Q: So how did the neighbor find you? Why did the neighbor even look for you? Do you know?
A: I guess they were not looking for me, but they accidentally saw me, I guess, and --
Q: I see.
A: -- they ha -- reported me.
Q: Did you -- did you tell your mother why you were doing that?
A: Yes.
Q: And what did she say?
A: She took me to school and she told the teacher why I was missing classes.
Q: Uh-huh, right.
A: And the teacher then brought it up to the other students, and that ceased, and there was no more problem.
Q: So there was no more problem, they left you -- it was fine? Why was this kid picking on you?
A: Well, you know, there’s always big bullies in -- everywhere.
Q: Everywhere. Were you close with your father?
A: Yes.
Q: As a -- as a young -- as a young kid as well?
A: Oh yes.
Q: Yes?
A: Yes. All of us were very close, yes.
Q: So you were close with your mother as well?
A: Well, she was home at the time, and --
Q: Right, so your -- so --
A: -- my father used to, later on had a business where he used travel quite a bit. And as a matter of fact, at one time he was in the car, with the chauffeur, and he fell -- the chauffeur fell asleep, my father was asleep, and had an accident. So after the accident, we moved from Selestat to Strasbourg, which was another town of about 200,000 population. And then my father changed ac -- a -- ax -- activity, he went into the radio business. He had a big radio store, and then we moved to Colmar. I believed I showed you a picture of the exposition that we had.
Q: Right.
A: When some uncles c-came to visit us also.
Q: Right.
A: Yeah.
Q: So, was he hurt in that accident, is that why he changed to go to the radio business?
A: Well, he -- yes he was hurt there, and I guess he had some -- a compensation, and then he opened up the other business.
Q: But the other business was not with this man Camille Ernst. Did ern --
A: No, but ye --
Q: -- he stay -- did he stay in this other business?
A: No, apparently not.
Q: Apparently not. So it was over.
A: So we were l -- we lost contact with him completely.
Q: Right.
A: Yes.
Q: Do you remember moving to Strasbourg? Or you --
A: Oh yes.
Q: You do?
A: I lived there for a few years.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: I went there to the Lycée St-Jean, which is on the border -- on the -- next to river Ill, I-l-l.
Q: Right.
A: I remember it very well. I had to walk quite a ways from home to there.
Q: To school?
A: To school.
Q: Yeah?
A: I enjoyed it though.
Q: You liked that?
A: Yes. We lived near the courtyard. This was a -- it’s interesting. I -- it’s a big park, and now they have the United Nations building on the courtyard. It’s a -- the u -- I’m not sure exactly its function, but it has to do with the United Nation, o-or -- or Europe -- European community. It’s a big building over there, yes. I went to visit their museum.
Q: Was it difficult moving so -- so often as such a young person, because you went to -- to Selestat and Strasbourg, and the Colbear --
A: Colmar.
Q: I mean, Colmar, rather.
A: No. I mean, you know, I was young and, you get used to the changes.
Q: You get used to it.
A: Right.
Q: Your friends, were -- were you going to a public school so that you were with Jewish students as well as Gentile students?
A: Yes. Absolutely, yes.
Q: And di -- were your friends mixed, so you didn’t have a -- you --
A: No, mixed, all sorts.
Q: Yeah. And did you live in a neighborhood where -- where it was both Jewish and Gentile?
A: Oh yes, yes.
Q: Was -- was yours a religious family, or not?
A: They came from religious families, yes.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And they did observe the shala -- sha -- Shabbat, and the [indecipherable]
Q: The Sabbath, yes.
A: Yes.
Q: Yes. And holidays? A: And holidays, absolutely yes.
Q: Did you go to synagogue?
A: Yes.
Q: You did? On a regular basis?
A: No. Usually I went on holidays.
Q: Were you kosher?
A: Yes.
Q: You were?
A: Absolutely, absolutely. [inaudible]
Q: So you were very conscious of being --
A: Oh yes.
Q: -- Jewish, and -- and the traditions?
A: Oh yes. I remember in Colmar, we used to have the [indecipherable] holidays.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: And they took all the children, and they had them go in the circle around a [indecipherable] and they used to hand us candy bars -- bags, okay.
Q: Right.
A: It was very, very nice.
Q: You liked that.
A: I liked that, yes.
Q: Because that was a fun holiday.
A: I had a sweet tooth.
Q: Yes. And you had a lot of friends as -- growing up?
A: Oh yes. I think so.
Q: And w-w-were they often at your house? Or --
A: Well, occasionally.
Q: Occasionally.
A: There is one thing I objected to at that time.
Q: Mm.
A: My father wanted to have me go to the synagogue on Friday -- on Saturday afternoon with the other children, and I just didn’t l-like that too much.
Q: You wanted to have your Saturdays to yourself?
A: Yes.
Q: So what happened, who won?
A: I guess I won.
Q: You won. So what was it -- what was it like at -- at home? Were your parents very affectionate, did they talk with you a lot?
A: Oh yes. But they had to make a living, they were busy. My mother had the business on her own.
Q: Oh, she did?
A: Y-Yeah, what they call bonneterie, which are underwear, you know, that’s -- it was her [indecipherable] business, and my father had his business, so they were traveling. I mean, in Colmar they had the -- the open air markets --
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Twice a week, on Thursday and Saturday. And then my mom was over there [indecipherable] store, and it was interesting.
Q: She had her own store?
A: Yes. In the [indecipherable]
Q: Now, was that unusual for a woman to be doing that kind of work, or not so much?
A: Well, no.
Q: It wasn’t?
A: I don’t think so.
Q: Did you go to that store also and work, sometimes?
A: Well, yes, b -- I-I didn’t work there, but we had actually, like a small a-apartment behind it.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: Or, at least a few rooms.
Q: Right.
A: So I used to go there, too.
Q: But that’s not where you lived --
A: Oh no.
Q: -- you lived in another place, but you were able to just be there and so you could play, as a kid?
A: Oh yes.
Q: Did you eat dinners together?
A: Oh yes, absolutely, absolutely. Breakfast and dinners.
Q: So all the -- wi-with Max, and Erna’s the name of your sister.
A: My sister, that’s right.
Q: And Berthe is your mother?
A: Yes.
Q: And Elias is your father.
A: My father, correct.
Q: Right. So did you talk politics when you grew up?
A: No, but I was very much interested in things that went on in the world.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: I used to read the papers --
Q: You did?
A: -- all the time, yes. First of all, for breakfast, I had my dictionary in front of me.
Q: Your dictionary, right.
A: For lunch, I had my dictionary in front of me, and [indecipherable] too, and I just read it from cover to cover. I mean, I find it very interesting, I liked words. I followed the a-attack of Italy on Ethiopia.
Q: Really?
A: I got interested in that. I was interested in the revolution in Spain, Franco revolution.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: I followed that very closely, too. And the events in Germany. Yeah, I -- I was very much interested in these sort of things, yes.
Q: But you’re born in 1925, so when Hitler takes over --
A: In ’30 th --
Q: In ’33.
A: Three, yes.
Q: You’re eight years old.
A: But I was reading papers.
Q: But you’re -- but you were -- so, when you said you were sitting with the dictionary, does that mean you were using the dictionary and reading the newspaper, or you were just reading the dictionary?
A: No, no, no, no, no. Dictionary.
Q: You were just reading the dictionary?
A: Yes, and I found time for newspaper, too. Now, in 1933, I was interested in what was going on, because my relatives lived in Germany --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- that time, Frankfurt. My grandfather lived there, my uncles. It was a family of eight -- 10 children, actually. My mother was one of the 10.
Q: Wow.
A: So, one of her sisters had -- moved to Brazil, and she came to Colmar -- no, to Selestat on the way to Brazil, she stayed a few days with us.
Q: Right.
A: But then we still had eight brothers over there, a-and sisters. One of her brothers was killed by the Nazis on the Kristallnacht. What happened is, when they were looking, the police was looking for the Jews to arrest them, he was in the cellar. And when the two policemen came down there, they found him -- okay, I should go back a little bit. One of the neighbors in the house watched my cousin, his son, bring him food, and followed him and saw that he was going to the cellar and -- where my uncle was hidden. So he reported him to the police. When the police came, he was making believe that he was chopping some wood for the fireplace, and the Germans accused him of having threatened him with the ax.
Q: With the ax, hm.
A: And they said that he died of a heart attack. My -- my cousin, the older one, his oldest son, opened up the casket later on. He found out that he had been beaten in the face, and shot through the heart.
Q: Wow.
A: So there was no question about that he had been murdered, you know. So his mother sent him to England on the Kindertransport to get him out of the way --
Q: The older -- the oldest, right.
A: -- because he was the oldest one. The other one follow -- the middle one followed later on. The youngest one is the one that the neighbor had spied on.
Q: Right.
A: And he remained with the mother. She went to Belgium, and I met her there after the war. She was hiding in a farm, under a false name also.
Q: Right, right. So between ’33, and ’39, are you discussing politics in your home, or you’re just -- you’re reading the newspapers and seeing what’s going on in Germany?
A: Well, y-yes, we -- we discussed what was going on in Germany, because my mother was very much concerned about her family there.
Q: Right.
A: And then in ’39 -- my father had family in Poland, so he was concerned about it too.
Q: Concerned about family, too, right.
A: And what happened, in the Kristallnacht, my other uncle, one of my mom’s brothers, Willie, was arrested, and he went to the camp of -- starts with an R, I forget the name now. It -- this became a woman’s -- women’s camp.
Q: Ravensbrück.
A: Ravensbrück, that’s correct.
Q: Yeah.
A: Yes. And he died over there in 1941.
Q: Huh.
A: His wife had passed away before the war, so he had a daughter, and apparently, she was in a home for orphans at the time.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: I found out later on that the Nazi kids broke into the orphanage and attacked th-the -- the girls over there.
Q: I see.
A: Then they had a -- a -- a death certificate saying that she died of a -- a lung infection. I spoke to relatives later on, she said no, apparently she committed suici-cide after what happened.
Q: Mm. Mm-hm. So ha -- you’re not hearing about this, however, until much later, right?
A: Oh yes.
Q: You -- it’s -- there was just a lot of worry about what’s -- what’s been going --
A: Well, about my uncles, yes, I found out [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: -- in time.
Q: Right.
A: Another uncle, Uncle Meyer was also arrested, went to Buchenwald, but was released when he got visas to come to United States.
Q: So he was in the United States.
A: He was saved.
Q: Right.
A: And another uncle, Nathan, and his sister, Fanny, went to the United States before the war. They had some papers to see some relatives over here.
Q: Right. So your -- is your -- does your father come from a large family, or is -- was he the only child?
A: There were eight --
Q: There were eight children?
A: -- children. One girl and seven brothers. One of the brothers came to visit us, went back to Holland, then he went back to Germany and he disappeared in Poland in the end. He died there.
Q: Uh-huh, right.
A: He was murdered, actual, in Bialystok, I understand.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: Another brother went to the United States. And then my father, so that took care of three of the brothers, and the other ones all perished.
Q: Right.
A: And so did my aun -- my grandmother. She lived in a --
Q: On your father’s side.
A: On the father’s side.
Q: Right.
A: She was in a small village called Zegocina, Z-e-g-o-c-i-n-a. And what happened is a small village, was only a few Jewish people there. I understand three Jewish people living there, and the Nazis had -- wa -- after the occupation of Poland, requested that they come to Bochnia, a larger city, to a cer -- bils -- or a certain portion there wa -- became the ghetto. So the neighbors, the Polish neighbors were forced to put my grandmother in one of their carts, and bring her over there, too. She was no -- in no way capable of traveling by foot.
Q: Right.
A: And she disappeared also.
Q: Right. Is -- let me go back to you as a kid. Besides being interested in the dictionary, what else were you interested in? It’s a very interesting interest, it’s very unusual to have a child --
A: I was interested in the words, and how to spell.
Q: In the words, and how to spell.
A: I was th -- that -- I was very good at that, the spelling.
Q: And -- and what was the dictionary, French?
A: LaRousse.
Q: LaRousse
A: LaRousse [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: [indecipherable]. It’s a big dictionary, by the way.
Q: Yes, it’s a very big dictionary.
A: In French.
Q: Did you get through the whole thing?
A: Oh yes.
Q: Really?
A: And then back again sometimes. I mean, I didn't do it all in one -- one month or so, it -- it --
Q: No.
A: -- took time.
Q: No. But did you start with A and then go through?
A: All the way.
Q: Really?
A: Yes. I picked up a few Latin words the same time.
Q: I bet you did.
A: Oh, th-the etymology of the words, you know?
Q: Right. Was your brother and sister interested in the words in the same way, or were you very different?
A: I don’t know, but they were bookworms, also.
Q: They were bookworms?
A: Yes.
Q: So all of you were bookworms?
A: Yes, that’s right.
Q: And your parents too?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: No. They -- not so much. Although they read a -- a local newspaper in Alsatian, in German dialect, you know.
Q: Right.
A: But -- but they didn’t s -- they didn't read any French books or anything like that. I guess my [indecipherable] had some German books, yes.
Q: Right. Hm. What sort of a personality did your mother have and your father have? Did you -- because they both --
A: Real busy.
Q: -- especially your father turns into a very imaginative kind of person, taking a lot of responsibility in a very difficult time.
A: Absolutely
Q: Did you see that early on? Do -- could you -- could you tell?
A: No, his one concern was for his family.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: How to make a living. It was difficult at the time too, because in Paris you could not be employed, as a foreigner, you know, not to take jobs away from local people, so they had to be self-employed. So this is very difficult.
Q: Right, yes.
A: Especially since he did not speak French either. Alt -- al -- Al-Alsatian and German.
Q: So he spoke Alsatian and German, he never learned French?
A: Not at that time, no. When he went to southern France, then he picked it up fine, yes.
Q: Uh-huh. But still he wasn’t fluent, so you were fluent.
A: Yes.
Q: And you could speak Alsatian and German and French?
A: And French, yes.
Q: And some English.
A: And -- and some English. Not too much English at that time.
Q: Right.
A: My mom was very concerned about us, and she always was very motherly [indecipherable]
Q: Yeah, yes. Were -- before the war, were you able to see relatives in Germany? You never went to Poland, am I correct?
A: No.
Q: But you did go back to Germany --
A: To Germany, yes, we went --
Q: -- you visited.
A: -- to weddings over there, the family weddings, you know, and I went back at least, I remember, twice, for sure.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: Probably three times, but twice for sure --
Q: Right.
A: -- to the -- no, went to three different weddings over there.
Q: Three different weddings?
A: Yes.
Q: Before the war?
A: Yes.
Q: Really? So did you -- did you feel close with these people, or -- or not too much?
A: There were two uncles and one aunt.
Q: That’s all.
A: So we were very close to them.
Q: Oh you -- you -- so you were --
A: The family was very close.
Q: I see.
A: What happened at that time, my grandmother had passed away in 1929, I believe. So my grandfather had eight children [indecipherable] for a long time, and my mother, being the oldest daughter, took over for my grandmother, so she was in charge of the family, the children. So she had her hands full, but then she got married in 1919, and then my grandfather had his hands full, too.
Q: Uh-huh. So then he took over at that point.
A: Yes.
Q: Yes. So your mother was a mother long before she was a biological mother.
A: Correct.
Q: Yes.
A: Correct.
Q: Well, the war comes in 1939, and you’re in --
A: Colmar.
Q: -- Colmar, right?
A: Yes.
Q: And I understand your f -- your father was -- first of all, you had learned how to be a civil defense person, right?
A: No, no.
Q: Both -- no.
A: What -- what happened is that my father volunteered. He was, what 40 -- see, ’39 -- 49 years -- was it 49? He was about 49 years old.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: While he wouldn’t volunteer for the service, his age was [indecipherable] children, but he volunteered for civil defense.
Q: Right.
A: And they immediately put him in charge of a post in a school where they expected possibly the Germans are using war gas. So he was in a disinfection station. And he organized it in an excellent way. He got -- and made sure that the -- all the equipment that they needed, and that they appreciated it very much, what he did for this place in -- this was an interesting one, in case of a failure of power, he had bicycles put in there, remove -- well, they put them on -- on the stand basically, and they had generators on the bike.
Q: Right, so they could use the bicycles.
A: For lights.
Q: Right.
A: That was a very --
Q: Very smart.
A: -- ingenious at that --
Q: Yes.
A: [indecipherable] time, since they had no money to buy all the equipment they needed. And then we had training over there, the Dr. Sitlow was in charge civil defense, and he came on and give us training and first aid and decontamination. Now why -- this is actually how I got involved, because my father says, “Come on down to the classes, this is very interesting for you, too.” This how I involved, I was about 13 - 14 years old.
Q: Cause you were 14, right.
A: Yes, and he got his diploma, I think I have it with me.
Q: And you got a diploma.
A: I got one too, I -- I didn’t bring it with me, I couldn’t find it at the time, but I, the same as he.
Q: So where is Max, how come he doesn’t say to Max to go, but he says to you to go?
A: Max was employed.
Q: He was employed?
A: Yes, he was a shoe salesman in a store.
Q: I see. Now, this civil defense work was done because they were afraid of the Nazi attack, am I right?
A: Yes, we are close to the border.
Q: Yes.
A: So, no, the -- the Maginot Line was there, but you can’t come in with planes, you can’t come close [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: You know. So as a matter of fact, at one time on a Sunday, we had about seven or eight alarms going off, planes coming over, to the point where you refused to go back in the cellar. They had the civil defense sa -- protection of the house, but we are sick and tired of going up and down, up and down, up and down.
Q: So what’d you do?
A: Just stayed in the apartment.
Q: Yes?
A: You know, I guess I had [indecipherable]
Q: Did the planes come back?
A: Well, they came back about seven times, or -- or more.
Q: Really?
A: Seven to 10 times in one day.
Q: So how long were you working at this yo -- or your father was head of the post before you --
A: Well, from August, or September of 1939, til we left Colmar. What happened is the Germans invaded Belgium on the 10th of May, 1940.
Q: Right.
A: So things got aya -- off of that point. And the Germans captured Belgium, the French resistance broke down.
Q: Right.
A: They came across the Vosges mountains, which was the -- here is [indecipherable]. We are in Colmar in the Alsace in the plains, and the Vosges mountains, the Germans came around because the Maginot Line was facing one way. All the guns were facing --
Q: The other way.
A: -- east.
Q: Yeah.
A: And they couldn't be turned round. That was a really stupid move on the part of the French army.
Q: Right.
A: But they thought that the -- it was only meant as a temporary measure to give chance to France to mobilize its troops.
Q: Right.
A: This was the purpose was of the Maginot Line.
Q: Right. We’re going to have to stop the tape at this point, and we’ll start again right there.

Beginning Tape Two
Q: Fred, you were describing the German attack of France.
A: Okay, so the Germans attacked through Luxembourg and Belgium --
Q: Right.
A: And Holland, of course. And they came around the mountain, the Vosges mountains. On the 15th of June, 1940, they open up with the artillery on the other side of the Rhine. We were about 19 kilometers from the Rhine, so it did not affect us directly, but we knew things were going wrong. So my father was on duty at the zo -- station, yeah, on the 14th, and already he is -- people that work for him in the first aid station, start to question, when the Germans come in, should we salute them heil Hitler, or should we salute them the French way? My father says, “Oh-oh, this doesn’t sound good.” So immediately he went to his superior and asked for a transfer out to go to interior of France. He received an ordre démission. It’s an order that the authorities have to help him out to go to where he has to go, and this was Bordeaux, on the other end of France. We were told to be at the railroad station at --
Q: Can I stop you for a minute?
A: Certainly.
Q: Whe -- when your father realizes that everybody around him is trying to figure out how to accommodate the Germans.
A: Right.
Q: So does he think of himself as vulnerable because he’s Jewish, you think?
A: Absolutely. It’s cl --
Q: He does? It’s very clear to him.
A: Oh yes, because of the -- what happened to his two brother-in-laws.
Q: What happened to --
A: The brother-in-laws.
Q: Uh-huh, right. And he knew that.
A: Sure, he knew that.
Q: Right. So when he goes to his superior, does he say look, I -- you know, this is dangerous for me and family and I have got to get out.
A: There was no question --
Q: There was no question.
A: He wa -- he will be given the authority to leave, and to get the help of -- assistance of [indecipherable] authorities --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- to go to Bordeaux.
Q: Okay, so you’re going to go to Bordeaux the next day.
A: No, we tried.
Q: You tried.
A: On the 15th, we go -- we are told to go -- be at railroad station at 10 o’clock in the morning. We go there, the train had left about si -- seven o’clock in the morning. That was the last train out of Colmar.
Q: So do you think you -- he was given bad information on purpose --
A: No.
Q: -- or people just didn’t know?
A: No, I guess they were realizing the situation was worse than they thought, and they had to leave earlier.
Q: Uh-huh, I see.
A: So we had actually left the house with a few things on our back, and a bicycle. We figured, oh, we are going to be gone for a short time, and be back soon, so we didn’t take too much, except what we could take with us. Silverware, and food, and that’s about it, you know. So my father decides we are going to walk.
Q: To Bordeaux?
A: On the road, on the road. So we go south, and there is a Protestant minister, he comes along with a horse drawn carriage, and he seems to realize what goes on, and he invites my sister and my mother on the cart, because he had room for two people. And he rides on a few miles, and -- kilometers, and drops them off when he takes it off-road. We, in the meantime catch up with my mom and sister, and quickly walking, I’m not sure how lo -- how far we walking, we must have walked between eight and 10 miles. Along comes this army truck that is going back -- was retreating, and they pick us up. With the bicycle, too. That was wonderful. There was nobody else on the road except us.
Q: Really?
A: When the minister left us, he says, “God be wi -- wi -- will be with you.” He realized what was going on. And so we --
Q: Does it -- does it surprise you now that nobody else was on the road, that you were the only ones on the road?
A: Right.
Q: Doesn’t that seem surprising?
A: Well, you know, the local people didn’t have to worry about the Germans.
Q: Germans.
A: Other ones may not have the means, or no -- no car, or so --
Q: Right.
A: Remember that the French army had the authority to requisition cars for their needs.
Q: I see.
A: Because there are only so many army trucks or whatnot, and they had all -- also requisitioned our car.
Q: Uh-huh, so you didn’t ha -- I see, you --
A: The military. So we didn’t have transportation.
Q: -- didn’t have a car.
A: That’s right.
Q: What did your dad tell you and the kids? What di -- were you frightened when you were on this trip?
A: Well, we were very concerned, of course. We were not pleased to -- to leave, you know, on foot or so. But we thought it was an emergency, and my parents know what’s best for us.
Q: Right.
A: So the truck drove us for some distance, and had dropped us off. Along comes this so -- young recruit, actually it was a civilian in a car, and he has orders to report to a certain area. So he takes us on. We are driving down to Dole . . . Dijon, that area, and things got very hot. There was a big tank -- gas tank, burning. I’m not sure if the army had done it to destroy it, or if the Germans had machine-gunned it, but it was burning at night. That gave us a chance to drive at night with, you know -- but at that point we run into traffic.
Q: Mm?
A: And got really hectic. If somebody run out of gas, or had a pa -- had a problem with his car, the cars behind him stopped, pushed him off the road, with the people inside.
Q: Really?
A: Nothing get in the way. They had to go on. It was terrible. There is no es -- it’s me, me, me and I don’t care about anybody else.
Q: It’s really scary.
A: It was very scary, especially when they don’t let the people get out of the car.
Q: Right, right. So you saw that?
A: Yes. And we got to [indecipherable], we got to Rouen, we got into a train, and oh, the démission gave us permission to go on any train, in any -- get any assistance from the military or civilians. So the train stops a few miles down, and they tell us to get out. No, the -- at -- the train stops in the station, and there’s a Italian plane flying over. And we say, oh gosh, they were machine gunners.
Q: Right.
A: They -- it was in front of our compartment, it was a flatbed with a machine gun, right, a French machine gun, and about three or four French soldiers. That was a bad situation because civilians and military -- if you see troops there, you have a right to shoot at them.
Q: Right.
A: If you believe in the Geneva Convention that civilians are protected.
Q: Right.
A: Then came the order, all civilians off the train. We are expecting an attack by Italian planes. So we get out of the station. I think it was just a trick. The French authorities want to have the train to themselves to put more troops on there. We go outside of the station and there my father meets a couple from Frankfurt -- he never knew -- I mean, he knew who they were, and they didn’t speak French. And they were -- then we -- we gave them, we talked to them. They owned a movie -- a -- a movie i-in Frankfurt, and my parents knew about that. So they said, what are you doing here? They said, well, they’re here from Belgium, they had escaped from Belgium, and they were completely lost. So my father decides, we are going back on the train now. And he says, “You come with us, and don’t say a word.” There is a soldier there with a fixed bayonet to prevent people from going on. My father says, “You follow me.” And we go by, he presents the order, and we walk right through. The soldier did not even have time to read it. He let us go by. I mean, my father bluffed him.
Q: Right.
A: Get back on the train -- excuse me -- and then the train takes off.
Q: When you saw this, were you surprised at how your father was acting, or was this --
A: I guess h-he -- he surprised me, but I know I -- I just follow orders. He says, you know -
Q: No, I understand that, but it did surprise you that your father did that?
A: Oh, it surprised me very, yes. Especially because the people there --
Q: Right.
A: -- come with us, and -- and have their luggage, too, you know? So --
Q: So, clearly, the situation brought something out in your father.
A: It’s a decision -- they have -- time to make a decision.
Q: And he just made the decisions and just did things, right?
A: Then we go on the train, and now in the com-compartment there are some ci-civilians coming on, and there is a guy from the -- a civilian, he has a French army pack with him.
Q: A French army?
A: Pack.
Q: Pack. Oh, an a -- a --
A: A -- a -- a -- for a -- outfit.
Q: Right.
A: Right. He was in c -- i-in civilian clothes. And the -- the gendarmes are coming now, and checking for deserters. My father says to the guy, “You better throw that pack out or they’re going to arrest you.” Because he was a desert-serter. So he threw the pack out. He saved his neck, probably, too, because he got [indecipherable]
Q: I’m sure he saved his neck.
A: Then, to continue --
Q: But your father was obviously so observant of what was going on --
A: Oh yes.
Q: -- so that he could make these kinds of decisions.
A: Oh yes.
Q: It was quite amazing.
A: Then there were some young students on the train, and they had mon -- a -- harmonicas and they would sing th -- tha -- playing music. It was very encouraging, you know.
Q: Yeah.
A: And my mother gave them some bread, too, they were st -- starving.
Q: So you gave them food?
A: Yeah, bread.
Q: Yeah.
A: We had -- that’s all we had is bread at the time. We -- we shared it with them. And then we stopped in the station, and th-there was a wine -- there was another tr-train on the other side of the rail, and we looked out there, there’s a -- a soldier laying on the floor. The train had been machine gunned, and this was a tank truck of wine, full of holes, and the soldiers were just laying down letting the wine go into his mouth. He was so amusing, you know.
Q: He was the only -- only soldier doing this? [indecipherable]
A: He was [indecipherable] doing it for free, you know?
Q: Right.
A: I mean -- and then we go back on the train. We didn’t get -- we didn’t get off the train because we didn’t want to t-take a chance on train leaving and leave us behind.
Q: Right, right. So you stayed on the train?
A: Yes. Different station, we run out of water, so farmers come over and sell us water, at a franc, one franc per glass.
Q: That’s a lot of money.
A: It was, and taking advantage of a situation.
Q: Right.
A: And another [indecipherable] we had what they call a buffet, in French, in the railroad stations. And they had food at exorbitant prices, too.
Q: Mm.
A: We bought whatever we could there, and then after about nine days, we wound up in Bordeaux.
Q: Nine days.
A: Took us nine days traveling. And si -- the -- or the train stops and [indecipherable] and try and get food.
Q: So there’s clearly not much chance to wash yourself anywhere, right?
A: Oh no, oh no.
Q: There’s nothing like that.
A: Not -- no, nothing like that.
Q: And are there bathroom facilities on the train?
A: Ah --
Q: Do you remember?
A: I don’t recall. I know -- maybe -- probably you had to go outside in the station’s -- regular train stations there.
Q: When it stopped.
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah.
A: And as you go on the train stop, we go to the gare, which was a railroad station, and this one guy comes over, and it was a competitor of my fa-father, he was in the radio business in Colmar.
Q: He was in the radio business?
A: Yes, he was a competitor of my father.
Q: He was a competitor, uh-huh.
A: So he asked my father, “What are you doing here?” He says, “Well, we just came from Colmar.” He said, “I’ll find a -- a place for you.” For one night he put us up in a -- in an apartment. Then, they were sending these troops on the railroad station that had been abandoned by their officers. They didn’t speak French, they had no money, they had no food. And they were looking at us, you know, jealously because we were eating. So my mom said, sh -- let’s share bread with tha -- them. There were about four or five of them, you know, so we share the bread with them, and they were so happy, because they had no-nothing.
Q: But that was your mother who said that, yes?
A: It’s very emotional. Anyway --
Q: It’s very what?
A: Emotional.
Q: Oh, emotional, yes.
A: Very -- now. So --
Q: Why -- why was it so emotional, do you think?
A: It is for me now.
Q: Now.
A: That I think about it, you know, because m-mother was thinking of them, of the soldiers, that they need help, too.
Q: Right.
A: And then, in the night -- or the night before, Italian planes had bombed Bordeaux, and it was time to get out. So we go to the -- is -- Bordeaux is a port city, so we go to the port, and to the [indecipherable] authorities, and he showed them the p -- the pass, we have to go to Bordeaux, and we want to go to England. The -- the -- the officer says, “Okay, come back to -- tomorrow, and there’s a ship going to England,” and he’s prepared the papers for us, too. Next morning, same thing happened, the ship had left. Last ship. So, then the ar -- neighbors -- the papers come out that the armistice has been signed, the German ath-authorities -- army will occupy northern France and the whole western coast --
Q: Right.
A: -- including Bordeaux, all the way to -- to Spain. It’s time for us to get -- move on again.
Q: And you’re only there what, for a day or two, few days.
A: Yeah. One day.
Q: Right.
A: One day.
Q: One day.
A: This is -- this was about the 23rd -- I don’t know the exact date, but this came in the paper there. And then my father says, “Let’s go on to Toulouse.” Toulouse -- we had a map, so we knew which was occupied zone, which was not occupied. So we go in the train, and in Toulouse we got off, and there are thousands of people in Toulouse. People came from Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, from all over.
Q: Right.
A: The north of France, from Germany, Austria.
Q: And why was Toulouse such a attractive --
A: This was a large city.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: A large city in a non-occupied zone.
Q: Right.
A: And you could like go close to the border to see -- to the occupied zone, we were not interested in that. And this was the --
Q: Right. You wanted to get as far away as you could.
A: Yes, and this was not too far from the Spanish border either. So we go there, and they have big plaques -- how can I say? Blackboards where people -- I look for this one, I look for that one. This a-army unit, and this a -- a -- so --
Q: Right, right.
A: -- you know, they were trying to find each other over there. And then there was a big cab -- a sik -- a big place for the refugees to get food. So we went over there, and there [indecipherable] line over there, too, you know? You know, was terrible, I mean, it took long hours to get there. And then we do find an apartment, and find a small place at -- an old man there, rue Petraque, P-e-t-r-a-q-u-e. Petraque was a Greek, or -- or -- or an poet or something like that. [indecipherable]
Q: Yes, right.
A: So, we go there, and the man is very nice to us, and he says, “Look, we have no beds over here, but I know a place where we can get you mattresses.” So this was a factory that had shut down, and they had mattresses for their employees. We go over there with a handcart and we buy three or four mattresses, o-or five mattresses, and he brings us -- bring home to us again. So tha -- this a place to sleep on.
Q: So what was this place like?
A: It was a small house, he had him and his son in the house.
Q: Right.
A: And he had, I guess, two rooms available, so we slept there on the floor. And next day, or a few days later, I helped him, he was putting a -- a floor board, replacing the old board, and I helped him out.
Q: And you helped him out.
A: He -- he -- he went to buy the lumber and all that, and I helped him put s-strips in there --
Q: Right.
A: -- and nail them on. And then we had to -- we were there a few days. We went to Polish consulate to get a passport. We did not have a passport.
Q: You had no -- you -- you -- your father had no passport at all?
A: No, he had a Spanish carte étrangère, foreigner --
Q: Right.
A: In France. It’s a green card.
Q: Right.
A: It’s like a passport also, different pages. So we get to the consulate, big lines over there. Finally we get to the consul, I was with him, and he would like to have passport. The girl says, “Where were you born?” In so and so, western Poland. He speaks Polish with the consul. He says, “But you have no passport.” That’s why I am here for. I want to go get the documentation. He says, “But you left Poland in 1919, that was when -- or ’18 -- when you became aus -- it was Austrian before that, so you’re not actually Polish,” he says, “I can’t give you a passport, except [indecipherable] exception, your son is -- the oldest one is 19 years old?” No, 17 or eight -- “18 years old, and if he joins the Polish army, I will give him a passport.” He said, “Thank you very much.” [indecipherable] We left.
Q: So they were going to take Max in order to give you --
A: To him only. They would give him a passport.
Q: But not for any --
A: Big -- big favor.
Q: But not for anybody else.
A: Not to us, no. So we walked out.
Q: So you’re in France without any sort of identification except that you’re foreigners?
A: That’s right, there’s foreign -- like, it’s a green card of about eight, 10 pages, I believe, and it’s like that.
Q: Right.
A: But only my parents had that, and my brother. My sister also, I believe, because they were employed, so they had the same thing.
Q: And you had nothing?
A: No, because I didn’t -- I wasn’t working. I -- I -- I was not a certain age, I didn’t need an --
Q: Right.
A: -- identity card. So what happened then? We are back in the house -- one morning, about five o’clock in the morning, knock on the door.
Q: This is the same house, with this -- where you bought these mattresses, yes? Or are you at a different place?
A: Where we lived, where we stayed at. Where we stay overnight.
Q: Where you were staying, right?
A: Mm-hm. And I -- as -- was going to say [indecipherable]
Q: Was there a knock on the door?
A: Knock on the door, and then they had these inspectors -- inspector, and come with us, they asked us. They put us in what they call a black Mar -- Maria, this is a police wagon, and I said, “Why you are arrestings us?” Don’t ask questions.
Q: These are not Germans, these are French.
A: No, the French police.
Q: Yes.
A: And they pick up -- and they go from house to house, where they have foreigners, and they pick them up. And they were all Jewish except two -- some Russians. The cart is full now, and then I found out later what th -- the course was. The French government in Lotrower issued an order that all those who came to France after 1936 should be sent to concentration camp.
Q: Right.
A: But the authorities had also the latitude to arrest anybody that came before 1936.
Q: Right.
A: And prefect did not like Jews particularly, so he said it doesn’t make a difference what the -- time they came in here.
Q: Take them.
A: As long as -- yes, take them. The reason originally of that was that France, Vichy government was against Communists, came from Spain, from the 1936 revolution. So, they had those in mind first, and then anybody that came from Belgium, Holland and Germany, and [indecipherable] after ’36.
Q: And what year was that ruling put into place, did you --
A: In 1940, in November. 1940.
Q: 1940 in November, uh-huh.
A: Yes.
Q: Okay.
A: Then we were put in small camp, I forgot the name of it, Recebedou, or an --
Q: This was before Agde? A: Yes, this was in the area of Toulouse.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: So, my father knew somebody in the prefecture, in the governor’s office, who had just -- you signed in -- as foreigner you had to register.
Q: Right.
A: So he said, maybe this guy can help us out. So he asked the camp commander, captain -- the camp was actually surrounded by boy scouts, that’s what I had -- in charge of the camp. [indecipherable] captain --
Q: This is not Agde, this is --
A: No, no, this is to --
Q: -- this is Toulouse, near Toulouse.
A: -- near Toulouse, near -- near Toulouse, yes.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: I -- I remember it was --
Q: Boy scouts surrounded the --
A: Boy scouts. They -- th-they not -- they didn’t arrest the people, they let them go in and out if they had some justification. It wasn’t a camp to hold them.
Q: Oh, right, so it was a holding camp of some kind --
A: Right.
Q: -- a transit camp.
A: So my father asked the captain to be authorized to go to Toulouse to meet this man from prefecture. Okay, fine. So him and my fa -- and my sister hitchhiked to Toulouse, there was the prefecture -- to see this man, and thi -- they ask him, why didn’t you tell us that the workers who are [indecipherable] you know, you could have given us a warning. The guy sh-shook his sh-shoulders. You know. Sorry about that, you know. I cannot do anything for you. They go back to the camp because we are still there [indecipherable] us, my mom, my brother and me.
Q: Right.
A: And then they say okay, everybody let’s march railroad station. They pug u -- put us in a cattle car. French have a fancy name for it, eight horses or 40 men, huit hommes -- quarante hommes ou huit chevaux, eight men -- o-or eight horses.
Q: Eight horses, right.
A: And put us in there. No windows. So it had maybe a small opening for air. And the cabin had a few other people in it. And the train goes on the way, for hours and hours and hours. At night we arrive, I believe is Montpellier. And in Montpellier they open up the door, and they let Red Cross nurses give us some water.
Q: Give you water?
A: Yeah.
Q: Uh-huh. Then they close the doors again, and we continue to Agde. Everybody out, it’s middle of the night. We had to march to the village of Agde, you know, with luggage and whatnot. Was quite a march, and then went into the camp, and they say well, go to -- guys over here. Women on one side, one -- some guys, one camp, men on the other camp. And they put us in camp, they had -- a clo -- a cap -- a -- a head of the barrack, and he assigned us places on the straw, and there is a double layer straws on the bottom, and on top there. I don’t remember if it had 40 or 50 people in a barrack.
Q: Fred, let’s go back a little bit. When they came that morning to pick you up --
A: Yes.
Q: You were home?
A: Yes. We were sleeping, at --
Q: So the whole family was home.
A: -- five o’clock in the morning.
Q: Oh, it’s five o’clock in the morning?
A: Yes.
Q: So this must have been very scary to you --
A: It was, it was.
Q: -- you were 14 -- y-you were 15 now -- 16? 15 years old.
A: Fi -- 40 -- 40 -- yeah, right, right.
Q: Do you -- did your father and mother explain to you that these kinds of things might happen --
A: No.
Q: -- or there was no idea?
A: We never expected.
Q: You didn’t expect it at all?
A: No. I mean, after all, you live in France, so you don’t expect have a-anybody, whether they were foreigners, or -- or -- or -- or French, or --
Q: You expected to receive --
A: -- or came before or after [indecipherable]. There was no -- we did not know of the law, of the ‘36 law.
Q: You didn’t -- you didn’t know that law?
A: No, found out afterwards.
Q: I see.
A: No.
Q: So it wasn’t publicized --
A: No.
Q: -- as far as you knew.
A: It was only through the authorities, so they could go ahead --
Q: And do what they --
A: -- and people [indecipherable] themselves and -- and disappear.
Q: So did you have any time to -- to take something with you?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: Just get dressed --
Q: And go.
A: -- go. Yeah.
Q: But you described when you were -- when you went to Agde that people were carrying luggage, but you were not?
A: Well, we had -- well, I should say there was a -- a few things, possibly, I’m sorry.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: We lib -- we did not have time to pack, nothing. Just --
Q: Just a few things.
A: -- what you -- what you can carry, you know [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: I -- I guess [indecipherable] because yes, we had some things we could carry, like clothing or whatever.
Q: Right
A: But [indecipherable] you know.
Q: But you probably didn’t have much stuff to begin with, because --
A: That is right.
Q: -- you had left Colmar so fast.
A: That is correct.
Q: So you really --
A: We are just -- we are leaving this behind there.
Q: Right, right. Let’s -- let’s stop the tape, instead of moving on.
A: Yes.
End of Tape Two
Beginning Tape Three
Q: So you’re in the camp of Agde.
A: Yes.
Q: Which is considered a concentration camp.
A: Yes.
Q: And your mother and sister are in one place.
A: Excuse me, it is fa -- term, atelier, is a -- that was a concentration [indecipherable]
Q: Ata --
A: Atelier, it’s atel -- yeah, atelier.
Q: An int -- an intern -- internment camp, yes.
A: Yes, exactly.
Q: But that’s not what it was, no. So what was this like for you when you walked in there? You were -- you were set up in barracks?
A: Yes, and we were tired, we slept. About six o’clock in the morning, everybody has to get out, wash. They had a big -- a big pipe for water in the -- from faucets --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- [indecipherable] put a trough there, and we wash up, and then they serve us black coffee, no sugar, nothing, and I guess they gave us a -- a bread for four people. We cut it up in pieces, and took turns. Every time they serve bread, the f -- they were changed as a priority, one guy had the -- the choice first, and the next one next time. So he could get the largest piece.
Q: I see.
A: It was -- you know, we were hungry, and it was very important to get as much food as you could.
Q: Right. And who cut the bread?
A: One of the four.
Q: One of the four.
A: Yes.
Q: And who was your fourth, because you were three?
A: Well, we were not -- my -- my wife -- my mother and my sister were in a different camp.
Q: Right, but your brother and your father, and --
A: But we -- yes, but we -- we took from the whole barrack, they just took four people, any four.
Q: I see, any four.
A: And -- and here’s the bread, divide it.
Q: Were you staying near your father and brother, or you we --
A: Yes.
Q: You were.
A: Yes, I stay with them.
Q: And were you -- a number of people on one bunk, or was it one person?
A: No.
Q: Do you remember?
A: We were like two people on one bunk.
Q: Two?
A: And usually -- and -- and then there were about over 40 people in the whole barrack, I think.
Q: 40?
A: 40.
Q: So it’s not -- it wasn’t huge.
A: No, [indecipherable] barracks, but not huge, no.
Q: Was it cold?
A: What happened later on is -- I’ll tell you about this one. [indecipherable] was very cold, and he took an old bench -- they had the stove there --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- it was op -- operating. And he took a bench, broke it up somehow, and he started a fire. Well, somehow or other somebody reported him, the guy who was in charge of the barrack, I believe, and then they put him in jail, in the brig for a few days.
Q: Because he broke up this bench?
A: Yeah. They [indecipherable]
Q: Was it warm -- was it warmer?
A: Not very well.
Q: It didn’t --
A: No. Orders are orders, you cannot -- you are going to freeze, you’re going to freeze, you know?
Q: Right. And your clo -- they didn’t give you different clothes?
A: Oh no.
Q: It was the clothes you came in with.
A: That’s right.
Q: Did you have coat? Do you remember?
A: At that time, no.
Q: No.
A: Because we had left in the summertime, in June, think -- no, I take that back. No, that was it. We did not have any coats then.
Q: You didn’t have a coat.
A: We got some coats later on, in Montpellier. But -- so we were there for about four or five days I believe, and [indecipherable] in the morning, get your breakfast -- breakfast. My brother and I were designated to go in the kitchen to work peeling potatoes. So the guys already give us a little food they throw on the side, you know. But that just lasted one time, one day.
Q: You -- you were only in the kitchen for one day?
A: Yes.
Q: I see.
A: It wa -- a few hours one day.
Q: Really?
A: But the -- the guys [indecipherable]
Q: Did you take some stuff?
A: Well, the guy gave us a few things, but --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- th-then [indecipherable] so then what happened is the camp commander let people go out sometimes if they had to go to see a dentist or a doctor or so.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: He gave them a permit for a few hours. While they were out in the city, in the village, that is to say, they sometimes were able to buy stuff for themselves or for other people, too.
Q: Right.
A: And they brought in food. That helped. If those -- if you had money, you could buy some stuff, you know. Well, when we realized that you could go out of certain -- on certain conditions, we decided -- my father decided, let’s see if we can go out completely, permanently. So he -- there was a -- a young lady in the cap -- captain’s office, a st-stenographer. And my sister was with her [indecipherable] in the same camp with the -- barrack with the woman, and she says, you know, they need another s -- not stenographer, dactylo, a --a typist.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And w-why don’t you apply for a job? So my s -- my sister said okay. So she applies for the job, and she was there a few days, my father says, you know, ask if I can go to a od -- to a -- the prefecture in Montpellier, to see the governor. Just like that.
Q: Now let me ask you something. How did your father make contact with your sister, if you were in different barracks?
A: Wel -- we had -- we had visiting times.
Q: There were visiting times?
A: Yes. Ev -- every --
Q: Every day, or no?
A: No, every so often.
Q: I see.
A: Within a few days, or maybe a few times in a week.
Q: So your father is immediately thinking, how can I --
A: Yeah, I’m not going to be here, I’m not going to stay here.
Q: I’m not going to stay here.
A: That’s right.
Q: I’ve got to figure out a way to get out.
A: Right. And -- at that time we did not know the 36 -- 1936 law.
Q: Yeah.
A: So my father -- my -- my sister is performing very satisfactorily for her --
Q: Right.
A: -- captain, and my father says, “Ask for permit to go to Montpellier,” for her and him, because sh -- he didn’t speak French. Captain says fine, but he had hostages there, my mom, and my brother and me --
Q: Right.
A: -- so he was not afraid he was -- escape.
Q: Right.
A: Fine, so they go to Montpellier, find out where the prefecture is, where the prefect’s office is, and in the hallway, they’re already down there and this man comes towards them, and they look at each other. The man says, “What are you doing here?” That was Camille Ernst.
Q: The man with whom your -- your father was the -- yeah.
A: Partner before. Father says, “We’re at camp in Agde.” So he says, “What? You are free.” And he releases us either way, and he says to my father, are there more people that you know -- and he explained to my father what the story was with the 1936 law, but you were here before. So he says, “Do you know more people in the same situation that came before 1936 in the camp?” Off the top of his head my father had met people already in the camp, in the barrack, and he remembered -- thought of 36 people including us five.
Q: Right.
A: And Ernst puts all the names down on the same list, he says they are all free. Then he says, “I want you to stay in the camp of Agde, and in the village of Agde.” My father says “Why?” He says, “I want you to help free all the people that can be freed from the camp.” He was -- a hand to the heart. So my father says, “Well, how can they po -- ho-how can they be freed? What does it need to be [indecipherable].” He says, “If they have the means, they came -- first of all, they have to be in France since before 1936. They have to have the resources to exist in France without falling in the charge of the French government.” That was important.
Q: And that was for a period of about a year, right?
A: About a year, if I remember correctly.
Q: Yes.
A: And my father says, “That’s nice. How about people who have no money?” He says, “We will find a way.” And -- okay, so my father and my sister come back, my father sees -- become -- right away I see him, he says, “Keep your mouth shut, but we are free.” He didn’t want to cause a panic in the -- in the barrack, you know, people getting all excited. And then he explains --
Q: And did -- did Mr. Ernst give your father --
A: A pass.
Q: A pass. So if you would --
A: What happened -- he gave them the list, the whole list actually, and -- had to be turned in o the captain of the camp.
Q: And how does Ernst have this power to do that? Do you understand that?
A: He was in charge of the police. He was under the prefect, the second in charge. He wa -- his title was secretaire generale, and he looked at the -- looked from Dr. Zuco -- Zu --
Q: Zuccotti?
A: Yes, Zuccotti.
Q: Yes.
A: And [indecipherable] secretaire generale. Him, and then the other gentleman who was working for him. Actually, everybody w-working for him. You know he reported to --
Q: Right.
A: -- governor -- excuse me -- Mr. Verdi -- Berdetti.
Q: This was very emotional for you when your father came back and told you the story, yes?
A: Yes, he says, “Don’t say anything.” He didn’t want to cause a panic. H-He da -- spoke to the individuals from the barrack who were going to be freed. There wasn’t [indecipherable] they had their wives too, you know.
Q: Right.
A: Just fo --
Q: Right.
A: But he called them up one at a time, and told them, keep your mouth shut, but you are free tomorrow, you’ll get out. So the list was in the hands of the captain, an he issued individuals -- individual releases. That’s why our release has a number of blanks, about four or five lines, but it was actually a whole list of people. So he issued that for [indecipherable]
Q: And the captain, Tass -- Tassart is his name?
A: Tassart.
Q: Tassart?
A: Yes.
Q: N-N-No question?
A: No question. Orders are orders.
Q: Well, this is -- this is the orders and this is what he’s going to do.
A: That’s right.
Q: So were peop -- were other people upset that you folks were leaving, or did they --
A: They didn’t know.
Q: No.
A: We did not tell, and the next morning we were -- we ready to go. That’s where they found out that the -- a few people ba -- not just us, but a few other ones --
Q: Right.
A: -- were released. And then they asked, how come they’re released? Well, we came before 1936.
Q: Right.
A: That camp was a whole bunch of Spanish internees, because they came after ’36. They had been interned because they -- lots of them were Communists --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: And that the French didn’t care for them [indecipherable]. Even though Germany became an ally of the German -- of the Russians -- the Communists --
Q: Right.
A: -- the French did not -- didn’t say [indecipherable].
Q: The French didn’t like the Communists?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: For Germans it was just an expedient to occupy part of fro -- Poland, you know. And so we took the train and we -- somehow I guess we wound up in the Jewish organization, and we asked them to help us find a place. And we ran out of funds at that time, because we could not go back to -- Alsace was occupied. The banks, everything had been seized.
Q: Right.
A: So we were running out of money. They helped us out there.
Q: And where -- where did you go from Agde?
A: In Montpellier.
Q: You went back to Mo --
A: Montpellier
Q: Montpellier.
A: Yes. To that Jewish organization. And they were helping all the refugees --
Q: Right.
A: -- that was the funds from the Jewish organizations, from the United States. Then, we met somebody over there, and we ask him if he knew where they had places for rent. And he says, “Yes, come with us. I live in Celleneuve,” which is small village outside of Montpellier, we rode up a trolley car. Went over there, we found this home. It was not the fanciest place, it has a stable underneath there, but hey, we lived there, that’s it. So we stayed there for the first time, in ce -- in Celleneuve, let’s see. These people are from Belgium, and they lived in the same village. Unfortunately, they are on the -- okay, then, later on came ins-instructions to arrest the people, I think it was in the s-summer of 1942. They had what they call razzias, r-a-z-z -- double z - i-a-s, or rafles, r-a - one f - l-e-s. And they just came, gendarmes a-arrested -- no, they arrested at certain cell blocks, homes. And they searched anybody in the street. If they see you walk into a hallway, they would hassle you, because they knew that you were trying to hide. So they check identity [indecipherable]. Then the -- if they had the ideas that you came to France after ’36, they took you in right away, arrested you. At that time, my father had connections with the boy scouts, the leader. He [indecipherable] in one of the books by Ann Latour, which was [indecipherable] here, was sold in the museum, and [indecipherable] name. Anyway, we found places for some of the people, hiding places.
Q: Let me stop you for a moment. Aren’t you forgetting the f -- your father and sister going back and forth into Agde?
A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah. I --
Q: This i -- this is a very big, important story, yes?
A: Absolutely, absolutely. So, when he stayed in Agde, then he went to the camp commander, Tassart, who helped him out, sort out who was there before 1936 --
Q: Right.
A: -- this was [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: And my father approached him, he says, “You can be free if you meet certain requirements.” 1936, and means of -- of existing on the outside. “But,” he says, “you must also help people who have no funds. You must lend it to them, and they give back to you when they get out.” Because this was another of -- transaction outside the [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: So the -- okay, and my father was able to get about 1500 people out this way.
Q: It’s extraordinary story, you know. In how long a period of time was this go on? Months?
A: It was -- oh yes, oh yes. It was from November to February or March, just before we went to Montpellier. This was --
Q: So it’s in --
A: -- in Agde.
Q: -- November of 1940.
A: ’40 to ’41.
Q: To ’41.
A: About.
Q: To February ’41.
A: I believe so. Now what happened at that time -- so these people were free. The other thing happened. Ernst told my father, you know, I suspect anybody -- somebody over here is writing down the serial numbers of the bills.
Q: Oh.
A: So we became money launderers, we trade the bills so there was always constant new supply.
Q: So who was doing the money laundering?
A: My brother, my sister and me.
Q: Your brother and your si -- the three of you.
A: The three of us. Went to grocery stores, we went to banks. We -- or so -- we brought food into the camp, too. So people gave us the money to buy food for them, and so we had a-an exchange also.
Q: Now, all of you had passes to go in and out.
A: Yes, yes.
Q: Right?
A: I have one here from my mom and my father. And the passport is for every day, seven days a week. From eight o’clock in the morning til seven o’clock at night, that’s 11 hours. That wa --
Q: It’s really rather extraordinary, but this happened in a number of places in France, I gather, that people were able to get passes to go in and out [indecipherable]
A: I don’t know about the other camps. I don’t know, I --
Q: But at least there.
A: I have no idea.
Q: Yeah.
A: But this camp, because of Ernst, was very important.
Q: Right.
A: And I have the original pass with me.
Q: Did your father see Ernst on a fairly regular basis, or not?
A: Well, every time people were freed, they had to get to Montpellier. And so they were accompa -- accompanied by either my father, or my si -- [indecipherable] my father, my sister or my sister [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: Yeah. Because they had to go through [indecipherable] over there. They didn’t had -- excuse me -- they couldn’t send somebody to the camp.
Q: Right.
A: And then show the money [indecipherable], no, had to be [indecipherable]
Q: Right. But now, let me ask you something. When people didn’t have money --
A: Yes.
Q: -- and the people who did have money would lend them the money --
A: So they gave it to my sister --
Q: -- then they leave, and then they gave it back.
A: -- to take back.
Q: Take it back so it can be used again.
A: To [indecipherable] the list, and then --
Q: Right.
A: -- return the money to people.
Q: But now these people leave, and they really don’t have money. So now, how do they survive?
A: Well, they went to Jewish Committee to help them out.
Q: In Montpellier.
A: Montpellier.
Q: I see.
A: That’s where they were hiding, in Montpellier, at that point. So --
Q: And then they were helped.
A: They were helped, yes. Some had the visa to go to other countries, they had visa to go to Portugal. We have a very important pa -- place to go through it, to go to the United States.
Q: Yes.
A: Because if you had a visa from the United States, you had to go through port -- Spain or Portugal, and many people waited in Portugal for their American visas to come through.
Q: Right.
A: So the Joint Distribution or other organizations helped them out monetarily to go to --
Q: Right.
A: -- these places.
Q: Right. Were you folks frightened during this period or did you all feel very safe once you had the pass?
A: Well, as long as we knew Ernst, we felt very safe.
Q: Then you -- then you felt safe.
A: I forgot to say also, in those days they have also soup kitchen for all the refugees. Food, the -- either the Red Cross or other organizations had food, they sit -- they u -- went to those places. So the people who came out of the camp, and us too for awhile, ate in those places because we had no resources, you know?
Q: I see.
A: So --
Q: So your situation was not so terrible?
A: I’m sorry?
Q: Your situation was not so terrible, because there was this -- some food.
A: It -- it was not -- it was not that much food, either.
Q: It was not that much.
A: Or choice, but they --
Q: Right.
A: -- better than nothing.
Q: But there was something.
A: That’s right.
Q: Yes.
A: So --
Q: Were people working in this camp?
A: No, no.
Q: They weren’t.
A: It were very idle, no.
Q: They were just sitting, and waiting.
A: I -- and then also, Montpellier, you had the Red Cross distributed clothing, and also the -- what was it called? Not the [indecipherable], the foundation army distributed clothing over there, too. A reg --
Q: Clothing?
A: Yes.
Q: Oh.
A: For -- from the United States that they donated. So that’s where we got our first clothes, my brother and me. It was like a pillorin they call it, it -- it was a [indecipherable] without sleeves, except it had openings [indecipherable]
Q: Like a poncho.
A: Exactly, that’s what it is.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: This was good for rain, you know.
Q: Yes.
A: For you got your hands free. You didn't --
Q: Did you get some warm clothes? Because it’s winter now.
A: Yes, yes.
Q: Yes.
A: You know, they had the -- plenty of supplies. They had a lot of supplies.
Q: Right.
A: But they could not bring them into the camp.
Q: They couldn’t bring it into the camp?
A: No. By the way, it was where the camp [indecipherable] in there, there was someone, and we suspect it was an American journalist that was there, and it was behind the barrier that [indecipherable] and the gendarmes were with him, so a few of us made a sign, “Nous avons faim.” We are hungry. We moved that towards him. The gendarmes [indecipherable] too close, and I hope he saw the sign.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: They didn’t force us to go back.
Q: Right.
A: Uh-huh.
Q: Huh. All right, so 1500 people get -- how many people were in this camp to begin with, do you have any idea?
A: Thousands.
Q: Thousands?
A: Yes. I don’t [indecipherable] thousands -- I’d say probably between three and 4000, probably. That means just the women --
Q: And were they all -- were they mainly Jews?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: They were Spaniards, and also military, foreign troops like Czechs. And I -- I don’t remember [indecipherable] of Polish troops, but they were supposed to go to Africa when Germany won the war.
Q: Right.
A: But then they got stuck, there with no ships to take them to Africa, so they put them in the camp.
Q: Now, how did people prove that they came to France before 1936? Did they -- or did --
A: You -- you --
Q: You have a -- you have an entrance pa --
A: A passport from a -- if you came from foreign countries, or even from France that you had a -- your foreigner card. And a foreigner carte étrangère, has a pa -- passport when you came in -- ha-has a card showing when you came in.
Q: So the people who came in after 1936 were stuck in the camp?
A: And then, the worst that happened [indecipherable]. Then they decided to enter the camp and transfer everybody to the camp of Rivesaltes.
Q: Right.
A: Which is near the Pyrenees, and there are terrible conditions. It was near the sea, and they had the, I guess water running close by a-and the rain and whatnot.
Q: Right.
A: And so the camp commander, Tassart, said, “Well, I’d like to send a delegation of the people to Rivesaltes to see how the conditions are, so they can convince the people in the camp that things are not that bad over there the way [indecipherable].” It was one of those, what do you call it? There was a Russian general who made fake visitors [indecipherable]
Q: Oh, Potemkin.
A: Potemkin.
Q: Yes.
A: Potemkin village.
Q: Right.
A: So they had places over there, and they saw [indecipherable] is, this has flowers over here, and this and that, and so forth. Sidewalks and that. It was terrible when they got there, though.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: The food was not good, and that -- the Rivesaltes, th-they had just a few barracks they showed them.
Q: Right. Now this is after you got out the 1500 people --
A: Correct.
Q: -- that they closed Agde and sent them to Rivesaltes, yes?
A: Correct. I know of one of the people that went to -- like, it was part of the [indecipherable] it was called Rubenstein. He was from Frankfurt and my parents knew him, and he had a son of our age, too. And he was wa -- allowed somehow to come to Montpellier [indecipherable] camp and he went to our house even, but he had to go back to the camp.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: But he was one of the guys that was blindsided, I -- you know, just told him hey, it’s so beautiful over here, and they showed him the -- how many things that were favorable to show to -- to the French -- to the internees.
Q: Right. Now, bef -- before we get to talking about you father, and y -- because of these razzias and their -- razzias and their picking up people.
A: Oh yes.
Q: You g -- you are going to school, you’re in a suburb of Montpellier in Celleneuve?
A: Celleneuve, yes.
Q: Celleneuve.
A: I went to the ORT school --
Q: ORT school, and very --
A: -- in Montpellier.
Q: Yes. And there you learned things that became important for you later, yes?
A: Yes. First of all, I started as a mechanic’s training. Forging -- iron forging -- forge is a French word, it’s a -- what do you call it -- you know, where you process hot irons.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: And where the [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: And then the -- and then I took the class in chemistry, my brother also. And that was very interesting, it took a few months [indecipherable]. Exam was very strict.
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A: Because you might think it was from the Sorbonne [indecipherable] Paris [indecipherable]
Q: It was good.
A: Yes.
Q: Yes.
A: I aced it.
Q: You did?
A: Yes, I got Tres bien. I have [indecipherable] here, too.
Q: Really?
A: Yeah, we had to know how to -- what are you using to make soaps, what are you using to make lipsticks, what are you using to make toothpastes, and all kinds of -- of what do you call that, practical chemistry.
Q: I was going to say it’s very practical chemistry
A: Yes, yes.
Q: It’s not theoretical.
A: Yes, it -- the instructor was from Poland, and he was -- he trained us. He was a -- also a refugee [indecipherable]. He -- I saw him in pa -- in -- in New York when I came back, when I came over here. I looked him up in the phone book, and tried to get a job, and he took me to his chemistry factory in Bayonne, and they were -- offered me a job. They did not tell me what it was, but when [indecipherable] and I says I wouldn’t accept this job, they wouldn’t pay anything, because the expenses would be higher traveling --
Q: Right.
A: -- than they would want to pay you.
Q: Now why did you take this course in particular?
A: I didn’t want to be idle --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- you know, and then the -- I also had the training in mechanical applications, they had the other course being taught the same time a -- the same time, later on, so it was good to continue.
Q: Right.
A: I like it a lot, you know.
Q: And when you’re in Celleneuve, you -- you were Jew -- I mean, people knew that you were Jewish, you weren't hiding the fact.
A: Where?
Q: When you were in Celleneuve.
A: Celleneuve?
Q: When you were going to school.
A: We did not to broadcast anything at all, no.
Q: You didn’t broadcast.
A: We are refugees, yeah, just refugees from Alsace.
Q: Right.
A: There was only one more family in Celleneuve, that’s the one that told u -- told us about the apartment.
Q: Right.
A: And there were two -- three, four, five people. And --
Q: So you didn’t have false papers, but you were still not you -- but people didn’t know who you were?
A: No, no.
Q: They didn’t --
A: They were -- just were Alsatians.
Q: Right.
A: They didn’t know we were foreigners, no.
Q: Right. Okay, we have to stop the tape.
End of Tape Three
Beginning Tape Four
Q: Fred, let’s -- let me just ask you again about Agde, because you and your brother brought in food --
A: Food.
Q: -- daily to people. W-Were you actually working out -- you had access 11 hours a day.
A: Yes.
Q: Were you really going back and forth all those hours?
A: No, no.
Q: No.
A: Once a day.
Q: Once a day you went.
A: We had -- you know, it was difficult. First of all we had to do the shopping, you had to carry as much as you could and besides, there was the matter of -- these people have money to buy anything, yo -- I mean, we were limited ourselves, so we could not actually -- that was not the case though. The primary thing was, it was quite a distance to walk in the village, too, you know.
Q: It was a big distance, yeah.
A: And do the shopping, and carry it back, you know, it was a --
Q: But the people inside the camp would give you money?
A: Yes.
Q: And would they ask you to get certain things, or --
A: Absolutely.
Q: They d -- they did.
A: Absolutely, yes.
Q: And how did you decide who you would w-work --
A: They asked us, you know?
Q: They just asked you.
A: Because this happened before. People went to -- had the authority to go to see a dentist or a doctor, or so, and people asked them, would you please buy me this or that [indecipherable]
Q: I see.
A: So th-that already started before.
Q: Right.
A: So for us it was just a matter of stepping in there and help them out too. We had been through these horrible few days, and we were lucky, it was just a few days.
Q: Right.
A: We felt very badly for those people. I mean, when you’re hungry, it’s a terrible feeling.
Q: Right. So you felt responsible to do something.
A: Absolutely.
Q: So how much -- how long a walk was it from the camp to the village?
A: A few kilometers.
Q: A few kilometers.
A: Yes.
Q: And --
A: And then when you go to the village you have to go to the -- the grocery stores, and you had to get from th-this end, that [indecipherable] different places, you know, so it took time.
Q: Right. And you didn’t have gloves, so it was very cold.
A: Our hands were frozen. But we did not worry about that because we felt we had to do this.
Q: Right. So it must have been exhausting both psychologically and physically for you folks.
A: No, psychologically we felt we had to do it.
Q: So this was --
A: This was a must.
Q: -- this was good. And this went on for a number of months?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: Til about -- well, til about February or so, when they decide to close the camp.
Q: So it’s December, January, February, so it is a few months.
A: Right, yes, it was a few months, yeah.
Q: So it’s a lot.
A: Oh we, you know, I have to -- yeah, we were staying in the [indecipherable] when they decided to move the people to Rivesaltes.
Q: Right.
A: Yes. And then they had to send a delegation to --
Q: To -- to look at the fake part of the camp, yes.
A: Right.
Q: But after they leave, do they -- do they close the camp in June of --
A: I believe so.
Q: In June of 1941 or ’42?
A: Oh, before.
Q: Before?
A: Oh yes, I think it -- see, let’s see, June -- I think February was what -- I-I can’t recall.
Q: February ’41.
A: I believe in early -- yes, ’41, yes, uh-huh. It wasn’t too many months after we left. I think this was February, or something like [indecipherable]
Q: So when you’re at school, the ORT school --
A: Yes.
Q: -- was that in ’41 or ’42, do you -- do you have a -- do you remember at all?
A: Not exactly, but I have the certificate so I can --
Q: Well, we can check.
A: Yes.
Q: But maybe it’s ’42 that you’re in this school.
A: Well, because I went to different classes, I went to the mechanics.
Q: Right.
A: I went to the other one. So the other one was about four or five months prior to the applied chemistry class.
Q: Right.
A: What a class that was, it was -- it was great.
Q: It was great?
A: Yes.
Q: Yes.
A: I learned an awful lot.
Q: But you hadn’t been to school for a few years now, right?
A: Oh no.
Q: So this was just --
A: That wa -- that was th -- that was the end of it there.
Q: Did you carry around your dictionary with you? Is that one of the things you took?
A: No.
Q: No?
A: No, no. No.
Q: No, huh? So it’s good that you had all this dictionary training beforehand, yes?
A: Yes.
Q: So in July and August of 1942, they start these raids, the Germans --
A: Ah, yes.
Q: -- because they’re occupying Vichy, no?
A: No, this [indecipherable]
Q: This is before?
A: -- before that. Because I remember that they had some raids, or rafles [indecipherable]
Q: Right.
A: -- and before that -- and we located places to hide.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: People to hide with, food. My father had this one friend of his who had a restaurant, Tellenbaum, and he provided food. The boy scouts went to different donors or so, they collected the food. They distributed it to the homes, not on a daily basis, because that would have attracted attention. So that every two days or three days, they will bring a supply for a few days, so as not to arouse the people there to see wha -- what goes on there, you know? They found abandoned houses like that -- things like that. The best place to hide was hospitals.
Q: Why?
A: The food was available. You did not have to bring anything in. Doctors and nurses cooperated.
Q: They did?
A: They put people in beds, and we -- we were [indecipherable]. That was very -- these were -- these were doctors and Red Cross people and -- and nurses, these are not Jewish. Everybody cooperated. Not just -- not just --
Q: But your father arranged all of this?
A: Well, he got people -- connections, you know.
Q: Right.
A: But --
Q: But he started it.
A: Yes, yes.
Q: So he just keeps going with these ideas?
A: Because we knew that people were going to be getting arrested, we had to hide them, you know?
Q: But weren’t you vulnerable also? Or people just didn’t know who you were?
A: We weren’t vulnerable because we knew Ernst. He was in charge of police.
Q: I see.
A: At that point. Now, the people that lived in the same village as we did, Celleneuve, the daughter was arrested. And we tried to get her freed out, couldn’t --
Q: But you couldn’t do it.
A: -- couldn’t [indecipherable] no. Then the pers -- the family hid us later on, too. This was before --
Q: So s --
A: I’m sorry.
Q: No, no, go ahead.
A: This was before the Germans occupied southern France.
Q: Okay. But in Celleneuve there seems to be a lot of help, the people are -- are willing to be very helpful to the people who are vulnerable.
A: Well, I’m talking about people who are French citizens basically, because they were not subject to any persecution.
Q: I see.
A: Because they were French citizens.
Q: Right.
A: Th-They fall under ’36 law -- 1936 law.
Q: And because it’s unoccupied at that point, they’re not vulnerable.
A: Correct, correct.
Q: Uh-huh. And so this goes on now for a few months?
