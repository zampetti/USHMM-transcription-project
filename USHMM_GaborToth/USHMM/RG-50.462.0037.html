interviewing Kay Foldvary.</span> <span id="s3">Kay, when we first spoke, you said that you were one of forty nurses that, in your unit.</span> <span id="s4">Could you, in your army unit.</span> <span id="s5">Could you please tell me where in Europe and in what unit you were serving before you arrived at the site of the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s6">[tape off then on] O.K., now we can go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">KF: When we first arrived in Europe, we were put, until our equipment came, we were put in different units.</span> <span id="s8">And I served with the 54th Field Hospital temporarily, until we got our equipment together.</span> <span id="s9">And then we, our unit all came together as the 116th Evacuation Hospital, in the 7th Army section of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">NP: All right.</span> <span id="s11">Did you know of the existence of this particular camp that you would liberate before you arrived there?</span> <span id="s12">Had you any idea that it existed?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">KF: No, because we arrived in Europe in November 6th of ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">KF: And we, it was a year before...</span></p> <p><span id="s16">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">KF: We arrived at Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">NP: All right.</span> <span id="s19">So then you had no prior knowledge of the existence of any concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">KF: None whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">NP: I see.</span> <span id="s22">Before you arrived at the camp, had you heard anything at all about the mass murders of Jewish people in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">KF: Only when you would hear sometimes some news reports of suspicion of things that were the reason the United States government got involved...</span></p> <p><span id="s24">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">KF: With the war.</span> <span id="s26">I think this was the determining factor, because they had inklings of things that were going on over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">NP: And the information that you heard, was this from the army newspaper or the overseas radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">KF: Mainly from reporters and so forth that were giving news.</span> <span id="s29">And it was vague but nothing was that, of my knowledge, that things were at the point that they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">NP: All right.</span> <span id="s31">[tape off then on] Kay, could you give us some information about where you were before you came to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">KF: Yes.</span> <span id="s33">After we collected our unit, and we served as a unit together, we were sent to Epinal, France in November, 24th.</span> <span id="s34">And we stayed there just two days and moved down to Sarrebourg, France the 26th of November of ‘44.</span> <span id="s35">And we remained there throughout the winter.</span> <span id="s36">And fortunately we were in buildings which had been a Catholic priest’s home, or a Catholic monastery, I would say.</span> <span id="s37">And we stayed there until the 20th of March, taking care of GI wounded and we were very, very busy.</span> <span id="s38">And then the 20th of March of ‘45, we were sent to Dettwiler, France and remained there until the 28th.</span> <span id="s39">And then we went into tents and into fields, which were grass when we arrived, but by the time we left, perhaps a week later, it was mud from all the trafficking.</span> <span id="s40">But we set up camps and this was our first experience with tent living.</span> <span id="s41">We went into Bellheim, Germany the 28th of March in ‘45, until the 31st of March in ‘45.</span> <span id="s42">And the 1st of April of ‘45 we were sent to Dieburg, Germany and remained there until the 12th of April in ‘45.</span> <span id="s43">Now, this was constantly moving and taking down tents and putting them up, and we were under a great deal of pressure at this time because if we moved in the morning, by evening we were expected to have crucial tents, like our surgery and x-ray tents, set up, that we could start accepting patients.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">KF: On the 13th of April we were moved to Arnstein, Germany, and remained there just one day.</span> <span id="s46">Of course we didn’t accept patients in that day.</span> <span id="s47">And then from there we went on to Rattlesdorf [phonetic], Germany the 14th of April and remained there until the 25th of April.</span> <span id="s48">From the 25th of April in ‘45, we went to Ettringen, Germany and remained there until the 2nd of May of ‘45.</span> <span id="s49">At this time, our Seventh Army headquarters had given us orders to move into Dachau concentration camp to take care of the many patients that were there and to clean, help clean up and help these people that were there.</span> <span id="s50">So on May 2nd we moved to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">NP: I see.</span> <span id="s52">To the best of your memory could you describe what you saw at the camp and what you felt at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">KF: Well, our enlisted personnel and some of our male officers had been there for two or three days to clean out a building that we could—again—move into buildings, which of course we were pleased about going back into buildings and not having to live in tents for a while.</span> <span id="s54">But the first thing that, as we came in the gate, and above the gate in German was writing, Schaffen machen [macht] sie frei, which means, “Work Makes You Free.”</span> <span id="s55">But the thing that, the first thing that you noticed was the terrible odor as we came in, and it was the odor of spoiled meat is the closest I can relate to that.</span> <span id="s56">But of course then we went in.</span> <span id="s57">This was at the entrance of the camp you could already smell the odor.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">NP: I see.</span> <span id="s59">From there, what were your duties?</span> <span id="s60">What were you to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">KF: Well, as we arrived in the building and were assigned rooms and put our things in, the first thing our commanding officer wanted to have a meeting with all the nurses as we had arrived.</span> <span id="s62">And at the meeting, he said, “I don’t want you girls to be going around the camp, because the horrors in this camp are unbelievable.”</span> <span id="s63">And he said, “They are even very hard, difficult for the people, for the males that are here.”</span> <span id="s64">And he said, “I want you to stay near your quarters.”</span> <span id="s65">But just telling us to do that, like children, we, the enlisted men who we had been working with all these years, who were very fine young men said, “We have so much to show you girls,” and took us for a tour of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">NP: I see.</span> <span id="s67">Can you estimate how many prisoners there were and if any of them were alive, near death, or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">KF: We didn’t have the facilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">NP: So that the hospital and concentration camp were within one compound?</span> <span id="s71">They were next to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">KF: No.</span> <span id="s73">You had the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">KF: And inside the camp was an area that was fenced-in where they lived, and inside that area, I didn’t, we were not permitted to go in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">KF: That had I think 1200 patients in there.</span> <span id="s78">Now our unit for combat was a 1200, was 1100 capacity, of 40 nurses, 40 doctors, and 250 enlisted men.</span> <span id="s79">So, we, each nurse was in charge of one building.</span> <span id="s80">We had 11 buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">NP: I see.</span> <span id="s82">That is where you treated the sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">KF: And this is when they brought them out of the hospital, compound hospital.</span> <span id="s84">They were covered with DDT powder.</span> <span id="s85">It looked like they had been just doused in a barrel of flour to us.</span> <span id="s86">And of course they, this was to kill the body louse.</span> <span id="s87">Nobody gave us the dangers of the DDT, but their main object was to kill the body lice.</span> <span id="s88">So then we accepted them and we had the cots set up and each nurse then was in charge of 110 patients.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">NP: I see.</span> <span id="s90">Could you describe your feelings when you saw these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">NP: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">KF: But they were [pause] bodies of bones with skin stretched over, and very, very emaciated, partly because of the life they had been living and their food rations and so forth, and as the war was progressing their food rations were worsened and of course typhus epidemic, they would lose a great deal of weight.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">NP: Kay, do you know if this particular camp was set up only for Jewish people or were there prisoners of all nationalities?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">KF: There were prisoners there of anyone who was against the Hitler regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">KF: We had American, there was one American Major that I met who had been from Cicero, Illinois.</span> <span id="s97">His name was Major Gerard.</span> <span id="s98">And he had been in there.</span> <span id="s99">There were, I personally had met, there were twelve British flyers, because they had been found in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s100">And anybody that was found in civilian clothes was taken as prisoner and put in concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">KF: They were not put in the regular POW camps, like other soldiers who were captured.</span> <span id="s102">These were put in.</span> <span id="s103">And anyone who had helped anyone to escape.</span> <span id="s104">There were Poles.</span> <span id="s105">There were from all countries there were prisoners there.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">NP: I see.</span> <span id="s107">Mixed nationalities.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">KF: Mixed nationalities.</span> <span id="s109">And apparently before we liberated the camp, they had uniforms.</span> <span id="s110">Some of them wore triangles.</span> <span id="s111">Now I cannot remember exactly what these emblems meant.</span> <span id="s112">Some who were considered gay or whatever had a certain emblem.</span> <span id="s113">Those that were political prisoners had another emblem.</span> <span id="s114">And those who had, were criminals, had another emblem.</span> <span id="s115">But by the time we got there, the people that were, had died or whatever, if their body was laying around, and these people that were still walking around, would rip off the emblem of that, what they wanted to put on, and put this on there.</span> <span id="s116">So, on their own uniform.</span> <span id="s117">So we could not tell who was in there for what reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">NP: Was the yellow star visible?</span> <span id="s119">You said a triangle was one of the emblems.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">KF: I cannot remember the, we were so busy at that time...</span></p> <p><span id="s121">NP: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">KF: And given them medication and things like this, that we found the vitamins underneath the blankets.</span> <span id="s124">So therefore, then we had to wait and be sure that they swallowed the pills before we went on to the next one.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">NP: Were there any children in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">KF: As I recall now, we had only male.</span> <span id="s127">Now I’m sure, outside the camp I understand there was another military hospital, that was, they were sending patients to.</span> <span id="s128">We did not get any women.</span> <span id="s129">We did not get any children.</span> <span id="s130">But in the enormous pile of bodies that had not been cremated, that were outside the crematorium, there were children, bodies of children as well as women, as you could see in the pile of bodies.</span> <span id="s131">Now where the children and the women were sent, I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">NP: All right.</span> <span id="s133">Let’s see.</span> <span id="s134">The reactions of the prisoners to you.</span> <span id="s135">Well, you had just described that certainly one reaction was suspicion.</span> <span id="s136">Did any confide in you or just...</span></p> <p><span id="s137">KF: Well, one thing, there was a great language barrier.</span> <span id="s138">Now I could understand some of the German, a small amount.</span> <span id="s139">But I could not understand any of the other languages.</span> <span id="s140">Now they would sometimes, we had, I think I had 15 Russians in my building.</span> <span id="s141">Some of the Russians could speak English, or German.</span> <span id="s142">And those that couldn’t would, by interpretation, would reveal to us.</span> <span id="s143">But we used mainly sign language, because we could not really communicate too well with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">KF: Well, we had, during war time, maybe a great deal of it is not propaganda, but it is, you developed a real hatred, which of course was not a good thing, but it is something that you cannot avoid.</span> <span id="s145">And we had been taking care of German prisoners, as we progressed, prior to coming to Dachau.</span> <span id="s146">And we gave them treatment.</span> <span id="s147">But our conversation with them was very limited and we gave them medication and treated them as a patient.</span> <span id="s148">Of course our main care was given to our own soldiers, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s149">NP: Did, were there any German officers around, those that had been in charge of Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">KF: Yes.</span> <span id="s151">As I told you, the camp had only been liberated a few days...</span></p> <p><span id="s152">NP: yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">KF: A couple days before we went in there.</span> <span id="s154">And there were still S.S. troopers, which the camps were really run by S.S. troopers, not the Wehrmacht, which was the regular German Army.</span> <span id="s155">But they were taken care of by the S.S. And the S.S. were very much the hated and feared part of the German Army.</span> <span id="s156">There were S.S. troopers, S.S. soldiers who, their bodies were there.</span> <span id="s157">We saw bodies with the dogs that they had used, in the camp, who had been shot.</span> <span id="s158">And these S.S. troopers had been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">NP: By whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">KF: By the Americans liberating the camp.</span> <span id="s161">And it was, it was an awful sight to see, but we had to step over the bodies to get through to see.</span> <span id="s162">Because we were anxious to see really what the camp was like, in spite of the horrible odor.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">NP: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">KF: But we [pause]...</span></p> <p><span id="s165">NP: Would you like to take a little rest?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">KF: Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s167">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s168">NP: You were saying...</span></p> <p><span id="s169">KF: One day one of the nurses was feeding the patients from the cart that we, the food was brought up in, and was serving.</span> <span id="s170">And of course we had some of the displaced persons or prisoners who were up and around and would help us.</span> <span id="s171">So this was a big help.</span> <span id="s172">We put them to work, and they really did help us.</span> <span id="s173">But one of the nurses, or someone must have said something, but one of the patients got up and he took the handle from this big cart.</span> <span id="s174">And he struck one of the nurses with it.</span> <span id="s175">And right away the rest of the patients, of course, came to her defense.</span> <span id="s176">And one of the men said, “Oh, if that had happened before the Americans came in, he would be shot immediately.”</span> <span id="s177">And this was things that...</span></p> <p><span id="s178">NP: It was really a revelation.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">KF: We had to be...careful, because they were demanding.</span> <span id="s180">They didn’t trust us.</span> <span id="s181">And of course those that were French said the French had really won the war.</span> <span id="s182">So you could see how their mind was so distorted.</span> <span id="s183">I was fortunate enough, I was in charge then for a period of, in charge of the penicillin team.</span> <span id="s184">And penicillin at that time had to be injected every three hours.</span> <span id="s185">We didn’t have the long-lasting penicillin.</span> <span id="s186">It was still quite a new drug.</span> <span id="s187">And so I had patients coming to me for penicillin and I also went around and gave penicillin to those that the doctors felt needed it.</span> <span id="s188">I had one man who, his name was Hans Gercheff, from Holland.</span> <span id="s189">He had been with the Dutch underground and he had been a prisoner in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s190">And coming from Ausch-, before the war ended, apparently the Germans were getting panicky and they were trying to put as many prisoners in just certain camps and then machine-gun them and do away with all of them.</span> <span id="s191">It was the most ruthless thing.</span> <span id="s192">But as Hans would come, he was a very intelligent man.</span> <span id="s193">He had been in Auschwitz for three years.</span> <span id="s194">And he had had no contact with his par-, with his family all this time, so he did not know if they were living or they were dead.</span> <span id="s195">They were in Holland.</span> <span id="s196">He was a very intelligent man, and when he would come, he was getting the penicillin shots because he had all the carbuncles on the back of his neck.</span> <span id="s197">But the American government was using him for information because they were making preparation for the...trials, for the Nuremberg trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">NP: The Nuremberg trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">KF: And as we, as he would come around, they gave him a motorcycle so he could get around faster and do more.</span> <span id="s200">So every three hours he came around for me to give him a shot of penicillin.</span> <span id="s201">So each time he came I had a list of questions that I wanted to ask him real quickly, because his time was so limited.</span> <span id="s202">And he told me about all the experimenting that they were doing in the concentration camp, Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s203">Apparently Auschwitz was pretty much known as an experimental camp.</span> <span id="s204">And I said to him one day, I said, “Did you know how the war was progressing?”</span> <span id="s205">And he said, “Well, we had somewhere gotten a radio from somewhere.</span> <span id="s206">They put it under the floorboard in their, where they lived, and covered it up and then covered it with dirty laundry.</span> <span id="s207">And they would lie down on the floor and they would put this radio on because if they had been found out that they had this, they would have been shot.”</span> <span id="s208">So he said, “Only three of us knew about this radio.</span> <span id="s209">And it was two English flyers and myself.”</span> <span id="s210">And he said, “We would lay down on the floor and get news, because we decided that if the Russians were going to liberate Dachau, that we were going to make, try to make a run for it.</span> <span id="s211">Because we did not trust the Russians.”</span> <span id="s212">And he said, “Ah, I don’t understand you Americans.</span> <span id="s213">You are so trusting of people.</span> <span id="s214">Because,” he said, “You, the Russians,” he said, “they’re no different than the Nazis.</span> <span id="s215">It’s just that they’re on the other side of the war now.”</span> <span id="s216">But he said, “Their ways, their thinking, is very different from yours.”</span> <span id="s217">But he said, “We decided if the Americans were going to get the closest...” It was quite a challenge who was going to get there first, because the Russians were coming from one angle and the Americans were coming from another; who was making the fastest progress.</span> <span id="s218">So he decided if the Americans were going to take over Dachau that they would stay.</span> <span id="s219">And this is how he told me, that they had some idea of what the war... But they had made a vow, the three of them had made a vow that they would not tell one other person, because, he said, “News and things went around the camp like you wouldn’t believe,” he said.</span> <span id="s220">“But if just the three of us knew, then we were encouraged with what was going to happen.”</span> <span id="s221">But talking about Auschwitz, it seems like a few days, well, maybe not; maybe it was longer than that, they were bringing prisoners from Auschwitz to Dachau in these big boxcars.</span> <span id="s222">And he described to me how they traveled.</span> <span id="s223">They traveled one sitting in front of the other like this with your feet like this...</span></p> <p><span id="s224">NP: Apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">KF: And you sat like that.</span> <span id="s226">You sat like that for days.</span> <span id="s227">And you were on the train.</span> <span id="s228">You didn’t know where you were going or where they were taking you or anything.</span> <span id="s229">You had no idea what, nobody told you anything.</span> <span id="s230">And then the cars, the trains would stop and go on a siding if they were to let German troops through or let some other vehicles go.</span> <span id="s231">So they would sit there maybe for hours.</span> <span id="s232">This is, and if the person died in front of you, that made no difference.</span> <span id="s233">As far as sanitary conditions, there were none.</span> <span id="s234">And these people traveled like this all the way to Dachau.</span> <span id="s235">Now I don’t know how long it took or anything because as I said, my questions were short for Hans.</span> <span id="s236">And of course he was limited.</span> <span id="s237">But I wanted to get some real stories of what had gone on.</span> <span id="s238">Now these boxcars remained there, as I have shown pictures...</span></p> <p><span id="s239">NP: Yes, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">KF: Of these boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">NP: I see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">KF: And one day I was walking from the...building where I was working, up to the building where I was living.</span> <span id="s243">And as I was coming, and it was, oh, a good distance.</span> <span id="s244">But what I could see, there was a young prisoner standing in the doorway of this open boxcar.</span> <span id="s245">And it took me, oh, maybe five, ten minutes, for me to walk up close to the boxcar.</span> <span id="s246">Not that I went up close to them, but to my building, which the boxcars were near our building.</span> <span id="s247">He stood there in a definite catatonic state.</span> <span id="s248">Catatonic means you don’t move a muscle.</span> <span id="s249">And I was afraid.</span> <span id="s250">I was fearful of what he might do if I went close, so I didn’t.</span> <span id="s251">But this shows you the mental and the physical condition of these people.</span> <span id="s252">It wasn’t only their physical state.</span> <span id="s253">It was their mental state.</span> <span id="s254">Because they...</span></p> <p><span id="s255">NP: A total deterioration.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">KF: A total deterioration, physically and mentally.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">NP: Kay, the reaction of your fellow nurses, the physicians and everything that you worked for, their comments.</span> <span id="s258">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">KF: Well, I think we all had the same feeling.</span> <span id="s260">And as, one...thing, when we took the tour of Dachau, the first day after we arrived, I was going to go into the crematorium, just to see what it was like.</span> <span id="s261">And I saw an American Major come out the other side of the crematorium.</span> <span id="s262">And he was so pale.</span> <span id="s263">He was white.</span> <span id="s264">And I lost courage to go through the crematorium.</span> <span id="s265">But the pile of bodies were right on the side of the building, so you could not avoid seeing them.</span> <span id="s266">And so I didn’t go in.</span> <span id="s267">But the doctors and the nurses, and our enlisted men, they were all shocked by what they saw, and they would not, could not believe it, that they actually saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">NP: It was really an unbelievable thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">KF: But we were so busy, and as we...worked, it was depressing.</span> <span id="s270">It was very depressing.</span> <span id="s271">And our doctors had said to us, “You’re not going to be able to save everybody.”</span> <span id="s272">You know, because we felt like we should.</span> <span id="s273">He said, “You know, you can’t work yourself to death.”</span></p> <p><span id="s274">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">KF: You do what you can, do the best you can, and you’ll sa- Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s276">NP: This is side B of the interview with Kay Foldvary, on Thursday, July the 7th, 1989.</span> <span id="s277">In your own mind, Kay, how do you explain German decisions that led to the setting up of concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">KF: I’m sorry, could you repeat that again?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">NP: Sure, sure, absolutely.</span> <span id="s280">How do you think the Germans came to do this, to set up the concentration camps?</span> <span id="s281">Do you have any feelings of what led to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">KF: No, I have some insight into it.</span> <span id="s283">Germany was in a, apparently a serious depression, and the government and everything was really in chaos.</span> <span id="s284">Well, they had numerous leaders, who were, made promises they were going to do this, and they were going to do that.</span> <span id="s285">And they could not follow through.</span> <span id="s286">And then here comes Adolf Hitler, who was a very, well I call them rabble rousers.</span> <span id="s287">But nevertheless, I, in this country I was living in a small community in Ohio, which was years prior was predominantly German.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">KF: We had people living in Germany, or in this town, that were, still had family in Germany that they were corresponding with.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">KF: So we would question these people when we heard of these things that were going on in Germany, what was, how Germany was doing.</span> <span id="s292">And when they would write their family, their family would write them back honestly about things were really bad.</span> <span id="s293">And then when Adolf Hitler took over, he started doing things or promises he made which were not destroying the Jewish community or, I think, but just little promises, and he carried them out.</span> <span id="s294">And he was very, very forceful.</span> <span id="s295">So, at first they thought, “Hitler is our lifesaver.</span> <span id="s296">He is going to bring Germany back into prosperity.”</span> <span id="s297">And then when things started changing, and these people were beginning to see a different side of Hitler, the people in this country would write to their family and ask them what, tell them what they had heard in the news and so forth, and ask them how things... And they would not answer their questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">NP: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">KF: They were afraid to answer their questions.</span> <span id="s300">So already Hitler was taking power.</span> <span id="s301">And they were afraid for their lives.</span> <span id="s302">And anybody who really opposed the government, there was no mercy shown.</span> <span id="s303">So they were very, very careful then as to, they just would ignore the questions.</span> <span id="s304">And that’s the first inkling we knew that things were not going well and that he was really a dictator.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">NP: Yes.</span> <span id="s306">After you left the camp, was there any official or unofficial meeting of your unit to discuss what you had experienced at the camp?</span> <span id="s307">Was there any debriefing or...</span></p> <p><span id="s308">KF: No, because as we left the camp, we were then, the unit was more or less broken up and gone to various other places until we went for, embarking to come back to the United States.</span> <span id="s309">And we were to come back on the unit, on how many points you had, on a point system—how long you had been, how many battle stars you had, and how much you had gotten involved with.</span> <span id="s310">And so our unit then was, and of course our main conversation was getting back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">NP: I just didn’t know whether they, you know, were questioning you here.</span> <span id="s312">You had mentioned, in preparation for the Nuremberg trials, they were questioning prisoners, and I didn’t know whether they were questioning medical help as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">KF: They may have questioned some of the doctors.</span> <span id="s314">We had two German doctors, doctors that were educated in Germany in their medical profession but were American citizens...</span></p> <p><span id="s315">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">KF: And were in the American Army.</span> <span id="s317">So these two doctors, I’m sure, were a big help in, they had such control of the German language and so forth.</span> <span id="s318">Someone was telling me about, because there was a lot of interrogation going on.</span> <span id="s319">But, away from our medical unit, because we were too busy taking care of patients...</span></p> <p><span id="s320">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">KF: To get involved with these things.</span> <span id="s322">And, but I understood that one of the soldiers, or S.S. troopers, perhaps, who survived it, can you stop yours now?</span> <span id="s323">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s324">NP: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">KF: One of the S.S. troopers was being interrogated, I understand, and in the offices, and of course the American Army was doing the interrogating.</span> <span id="s326">This was not the medical profession that was, excuse me, doing the interrogating.</span> <span id="s327">But apparently this S.S. trooper was being interrogated and there were other, there were some of the prisoners there, a few, well-edu-, better educated and the prisoners that they felt they could rely on.</span> <span id="s328">Because there were all levels of integration in the camp.</span> <span id="s329">They were questioning this S.S., and as he came up to the man who was questioning him, which I’m sure was an American officer, he had his hat on, and he clicked his heels.</span> <span id="s330">And one of the prisoners that was also there, went up to him and snatched that cap off his head.</span> <span id="s331">And they said, in seconds.</span> <span id="s332">So you could see the attitude and the hatred and, that they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">NP: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">KF: But they said the S.S. troopers were the vicious and the real culprits of the German Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">NP: Had you mentioned that when news reached the various countries, about the concentration camps, that they existed, and the horrors that existed behind them, did you mention that Charles de Gaulle came through?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">KF: Yes.</span> <span id="s337">As we were there, we were there one month.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">KF: And if you were not in the building and you were outside, you saw these cars of de Gaulle.</span> <span id="s340">You saw congressmen from United States and many government officials from United States coming over because, to view the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">KF: And one day I saw General de Gaulle, with some other French officers, coming to drive through and document things that were going on there.</span> <span id="s343">I understand it was almost every day we saw some celebrities or some government officials from somewhere coming through and we happened to see them.</span> <span id="s344">It was a common thing.</span> <span id="s345">And then I understand that the United States government had told the officials in this country if they wanted to go, they could go, but they had to pay their own...</span></p> <p><span id="s346">NP: Their own way?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">KF: Their own way.</span> <span id="s348">So then we saw less of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">NP: I see.</span> <span id="s350">I see.</span> <span id="s351">The prisoners that you treated, did they then go on to other hospitals?</span> <span id="s352">Or do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">KF: No, the prisoners that we treated and survived, they were being sent back to their own country.</span> <span id="s354">And many of them did not want to go back to their own country.</span> <span id="s355">The Polish, from Poland, did not want to go back to Poland, because they said, “Take us back to United States with you.”</span> <span id="s356">Because they said, “Poland is no longer what we knew as Poland.”</span> <span id="s357">And they did not want to go back to their own country.</span> <span id="s358">They said, “What do we have to go back for?</span> <span id="s359">There’s nothing there for us to go back to.”</span> <span id="s360">That was a very sad thing.</span> <span id="s361">And we did, we felt, “Gee, I’d love to take them all.”</span> <span id="s362">You know, and you can’t.</span> <span id="s363">You just could not do it.</span> <span id="s364">You had to, it was a difficult time, but you had to remain your professional self...</span></p> <p><span id="s365">NP: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">KF: Just to be able to cope with these things.</span> <span id="s367">Because at one time when we first moved into the concentration camp we had to be careful if anybody drank a, perhaps there was a ration or a, we were able to get Coca-Cola or whatever.</span> <span id="s368">And the American troops perhaps would throw the empty can or whatever in the trash.</span> <span id="s369">Well, the prisoners were going through that to see if they could get a few drops of whatever...</span></p> <p><span id="s370">NP: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">KF: They could get out of it, you know.</span> <span id="s372">It was just, it was just a sad thing.</span> <span id="s373">So they had to be very careful what they even put in the trash cans.</span> <span id="s374">Because the prisoners... And then, of course, there was a lot of thievery going on.</span> <span id="s375">These people had been denied so much for so long that we had to protect everything so, because they stole everything in sight.</span> <span id="s376">If you didn’t keep it, you know, locked up or on guard, because as I said, they were very demented many of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">NP: And it was the only way they knew how to survive, these.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">KF: Well this is it.</span> <span id="s379">This is it.</span> <span id="s380">So we were tolerant and very patient with them, because they certainly deserved that.</span> <span id="s381">Your heart ached for these people, but you just had to do, to take care of them medically and help as many survive as you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">NP: Where did you go from there, Kay, after Dachau?</span> <span id="s383">Did you remain in Europe for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">KF: Yes.</span> <span id="s385">After Dachau [pause] I got, oh the last week that I was in Dachau, I was given what they would call rest and recuperation.</span> <span id="s386">This was our first chance, when, the time we’d been over there, that we had had any, any time off, any relief.</span> <span id="s387">And I got to spend seven days on the French Riviera, which was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">NP: A much needed rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">KF: And my unit was still at Dachau.</span> <span id="s390">And it was to help us, I guess, keep our sanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">NP: Yes, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">KF: And so they would let two nurses at a time go.</span> <span id="s393">Well, when I came back, then we got the word the Seventh Army was then moving us.</span> <span id="s394">I think we then went to Limburg, Germany.</span> <span id="s395">And I think I was transferred then into another unit...</span></p> <p><span id="s396">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">KF: Into Limburg, Germany.</span> <span id="s398">And I think it was 114th Evacuation Hospital.</span> <span id="s399">And they were set up in a school for priests and nuns.</span> <span id="s400">And that was an interesting short-term there.</span> <span id="s401">But then when we got ready to embark to come back to the United States they were nice enough to send us back as a unit, of the 116th Evacuation Hospital.</span> <span id="s402">But the people, the German people, you got varied reactions, depending on the area that you were in.</span> <span id="s403">Now I understand Limburg, Germany was a very hostile, and we were very careful who we even hardly spoke to.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">NP: Hostile to the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">KF: The Americans.</span> <span id="s406">And I understand, they were telling us that when the American troops or the American prisoners, those that were taken prisoner by the Germans, were marched through Germany, the people in Limburg stoned them.</span> <span id="s407">And this was before the war had ended.</span> <span id="s408">And, but as always, you always found some that were willing to do anything.</span> <span id="s409">They said, “Can we do some laundry for you?</span> <span id="s410">Can we do anything?”</span> <span id="s411">And of course, you could get your laundry done.</span> <span id="s412">There was ration of soap.</span> <span id="s413">If we gave them a bar of soap, this was after the war, they would do your laundry.</span> <span id="s414">They would do anything.</span> <span id="s415">If you gave them a pack of cigarettes, and of course I didn’t smoke so I could use my cigarettes to get my laundry done.</span> <span id="s416">And there were people that, you know, and you did get to talk to a few who were on the side of the Americans.</span> <span id="s417">But you were, you got to be very suspicious of anybody.</span> <span id="s418">And of course this was our indoctrination in the military that you just...</span></p> <p><span id="s419">NP: You had to keep your distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">KF: You keep your distance, and you just didn’t trust people that you didn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s421">NP: Really know.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">KF: That were from another country.</span> <span id="s423">And until you found out that you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">NP: If we might back up a little bit, a thought comes to my mind.</span> <span id="s425">The prisoners that you treated in Dachau...</span></p> <p><span id="s426">KF: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">NP: Did they speak, and they were men, all men?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">KF: Yes, at one time they were all men.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">NP: Did they speak, well, did they speak of wives?</span> <span id="s430">Of children?</span> <span id="s431">Of any family?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">KF: Some of them did.</span> <span id="s433">Some of them knew that their families had been killed.</span> <span id="s434">But the S.S. troopers had segregated so many, their husbands from their wives, they had no idea where their wives were.</span> <span id="s435">They had no idea where their family was.</span> <span id="s436">We in this country have no idea now devastating a war is.</span> <span id="s437">It isn’t only the killing, but it’s the uprooting of the family.</span> <span id="s438">It’s, your whole life is changed.</span> <span id="s439">And when I came back to this country and people say, “Do you think we’ll have another war?”</span> <span id="s440">And that’s all you needed for someone to make a remark like that to you, your stomach churned.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">NP: Certainly.</span> <span id="s442">Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">KF: They had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">NP: The devastation.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">KF: It isn’t only, it’s the black market.</span> <span id="s446">It’s the whole destruction of the whole world.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">NP: What people are reduced to because...</span></p> <p><span id="s448">KF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">NP: Of this terrible war.</span> <span id="s450">Did anybody have anything with them?</span> <span id="s451">Any pictures?</span> <span id="s452">Anything at all?</span> <span id="s453">Any remnant of their former life?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">KF: No, because they had been stripped.</span> <span id="s455">When they were put in concentration camps, they were just stripped of the gold in their teeth.</span> <span id="s456">They were stripped of all, any jewelry.</span> <span id="s457">They were stripped of any clothing they had.</span> <span id="s458">As you will see in one of these pictures...piles of body of clothing that were just put off for trash.</span> <span id="s459">And they were stripped of everything and just given a uniform and that’s what they had to wear.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">NP: So they were totally in limbo.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">KF: They had, one of the books that I have read, that gave such a good picture of concentration life is Corrie Ten Boom’s.</span> <span id="s462">She has written several books.</span> <span id="s463">But when she was lecturing in this country, my son got to meet her.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">NP: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s465">KF: And he told me that he had met her.</span> <span id="s466">And I said, “Well, if you see her again, you tell her that I was aware of the horrible things of the concentration camp.”</span> <span id="s467">She was a Holland Dutch woman, whose family had been, she lost her family because of, they had protected the Jewish families.</span> <span id="s468">They had an underground in their home for Jewish people coming through.</span> <span id="s469">And her book is well worth reading.</span> <span id="s470">She has written several books, and I haven’t read them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">NP: Their, her last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">KF: Corrie Ten Boom.</span> <span id="s473">Do you want to turn your tape off and I’m going to go get her book.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">NP: All right, except that I do have a couple of questions, unless you’re tired.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">KF: No.</span> <span id="s476">I’m fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">NP: Well, these were prepared by Phil Solomon, who, too, was a liberator in one of the army units.</span> <span id="s478">And one of the questions was, did you examine all of the survivors in the camps or only those who came forward with complaints?</span> <span id="s479">But then, of course, you have explained the triage situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">KF: Right.</span> <span id="s481">So they were sent to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">NP: Yes.</span> <span id="s483">I think that about covers it.</span> <span id="s484">I had asked you about were you involved with the evacuation of the patients.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">KF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">NP: No.</span> <span id="s487">Just in the treatment.</span> <span id="s488">Kay, you mentioned to me about why you thought it was important to do this interview.</span> <span id="s489">And you mentioned something about those that say, “This never happened,” the experience that you’ve just described.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">KF: Yes, our younger generation, part of it is many people who had been victims of the concentration camps have tried to put this out of their mind and live a new life.</span> <span id="s491">And our, it’s too painful for them to talk about.</span> <span id="s492">And I really got quite perturbed when I heard someone say that they thought these concentration camp stories were a lot of propaganda.</span> <span id="s493">It made me decide that I wanted to do something to make people realize it was not a lot of propaganda.</span> <span id="s494">It actually happened.</span> <span id="s495">And the younger generation, I think, should be made aware of what can happen and many, and I presume, this could happen, that there were German people over there that did not realize that this was going on.</span> <span id="s496">As in this country, very often we hear news by television or radio or particularly television, of things that are happening in this country.</span> <span id="s497">Had we not had the television, we did not know these things were going on.</span> <span id="s498">And I’m sure this happened.</span> <span id="s499">Now that we have the television perhaps some things are not the best, but at least we’re getting news of what’s going on.</span> <span id="s500">At that time they had radio.</span> <span id="s501">They didn’t have television.</span> <span id="s502">And the German people were kept in the dark as much as possible.</span> <span id="s503">They were given what propaganda the government wanted them to have.</span> <span id="s504">And a few people, the German people that I did question about this, they actually were perturbed.</span> <span id="s505">Now when, I happened to be in my room when the government, the United States government had talked to the farmers that lived in the area...</span></p> <p><span id="s506">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">KF: And had them come with their wagons and horses, and load these bodies.</span> <span id="s508">And what they did was went out the front gate.</span> <span id="s509">And as they were going out the front gate, I was in my room.</span> <span id="s510">And I took a picture of, I happened to have a camera in my room.</span> <span id="s511">I took a picture and I counted.</span> <span id="s512">There were sixteen wagonloads going out the gate.</span> <span id="s513">What they did was march them through the city of München.</span> <span id="s514">We call it Munich, but actually the Germans called it München.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">NP: München.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">KF: To show the people what had gone on.</span> <span id="s517">Because many of them refused to believe it.</span> <span id="s518">And they wanted the people to really see what was going on.</span> <span id="s519">Now there were many beautiful, expensive homes outside the camps, where the S.S. troopers lived.</span> <span id="s520">And München was a beautiful city, from what I understand.</span> <span id="s521">I only got in there one day.</span> <span id="s522">It was a modern city.</span> <span id="s523">We were amazed at all the electric appliances and all the beautiful things that, where the troopers lived.</span> <span id="s524">But the average German peasant was not aware of, I’m not saying they were not, that, they may, many were aware, but were afraid to speak up.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">NP: These farmers that they gathered to bring their wagons and so forth, they were, they surrounded Dachau.</span> <span id="s526">They were in the neighboring farms.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">KF: That’s where they got them.</span> <span id="s528">Now, these farmers were very reluctant, and they did not want to come in and do it, because they were afraid of getting typhus.</span> <span id="s529">And, but when the American government said, “You do it...”</span></p> <p><span id="s530">NP: They did it.</span> <span id="s531">Do you think they knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">KF: Well there again, I said...</span></p> <p><span id="s533">NP: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">KF: Some may have known and were afraid to speak up.</span> <span id="s535">And I’m sure perhaps there were some that they may have known some of it.</span> <span id="s536">But to what extent?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">NP: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">KF: And, like the average person, what can you do?</span> <span id="s539">It’s just like one person speaking out.</span> <span id="s540">Unless you have authority and so forth, and really had someone backing you, just one little voice...</span></p> <p><span id="s541">NP: Did you ever meet anybody from the underground, anybody that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s542">KF: Well, Hans Gertzug.</span> <span id="s543">Hans.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">NP: O.K., Hans.</span> <span id="s545">Besides Hans?</span> <span id="s546">But he...</span></p> <p><span id="s547">KF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">NP: He was very much in...</span></p> <p><span id="s549">KF: I never had, I really didn’t get a chance to talk to Major Gerard too much.</span> <span id="s550">And as I say, we were so busy at the time, we didn’t get to sit down and talk to these people like we would like to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">NP: Of course.</span> <span id="s552">Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">KF: And they were busy.</span> <span id="s554">The United States government was keeping them busy, helping them to accumulate information for the Nuremberg Trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">NP: Certainly, that was their first priority.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">KF: So we saw them only occasionally.</span> <span id="s557">And then of course in conversation, short conversations, we got a little bit of this.</span> <span id="s558">But apparently there was a lot of underground.</span> <span id="s559">And I understand just before the American government liberated the camp, a French General was cremated, was gassed and cremated in the... Apparently he was trying to...</span></p> <p><span id="s560">NP: Be part of the underground and...</span></p> <p><span id="s561">KF: Be part of the underground.</span> <span id="s562">We didn’t get the details on it, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s563">NP: Was there something, I don’t know whether it was Dr. Eichner or was it you, had mentioned something about one of the German, one of the S.S., that he was taken out and shot.</span> <span id="s564">A German officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">KF: Well, there were many, many German officers, their bodies were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">NP: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">KF: They had been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">NP: I thought this was something that you had witnessed...</span></p> <p><span id="s569">KF: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">NP: At one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">KF: One thing that, an American reporter, who was a woman, and of course reporters were aggressive people...</span></p> <p><span id="s572">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">KF: Had wanted a story.</span> <span id="s574">And I understand this was perhaps the day or so before we arrived.</span> <span id="s575">Our commanding officer told us this, that they had found the Assistant Kommandant of the camp and some of the guards of the camp had captured them.</span> <span id="s576">And what they did was, they were, wanted to belittle them in front of all the prisoners.</span> <span id="s577">So American prisoners were marching them with their hands up behind their heads, through the compound, which was a fenced-in area where the prisoners lived.</span> <span id="s578">And they had just marched them in for a very short distance.</span> <span id="s579">And it was just a number of three or four of them that, and of course the American prisoners were marching them.</span> <span id="s580">And the prisoners that were in the compound at the time actually overpowered the prisoners and tore them limb from limb.</span> <span id="s581">And what could the American military do but just, they certainly couldn’t shoot the prisoners.</span> <span id="s582">So they just had to turn their backs.</span> <span id="s583">Then an American woman was going to go in to get an interview and get a story.</span> <span id="s584">When she saw what had happened, she changed her mind.</span> <span id="s585">Now when we went in there, these men had not seen a woman in a long time.</span> <span id="s586">They had not seen an American woman, many of them, ever.</span> <span id="s587">And of course we were well-nourished.</span> <span id="s588">We were not, we were in fatigues.</span> <span id="s589">We were not dressed as women, but they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s590">NP: It was undeniable...</span></p> <p><span id="s591">KF: All eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">NP: That you were women.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">KF: Yes.</span> <span id="s594">And of course, our enlisted men, we did not go on our own.</span> <span id="s595">We went with protection of our enlisted men, who would protect us if the prisoners did get out of hand.</span> <span id="s596">And of course there were enough American soldiers around at that time that we had no fear.</span> <span id="s597">And of course at that time when we first went through it, we didn’t realize, I don’t think, that these people were as demented, some of them, as they were.</span> <span id="s598">Because all they did was just stare at us.</span> <span id="s599">And they did not release all the prisoners out of the gate, out of the fenced-in area, when they captured the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">KF: Because it would have been chaos to have just opened the gates and let everybody out.</span> <span id="s602">This way, the American government, or the American soldiers, could keep control of the situation.</span> <span id="s603">Had they opened up the fenced-in area and let everybody out, they would have lost control of everything and not been able to document anything or whatever.</span> <span id="s604">So it had to have been, it had to be done systematically.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">KF: And of course they warned us about these things, you know.</span> <span id="s607">And we didn’t have any casualties.</span> <span id="s608">One of the nurses did contract a hepatitis from...</span></p> <p><span id="s609">NP: The blood, I guess, or a needle or whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">KF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">NP: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">KF: It might have been just the atmosphere or whatever.</span> <span id="s613">But fortunately we were in good health, and we had enough resistance that we had no problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">NP: You were very fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">KF: But we did, we had a very fine group of doctors and nurses that worked all well together.</span> <span id="s616">And the cooperation was very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">NP: Well, what you’ve done is just incredible, the care that you took, and so that no one can say this didn’t happen, as you had remarked to me...</span></p> <p><span id="s618">KF: That’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">NP: That your children will know, will have this tape, and future generations will have your testimony.</span> <span id="s620">And that beautiful little grandchild there will know what a heroine really their grandmother is.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">KF: Well, this is, I want to document this, because in future generations for my grandchildren, and anyone else’s, that it will be preserved.</span> <span id="s622">Because I think any of these things that happened to any of these countries- [tape ends]</span></p></body></html>
