Lowenberg.</span> <span id="s45">Mountain lion in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: We t -- we -- we talk about the change of the name a little later on --</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: -- since this is sort of the official introduction.</span> <span id="s49">And now that we know who is talking to us, I would like to begin with liberation.</span> <span id="s50">How was liberation for you, when was it, and -- and what kind of state of mind were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Circumstances, okay.</span> <span id="s52">Well, I was in the labor came and one day my older friend approached me and said, Cornell, next morning when the train pulls out from the station, you and I are staying, and we going to hide someplace.</span> <span id="s53">We are not leaving with this train.</span> <span id="s54">Cause the train was going on and on and on of course.</span> <span id="s55">And, of course, my -- my closest friends were my age, see, he was a little bit older, maybe wiser, and he had certain ideas, you see.</span> <span id="s56">So next day as the train was ready to pull out, and that was in hunga -- Hungary, of course, he -- the train started to move and I had sort of, you know my younger friends, they were all going up on a train and I was ready to move on the train and he grabbed -- fortunately he grabbed my arm, he says, we’re staying.</span> <span id="s57">And we didn’t stay.</span> <span id="s58">And the train pulled out, and then we hit the road, and we walked on the highway.</span> <span id="s59">And after awhile we got off the highway, because it was dangerous, you know, trucks were coming with Hungarian soldiers, and maybe German soldiers, we didn’t want to stay on the highway, too obvious.</span> <span id="s60">So we moved off the highway and about maybe quarter of a mile, half a mile, and there was some water there, and some little river, and we just sat down there and was waiting for the dark.</span> <span id="s61">We’re thinking what’s going to happen now, see?</span> <span id="s62">Actually it was -- well, it was Hungary in no -- ru -- th-that -- it was Romania, Romania at that time, yeah, because it was always back and forth Hungary and Romania and back and forth.</span> <span id="s63">And before it got dark, some Hungarian soldiers stopped on the highway and came towards the river.</span> <span id="s64">So we got sort of a little bit scared, but then you have to act cool, right?</span> <span id="s65">And as they were getting closer and closer, we got up and we waved to them.</span> <span id="s66">[indecipherable] come over here, here is the river, see?</span> <span id="s67">Came over, sa -- and they came over and then one of them asked us, he says, what are you doing?</span> <span id="s68">We says, ah, we got late -- we got off the train -- w-we missed the train, we’re waiting.</span> <span id="s69">Oh.</span> <span id="s70">They didn’t make a big issue out of it, we’re lucky.</span> <span id="s71">Then they left.</span> <span id="s72">Later it became dark.</span> <span id="s73">A Romanian farmer came across the river and he said he is willing to hide us.</span> <span id="s74">So all right.</span> <span id="s75">Actually it was four of us, yeah, this older guy, me and two other guys [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s76">So, we accepted, what choice do you have, right?</span> <span id="s77">So we went -- he took us to his little farm and we went upstairs in his barn and we were hiding there.</span> <span id="s78">We were hiding for a few days and suddenly we hear guns, guns, guns, Russian guns getting closer and closer.</span> <span id="s79">We had food, we fed us potatoes, we’re not hungry, had water and everything.</span> <span id="s80">And -- and then he came -- one evening he cames over and he said the Russians are next door in the next village, but they celebrating.</span> <span id="s81">So, d -- you know, how long are they gonna celebrate?</span> <span id="s82">But two days later they came, the Russians and the Romanians.</span> <span id="s83">First thing is a Romanian soldier I remember, first thing he did, he took my watch.</span> <span id="s84">So wa -- so I asked him, I says -- some -- somewhat we conversed, you know.</span> <span id="s85">I said, why are you taking my watch?</span> <span id="s86">He says, I have to give it to the Russians.</span> <span id="s87">[indecipherable] okay.</span> <span id="s88">The next Romanian took my shoes, which I didn't mind because it had nails from inside, you know?</span> <span id="s89">So he gave me his shoes.</span> <span id="s90">I think it was a good trade.</span> <span id="s91">Anyway, so then we -- no, says, well let’s start an -- let’s start walking.</span> <span id="s92">Walking the -- th-the aim, the goal was to reach his hometown in Hungary, which was probably hundred miles from there, roughly.</span> <span id="s93">So we’re walking, maybe we get some rides.</span> <span id="s94">So we walked on the highway, see?</span> <span id="s95">And so the Russian Cossacks on horses on the highway, shooting apple off the trees, and all that.</span> <span id="s96">And then came a Russian -- Russian soldiers, you know, on -- on -- on trucks, they stopped, and they asked us, they said what -- who are you?</span> <span id="s97">Says, well we are, you know, we were in labor camps.</span> <span id="s98">Th-Th -- actually didn’t know exactly what you are talking about, this -- they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s99">What do they know?</span> <span id="s100">So it’s -- one [indecipherable] ask who -- who -- where you from?</span> <span id="s101">I says, I am from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s102">He says, wh-wh-why aren’t you fighting with the partisans?</span> <span id="s103">[indecipherable] going to explain it.</span> <span id="s104">But anyway -- and I spoke Russian, fortunately.</span> <span id="s105">That was another thing by the way, my f -- my -- my f -- older friend was smart too, he knew with me -- he was going need the Russian language.</span> <span id="s106">So he was not stupid.</span> <span id="s107">So I spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s108">Okay, so oh, oh, all right, fine, fine.</span> <span id="s109">And a Jewish officer, Russian officer came over and was talking to me, so, are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s110">I say yes.</span> <span id="s111">He says, okay, I am too, he says, but be quiet, don’t tell the Russian soldier that I’m -- they don’t know that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s112">Interesting.</span> <span id="s113">I don’t recall now if that truck, or we -- I think we took a ride with them, they took us for a few miles, 20 - 30 - 40 miles, then we got off again.</span> <span id="s114">Well, eventually, in about two days, we got into his hometown.</span> <span id="s115">His wife was there, of course, his wife was a Gentile.</span> <span id="s116">He was also half Jewish like I was, I didn't mention that.</span> <span id="s117">His wife was Gentile, of course.</span> <span id="s118">And in his hometown, there’s absolutely no sign or war.</span> <span id="s119">There was no sign of war, it was peace.</span> <span id="s120">Food like in the peacetime.</span> <span id="s121">Duck, geese, anything, it was just [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s122">So we s -- I s -- the two guys and myself, we staying by their house, and we stayed with them, of course.</span> <span id="s123">The name of the city was Bekes-Gyula.</span> <span id="s124">It was about maybe 60 miles from Budapest --</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: -- 60 - 70 miles from Budapest.</span> <span id="s127">We stayed there.</span> <span id="s128">I did not know at that time if my parents are okay -- they lived in Budapest, see?</span> <span id="s129">And I had a brother who was in Borr, Borr was a famous camp, you probably heard about it, the copper mines, you know, and they took from Hungary, these kids to Borr in ’44.</span> <span id="s130">Later I -- somehow I found out through somebody who came from Budapest that my parents are alive, but my brother died, he was killed in Borr.</span> <span id="s131">He was murdered in Borr.</span> <span id="s132">Later, after the war, my cousin went to Borr by the way and recovered his body and brought his body back to Novi Sad, to my hometown, where he was buried.</span> <span id="s133">Now, the idea was to get to Budapest, but Budapest was not liberated yet, that time, well, they were still fighting for Budapest.</span> <span id="s134">And then I got a job as an interpreter with -- in a Russian h-hospital.</span> <span id="s135">The commander was Jewish, by the way.</span> <span id="s136">We became sort of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: That was in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: In -- no, that was still in -- in Bekes-Gyula.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: In Bekes-Gyula, and [indecipherable] of course, from Budapest gets liberated right away, we’ll go to Budapest.</span> <span id="s141">Sure enough, we went to Budapest with him, with the Russian commander, and arrived in Budapest -- it was unbelievable, of course.</span> <span id="s142">People starving on the streets, coming over to the truck, begging for food, will give you anything.</span> <span id="s143">Gold rings, whatever you have, for a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s144">Was pathetic.</span> <span id="s145">And the city looked, of course, terrible.</span> <span id="s146">It was just a day after liberation, still t -- heard shootings and everything.</span> <span id="s147">And now the idea was to find my parents.</span> <span id="s148">Well, I knew where they lived, see, because I lived in an apartment too, before I went to labor camp.</span> <span id="s149">So that was no problem to find them.</span> <span id="s150">So we -- we drove over there, with the truck.</span> <span id="s151">And my mother opened the door.</span> <span id="s152">She didn't know I was coming, of course, she opened the door, and she saw me, it was unbelievable, you know, like ah.</span> <span id="s153">She didn’t know the circumstances.</span> <span id="s154">And then -- course we talked about my brother and everything, and they were in good shape, they were lucky, and then -- of course we invited -- the Russian commander stayed there in the apartment, he s -- he lived there.</span> <span id="s155">We -- I don’t know how long I will stay, but I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s156">I remember one day in Budapest, I was walking down the street, and came these Russian soldiers, surrounded a whole block and took every man, every man from that block, they took into a backyard, into a big backyard, a schoolyard or something.</span> <span id="s157">I did not like the idea, I knew there is something wrong here, something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s158">So I said, I better work fast here.</span> <span id="s159">So I found a soldier in the group there, and I told him, hey, do me a favor.</span> <span id="s160">Go over to this place -- I gave him my mother’s address -- find my commander, and tell him to come over here immediately, I need him.</span> <span id="s161">I was very, very lucky, cause the Russians were unreliable, very unreliable people.</span> <span id="s162">Big liars and unreliable.</span> <span id="s163">Now, first of all, he has to find the place.</span> <span id="s164">He’s not a Hungarian, you know?</span> <span id="s165">I just give him an address.</span> <span id="s166">Then, he has to go, to begin with.</span> <span id="s167">And then he has -- and then he has to find the commander in the house and bring him over here, because this is a matter of time now, right.</span> <span id="s168">He did go.</span> <span id="s169">He did bring the commander, and the commander came in.</span> <span id="s170">I told him what the story is -- well, he knew, so he talked to the commander in the yard and told him, this is -- I need this man, he is my interpreter.</span> <span id="s171">I need him, you have to release him.</span> <span id="s172">Okay, that’s it.</span> <span id="s173">He saved me.</span> <span id="s174">I don’t have to tell you what happened to the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s175">Russia.</span> <span id="s176">Took them to Russia.</span> <span id="s177">Many of them probably died.</span> <span id="s178">Matter of fact, not in that group, but I know my father’s -- one of his good friends from Yugoslavia originally, who was in a German concentration camp, and who came back liberated from ra -- from Germany, was caught in one of these Russian affairs, you know, taken to Russia and died in Russia.</span> <span id="s179">Terrible.</span> <span id="s180">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: W-We should probably add that your mother was a Gentile and then stayed in Budapest for --</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Yeah, of course, that’s why -- exactly, that’s why how could -- she could stay because she was Gentile, and she lived in this apartment house, and the -- the land -- not the landlord, the -- the -- ha -- the keep -- not e -- the manager of the house was also, of course, Gentile and he told the soldiers when the soldiers came a few times, who are these people, he said, this is Mrs. Loen -- Lowenberg at that time, of course, and she’s a Gentile person, you know, she was [indecipherable] the name, her father was actually German, the mother was Hungarian.</span> <span id="s183">Of course, my mother did convert, you know, but they didn’t know that, originally.</span> <span id="s184">And then she had the opportunity to save a lot of Jewish people from this apartment house.</span> <span id="s185">They were moved, before, to another apartment house, downtown Budapest and my mother used to take food there.</span> <span id="s186">Yeah, she ta-take them -- took them food, let her in, you know, and one time one of the guards I think was objecting and so forth, and what she said, you have to let me in because these people owe me money.</span> <span id="s187">Something like that, you know, sh-she’s smart.</span> <span id="s188">And -- and she has -- I don’t know if Masha mentioned it to you in j -- in Jerusalem she has a plaque, you know, and sh -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Yes, she did mention it, but we should talk a little bit more about it later on because there was also a celebration in Los Angeles, I understand [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yeah, oh yeah, big one with George Putnam.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Oh, she said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: She said that</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: -- I would like you to say that a little later when we --</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yeah, okay --</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: -- when we get to that topic.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s199">So anyway -- so then, a wa -- as I say, I was lucky, he saved me.</span> <span id="s200">Then I went back to -- I was going back and forth from this Bekes-Gyula, you know, where I lived with my friend, because th -- I lived there, actually.</span> <span id="s201">I didn't move right away back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s202">And we used to do some funny business, we went to Romania from Hungary and smuggled certain things.</span> <span id="s203">Like one time we smuggled a carload of sugar, and the Romanians mixed it with salt, so we had to throw the whole thing -- that reminded me, Stalin -- Stalin said once, he says, Romanians are not a nation, they’re a profession.</span> <span id="s204">It’s true.</span> <span id="s205">Was very, very disgusting, but what can you do?</span> <span id="s206">Amazing.</span> <span id="s207">I told the story the other day to a Romanian guy about the sugar, so he said right away, they mixed it with salt, didn’t they?</span> <span id="s208">So he knew.</span> <span id="s209">This was now, in 1999.</span> <span id="s210">See, a Romanian.</span> <span id="s211">Takes a Romanian to know.</span> <span id="s212">But my friend, by the way, where I lived in -- in -- interestingly enough, I remember he had a brother who lived in London, who went to London before the war, and he was on the British Broadcasting Corporation, yes?</span> <span id="s213">His name was Haytai.</span> <span id="s214">I don’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s215">I don’t know what happened to the brother.</span> <span id="s216">I know one thing, the brother where we lived, it was very nice, and the wife was nice, but they were constantly fighting, which made it sort of unpleasant sometimes, you know, to live and stay and eat in a place where the -- th-the host and the hostess constantly fight.</span> <span id="s217">The reason I don’t know.</span> <span id="s218">But anyway, he was too much in business, he was a businessman and preoccupied with business, and I think that’s what she objected to.</span> <span id="s219">She was fairly young woman yet, you know, the man comes back after, you know, so many years from a labor camp and then he -- 99 percent he spends in business, you know, and one percent with the wife.</span> <span id="s220">But then -- then eventually, of course, we split because I did go back to Budapest and -- and stayed with my parents.</span> <span id="s221">Now the goal at that time was eventually to go to America where my older brother -- Masha, I’m sure mentioned it to you, Ernest le -- came in 1938, he stayed here.</span> <span id="s222">So we have to get somehow out here, and -- and the parents were working on it, too, but I had to leave, somehow, Hungary and go to Austria, sort of the bridge, then from Austria to America.</span> <span id="s223">So I had [indecipherable] first to cross the border.</span> <span id="s224">Couldn’t go it legally.</span> <span id="s225">So at night, with one of my good friends who was with me in the labor camp, he was -- by the way, I don’t know if I mentioned it before, that a lot of the guys were killed from -- on that train when we left -- oh, I didn’t say that, yeah, where he pulled me away from the train and the train went on, lot of these kids were -- lot of them were murdered later in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: How do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: We knew, we found out from somebody else.</span> <span id="s228">Yeah, that was a fact.</span> <span id="s229">So that was -- I was really lucky.</span> <span id="s230">Who knows what would have happened?</span> <span id="s231">But this -- this guy -- this -- this kid who le-left Hungary with me to Austria, Segeti Pauli was my best friend.</span> <span id="s232">He also escaped the train, the same train, a few stations later.</span> <span id="s233">So whoever escaped [indecipherable] well, anyway, so at night we crossed the border, paid a few forints, or whatever, panguat, I don’t remember the currency, and we crossed the border and came to Austria.</span> <span id="s234">So then we went to Vienna first and then [indecipherable] I was to get to a displaced camp, and we knew about two displaced camps in Linz, Linz on the Danube.</span> <span id="s235">It’s between Salzburg and Vienna, about halfway.</span> <span id="s236">And so we went to this -- that was easy when you get to a displaced camp, right away you register, you know.</span> <span id="s237">First we went to Lakeside, which was pretty lousy conditions, but then we went to Bindermichl.</span> <span id="s238">Now Bindermichl was like a -- a Hilton in comparison with Lakeside, right?</span> <span id="s239">And got a nice room, kitchen facilities.</span> <span id="s240">So -- he was married, by the way, my friend, married.</span> <span id="s241">And so we stayed there, he and his wife and myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Before I ask you more questions about that, I would like to just ask you one m -- other question about wartime experience.</span> <span id="s243">Was there a difference that you had because you were half Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Oh, of course it was different, because ev -- first of all, we were -- well, i-i-in -- in that camp it was different because there was never a danger of being killed, you see?</span> <span id="s245">Food three times a day.</span> <span id="s246">I me -- not weinerschnitzel, you understand, but beans -- bean soup, a -- but food.</span> <span id="s247">Coffee, everything.</span> <span id="s248">No problem.</span> <span id="s249">The commander was a lieutenant, nice guy, alcoholic, was drinking, you know?</span> <span id="s250">And just did what he had to do.</span> <span id="s251">Were never any beatings, were never any threatening.</span> <span id="s252">Matter of fact, we didn’t know at that time what was really going on, except once, where in the very beginning for instance, on weekends, I used to go back to Budapest, to my parents on weekends, it was so easy.</span> <span id="s253">And then we stopped at one station and there comes a train from Budapest, with people, you know, they were taking them to Poland in cattle cars.</span> <span id="s254">People just crying for water.</span> <span id="s255">So what’s going on?</span> <span id="s256">This was the first time that we realized that something -- something is going on, you see?</span> <span id="s257">And -- but we couldn’t get close to the train, they didn’t let us close.</span> <span id="s258">But as I say, it was -- a lot of half Jews were killed and murdered in Auschwitz, you know, I was just lucky that we stayed there and nobody bothered to -- to -- you know, to take us anywhere.</span> <span id="s259">So we stayed -- a mat -- fr-from that place, by the way, then we moved, a few months later, to another place that was in Romania, Gerdameshtahausa, also we were lucky, also circumstances normal, we were burying Hungarian soldiers, they brought them from Russia, you know, and they’re burying them, I remember it was one of the tasks we did.</span> <span id="s260">And in the f-first place, we were -- we did -- we build railroad tracks, you know, and unloaded railroad cars, you see.</span> <span id="s261">And then I remember one day German troops came, and I st -- I -- speaking German of course, so I spoke to one of the Germans and they said -- he says, today the invasion started, he told me, it’s a very good feeling.</span> <span id="s262">And I say, oh really, bah bah and da da da.</span> <span id="s263">But as I say, we were lucky, you know, it was luck.</span> <span id="s264">Many, many times it was really luck, lucky circumstances that nothing really happened.</span> <span id="s265">Th --</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: So let’s -- let’s go to the DP camp then, the Hilton, quote unquote, where you stayed.</span> <span id="s267">What -- what did you do there?</span> <span id="s268">What -- what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: In the -- in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: In the camp, yeah.</span> <span id="s271">Well now, going back to Austria, to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Bindermichl, Bindermichl, Bindermichl.</span> <span id="s273">I was -- I was thinking of something else, well okay, anyway, in Austria, okay, so that was in Bindermichl, right?</span> <span id="s274">So in Bindermichl, nothing, black marketing, you know, no -- no big things, whatever we could do.</span> <span id="s275">Well, I didn’t do too much in that, and I was not a -- a real expert.</span> <span id="s276">Some guys made a lot of money.</span> <span id="s277">But any -- one day I was walking down, oh, you know, in -- in the camp itself, and I saw this girl.</span> <span id="s278">Masha, yeah.</span> <span id="s279">It’s a beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s280">Said, where did she come from?</span> <span id="s281">She was absolutely stunning.</span> <span id="s282">So it’s ju -- un-unbelievable how beautiful she is.</span> <span id="s283">So we started talking, you know, da da da da da da, talking, talking, talking, and then started going together, I invited her [indecipherable] to a concert, she says, what’s a concert, you know, she’d never been to a concert.</span> <span id="s284">She would rather go dancing, like you.</span> <span id="s285">But anyway, then I met her father and her stepmother, because her mother was killed in the camp, of course, with her sisters.</span> <span id="s286">And so we got closer and closer, and so I says -- well, eventually we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: What did you like about her?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Well, she was very attractive, very attr -- different personality, she looked so different than anybody else in that camp.</span> <span id="s289">No, really, she was really beautiful, I -- I fell in love with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Describe her.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Describe her.</span> <span id="s293">What did she look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: I don’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s295">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s296">It’s crazy, it’s crazy.</span> <span id="s297">And so, you know, she had -- sh-she -- she -- she knew that I was -- had plans to go to America, too, and -- she had boyfriends, of course, before.</span> <span id="s298">As a matter of fact, she had a boyfriend who went to Italy.</span> <span id="s299">And he found out later from my friends -- my friends, you know, the one I told you I lived with, and his wife, he went to Italy and he met this guy, and this guy told him that he has a girlfriend in -- in Austria, and he said who?</span> <span id="s300">So he says, you’re too late.</span> <span id="s301">She’s -- she’s getting married.</span> <span id="s302">Funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: So whe-when did you marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: ’47.</span> <span id="s305">1947.</span> <span id="s306">Yeah, she was very young.</span> <span id="s307">Course, I was what, ’47, I was 25, Masha was probably, what is it, 18.</span> <span id="s308">18?</span> <span id="s309">Yeah, I think she was 18.</span> <span id="s310">I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: [indecipherable] 17, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: 17 or 18, something like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: She was born in ’30, 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s315">Was very young, very young.</span> <span id="s316">But we got married in -- in -- in Bindermichl, you know, Jewish wedding, break the glasses, everything at the end, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Oh, did you -- were you brought up -- you were brought up in the -- in the Jewish tradition?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Well yeah -- y -- really yes, that’s interesting, yes.</span> <span id="s319">See, my father was Jewish, my mother was Gentile, but as I say, my moth -- mother, at one time, she converted see?</span> <span id="s320">And i-it was a -- it was a jew -- not a religious Jewish home, you know, but tradition.</span> <span id="s321">Jewish holidays we celebrated.</span> <span id="s322">My father’s father, I mean, he was more -- you know, more Jewish, but -- but we celebrated the Jewish holidays, all the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s323">So it was a -- it was a -- really a Jewish -- I was Bar Mitzvahed when I was, you know, 13.</span> <span id="s324">So -- so was my older brother, too, and my -- my middle brother, who was killed.</span> <span id="s325">And I had interestingly enough, strange but true, I had cousins in Hungary who were Hungarians, and pro-Nazi.</span> <span id="s326">Well, of course, you see this is s-sad but true, pro-Nazi.</span> <span id="s327">I had an uncle, my mother’s brother, who walked in the night when the Hungarian army came into bu -- to -- to -- to Novi Sad, to my town in 1942, he walked in in a Nazi uniform.</span> <span id="s328">That’s my brothers -- my -- my mother’s brother, my Uncle Steffie, comes in with a Nazi uniform, with the hackenkreuz, you know, on his left arm.</span> <span id="s329">He says, I’m sorry [indecipherable] -- he was drinking, he liked to drink.</span> <span id="s330">He says, I’m sorry, but I can’t help you.</span> <span id="s331">The reason he came.</span> <span id="s332">He says, I can’t help you.</span> <span id="s333">Sad.</span> <span id="s334">And his wife too, of course they were all brought -- and like I say, my -- my cousin in Budapest was in Hungarian army.</span> <span id="s335">We all s -- the youngsters, you know, they used to come to Yugoslavia in the summertime.</span> <span id="s336">We were pretty well to do, you know, they were sort of poor people, so they -- we brought them, you know, to Yugoslavia on resorts, you know, they stay there.</span> <span id="s337">And they were always, you know, different than we were.</span> <span id="s338">Th-They were -- were Catholics, you know, pretty religious Catholics.</span> <span id="s339">So we always had these political arguments, you know.</span> <span id="s340">And there again, they -- they couldn’t help us too much when was a big pogrom in Yugoslavia, in Novi Sad, you heard about it, in 1942, when they killed 1500 Jews in one day and everything, and nobody would help, nobody.</span> <span id="s341">You couldn’t go to anybody.</span> <span id="s342">That’s when --</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: So they didn't want to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Nobody help.</span> <span id="s345">Th-That’s when my -- my father’s brother and his wife and the daughter and the whole family was killed in one -- they shot and thrown in the Danube river.</span> <span id="s346">Was very, very cold day.</span> <span id="s347">They -- the Danube was frozen, they had to dig holes to shoot.</span> <span id="s348">And the Croatian people, the Croatians across the Danube river were applauding.</span> <span id="s349">Nice.</span> <span id="s350">Very nice people, Croatians.</span> <span id="s351">Murderers.</span> <span id="s352">But anyway, like I say -- okay, so Masha and I, right, so we started corresponding and writing to America, to my brother and getting the affidavits ready, da da da.</span> <span id="s353">My parents left Europe earlier, they left in -- yes, in ’48, one year before we went.</span> <span id="s354">And bad luck.</span> <span id="s355">As it happened, my father send a lot of things in mail, Persian carpets, yeah.</span> <span id="s356">Nice paintings.</span> <span id="s357">A Persian carpet is the most valuable item.</span> <span id="s358">Everything was stolen.</span> <span id="s359">All the crates came empty and the insurance company didn’t pay a nickel because the things were open.</span> <span id="s360">But yet that’s why they said they could -- they -- he said, the things were stolen in Europe obviously, not during shipping.</span> <span id="s361">He couldn’t collect a penny.</span> <span id="s362">That was like the [indecipherable] now, you know.</span> <span id="s363">He didn’t pursue that, he shou -- and I s -- and I am sure it’s too late now for me to do anything about that.</span> <span id="s364">I don’t even know --</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: So he-he -- he -- they ha -- came here and had nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Noth -- and the cou -- [indecipherable] empty so they couldn’t prove anything.</span> <span id="s367">That’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s368">I don’t know if I could do anything about it today because I don’t -- do not recall, now everybody died there -- died -- mother died, my brother just died a -- seven, eight weeks ago, my older brother.</span> <span id="s369">So I have no idea who they arranged wit -- with.</span> <span id="s370">Could have been a German company, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s371">But anyway, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Let’s -- let’s talk a little bit more about Austria.</span> <span id="s373">You worked for the Joint?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yes, the Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Could you say something?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yeah, I worked for the Joint for -- since 1947 to -- in ’49, two years, in Linz, in Linz yeah, with -- spoke English already, some -- not as well, but pretty good.</span> <span id="s377">Good enough t-to be able to work for the Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: What did you do for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Just office, you know, working in the office.</span> <span id="s380">Nothing, no special -- clerical work, mostly.</span> <span id="s381">You see, it was the American -- I remember one of them, what was his name, Antel was the first one.</span> <span id="s382">He was in charge and he -- I don’t know, I heard some shady stories about him too, doing some business, you know.</span> <span id="s383">The next guy was Kaufman, came after Antel, he’s a very nice guy, Kaufman and his wife.</span> <span id="s384">We came very, very close.</span> <span id="s385">As a matter of fact, he was from San Diego, and later, when we came to America in the early 50’s, we met once in San Diego with this guy, yeah, he was -- he was a terrific guy.</span> <span id="s386">But the Joint was a great organization, it was really beautiful, you know?</span> <span id="s387">Would have been very, very hard if you wouldn’t have any help or, you know, support.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Did they approach you, or did you want to work for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Oh, you know, I do -- I -- frankly I do not re -- I think I probably went there.</span> <span id="s390">I -- I can’t exactly remember the circumstances, but I -- I would say I probably went there and tried to, you know, get a job and I got a job.</span> <span id="s391">We have a lady here right now, a good friend of ours, Lydia, she worked for the Joint also, in Linz.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: How many languages d -- and which ones did you speak, by the way [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Well, at that time I used to speak, of course, Hungarian, which I do speak fluently right now.</span> <span id="s394">Could say that was my mother tongue in -- Hungarian.</span> <span id="s395">And then Yugoslav, of course, Serbian.</span> <span id="s396">And German of course, I spoke as a kid.</span> <span id="s397">And then later I studied Russian in the [indecipherable] schools, you know, cause I knew eventually I might need it.</span> <span id="s398">And -- but I -- I forgot already Russian quite a bit.</span> <span id="s399">It’s easy -- you -- you have to keep up languages, it’s -- it’s -- it’s very easy to forget.</span> <span id="s400">Very easy to forget.</span> <span id="s401">And French, I used to speak French quite well, also, no practice, you know, in many, many years, you forget.</span> <span id="s402">It’s a beautiful language.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Okay, before we go on, it’s already time to switch the first --</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: [indecipherable] time.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: This is the end of tape one, side A, interview with Cornelius Loen and it’s -- we’re actually having a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: After, yeah -- it-it’s off?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Cornelius Loen.</span> <span id="s409">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Ah [indecipherable] here.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: So how did -- yeah, you -- so you were about to go to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s413">Now we are on, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Yeah, we are on.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s416">And -- yes, so waiting for the papers, was only a matter of time.</span> <span id="s417">As a matter of fact, Masha’s parents got the Canadian papers before we got ours.</span> <span id="s418">Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s419">They -- they got it in ’48, I believe, yeah, had to be ’48, and they went to Canada, cold country.</span> <span id="s420">As a matter of fact, I had to lend -- my father-in-law was an excellent tailor, and he made me a -- a gorgeous winter coat.</span> <span id="s421">I had to give him my winter coat because I figured in California you don’t need a winter coat, and he’s was -- I gave him my -- his creation back, which he appreciated, certainly.</span> <span id="s422">Toronto.</span> <span id="s423">And they did leave in ’48, and we of course, stayed another full year before we got the papers in ’49.</span> <span id="s424">That was in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: How did you live then, and how did you make your living, or how did you survive in that year -- during that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Oh, that -- there was no question, so we got food, you know, there’s food from, you know, through the Joint, and s -- there were never a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: So what was --</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Never a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: -- when -- when you came to America, what was it like to see your brother again?</span> <span id="s430">Your relative --</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Oh, you don’t want to hear the boat, the story on the boat and everything, not important.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Ah, tell me the story of the boat again, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Yeah, well it’s no big deal, I mean, we got this -- we boarded this ship, Royal Eltinge was the name, it was one of those Liberty ships, you know, in Bremen, right, Bremenhaven.</span> <span id="s434">And I don’t know what to tell you, I got seasick right away in the first few hours, in the channel.</span> <span id="s435">It was the -- one of the biggest storms.</span> <span id="s436">There’s always a storm there, but this was one of the biggest, supposedly.</span> <span id="s437">It was absolutely terrible.</span> <span id="s438">Those days, the boats, you know, they were not balanced as well as they are now, supposedly.</span> <span id="s439">But anyway, it was ter -- Masha too, oh.</span> <span id="s440">Couldn’t eat for at least one day.</span> <span id="s441">It was just terrible, terrible experience.</span> <span id="s442">And some people were eating and drinking.</span> <span id="s443">It’s amazing, you know, some people don’t get affected by it.</span> <span id="s444">And that -- on the boat, of course, I was the interpreter, I remember.</span> <span id="s445">You know, every so on I had to go on the microphone and tell the people about the situation, da da da da, prepare them for everything.</span> <span id="s446">And took about 12 to -- 12 days I believe, because we went to New Orleans through New York -- it’s a longer trip, and as far as seasickness, then it stopped and the sea was calm, no problem.</span> <span id="s447">Then we arrived in New Orleans, was August, and received by the Joint on the pier and then they took us for dinner.</span> <span id="s448">The first time in my life did I see white bread.</span> <span id="s449">You know, that so-called white bread, which we didn’t see in Europe, and it looked interesting.</span> <span id="s450">It -- it -- it -- it -- I thought it was a cake, first, see?</span> <span id="s451">Was hard to get used to it though.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: You didn’t like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s454">Well, I didn't realize that the only way that you can eat that is toasted.</span> <span id="s455">But a lot of people do eat it, you know.</span> <span id="s456">Then, let’s see, New Orleans, we must have spent one day, maybe, one and a half days.</span> <span id="s457">And then, by train of course, we drove to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s458">First time I saw, actually, black people.</span> <span id="s459">Still segregated.</span> <span id="s460">On the train, in the restaurants, which was amazing to us.</span> <span id="s461">But they told Masha -- Masha -- I remember Masha -- one of the girls in the Jewish committee that told Masha, don’t -- don’t -- don’t talk about it, don’t pay too much attention to this, you know, this -- this is just a facts -- facts of life.</span> <span id="s462">It was interesting, to us it was a very, very unusual experience, in ’49, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Well, how did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Well, it -- it was weird, it was strange, you see.</span> <span id="s465">We didn't see any arguments or fighting or anything like that, but it was still -- the restrooms, you know, colored, white, colored, white.</span> <span id="s466">Was sort of weird, especially after in the concentration camps, you know.</span> <span id="s467">So -- okay, so we arrived August -- end of August, I believe, I -- in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s468">My brother, my sister -- ex-sister-in-law, and her daughter, who was a young girl, waiting for us on the union -- Union Station, yeah, right.</span> <span id="s469">So we arrive, the [indecipherable] and we drove over to my mother’s house.</span> <span id="s470">My mother that time -- yeah, the moth -- the -- that time, yeah, my mother lived still with my brother in my brother’s house in Burbank.</span> <span id="s471">A real hot day, real warm day.</span> <span id="s472">You know, celebration, hi, kisses back and forth, hello.</span> <span id="s473">Haven’t seen my -- my brother since 1937, yeah.</span> <span id="s474">He had a -- some business going here.</span> <span id="s475">Masha must have mentioned it to you about the scooter business he had during the war, he didn't see -- during the war he had -- he was not a -- unfortunately he was a real intellectual, a very bright man, very intelligent guy, but business sense he did not have.</span> <span id="s476">It’s -- it’s interesting how some people, you know, they’re just born with a sense of business, you know, they can make anything out of nothing, see?</span> <span id="s477">He was a kind -- he was just too much of an intellectual, and he n -- he knew too much.</span> <span id="s478">Later on, of course, he became a management consultant and he was actually doing good jobs, you know, for many, many companies.</span> <span id="s479">But on his own, he could -- he would never succeed as a businessman.</span> <span id="s480">His -- his good friend, who he came with to America in 1938, he was just the opposite, you know?</span> <span id="s481">He came from a business oriented family, his father’s own -- anyway, he went into the clothing business and eventually made a lot of money in the clothing business [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Did your brother what -- what had happened?</span> <span id="s483">Was he in-informed?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: In the concentration -- you mean, in Europe?</span> <span id="s485">Somehow, not much.</span> <span id="s486">Later, you know, he found out.</span> <span id="s487">Lot of people didn’t really know.</span> <span id="s488">We didn't know, in -- lived in Europe and didn’t know too much i-in the beginning, you see?</span> <span id="s489">He didn’t, he didn’t.</span> <span id="s490">He heard about, of course, my brother being killed in -- in -- in -- and then whatever is in the papers here about the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s491">Radio, television, as much.</span> <span id="s492">So, then we stayed there, I think, in their house for a few days and then we eventually moved, my mom, my father and Masha and I moved to West Hollywood.</span> <span id="s493">West Hollywood, Clark Street, in 1949, yeah a few -- a month later, I think, or maybe two weeks later we moved.</span> <span id="s494">Oh, it was impossible situation to live, you know, six people in one house, seven people.</span> <span id="s495">And on top of it, my late brother, as I said before, he just died a few weeks ago, and was 84 years old, he was not the easiest guy to get along with.</span> <span id="s496">A very complicated man.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Did your mother and -- and Masha get along that well, or your --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Masha, Masha, yes.</span> <span id="s499">In the beginning it was a little bit hard, you see.</span> <span id="s500">They -- lot of -- unfortunately many times, you know, parents do not accept, oh poor little son, you know, they -- ridiculous, and it was tension, tension there in the beginning, much tension.</span> <span id="s501">Matter of fact, eventually -- I don’t remember how many weeks we stayed together, but eventually we had -- we moved.</span> <span id="s502">Not far from them, a matter of fact, few blocks from them, but we had to move to another apartment, Masha and I, because it was just constant, just tension.</span> <span id="s503">And even with my brother, Masha never really got along, all these years, was always -- but as I say, he was a difficult guy, he didn't get along with his wife either, and with his daughter, his own daughter hasn’t spoken to him for 15 years at least, maybe 20 years.</span> <span id="s504">Later she -- just last few years, two years ago I think she made peace.</span> <span id="s505">So she realized he’s getting, you know, older, older, older and then -- but it -- it was not easy.</span> <span id="s506">The beginning was not easy.</span> <span id="s507">But we had a good time, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: When you started looking for -- for -- for work, what -- did it help you that you spoke languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Well, ha -- yes and no, no -- you know, I -- first I says, gonna get a job, I went to the Roosevelt Hotel, I remember, on Hollywood Boulevard, trying to get a job, you know, I speak several languages, da da da, fill out an application and nothing happened eventually.</span> <span id="s510">Then the first job -- actually the first real job I got was in a motel.</span> <span id="s511">Nice, huh?</span> <span id="s512">Fa-Fascinating job in a motel on Sunset Boulevard, East Sunset Boulevard, that’s near Los Angeles, downtown.</span> <span id="s513">Night job.</span> <span id="s514">I can tell you, it was fascinating.</span> <span id="s515">I didn’t realize that time that it’s dangerous or not, hold-ups.</span> <span id="s516">But it was a job, I got it through a Jewish organization, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s517">A Jewish guy owned that motel.</span> <span id="s518">As it happens, the motel is still there.</span> <span id="s519">It’s ’99, I saw it the other day, I drive by it quite often.</span> <span id="s520">I don’t know who owns it.</span> <span id="s521">I’m sure not that Jewish guy because he was an old man, but it’s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Were you armed in that job?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: I -- no, armed, are you kidding?</span> <span id="s524">Not even a knife.</span> <span id="s525">Nah, it’s mostly guys came in with girls, you know, at night, to motels.</span> <span id="s526">And pay was very low, pay was very low.</span> <span id="s527">I didn't stay there too long, I believe maybe two -- two, three weeks, four weeks at tops.</span> <span id="s528">That same time Masha had a job downtown in a factory, she probably told you, yeah.</span> <span id="s529">Then after I left the motel -- trying to remember now, recollect here, what was my next job?</span> <span id="s530">Oh yeah, my brother had the neighbor in Burbank, he -- and this is a German guy, Erb, Max Erb, he had a downtown Los Angeles -- scientific instruments he used to sell, import from Germany, Zeiss, you know, and microscopes, and sell and rent to USC and UCLA, see?</span> <span id="s531">It was a big business, and I got a job there in the shipping department, I remember, in the shipping department.</span> <span id="s532">And I was there perhaps five, six months.</span> <span id="s533">Couldn’t get along, something happened, that was it, that was the end of that story.</span> <span id="s534">Then I joined a milk company here, Arden Farms as a salesman.</span> <span id="s535">As a salesman I was soliciting new accounts.</span> <span id="s536">You know, o-opening new accounts for the milk company.</span> <span id="s537">Tho -- time -- it’s still business, but tho -- those time -- those days, I mean, it was big business, this home delivery business.</span> <span id="s538">And it was a fairly good job, and that was a union job.</span> <span id="s539">That was the first time I joined the union, which was good, because I belonged to the union all my life.</span> <span id="s540">I worked there, it was an easy job, I met a few nice guys who helped me with opening accounts, you know, because they knew a lot of people on the street.</span> <span id="s541">That made it a lot easier, cause you get -- you worked on commission.</span> <span id="s542">Was -- was a -- basically was a salary, a basic salary, which was not too much, and then whenever you opened an account, of course, you got commission for the account.</span> <span id="s543">So -- so Masha and I then -- we lived, as I say, we moved from L.A., from my parents and we had this nice little apartment, which Masha fixed up very nicely.</span> <span id="s544">And we had a nice life.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Did you want children?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: We didn’t -- hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Did you want children?</span> <span id="s548">You personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: We didn’t -- no, that -- that -- we didn’t talk about -- we didn’t think about it too much yet, in the beginning, you know?</span> <span id="s550">We -- we had fr -- [indecipherable] friends, for instance, our first friends was a dentist who was recommended by my landlord to my mother, who lived down on Clark Street, in West Hollywood.</span> <span id="s551">And Bestley was his name, and we met them, and eventually we became very, very good friends.</span> <span id="s552">They became our first friends in America, American Jews.</span> <span id="s553">Bestley and his wife, and of course they had a family already, they have kids and they lived in Beverlywood, and oh, he had a big job with Masha’s teeth, you know, Masha had a big problem, you know, after the concentration camp, and -- but as I say, we became very good friends, we went to movies together and everything.</span> <span id="s554">And we [indecipherable] talked about is why don’t you start a family, why don’t you start a family?</span> <span id="s555">I says, ah, we got time, we got time for we get better situated and a bit more money.</span> <span id="s556">And then eventually we moved from West Hollywood to the valley.</span> <span id="s557">We always liked the valley somehow.</span> <span id="s558">We moved to the valley, to a very nice apartment on Deacon Street, where we had a crazy landlady who drove us nuts with keep the carpets clean, keep this clean, keep that clean, you know?</span> <span id="s559">So we couldn’t stand it, so we stayed there about two months, and we moved out -- same street.</span> <span id="s560">We moved to an apartment which this young couple owned, very nice young couple who also became our friends, eventually.</span> <span id="s561">And then I -- just about in 1954, I remember I changed jobs again, I joined this company.</span> <span id="s562">I -- it was a confectionary company, wholesale.</span> <span id="s563">They were making a famous Baker Boy confection roll, was a cinnamon roll, you know, but very -- very -- already established in Los Angeles area, and they needed some more salesman and I am -- introduced myself, da da da da.</span> <span id="s564">So I joined them, and I started working for them, selling this confection [indecipherable] to markets, big markets and all -- small markets, snack shops, stores, everything eventually.</span> <span id="s565">It was a good jo -- also a union job, of course.</span> <span id="s566">Five days, eight hours.</span> <span id="s567">Had a van -- their own van, of course, I used, you know.</span> <span id="s568">And, as I say, it was a good -- good steady job, which we needed that time.</span> <span id="s569">Masha still had her job, I don’t rec -- oh no, that time she had the [indecipherable] shop with a partner.</span> <span id="s570">So the income was fair, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Do you remember it as a difficult time for you to establish yourself all over again, or was it something that you didn't mind --</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: No, no, it was not -- it was not difficult really.</span> <span id="s573">I didn't have any problems, you know.</span> <span id="s574">Like at this job I got pretty easy and got into it very fast, smooth, no problems.</span> <span id="s575">Made friends easily [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: But your first friends were not survivors, they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Americans.</span> <span id="s578">Matter of fact, Masha pr-probably mentioned it to you that we didn’t know about the survivors.</span> <span id="s579">The only survivor we knew was the one from the ship who came with -- on the same boat.</span> <span id="s580">And -- but I don’t know why, I still don’t remember why he didn’t tell us that there’s a lot of survivors here from Masha’s hometown.</span> <span id="s581">But eventually, we somehow ran into them, see, and then we knew more and more of them.</span> <span id="s582">And a lot of them that all lived -- you see, we lived in West Hollywood, and most of the Jewish immigrants that time lived in a certain section in town Boyle Heights, which was eventually -- or re -- n -- yeah, that’s right, later became Spanish, Latino.</span> <span id="s583">But that time was strictly Jewish, and they all lived there.</span> <span id="s584">And we didn’t know, but through -- and this guy lived there also, this -- yeah, but he didn’t tell us about all these people.</span> <span id="s585">Why, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Was it important for you to talk about -- t-to ment -- did you talk about at all, about your war experience, or did you -- did you not, to people?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Well, it -- yes, yes and no, you see.</span> <span id="s588">Like, lot of these American people -- I remember the Jewish friends, the dentist, for instance, these people were -- th-that time, they were all Russian sympathizers.</span> <span id="s589">You see, we had arguments with them.</span> <span id="s590">We had arguments because we knew the Russians.</span> <span id="s591">We knew what they were, who they were.</span> <span id="s592">They didn’t.</span> <span id="s593">See, they didn’t s -- they saw it from another perf -- perspective, see?</span> <span id="s594">And this -- this was incredible.</span> <span id="s595">Later, they started realizing that we were right, but it took years.</span> <span id="s596">Remember when the Rosenbergs were killed, you know, they were all [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: And I meant to ask you how you felt about the McCarthy era, and the</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Well, I didn’t -- na -- no, I didn’t like -- I didn't like McCarthy at all, no, I didn’t like him, no, I didn't like him and then [indecipherable] and then Coen, remember?</span> <span id="s599">He’s a -- no, no.</span> <span id="s600">To me, I was strictly against that.</span> <span id="s601">Strictly, strictly against some days, dark days.</span> <span id="s602">This -- as I say -- and then, of course, I said I joined this company and I was with them from 1954 to 1978.</span> <span id="s603">Can you believe that?</span> <span id="s604">Yeah.</span> <span id="s605">Meanwhile, David was born, of course in 1958.</span> <span id="s606">See that -- and we moved again.</span> <span id="s607">We moved from one place to the next place.</span> <span id="s608">But also in the valley, we stayed in the valley since first time we moved, we stayed, and we stayed in the valley.</span> <span id="s609">San Fernando valley.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Tell me -- tell me more about David.</span> <span id="s611">Did you have any -- well, did you any particular sort of hopes, or did you want something that you thought, in terms of parenting, that you wanted to do or not want to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: With him?</span> <span id="s613">For him?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s616">Not really, not really.</span> <span id="s617">We didn’t have any -- any plans like some people have plans, you know, and th -- tries to do this and that.</span> <span id="s618">As far as going to school later, we see -- I don’t know why, just -- David was in sports very much, you know, he liked sports, so -- I remember, I used to be -- I think all the friends we had, all the friends we had had all sons, and I don’t remember ever any of their fathers going with their sons to -- to sporting events.</span> <span id="s619">Nat -- none.</span> <span id="s620">They were still -- I don’t know why -- I was -- I americize -- it was very, very much, you know, I became an American very fast.</span> <span id="s621">A lot of our friends were still in the European mind, you know?</span> <span id="s622">They never got accustomed to the American sports, really.</span> <span id="s623">That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s624">See, I -- I caught on pretty fast, you know, baseball, football.</span> <span id="s625">And even nowadays, it’s ’99 and I would say 90 percent of -- of -- of the friends who came from Europe, no idea about baseball, or football.</span> <span id="s626">Interesting.</span> <span id="s627">They never got into it.</span> <span id="s628">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: What -- what else did you like about -- about this country?</span> <span id="s630">And what did you not like?</span> <span id="s631">What are the things that you were critical about?</span> <span id="s632">But first the likes, what -- what else?</span> <span id="s633">Football, baseball, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Yeah, well sports, of course, of course [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s635">I -- I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s636">I li -- I just liked -- I liked America right away, I liked the -- the people, you know.</span> <span id="s637">I liked the -- the -- the -- the so-called liberty, you know, that you really can speak and not be afraid to speak.</span> <span id="s638">Nobody is watching over you, nobody is following you, you know, we were leaving the horrible period there, so that -- that makes also a big difference, you see?</span> <span id="s639">Course, most people who came to America, even before, they came from the terrible circumstances and mayb -- you know, also bad things [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s640">So it’s -- was very refreshing, you know?</span> <span id="s641">Really different --</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Some things you --</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: -- you could argue.</span> <span id="s644">Yeah, pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Some things you critiz -- you were sort of crit -- critical about?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: The white bread.</span> <span id="s647">No, really.</span> <span id="s648">Even food, you know, you get used to the certain things which you didn’t have in Europe.</span> <span id="s649">The hamburgers, and the -- eventually, a -- we liked it, we liked it, we never had any problems.</span> <span id="s650">We never had any problems.</span> <span id="s651">Never criticized too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Did yo --</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Pretty good life.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Did you always agree with the strong emphasis of a Holocaust work in your wife’s life, or did you have different --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Oh no, no, no, I agree with that hundred percent.</span> <span id="s656">No, had -- somebody had to do it.</span> <span id="s657">Cause if you don’t do it, if nobody does it, you know, it’ll be forgotten.</span> <span id="s658">There’s a lot of people like -- would like to forget it, see?</span> <span id="s659">And you have to constantly be on top of it, constantly.</span> <span id="s660">It’s ju-just something which is very, very important, so easy to forget, with this denial.</span> <span id="s661">This -- I -- I sto -- I still can’t -- I-I can’t conceive this, how some people -- people, how can they deny something like this?</span> <span id="s662">Is it -- is it really -- that really deny -- they really believe in it, or -- or are they just acting, is it part of acting?</span> <span id="s663">I remember this case when -- I remember, if you recall this Mermestein, they had a lawsuit against this American who -- you remember that case, yeah?</span> <span id="s664">Was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s665">How -- how this guy ever expected to win his case.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Say a little bit more about that though, for the listeners who may not remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Well, they -- an -- well, anyway, it was several years ago, this -- it was a guy, an intellectual man, you know, was not a nobody and he was not -- not a -- a -- right-winger or a skinhead.</span> <span id="s668">A man, a business man, and he denied the Holocaust, he said it’s all exaggerated, it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s669">And then one of our friends, Mermestein, who went through the concentration camps, he says, he [indecipherable] you dispute it, okay, let’s go to court.</span> <span id="s670">And there was a court case, went on for several weeks or months.</span> <span id="s671">50,000 dollars I think it was, you know [indecipherable] the money, of course.</span> <span id="s672">And the man lost, of course he lost the case, went to court and he lost it, point blank.</span> <span id="s673">But it was -- it was unbelievable t-to -- how this man ever expected to win.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Did you ever testify anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Me?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Testify, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: No, I didn't.</span> <span id="s680">I did not.</span> <span id="s681">I did not personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Did you ever go back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: -- to ger -- to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Yeah, we went back twice.</span> <span id="s686">I went back in 1967 to Novi Sad, to my hometown, with Masha, yeah.</span> <span id="s687">Well, 1967 there was still -- lot of the old friends were alive, and the relatives.</span> <span id="s688">That Uncle Steffie, remember I told you about, the Nazi th -- he was still alive, with his wife.</span> <span id="s689">Very poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: But what was it like s -- what was it like seeing him, though?</span> <span id="s691">I mean, here was the man who --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: N-Nothing.</span> <span id="s693">Nothing, nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s694">He wa -- you see, he ne -- I never took him too seriously, he was not dangerous.</span> <span id="s695">He was just like a -- a comedian to me, even then.</span> <span id="s696">Yeah, I know, I know, it sounds sad but true.</span> <span id="s697">You see, sometimes he --his wife was alt -- well, no, he had -- a-actually, there were some parts in the family who were much worse than he was, like my brother’s wife’s family.</span> <span id="s698">They were -- they were really bad.</span> <span id="s699">They were really -- they were involved in the Nazi regime much, much, much deeper.</span> <span id="s700">He was nothing, nobody took him seriously, this -- this Steffie, not even the -- the Germans or the authorities, nothing.</span> <span id="s701">But th-these people were dangerous, some of those people.</span> <span id="s702">Later, some of them came to America after the war, yeah.</span> <span id="s703">But anyway, in ’67, as I say, we were there, and lot of our friends were still alive.</span> <span id="s704">Dr. Fisher and I didn’t meet anybody from my -- my school days, but some of -- some of the other ones.</span> <span id="s705">I remember I stayed in this hotel -- Masha never mentioned it to you?</span> <span id="s706">On the Danube River, and Masha got bitten by mosquitoes and we asked the guy next day, I said -- the clerk, I said, why didn’t you put screens -- screens on the windows?</span> <span id="s707">He said, you’d ruin the view.</span> <span id="s708">She was absolutely destroyed there mosquitoes, none of them bit me.</span> <span id="s709">See, different blood.</span> <span id="s710">Yeah, it’s the blood, they can sense this, the mosquitoes in Novi Sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: I -- I -- I meant to ask you actually, did you ever like Austria as much as -- as your wife did, as Masha did?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: I what?</span> <span id="s713">Q: Did you like Austria ever as much as --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Oh Austria, oh yes.</span> <span id="s715">Oh, Austria’s beautiful.</span> <span id="s716">Well, I was in Austria before the war also, in Vienna, many times you see, and Salzburg.</span> <span id="s717">But, with her -- oh, we loved it.</span> <span id="s718">It’s -- it’s a beautiful country, beautiful country.</span> <span id="s719">Salzburg is great, of course.</span> <span id="s720">Linz, Linz is not as beautiful as Salzburg.</span> <span id="s721">And then we went to the Wolfgangsee, beautiful lakes, you know.</span> <span id="s722">That’s where this -- remember that [indecipherable] tragedy.</span> <span id="s723">Food -- food was good in Austria.</span> <span id="s724">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s725">Then, in --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s727">Let’s -- let’s stop for one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Yeah, yeah, let’s -- let’s talk [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Yeah, went into -- Masha in Salzburg we ha -- we went to see Jedermann in [indecipherable], tre -- a tremendous experience.</span> <span id="s731">And we saw of course, Mozart, Marriage of Figaro, which is also fantastic.</span> <span id="s732">The scenery incredible, unforgettable.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: And di -- and you didn't mind that much to -- to -- to be in the country of where a lot of things started?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: No, no, because the -- well, they chang -- they changed it, or they tried to change, you know, certain remarks, you know, certain people behaved a little bit weird.</span> <span id="s735">But all in all there was no trouble, there was no problem.</span> <span id="s736">There was no problem.</span> <span id="s737">You didn’t feel any animosity, you know.</span> <span id="s738">You f -- you felt like at home in Salzburg, we had a good time.</span> <span id="s739">Linz, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Did you ever feel anti-Semitism at that time in -- in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: No.</span> <span id="s742">Not really, no.</span> <span id="s743">Reading it, you know, in papers, you know, about sort of -- but you didn’t feel it.</span> <span id="s744">No-Nothing was like, you know, Europe, after Europe anything was a -- was so bad, you know, that anything, even rem -- it was okay, it was okay.</span> <span id="s745">There was some, of course, you know.</span> <span id="s746">When I had these -- when the Rosenberg trials, of course, you hear some comments.</span> <span id="s747">But all in all, you didn’t feel nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Bef-Before we go back, in a sense, to Los Angeles, and also I want to ask you about Israel, there was a little anecdote in New Orleans that I forgot to ask Masha about, but maybe you can tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Oh with the -- the thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: -- oh, oh yeah, we arrived, and yeah, she saw this menu in one of the restaurants and she said -- she saw this in the writing on the menu, hot dogs.</span> <span id="s752">So she says, what kind of a country is this where they serve hot dogs?</span> <span id="s753">Was really funny.</span> <span id="s754">Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: How -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: But later she liked hot dogs.</span> <span id="s757">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: O-Okay.</span> <span id="s759">Did you ever go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s761">I was there, we see, once, Masha was there twice.</span> <span id="s762">And the first time we went in ’79, also a very interesting experience because Masha had -- she knew, see, that she had relatives, did she di -- tell you the story?</span> <span id="s763">She must have told --</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Yeah, that’s -- but still, you can [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Well, of course, all right.</span> <span id="s766">Well, she knew about her -- that she has some relatives in Israel, but she had no idea where they live and so forth.</span> <span id="s767">And we -- as we arrived in -- we went to [indecipherable] of course, Tel Aviv, and we stopped on one corner, and we asked the cab driver, this -- these people live here and here?</span> <span id="s768">He says [indecipherable] live across the street.</span> <span id="s769">Across the street, yeah.</span> <span id="s770">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s771">So it was actually Masha’s cousins, first cousins.</span> <span id="s772">Tremendous reception, oh, it was incredible.</span> <span id="s773">She never seen them, you know, never -- never seen them in her life, never corresponding with them.</span> <span id="s774">She just knew that her -- one of her aunts went to Israel before the war.</span> <span id="s775">There was actually two of them went to Israel before the war, two sisters, and one of them was a real bad character, yeah.</span> <span id="s776">One of those things, and Masha never liked her.</span> <span id="s777">She was there, and we met her too, of course, but the other one was a much nicer girl.</span> <span id="s778">And then she had two -- two -- two daughters, and the father -- from the sister -- from the cousin, had a big factory.</span> <span id="s779">He made appliances.</span> <span id="s780">We have one here, it’s an automatic tea maker.</span> <span id="s781">Terrific thing.</span> <span id="s782">In two seconds you get hot tea.</span> <span id="s783">He died also.</span> <span id="s784">So we had a very good time there, very good time.</span> <span id="s785">We stayed about two weeks in Israel with some friends from America, we came together.</span> <span id="s786">They had a ball, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: What was the situation in the country then?</span> <span id="s788">That was in ’67?</span> <span id="s789">This was --</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: No, no that was in ’79.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Oh, ’79.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: ’79 was okay.</span> <span id="s793">70 -- six -- ’67 was bad, that was during the war time.</span> <span id="s794">No, the ’79 was okay.</span> <span id="s795">’79 was very good.</span> <span id="s796">Peaceful, you know, normal.</span> <span id="s797">Was good.</span> <span id="s798">We stayed in the Hilton as I recall and saw the relatives, of course, every day.</span> <span id="s799">And they came to America later, several times, yeah.</span> <span id="s800">He had the -- the cousin’s husband had a -- a Fiat repair shop, Fiat di -- did -- I think repair, and dealership maybe, too.</span> <span id="s801">Just retired recently.</span> <span id="s802">That was ’79, of course.</span> <span id="s803">And then from se -- from -- from Israel we went to Greece, we took the Mediterranean cruise, Masha probably told you.</span> <span id="s804">Yeah, Mediterranean cruise to Istanbul.</span> <span id="s805">And then we saw -- saw the -- all the Turkish cities with all the Roman relics.</span> <span id="s806">Kusadasi, that’s near Istanbul, it’s beautiful.</span> <span id="s807">Istanbul was striking as you arrive.</span> <span id="s808">When you arrived in Istanbul from the boat, you know the -- the -- the -- the -- incredibly beautiful, but as you arrived on the pier and you landed, dirty.</span> <span id="s809">Dirty, unbelievably filthy, yeah.</span> <span id="s810">Very disappointing, but that was Istanbul.</span> <span id="s811">And then they had a great bazaar there, and they tried to sell you, of course, everything and anything.</span> <span id="s812">Everything is a bargain, everything is free.</span> <span id="s813">The most beautiful thing was, of course, the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: I think we better stop now, I have to change the tape.</span> <span id="s815">This is the end of tape one, side B, interview with Cornelius Loen.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">End of Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Cornelius Loen.</span> <span id="s819">This is tape number two, side A, and I wanted to ask you about the change of your name, which occurred when, and why?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s821">Change, okay, the original last name was Lowenberg in Europe, and when my brother came to the States in 1938, he changed it from Lowenberg to Loen, thinking that Lowenberg is a little bit too complicated, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s822">And as it turned out, Loen turned out to be more complicated, because nine out of 10 times, it’s pronounced Leon.</span> <span id="s823">And imagine the complications, my father’s first name was Leon, so they called him Leon Leon.</span> <span id="s824">It’s not a joke, it’s a fact.</span> <span id="s825">Terrible.</span> <span id="s826">Could never change it back.</span> <span id="s827">Once in awhile somebody will hit it right, Loen.</span> <span id="s828">But it was done and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Okay, let’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: No, th-the -- there is a lot of Lowenbergs in -- in America.</span> <span id="s831">Can look in the phone book, you know?</span> <span id="s832">Maybe they changed it from Leon to Lowenberg.</span> <span id="s833">I kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Okay, let’s talk about your son David a little bit.</span> <span id="s835">When did you -- when did you start talking to him about your war experience in [indecipherable] or when did he start to ask?</span> <span id="s836">How did it happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Well, I imagine when he was maybe seven, eight, nine, 10, you know, Masha -- Masha -- Masha kept it real -- sort of a secret for a long time.</span> <span id="s838">I think she didn't even tell him til he was maybe 15.</span> <span id="s839">14 - 15 - 16, you know, to introduce him.</span> <span id="s840">I was telling him more or less about my experiences, which -- you know, an American kid, I mean, they -- it-it’s hard to him to -- to -- to -- to ac -- to ac -- understand this whole war situation in Europe.</span> <span id="s841">S -- s -- a lot of adults couldn’t understand it, is -- you tried -- the kid, you know, was born in -- in America in a different world.</span> <span id="s842">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s843">Today, of course, he understands a lot more, and he appreciates all the -- the movies, you know, the Holocaust movies and Holocaust stories, which he’s seen a lot of them.</span> <span id="s844">And he learned more about -- about those -- th-the situation in Europe from these movies than he probably heard from us, and this is the story in a lot of cases, lot of parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: What -- what do you think about some of -- have you seen some of the movies, and how -- how do -- how do you feel about the -- sort of the presentation of -- of the Holocaust in -- in pop culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Sh -- it -- I think it’s very good.</span> <span id="s847">It’s very good.</span> <span id="s848">I’ve seen it and the movies are all excellent, and I’m trying to remember, like I said, one of the movies, we just talked about it, my son the other day, he liked it, with this Hungarian grandfather [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Well when was -- when was Schindler’s List?</span> <span id="s850">That was probably the most --</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Oh, Schindler’s List was excep -- Schindler’s List was some six, seven years ago already, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: There was one in -- in 1978 which was sort of the first large success, and that was called, Holocaust.</span> <span id="s853">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s855">Oh, there was lot of them, there was a lot of -- I be -- the -- well, the -- talk about Schindler’s List, the other day, I understand --</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Oh, there’s another called, The Music Box --</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: That’s the one I’m talking about --</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: -- about a Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: -- that’s the one that was Hungarian, yeah, exactly, with the grandfather who was a -- a Nazi, see, and it turns out it was an excellent movie with an excellent actor.</span> <span id="s860">Talking about Schindler’s List, I understand that Schindler’s wife is suing now, because she -- yeah, she claims that Schindler was not a womanizer.</span> <span id="s861">Interesting, isn’t that something?</span> <span id="s862">After all these years.</span> <span id="s863">And, I don’t know, ridiculous.</span> <span id="s864">I don’t know what she’s going to get out of it, or not, but that --</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Which events in -- in America were sort of really important to you, had an impact on your political, social, cultural whatever, sort of one or two examples of -- of things that were really important for -- in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Oh, well you know the Kennedy assassiation, Kennedy assassiation was a terrible thing which affected --</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Assassination.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: -- yeah, which affected all of us.</span> <span id="s869">Who knows what would have happened, you know, if he lived.</span> <span id="s870">And then of course his brother’s assassination.</span> <span id="s871">And even nowadays we are not certain really -- I don’t know if you are certain, or -- who killed him.</span> <span id="s872">Seems like it was a more -- more than one person.</span> <span id="s873">But this is -- this is forgotten, this is gonna be -- this is just part of history.</span> <span id="s874">And as far as, for instance, Roosevelt, Roosevelt to me -- see, I -- I didn’t know, I never realized it, being in Europe, and -- during the war, to me, you know, Roosevelt was a -- a -- a -- as far as a -- a great president, you know, and being an anti-Semite or not, we did not know.</span> <span id="s875">Later, when we came to America, Masha had a discussion with a lady who told him -- told Masha that Hoover -- see, we thought that Hoover, yeah, Hoover, Republican, da da da [indecipherable] the Democrat, he says Hoover was much more for the Jews than Roosevelt -- Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s876">And later we found out it was a fact that -- course Roosevelt was under a lot of pressure from the Congress, you know the Senate, and he couldn’t do himsel -- alone, but he could have done more, a lot more than he did.</span> <span id="s877">Remember when they send the boat back?</span> <span id="s878">Was a horrible thing.</span> <span id="s879">We didn’t know about it, we found that out after the war, of course, about the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: With regard to your faith, or -- are you a religious man?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: No, no, that’s one thing, never, n -- I’m -- you know, certain traditions I keep because Masha -- Masha is not traditi -- she is not religious either, really.</span> <span id="s882">But, like every year, on Pesach, we go to this family [indecipherable] tradition, but to temple.</span> <span id="s883">Only go to temple when I go to a Bar Mitzvah, somebody’s Bar Mitzvah, but I never been -- the only one who was actually religious in my family was my grandfather.</span> <span id="s884">He was religious, I remember.</span> <span id="s885">And his daughter, my father’s sister was singing in the temple.</span> <span id="s886">She had a great voice, she had a great voice, and she was singing in the temple.</span> <span id="s887">But myself, never.</span> <span id="s888">My brother was never religious, my son, absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Let’s -- let’s talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: No, you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s895">I don’t know if really being religious helps one way or another.</span> <span id="s896">I don’t know, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Do you consider yourself a conservative man, or -- politically speaking, where -- where do you -- which side are you on?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Well, I’m -- I was always voting democratic and I was [indecipherable] I mean, I’m quite liberal.</span> <span id="s899">I’m quite liberal, you know.</span> <span id="s900">I always was.</span> <span id="s901">Father was also liberal, I remember.</span> <span id="s902">Mother didn’t care too much about politics.</span> <span id="s903">Ma -- my --</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Let’s talk -- let’s talk about your mother.</span> <span id="s905">You d -- you did say that -- oh, and Masha told me also that she was honored as a Righteous Christian --</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: -- here.</span> <span id="s908">Tell us a little bit more about that, whe-when it happened here in -- in Los Angeles?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Well, it happened, there was a celebration in -- I think it was the Hilton hotel.</span> <span id="s910">Don’t ask me the year, it was a long, long time ago, I remember.</span> <span id="s911">And it was a great evening.</span> <span id="s912">Master of Ceremonies was George Putnam.</span> <span id="s913">And they honored a lot of people from different countries and one of them was my mother, which was a -- that was a great experience, of course, a beautiful thing.</span> <span id="s914">And what she did -- what she did was great, because you have to remember, i-it sounds easy now, but when she did it, it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s915">Lot of people in Europe who were trying to hide Jews, some way, in one way or another, were killed, cause there was a lot of informants.</span> <span id="s916">See, like this -- this -- I told you the -- the -- the manager of that apartment house, he knew exactly what the mother is doing, and he could have -- one word he says, boom, she’s gone.</span> <span id="s917">The -- the leader of the Hungarian Arrow Cross party, Szálasi, lived across the street from her apartment house, for instance.</span> <span id="s918">So she was in constant danger, but she did it because she had to do it.</span> <span id="s919">She had a heart, a conscience, and she liked those people.</span> <span id="s920">She knew a lot of those people, you know, she saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Did you ever meet anybody she saved?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Well, one I knew -- actually, no, I wa -- only one couple I knew before, from before, you know.</span> <span id="s923">He was the landlord.</span> <span id="s924">He owned the apartment house where we lived.</span> <span id="s925">That’s the only couple, the other ones I did not -- no, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s926">After the war, I d -- I don’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s927">It’s a good question.</span> <span id="s928">I should have asked my mother what happened to some of those people.</span> <span id="s929">I don’t know if she ever met them after the war.</span> <span id="s930">It’s quite a few families, quite a few families.</span> <span id="s931">It was a long time.</span> <span id="s932">They were in for -- well, you see, the -- the -- in -- in Budapest, actually, the -- th-the most dangerous situation was in the last six months, eight months of the war, yeah.</span> <span id="s933">In Budapest was -- life was quite -- fairly normal til then, but then it started, you know?</span> <span id="s934">Eichmann came in and he says, final solution, this is it, and then they started, you know, that -- taking most people to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s935">That’s when the Swedish guy, you remember, Wallenberg, tried to save -- saved quite a few people also, and then disappeared in Russia, which is --</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: In the videotaped interview, you spoke about that you are a member of a -- a se -- a Serbian Jewish [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Society, yeah, we had a --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Tell us -- tell us a little bit more --</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: -- how did it come a-and -- yeah, I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yeah, this is quite interesting, yeah.</span> <span id="s942">One day, we met, in this house here, we met with some Yugoslav people from Belgrade.</span> <span id="s943">A Serbian guy with a Jewish wife, and came up with the idea to organize a -- a Jewish Serbian society, because you know, the ger -- serban -- Serbs suffered al-also under the war a lot, a lot, of course.</span> <span id="s944">And we -- it was a group of people about, I would say, maybe 16 people here, we met, and we formed a society.</span> <span id="s945">They had another Jewish Serbian society back east, I understand, so -- but we -- we are not in connection with them.</span> <span id="s946">See, we’re a separate unit.</span> <span id="s947">And then we had meetings every so often here and Pacific Palisades with the people.</span> <span id="s948">It lasted for quite some time, but then the political situation in Europe started with this Yugoslavia, with -- especially now [indecipherable] with Kosovo and everything, but long before that already, it’s got pretty bad and we figured we better stop.</span> <span id="s949">And then we stopped the meetings and somehow the whole organization fell apart and we lost contact completely with them in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s950">They were from Belgrade.</span> <span id="s951">Very nice people.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: What --</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: He was in politics, the husband.</span> <span id="s954">He was a politician, you know, f-forgot his name, and she was quite the intelligent woman also.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: What -- what is your perspective on this -- on this whole political development?</span> <span id="s956">Do you think that the Serbs have gotten a bad rap, in a sense, or what -- how do you feel about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: I -- I -- I do think so, I do think so, you see, but it’s very hard to prove one way or another.</span> <span id="s958">You see, Kosovo -- I don’t know if you recall from history, the historical thing, in the -- 1480, I believe, the Turks massacred, you know, the Serbs in Kosovo, and they won the war, and they were sitting then on yugosla -- on Serbia for 500 years.</span> <span id="s959">Turks, see?</span> <span id="s960">And they were Muslims, of course.</span> <span id="s961">Frankly, I do not recall how the Albanians came into Kosovo.</span> <span id="s962">I -- before this whole thing started, if you will ask me, I -- I wouldn’t have known if -- if there’s Albanians in Kosovo [indecipherable] Serbia.</span> <span id="s963">So is very hard to say, but why -- why Clinton picked on Kosovo, and not on -- on -- on Rwanda, and many other places in the world, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s964">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s965">But it’s all over.</span> <span id="s966">It’s all over.</span> <span id="s967">And Milosevic is still there.</span> <span id="s968">What’s going to happen to Milosevic I don’t know.</span> <span id="s969">He doesn’t know either, I think.</span> <span id="s970">But he is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: H-How do you feel about American involvement in all of these different things that pop up?</span> <span id="s972">Do you approve, basically, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Sometimes yes, sometimes no, but as I said, you see, it’s all political.</span> <span id="s974">Look at -- look at what happened with -- with Saddam Hussein.</span> <span id="s975">Nothing, right?</span> <span id="s976">He’s still there.</span> <span id="s977">What did we accomplish?</span> <span id="s978">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s979">So it’s hard to say, you know, it looks good, it looks good for awhile and then everything cools off, and everything goes back to normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: And when you said the -- at one point, when the political development in Yugoslavia stopped, you thought in the alliance, we better stop, what -- what was the -- elaborate a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Well, because -- you mean, with our Jewish society?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Because we figured it’s not a very good idea, you know, we were -- well, we’re not afraid really, but we feel we better lay off, let it -- let it cool off a little bit before we start again something.</span> <span id="s984">It’s -- it’s not -- it was not a good idea.</span> <span id="s985">It was a good idea originally, see, but then it would have been hard to keep up with the members.</span> <span id="s986">Some of them really got scared, I think.</span> <span id="s987">So how can you sympathize?</span> <span id="s988">How can you sympathize with the Serbs?</span> <span id="s989">See, and all the -- th-the newspapers and the media was against them, the -- the -- the k -- the -- the -- the killers, you know, genocide here and there.</span> <span id="s990">I mean, how can you have a society and sympathize with them?</span> <span id="s991">So we just figured it’s -- it’s better -- Lydia, one of our good friends, you know, was very much for the society.</span> <span id="s992">She was reading these articles, says Cornell, it’s impossible.</span> <span id="s993">Says, come on, how can we have this society?</span> <span id="s994">Doesn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s995">And now you know what’s going to happen in Kosovo?</span> <span id="s996">The [indecipherable] gonna start killing the Serbs.</span> <span id="s997">It never stops.</span> <span id="s998">Never stops in the small countries, you know?</span> <span id="s999">Look what the Croatians -- look what the Croatians did to the Serbs several years ago, was a tremendous massacre, Clinton didn’t lift a finger.</span> <span id="s1000">It was obvious what’s happening.</span> <span id="s1001">So everything is -- everything is, you know, political and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: When you think about your identity now, who -- who are you?</span> <span id="s1003">What di -- what -- how do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: An American, oh of course, after, you know, after all these years, you -- you can’t -- you know, when you lived there, you were a Yugoslav, right?</span> <span id="s1005">And you -- you left Yugoslavia, and was the ca -- labor camp.</span> <span id="s1006">I mean, you came to America, you became an American.</span> <span id="s1007">I mean it -- this is so natural.</span> <span id="s1008">I don’t think -- I really don’t think anybody, after 40 - 50 years can possibly have allegiance and feel anything for your old country.</span> <span id="s1009">It’s impossible.</span> <span id="s1010">Oh, they play -- let’s say Yugoslavia plays soccer against Hungary, you would root for Yugoslavia, you know, or against Germany.</span> <span id="s1011">That’s about it.</span> <span id="s1012">But if Yugoslavia will play U.S., you’ll probably root for U.S..</span> <span id="s1013">You become an American.</span> <span id="s1014">Don’t you think?</span> <span id="s1015">Don’t you agree that most -- most cases --</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1017">I think after so lo -- after so many years --</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1019">And then, of course, don’t forget you have children who are born here, who are definitely hundred percent Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: What -- what is important in your life right now?</span> <span id="s1021">What do you -- what do you take joy in, or what is really --</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Well, being 77 years old, you know, I -- I enjoy life, and I just hope that I am -- be lucky enough not to develop any crazy diseases, you know, like -- a la -- as I say, cataract in my right eye, no big deal, no big deal.</span> <span id="s1023">But as long as you can stay healthy and be happy with your family, you’re okay.</span> <span id="s1024">No -- no ma -- no major troubles, no major troubles.</span> <span id="s1025">That -- that’s -- that’s it, you see, though, Masha too, you see, she is -- she has little problems here and there, but no -- no -- nothing really major.</span> <span id="s1026">But you have friends, you hear right and left, you know, this and this, and this one cancer and this one died, and is dying [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1027">You know, you get older, and I mean, it’s different.</span> <span id="s1028">It’s not like you were 17 years old, you don’t think about things like that.</span> <span id="s1029">You don’t think about dying and disease, and -- nothing.</span> <span id="s1030">That’s old age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Do you think you were able then, to rebuild sort of a rewarding life, here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Yes, of course, of course.</span> <span id="s1033">My -- yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: No, just keep -- continue.</span> <span id="s1035">I just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: I would [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: -- just want to say look -- look around a little bit in your -- in your -- in your home, and describe a little bit what -- what you see, and what it -- what it means to me -- what it means to you, and also what earthquakes have done to it at one point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Yeah [indecipherable] don’t -- don’t mention an earthquake, th-that was -- that was the most horrible experience, devastating.</span> <span id="s1039">Although I -- you know, we -- I was reading once in a paper that -- that -- that hurricanes are much worse.</span> <span id="s1040">It’s possible.</span> <span id="s1041">Well, of course, it lasts much longer and it does more damage.</span> <span id="s1042">But, of course, it depends where you live, like even in Los Angeles, you know, the big earthquake we had in ’72 -- no, ’72 was the first one, when was this big one?</span> <span id="s1043">I’m trying to remember now, this was in the -- when was the last big one?</span> <span id="s1044">See how I forget?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: It was not long ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: No, no, no, in the 90’s [indecipherable] well, anyway, it was -- it was bad here, pretty bad in my house.</span> <span id="s1047">Lot of -- lot of damage.</span> <span id="s1048">Some places were worse, much, much worse, you know.</span> <span id="s1049">Down -- down the street, a few blocks from here it was much worse.</span> <span id="s1050">So we are also relatively lucky, and we were lucky, too, that I had the insurance, earthquake insurance, which a lot of people didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1051">I had some, and -- which saved us quite a bit, becau -- headaches, money mostly, because a lot of damage in the house itself.</span> <span id="s1052">The -- there was one cabinet, I told you, it’s amazing, phenomenal, one cabinet, there’s a lot of [indecipherable] pieces from Spain, and this cabinet stayed sta -- stood still, sa -- didn’t move.</span> <span id="s1053">A lot of things -- the rest of the things, lot of breakage, lot of damage.</span> <span id="s1054">Lot of damage.</span> <span id="s1055">But we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Describe the [indecipherable] yeah, de-describe your home a little bit.</span> <span id="s1057">Wer -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: We have one -- we still have a lot of paintings here from Europe, brings old memories.</span> <span id="s1059">Nice paintings from -- over there from my hometown as a matter of fact, don’t see it here, it’s upstairs.</span> <span id="s1060">Snow -- winter scenes that you don’t see here, snow.</span> <span id="s1061">And then here’s quite a few paintings from -- I got it from my father, Bermrita famous hu -- Hungarian painter, and then [indecipherable] was a Hungarian painter also, still life paintings.</span> <span id="s1062">That’s all from Europe, the-these things were not damaged, fortunately.</span> <span id="s1063">We had some Dresden figurines, which of course went to pieces.</span> <span id="s1064">Yeah, broken.</span> <span id="s1065">Meissen, had a few Meissen pieces also.</span> <span id="s1066">Can’t -- irreplaceable, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1067">Had a beautiful lamp here from Portugal, bird, did not break, luckily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: You lost things in your life quite -- quite a few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: I mean, also mater -- also material things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Yes, yes, ye --</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: But you always -- you always pulled through somehow.</span> <span id="s1073">Talk -- talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Yeah, well, material things, of course, we had the -- going back to Europe, my father, we had two cars.</span> <span id="s1075">First we had a 1922 Fiat Torino.</span> <span id="s1076">19 - twe -- I mean, I’d like to have that car now.</span> <span id="s1077">That would be worth a few dollars, I imagine.</span> <span id="s1078">This car was confiscated by the Hungarian army, and it just disappeared during the war.</span> <span id="s1079">We never had it -- I remember my uncle used to drive that car, he was an insurance broker from -- in my father’s insurance company.</span> <span id="s1080">He used to drive to the country on those lousy European roads, you know.</span> <span id="s1081">And if I tell you that that car had ar-around 200,000 miles when it was stolen.</span> <span id="s1082">You know, it’s 200,000 miles, it’s a pr -- incredible.</span> <span id="s1083">Well, it had a few repair jobs, I remember, but still it was in good shape, still driving.</span> <span id="s1084">Torino, Fiat Torino.</span> <span id="s1085">And then later, Father bought a -- a 1938 Chevy for 800 dollars, brand new.</span> <span id="s1086">Well, 800 dollars in 1938 was 800 dollars.</span> <span id="s1087">So -- comparatively speaking, but -- and that car was also confiscated during the war, and disappeared, which was unfortunate.</span> <span id="s1088">Then later, of course, the -- I’d -- I don’t think I mentioned it here about the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: You did mention the lost luggage --</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: -- about the luggage --</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: -- about the luggage, did I mention it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Not on -- did I here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Yes, you did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Oh, I thought to you only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: -- but you could still --</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: So you lost all of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1101">And then, of course, we had a beautiful house in Novi Sad, that beautiful house which we always lo -- al-also lost.</span> <span id="s1102">And then we got some compensation for it after the war, a ridiculous amount, I hate to mention it, it was just nothing.</span> <span id="s1103">But a beautiful big home, and what -- we had about 10 rooms, and a big backyard, statues, we had two statues made by a quite famous master there in -- in -- in Yugoslavia, who incidentally committed suicide in Israel, his name was Coura.</span> <span id="s1104">It was a -- quite a -- quite a -- it was not Mestrovic, but he was great, well known.</span> <span id="s1105">And [indecipherable] and of course it was during the Communist, you know, it was confiscated and a lot of families lived in that house.</span> <span id="s1106">And somehow we got some money out of it, I don’t know how and who, the Yugoslav government [indecipherable] paid some compensation.</span> <span id="s1107">And ma -- ma -- my mom, late mother, she got a check and then she gave both sons something, and -- you know.</span> <span id="s1108">What else was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: And you lost your luggage, but then later on th -- you lost things again, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1111">Well, but the luggage, that -- that -- that was -- that was a big loss, because that -- very valuable things, you know, and the -- nothing for it, nothing for it.</span> <span id="s1112">Lo -- lo -- later we lost a little money in investments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Did you ever have any --</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: See, some people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: -- did you ever get any compensation from -- from -- for -- for the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: No, no, I didn’t, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1117">Only Masha.</span> <span id="s1118">I didn’t get any fortu -- unfortunately, as I say, I went to one lawyer once, and -- the Lowenberg lawyer I mentioned to you and he told me that there’s nothing he can do with -- with my case because I was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: You did mention -- yeah, I’m sorry to interrupt you, but you only said that to me privately in the car, maybe you should say that as an episode [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Oh, the -- the Lowenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Oh, oh, the [indecipherable] the story, yeah, yeah, was interesting.</span> <span id="s1123">I went to this German lawyer, name was Lowenberg and he looked exactly like my father.</span> <span id="s1124">I told my wife to take a look.</span> <span id="s1125">I mean, this is -- this is ma -- like my father’s brother.</span> <span id="s1126">And then I asked the man where he was born, and he said he’s -- he’s from Vestva and that’s a part of Germany, and as it happens, my father’s grandfather came from Vestva, so he could have been a relative.</span> <span id="s1127">But he was not a nice guy, he was not a nice lawyer.</span> <span id="s1128">Very unfriendly, very uncooperative, and as I say, he was very negative.</span> <span id="s1129">So I said to my wife, you know, wasting time here, nothing we can do.</span> <span id="s1130">But there was another lawyer also who told me that there’s nothing he can do with Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1131">Nothing he can do with Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1132">And now lately, there were stories that if you were in a Hungarian camp, a Hungarian labor camp, that you are eligible for certain compensation from the Hungarian government.</span> <span id="s1133">So I wrote a letter, I wrote a letter and no answer yet.</span> <span id="s1134">But somebody told me -- somebody told me, a Hungarian woman, she says, all you can expect from the Hungarians, if you -- you do get something, being in the labor camp, some money, but you’re not going to get the money, the money is going to stay in Hungary, and you have to go to Hungary and spend the money there.</span> <span id="s1135">Nice, huh?</span> <span id="s1136">And, again, it’s only a nominal fee, she says, nothing, nothing to get excited about.</span> <span id="s1137">Well, that is her opinion, but I don’t know, I’m still expecting an answer from a -- I think Chicago is the lawyer.</span> <span id="s1138">[indecipherable] even happens if -- well, sure I should get some compensation, being in a camp.</span> <span id="s1139">It was a labor camp, it was a slave labor camp, you know?</span> <span id="s1140">I-I didn't go there voluntarily, best years of my life.</span> <span id="s1141">Spent there, how many times [indecipherable] about two years.</span> <span id="s1142">I have pictures also, I have photos from the camp, which is unusual, a lot of people don’t, of course, you know, yeah, but I was in the camp there with the commander, with the sergeant and the whole thing, the whole group of people.</span> <span id="s1143">So [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: So, I’m kind of out of questions at this point.</span> <span id="s1145">Is there anything that you would like to -- to add, or say or something I didn’t ask, or that you really want to -- to add to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: No, what can I say?</span> <span id="s1147">As I say, I’m married to a great wife, who is the greatest coo-cook in the world.</span> <span id="s1148">Very beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1149">Didn’t change too much.</span> <span id="s1150">I told you in the beginning she was the most beautiful girl, she still is.</span> <span id="s1151">She’s very nice to me, and she -- we have a beautiful son who presently lives in Las Vegas and calls every day.</span> <span id="s1152">Very -- very devoted, very devoted son, very, very nice kid.</span> <span id="s1153">Very unusual.</span> <span id="s1154">You hear stories, you know, from people where their children are just a -- forgot their parents, and bad relationships, and to have a son like him is -- is -- it’s a -- it’s a jewel, a present, really.</span> <span id="s1155">But the way we brought him up I think is a lot to do with it.</span> <span id="s1156">The bringing up, you know?</span> <span id="s1157">Always close to him, always nice to him and that’s why he’s nice to us.</span> <span id="s1158">He really likes us, you know?</span> <span id="s1159">Comes twice a year, three times a year from Vegas on vacation.</span> <span id="s1160">He’s coming in a few weeks before Masha’s birthday, already happy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: I have one more question after all.</span> <span id="s1162">Did it make a difference any way or another that you were married to a survivor, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Oh no, no, I’m happy.</span> <span id="s1164">No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1165">I was a survivor too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: No, I mean, was it -- was it -- was it even a help?</span> <span id="s1167">Was it important in some ways even?</span> <span id="s1168">I mean, I didn’t mean to be negative about it, just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.</span> <span id="s1170">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1171">I usu -- we just met, you know, and I just happened to meet this beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1172">[indecipherable] really, survivor or no survivor, if she was no survivor, she’s still a beautiful girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: On that positive note, this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Cornelius Loen, and this is the end of tape two, side -- side A.</span></p>
