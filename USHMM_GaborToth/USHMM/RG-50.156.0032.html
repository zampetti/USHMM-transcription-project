<p><span id="s45">Q: What events were you aware of from the mid-1930s through 1941?</span> <span id="s46">Local, national, international…</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Well from 1939 ‘til 1941 I was in the Lodz ghetto.</span> <span id="s48">In 1944 I went to Auschwitz and a number of other camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: What they’d like to know is, were you aware of news of local, national, international about what was happening in the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: We were aware of news by reading the local paper -- and we went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s51">I know what happened within the ghetto -- when they put in barbed wire, electric wire, around the ghetto, and what we didn’t have to eat, and lots of people died from starvation.</span> <span id="s52">Every Jewish holiday, there was transportation what the Germans sent out people to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s53">I was living across the street from a hospital.</span> <span id="s54">In 1940 and ’41, the Germans went to this particular hospital -- I saw it myself.</span> <span id="s55">They threw out children on the trucks from the window.</span> <span id="s56">And then, it went by each few weeks, every few months -- I know it in a different language -- the first that went out, they picked intelligent people -- doctors, lawyers.</span> <span id="s57">Then they went out the older, elder people -- what they feel they are not able to work.</span> <span id="s58">They have some factories in the ghetto, where they were working in the factories.</span> <span id="s59">And then lots of things weren’t done in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: What did you hear about the Nazi party, about Hitler, before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: We didn’t.</span> <span id="s62">We didn’t hear anything.</span> <span id="s63">There was a rumor that a war is coming up.</span> <span id="s64">For instance, our parents did feel in that time that the Germans are not so bad.</span> <span id="s65">They remembered the First World War when the Germans come in and they were really not bad for the population.</span> <span id="s66">People mixed with them and everything.</span> <span id="s67">So even the people were not so concerned.</span> <span id="s68">Most of them, I would say, were not concerned that Germans were coming in, because we didn’t hear actually.</span> <span id="s69">The later years, they hear what’s happening in Berlin, or there’s something, but it was already by the end of when they took us out from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: And you said your primary source of information was the newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Mostly, yes.</span> <span id="s72">From the local newspaper it was.</span> <span id="s73">There really wasn’t much.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: What about radio or word of mouth?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s76">We had some radios.</span> <span id="s77">In that time, they didn’t really tell a lot.</span> <span id="s78">Later, when they closed up the ghetto, you couldn’t hear too much anyway on the radio.</span> <span id="s79">With everything controlled, probably to the Germans, so far.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: In what type of settings, if ay, did you have any contacts with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: In the beginning, before they closed up the ghetto, they had some contact with gentiles.</span> <span id="s82">My father was in the lumber business and he used to do business with gentiles.</span> <span id="s83">So right in the beginning, in some way, they used to smuggle in food.</span> <span id="s84">That’s all they could do, just for a short time till the Germans took more control around the ghetto and the wires and everything so it was impossible to do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Did your family have any gentiles in your home at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Never anything socially to do with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Did you have any personal encounters with anti-Semitism prior to the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: There was anti-Semitism in Poland.</span> <span id="s91">Of course there was.</span> <span id="s92">There were certain parties -- like they hate -- they didn’t hate the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s93">It happened I lived more in a gentile neighborhood.</span> <span id="s94">And sometime, we were afraid to come in the night late.</span> <span id="s95">Hooligans used to stay in the streets and chase the Jewish boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Is there anything specific you remember in terms of the things that happened?</span> <span id="s97">Did anything happen to you, personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: No.</span> <span id="s99">It didn’t happen to me personally, but specific what I remember, we used to come home, at night with friends, we used to live in the same neighborhood, and there used to stay with a group with the gentiles, and they used to yell, “Here’s the Jews coming,” and they used to chase us around.</span> <span id="s100">But as young people, you are not too much afraid.</span> <span id="s101">It was before the war --quite a few years before.</span> <span id="s102">Take another few years and forget everything! )</span> <span id="s103">Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: What about your family -- your parents?</span> <span id="s105">Did you know any anti-Semitic incidents that happened to them or any of your friends or anything that you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s107">I do remember.</span> <span id="s108">Before the war, the anti-Semitism troubled my father, because he was in the lumber business.</span> <span id="s109">In the lumber business, I would say, 70% was in gentiles’ business.</span> <span id="s110">They used to hate the Jew, if he’s in the same business or something like this, but they didn’t happen anything drastically.</span> <span id="s111">Just Jewish competition.</span> <span id="s112">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Did you have any relatives living outside your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Outside Poland there was mine mother’s -- my grandfather from my mother’s side, aunties and -- out of town.</span> <span id="s115">Then mine mother had two brothers in the United States where I could never find them.</span> <span id="s116">When I came back, I tried to look for it in papers, I did lots of things, but it didn’t happen nothing.</span> <span id="s117">From my father’s side, the whole family was a large family and they lived in Lodz, in the same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Do you know what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: They all went to the concentration camp -- to Auschwitz in that time -- a very large family.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Did you ever have any contact with them after that?</span> <span id="s121">Or did they survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: They didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s123">I have two sisters and a brother, and one sister was married.</span> <span id="s124">They had a little child.</span> <span id="s125">They didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s126">We went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s127">My father wasn’t alive anymore, he died in the ghetto, and my two sisters took my mother under the arm when we went into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s128">They didn’t want to leave her alone, and that’s how they went to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s129">My brother-in-law of my sister was with me in a number of concentration camps, and he died on one of the transports on the way when we were going from one camp to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Are you the only one that survived from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: I am the only one, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: May I ask you what age you were at the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: We received the news of the war on the one day we saw the Germans coming in our town.</span> <span id="s134">That was the news.</span> <span id="s135">We knew that there’s a war going around, but we didn’t know that the Germans arrived outskirt of our town.</span> <span id="s136">The one day, when they come in, the first thing what they did -- it’s good that you asked me about it -- they took a number of Jewish people -- and there was like a market place not far from us -- and they hanged them right in the market -- by the feet, with the head down, some woman, and men.</span> <span id="s137">That was like to show us that we would have to be scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: That was the beginning of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: The beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s140">Later we went out -- even my parents and others, younger children -- we used to see when the Germans coming in on their motor cycles with the dogs, with everything.</span> <span id="s141">We really didn’t know much about it.</span> <span id="s142">We didn’t know, because with us, it was kind of fun.</span> <span id="s143">An army comes in -- and even our parents, -- maybe they were old fashioned and they didn’t know so much about it -- said.</span> <span id="s144">“Ah, the Germans coming in.</span> <span id="s145">We know the Germans.</span> <span id="s146">They’re going to be the same like it was in our war.”</span> <span id="s147">Average people really didn’t know too much what was going on in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: So you really didn’t have any idea what was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No.</span> <span id="s150">People in certain parts of Poland -- they really didn’t know too much.</span> <span id="s151">They were also occupied with the children, with the work, with the food, with everything.</span> <span id="s152">They didn’t know too much.</span> <span id="s153">It’s a shame.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Do you have anything else you wanted to add to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: (Sigh) Well, I can add how it was in the concentration camps when I was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s156">When I went in to Auschwitz, I went in with three uncles -- my father’s brothers.</span> <span id="s157">And they, in some way, smuggled in my nephew, a small boy -- maybe ten years old.</span> <span id="s158">He was with us in the camp in Auschwitz, and from Auschwitz, when they sent us out -- they were kind of big guys, and they took him in with them, we were ten or whatever in a row -- to another camp.</span> <span id="s159">It was in Wustegiersdorf.</span> <span id="s160">When we went to work, the boy was hidden underneath the bed.</span> <span id="s161">One time we were at work, I and my uncle and the SS discovered that the boy walked out from the barrack.</span> <span id="s162">They discovered him through the window.</span> <span id="s163">We come back, the boy was not anymore over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: How old was this boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Ten years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Let me ask you if you can remember the day the Germans came, again when you were in Lodz -- where were you at the time/ and do you know what you were doing at the exact time?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Well, in that time, I don’t recall, but I think it was a Friday and a Saturday.</span> <span id="s168">I was at home with my brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s169">People started talking, “The Germans are coming in, the Germans are coming in!”</span> <span id="s170">Everybody ran out in the main street -- it was maybe three blocks away from where we used to live -- and they saw them coming in with their motorcycles and with dogs, with hardware, who knows what.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: What did the neighbors say or do?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Well, like I said, we used to live in a more gentile neighborhood.</span> <span id="s173">There was mixed Jewish and non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s174">Everybody, they didn’t say nothing – really, people were not afraid of it in beginning, because we didn’t know what’s going on in the world.</span> <span id="s175">A day, two days later, things start to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Were there any meetings held in the synagogues?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: No.</span> <span id="s178">Not that I can recall at all, because right after, the Germans burned the synagogues.</span> <span id="s179">In Lodz was one of the most beautiful synagogues in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: A large, large synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Minneapolis doesn’t even have a synagogue like this.</span> <span id="s182">It was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s183">Very beautiful.</span> <span id="s184">It was built maybe fifty years ago.</span> <span id="s185">This was the first synagogue what they burned to the ground.</span> <span id="s186">And the other synagogue, in the “smaller” synagogue they call it, people were afraid to go in, because they burned it up, and there was a law not to go into that synagogue, not even to pray in our homes, so people used to pray in private homes as long as the Germans didn’t know.</span> <span id="s187">I can tell you another incident that may be important.</span> <span id="s188">When I was in the ghetto, there was a Kripo [ this is an acronym for “Kriminal polizei” or “criminal police”], a German officer over there, and they used to know -- I don’t know how they used to know -- which Jewish family was very well off financially before the war.</span> <span id="s189">They used to call them in the office and said, “ You have money, do you have…?”</span> <span id="s190">What people used to save, gold rubles or the diamonds, that was their security in that time.</span> <span id="s191">And they ask you, “Either you give us whatever you got…” – they used to know, but I don’t know how!</span> <span id="s192">But they used to know what really you have.</span> <span id="s193">So I was three times in the Kripo.</span> <span id="s194">My father died in the ghetto already in 1942, and after that they called me in the Kripo, and it happened I come into the Kripo when one was in charge -- it was a Jewish fellow -- he used to be in the same business with my father, and he knew me, and he said, “Berek, we know, they know, that your father had some hidden stuff.</span> <span id="s195">Either you give, otherwise they are going to kill you.”</span> <span id="s196">So I said, “ I don’t know, I’ll have to ask my mother.’</span> <span id="s197">And then they come again and they called me in, and they said, “ This is it.’</span> <span id="s198">So eventually I took out everything what my father had hidden -- some gold rubles and diamonds and I give it to them.</span> <span id="s199">That’s how I really survived, otherwise they would kill me over them.</span> <span id="s200">Another one of the Germans --Suter was his name.</span> <span id="s201">He was a Volksdeutsch, they called it, a “Polish German.’</span> <span id="s202">He used to live in a house where my father used to deliver lumber to a certain company.</span> <span id="s203">So he knew my father and he knew me because I used to be with my father together.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: This is a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Yes, a German.</span> <span id="s206">So one time I was going with the street car, and he saw me.</span> <span id="s207">He was pretending that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s208">He used to speak perfect Jewish The other people what they didn’t know him -- they were talking about the Germans, how bad they are, and this - and he just looked.</span> <span id="s209">Later they went down from the streetcar and he took them away.</span> <span id="s210">So he recognized me and he said, “Berek, your father was Mendel?’</span> <span id="s211">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s212">He said, “ Do you remember me?”</span> <span id="s213">I said, “ Yeah, Mr. Suter.</span> <span id="s214">I remember you.”</span> <span id="s215">And that’s what really started when they called me in in the Kripo that I have to give away everything.</span> <span id="s216">That’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: That’s how they knew you.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s219">I can tell you -- this is after the war, but it’s really important.</span> <span id="s220">I would like you to know.</span> <span id="s221">I used to live in Germany in a small town.</span> <span id="s222">They call it Laufen.</span> <span id="s223">It’s on the border, Germany and Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: This is after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s226">Right after the war was over, I had a broken arm, what the German hit me -- about the last couple of days.</span> <span id="s227">I was walking with two friends in the concentration camp in the little street and I noticed one guy in a long leather coat -- he looked so familiar.</span> <span id="s228">And I looked in his face, and this guy was in charge in our ghetto.</span> <span id="s229">He was a German SS.</span> <span id="s230">He was in charge of sending out groups of Jewish people to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s231">His name was Alfred Stromberg.</span> <span id="s232">That was already an American government over there.</span> <span id="s233">They started to look up the papers and he was wanted in the Nuremberg Trial.</span> <span id="s234">So they hold him.</span> <span id="s235">We used to call witness from Germany, from our town, and everybody was telling who he is and so forth.</span> <span id="s236">So they sent him back to Poland -- or they sent him back to Nuremberg -- I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s237">But his name was Alfred Stromberg.</span> <span id="s238">We caught him.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Do you know how life might have changed economically or socially after the outbreak of the war?</span> <span id="s240">Different social changes, economic changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: There was no economically because people was working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s242">The people what were capable to work, they called it hazod, was working.</span> <span id="s243">Somebody was working in the straw factories and shoe factories and clothing factories, and everything was produced for the Germans.</span> <span id="s244">The people didn’t have any heads for socially, because everybody was hungry and worried, and in the evening you couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s245">Then, for work, you used to get stamps that you can go and they have some -- like groceries -- that each week or two weeks, you go in and you get your portion on your stamps for two weeks’ food.</span> <span id="s246">Like the people here on poverty.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: How many stamps did you get, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s249">We used to get for a family maybe two, three pounds of potatoes for a week.</span> <span id="s250">Or a loaf of bread for a family for two weeks.</span> <span id="s251">And that’s all.</span> <span id="s252">Then they give you some horsemeat.</span> <span id="s253">(Laughs) you couldn’t live on it and you couldn’t starve on it.</span> <span id="s254">It was real bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: When the Germans came, what type of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I was with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: He was still alive then.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s259">He died in ’42 or ’43.</span> <span id="s260">He got sick in the ghetto and he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: What type of work in the lumber company did you actually do?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well, in the lumber, let’s say my father used to receive by carloads lumber.</span> <span id="s263">We used to sell to bakeries, to factories, to lots of companies, what they did use in that time.</span> <span id="s264">They were bleaching clothes and they need lumber for heating up the furnaces.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: When the Germans came, were there any discussions about staying or fleeing from your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s267">There was discussions about staying or the fleeing.</span> <span id="s268">For instance, I have a brother and two sisters.</span> <span id="s269">And they were much younger from me.</span> <span id="s270">So my brother, really, took a chance.</span> <span id="s271">He said, “You’re the oldest.</span> <span id="s272">You stay with your parents.’</span> <span id="s273">And he went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s274">He ran away to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s275">He disappeared over there, too.</span> <span id="s276">Then I have mine sisters, and one of my sisters was already married and we lived together and she had a little child -- maybe four years old.</span> <span id="s277">There was already rumors in the ghetto that this part of the ghetto would be shipped out in a couple days.</span> <span id="s278">So I used to take my sisters and my mother and we used to go across the big bridge on the other end of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s279">We used to go by rumors what’s going on.</span> <span id="s280">We really didn’t know too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So that was all the discussion you had about staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s283">There was more discussion on what to get to eat.</span> <span id="s284">But you were strangled around with wires.</span> <span id="s285">Really there wasn’t too much chances to escape from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s286">And the Jewish people -- in a certain part -- they were really afraid.</span> <span id="s287">They didn’t have the guys to escape.</span> <span id="s288">Where would you go?</span> <span id="s289">You would go out from the ghetto, you would go right in the heart of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Do you know the dates, when did the Nazi occupation occur?</span> <span id="s291">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: In 1939.</span> <span id="s293">When they liquidated the ghetto, was in 1944, August.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: And when you were in the ghetto, what knowledge of the outside world or other ghettos or mass killings or concentration camps were you aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Well in our ghetto, in the Lodz ghetto, they used to send in lots of Jewish people from smaller towns.</span> <span id="s296">Lodz is a big town, second from Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: What was the population?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Very, very large.</span> <span id="s299">There was a large Jewish population.</span> <span id="s300">And then the Jewish people from the surrounding counties -- from the small towns -- they assembled in the Lodz ghetto for a month or so and then they shipped them out to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s301">Then people -- like from Berlin -- there was like a station what people used to come in.</span> <span id="s302">I used to see, they used to come in with a transport -- with train -- and one of the Germans looked up, he saw somebody calling down, and he killed him right away.</span> <span id="s303">He knew him from Berlin or who knows from where.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Can you recall any specific anti-Jewish measures or legislation by the occupation?</span> <span id="s305">Any rules, any laws that they made after they took over?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: You mean the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A; Well, there were a number of rules.</span> <span id="s309">For instance, there was a curfew.</span> <span id="s310">You couldn’t go out after a certain hour in the evening.</span> <span id="s311">And then there were rules where you could not assemble in any temples and synagogues.</span> <span id="s312">Was rules like you have to live by what you’re getting from your stamps – to live on it There were a lot of sharp measures in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s313">Used to see the ghetto, people used to walk on the sidewalk, and you could see the people are swollen from not eating.</span> <span id="s314">You walked behind them, and you can see, tipped over and died on the sidewalks.</span> <span id="s315">Every day!</span> <span id="s316">There used to be mass funerals every day from people who had just fallen over because there was not any food.</span> <span id="s317">And when somebody got sick, then you have to know he’s going to die because there was not any doctors.</span> <span id="s318">Who knew about doctors?</span> <span id="s319">People were very depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Did you have many friends that died in the ghetto like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Oh, lots of friends.</span> <span id="s322">Lots of friends.</span> <span id="s323">Some of our neighbors where we used to live.</span> <span id="s324">There was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s325">A ghetto means you knew everybody!</span> <span id="s326">You knew each other.</span> <span id="s327">Was like a small town, a little ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Do you remember the name of the street that you lived on?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Oh, yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s330">I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s331">The street was Lagervinitzka 33.</span> <span id="s332">I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s333">I was born over there.</span> <span id="s334">(Chuckles)</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: What was it like?</span> <span id="s336">The place you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Let’s say there was I and my father, two brothers and two sisters -- six people.</span> <span id="s338">We used to live in two rooms -- a kitchen and another room with a number of beds and that’s how the living was in Poland.</span> <span id="s339">It was real primitive, comparing to the United States.</span> <span id="s340">And at that time, they called that “good,” because we were financially pretty well off.</span> <span id="s341">Now, when you have to look back at how other people lived, it was much worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Do you remember the dates and circumstances of your deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s344">It was 1944, in August, on August 25th.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: So you were in the ghetto until 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Till 1944, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Do you remember who ordered it?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: The Gestapo.</span> <span id="s349">When you’re talking about who ordered it, I didn’t mention that I was working in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s350">What I was delivering from the Germans, food -- or the clothing to the factories -- they used to come in trucks and by horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s351">They used to come to a certain place, and we, as drivers, used to take to the trucks, the horse and buggy we used to deliver to the factory for the people working, like straw, fabrics, lots of things what was sent for the Germans.</span> <span id="s352">And this guy what he was in charge -- the German on the transportation community – and before they liquidated the ghetto, he knew me, and they told the remaining Jews -- we were one of the remaining Jews -- but this was the last day when they liquidated the ghetto – so I was with my mother and with my two sisters.</span> <span id="s353">Just my brother and my two sisters and my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s354">We went to a big market, and they did make a selection who can stay in the ghetto still working for the Germans and who have to shipped out.</span> <span id="s355">By them, “shipped out” means they go to some other place to work.</span> <span id="s356">So he wanted that I stay in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s357">I was a young strong guy.</span> <span id="s358">So I begged him, why don’t you leave my mother, too?</span> <span id="s359">So he picked one of my sisters -- the younger one -- that I and my sister, we can stay.</span> <span id="s360">So of course, I didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s361">That’s how I went to Auschwitz with my mother and with my two sisters and my brother Loren, the little child.</span> <span id="s362">Otherwise, I could stay in the ghetto, still working for the Germans -- I and my younger sister, ‘cause they still had some factories.</span> <span id="s363">After they liquidated the ghetto, still was remaining about 1,000 or 1,500 Jews but they left them over there.</span> <span id="s364">And I could be among them, but my decision was not to leave my mother with my sister and the little child go themselves.</span> <span id="s365">I didn’t know that they go to Auschwitz, but I wanted to be with them, together.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: What were you or your family’s expectations about the meaning of deportation?</span> <span id="s367">Did you have an idea what to expect?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Deportation was -- nobody knew in the ghetto -- maybe except a few on higher places in the ghetto -- that really, they were shipped out.</span> <span id="s369">Nobody knew where they were.</span> <span id="s370">They thought they ship them out to a certain part of Germany or in Poland -- for some kind of work, hard labor, whatever.</span> <span id="s371">But nobody knew Auschwitz, or there’s any concentration camps, or the ovens.</span> <span id="s372">Nobody knew about it in that time.</span> <span id="s373">Maybe some of the leaders from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s374">Maybe they knew.</span> <span id="s375">I was shipped out in the same day when the leader of the Lodz ghetto was shipped out -- Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s376">You probably heard of him.</span> <span id="s377">He was shipped out in the same transport what I went -- I’m sure he knew that there’s Auschwitz, but they forced him.</span> <span id="s378">He couldn’t get away anyway.</span> <span id="s379">He was an old man then -- went straight to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s380">I saw him when they put him in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s381">There was that chief of the Jewish police in the Lodz ghetto, Rosenblat.</span> <span id="s382">He went with us too, in the transport.</span> <span id="s383">They went, took both of them, into the crematorium --they were the first, the leaders -- first they took away the leaders.</span> <span id="s384">I came into Auschwitz with my mother and the two sisters and my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s385">There was some Jewish people on the receiving line, where they took the people out from the boxcars.</span> <span id="s386">And they told me, “You leave your mother alone, because your mother don’t going to survive.</span> <span id="s387">You maybe have a chance.</span> <span id="s388">You’re young and strong.”</span> <span id="s389">So my two sisters didn’t want to leave my mother.</span> <span id="s390">They told my sisters to go away from my mother, to give the little child to my mother.</span> <span id="s391">So my two sisters didn’t want to go away from my mother.</span> <span id="s392">One took from this side the arm and the other from this side, and they walked away.</span> <span id="s393">They walked right to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s394">My brother-in-law, he went with me -- a young guy, but he was killed on the way.</span> <span id="s395">He couldn’t walk anymore after when they sent us from Auschwitz to another camp.</span> <span id="s396">He couldn’t walk anymore and they shoot him.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Can you tell me, as detailed as you can, the transportation process from the ghetto to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s399">The transportation from the ghetto, they come a number of boxcars into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s400">And they told us -- not an order -- they told us to take whatever we can carry with us from home.</span> <span id="s401">So we carried lots of things.</span> <span id="s402">And when we come to the boxcars, they didn’t let us take nothing.</span> <span id="s403">They just chased us in the boxcars, and everything was right on the ground next to the boxcars.</span> <span id="s404">They just chased everybody in.</span> <span id="s405">And then they closed the doors, and we were going.</span> <span id="s406">But I can add a few things.</span> <span id="s407">One time, this was in the beginning of 1945, was then shipments again from one camp to another, and there was lots of sick people in the boxcars.</span> <span id="s408">And the people was real hungry.</span> <span id="s409">I used to see where people eating the flesh of other people who were already dead -- laying in the boxcars.</span> <span id="s410">And the other what was so hungry, and they used to eat the flesh -- bite the flesh out from dead people -- of those dead bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: This is on the way to the…</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Not from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s413">That was from another camp.</span> <span id="s414">That was in Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s415">I never was in one camp too long.</span> <span id="s416">They used to ship us from one camp to the other.</span> <span id="s417">And the one time, I was pushing a cart, what the soldiers have to eat -- an army cart with food.</span> <span id="s418">And of course I stole a bread, and they took me away from the cart, on the back.</span> <span id="s419">That means, when they take you to the back, then you’re dead.</span> <span id="s420">They shoot you.</span> <span id="s421">So there was one Polish guy from Cracow.</span> <span id="s422">Somebody told him we used to be together all the time, and we used to like each other.</span> <span id="s423">So one guy told him -- Bishak his name was --“You know, they took Berek in the end over there.</span> <span id="s424">They’re probably going to shoot him.”</span> <span id="s425">And he, again, was on good terms with the SS.</span> <span id="s426">He used to smuggle for them cigarettes, or whatever, so he run in the back.</span> <span id="s427">In some way, he took me away from the Germans, that Polish guy.</span> <span id="s428">(Chuckles) he said himself he was before the war -- that Polish guy --– a crook and everything.</span> <span id="s429">Before the war.</span> <span id="s430">They used to call him “Jewish father.’</span> <span id="s431">He was sticking up really for our people.</span> <span id="s432">Really was sticking up.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: He wasn’t Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: No, he wasn’t Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: You started telling me about the conditions of traveling to Auschwitz from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s436">Can you continue?</span> <span id="s437">How long did it take?</span> <span id="s438">What were the conditions like?</span> <span id="s439">Any experiences you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yes, I do remember.</span> <span id="s441">The conditions, like I said, we were riding in a boxcar with no food.</span> <span id="s442">and one of the stations we stopped, they opened the door like for fresh air.</span> <span id="s443">I don’t know where it was, and some of the people, Polish people, tried to give us water.</span> <span id="s444">And they just didn’t let anything get in.</span> <span id="s445">No water and no food.</span> <span id="s446">I don’t know what part of Poland it was or in Germany or whatever.</span> <span id="s447">Probably in Poland.</span> <span id="s448">Then when we stepped out from the cars, we saw that we are in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s449">It was the sign and everything.</span> <span id="s450">The music was playing, what was probably familiar to everybody, and then we used to go for the selection, they call it.</span> <span id="s451">Mengele, he used to separate the people right and left, and so forth.</span> <span id="s452">And I went at that time with three of my uncles, with my nephew, the little boy ten years old, and I don’t recall, but for a few weeks we were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s453">Then they sent us -- they called that camp Wygietrzow -- and Ravensbruck, and other camps.</span> <span id="s454">I was liberated in 1945.</span> <span id="s455">In May we were liberated in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: The first camp was Auschwitz that you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: The first was Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: How many days did it take you to get there from your ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: I would say two or three days, but that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Were these open boxcars?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: No.</span> <span id="s462">Closed-up boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: And they gave you blankets and food.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: No.</span> <span id="s465">We come in -- we went into the shower over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: So for two days there was no food at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: No.</span> <span id="s468">Was nothing.</span> <span id="s469">They didn’t care so much whether you eat or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Can you describe the conditions 0f the boxcar?</span> <span id="s471">Was it crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: It was very crowded!</span> <span id="s473">There was, I think, a steel floor.</span> <span id="s474">It’s like a cattle boxcar, I would say, because there was some straw scattered around in the car.</span> <span id="s475">And later, we ourselves opened a little window on top next to the roof.</span> <span id="s476">We opened a window over there and there was some bars, but that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Do you remember the approximate day and time and the year of your arrival in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Well, we left in August in 1944.</span> <span id="s479">I would say by the end of August we were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s480">I don’t remember the day arriving -- who knew at the time what date it is?</span> <span id="s481">You knew when you left.</span> <span id="s482">When they liquidated the ghetto, then I left.</span> <span id="s483">I think that was the 25th or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Can you describe, as detailed as you can remember, the process and the registration into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: When we walked out from the train cars, what the process was, the first thing, they separate women from men.</span> <span id="s486">Right by coming out from the boxcar.</span> <span id="s487">And then we went through the segregation.</span> <span id="s488">I would call it, when Mengele segregated which one go right and which one go left.</span> <span id="s489">After you went through the segregation, you were supposed to take a shower -- took you to the shower where you took off all your clothes, your shoes, and you went through the shower, and then you walked out the shower, they gave you a pair of wooden shoes and their uniform --what you were wearing with the stripes in Auschwitz at that time.</span> <span id="s490">And then they took you to one of the barracks over there.</span> <span id="s491">In the barracks, they used to come in -- they call it the kapos -- and they used to beat you and lots of things.</span> <span id="s492">Over there to survive, you have to be lucky, to hide in a corner, nobody see you.</span> <span id="s493">And they give you orders who will go to work and who stays in barrack.</span> <span id="s494">But most the time we went to work.</span> <span id="s495">They took us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Were you tattooed?</span> <span id="s497">Did you get a number?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: You’re talking about tattoo here?</span> <span id="s499">Yeah.</span> <span id="s500">(Looks at arm) 181,000; 180,000 or something.</span> <span id="s501">I have papers what it’s written over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Can you describe that process?</span> <span id="s503">How they did that?</span> <span id="s504">Was that on the first day?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: No.</span> <span id="s506">It wasn’t on the first day.</span> <span id="s507">I think it was on the second.</span> <span id="s508">It was like with a needle or something.</span> <span id="s509">I don’t recall it, but with a needle they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Painful?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Eh, could survive.</span> <span id="s512">(Laughs) I have some papers.</span> <span id="s513">180,400 something.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Can you provide a physical description of the camp?</span> <span id="s515">I’ll give you an example.</span> <span id="s516">The size of the camp, the buildings, how many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: The size of the camp -- they called it a barrack.</span> <span id="s518">Like a soldiers’ barrack.</span> <span id="s519">Was very long.</span> <span id="s520">And I would say there was a few hundred people over there.</span> <span id="s521">And there weren’t regular beds, there was bunk beds.</span> <span id="s522">And that was all.</span> <span id="s523">In the morning they’re supposed to give you some coffee -- some kind of liquid.</span> <span id="s524">You used to stay in the line in order to get something.</span> <span id="s525">And sometimes, the kapos, they looked at you and either he liked you or he dumped it on the floor and didn’t give you to drink.</span> <span id="s526">And sometime you were even afraid to go into the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Did that happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Sure it happened to me -- more than one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: What else can you tell me about the camp?</span> <span id="s530">What were the buildings like?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: It’s like barracks.</span> <span id="s532">Was wooden or there’s some steel buildings -- that was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s533">And we were not long in Auschwitz, and then we went to another camp.</span> <span id="s534">And the other camps --there was all over, the same thing.</span> <span id="s535">Talking about the camps, there wasn’t one better than the other one.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: So in the barracks themselves -- besides the bunk beds -- was there anything else at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: No, there was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: How many bunk beds were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: I would say 50.</span> <span id="s540">You know, you were so depressed, and so beaten up that you didn’t really look around.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: What were the living conditions like?</span> <span id="s542">Can you describe the routine of the day, the work, the food, sleeping, clothing, your health, medical conditions -- whatever you want to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Well, depends on what camps.</span> <span id="s544">Let’s say for instance, in Auschwitz, the routine was, in morning, you have to go out, like an “appell.”</span> <span id="s545">They count you whether you’re here.</span> <span id="s546">And then they send you out to do some work.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I don’t know what you call it.</span> <span id="s549">They took a group of people, we used to go out.</span> <span id="s550">That was in one camp.</span> <span id="s551">And then I went to another camp.</span> <span id="s552">We were not too long in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s553">Went to another camp.</span> <span id="s554">In fact, it was a different system they have over there.</span> <span id="s555">They used to give you some piece of bread or something.</span> <span id="s556">And happened our barrack was next to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s557">Used to see a mountain of bodies laying, prepared, to burn ‘em up.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: This was at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No.</span> <span id="s560">This was in another camp.</span> <span id="s561">This was some part of Germany.</span> <span id="s562">It was not Regensburg, but the third one -- Wustegiersdorf they used to call it.</span> <span id="s563">And the crematorium was right next to our barracks.</span> <span id="s564">We used to see how the flames and everything goes up.</span> <span id="s565">And over there they sent us to Regensburg.</span> <span id="s566">There was already by the end of the war that they were afraid of something.</span> <span id="s567">We used to work on the railroad.</span> <span id="s568">There was a hotel.</span> <span id="s569">They took over the hotel and all the prisoners, they were staying in the hotel.</span> <span id="s570">In morning we used to go out on the railroad.</span> <span id="s571">We used to clean up the railroad because the allies -- like United States and England -- used to bomb already the railroad.</span> <span id="s572">So one day, I recall that we were working on the railroad and I saw the planes coming up.</span> <span id="s573">I don’t know whether they were American or they were English.</span> <span id="s574">And our guards, the SS men, they ran away from us.</span> <span id="s575">They left us alone.</span> <span id="s576">There was a big hole in the ground, and they told us to go in over there.</span> <span id="s577">You know, they thought maybe we will get killed.</span> <span id="s578">But they did run away.</span> <span id="s579">They run away someplace else.</span> <span id="s580">So what’s happened?</span> <span id="s581">The same bombs fell on the place where all the SS men were hidden.</span> <span id="s582">They got killed and we were free to go!</span> <span id="s583">But really, nobody knew where to go.</span> <span id="s584">So I and a few friends, we run away.</span> <span id="s585">We were hiding in a cemetery.</span> <span id="s586">There was an older German woman, and she give us some food.</span> <span id="s587">You want clothes, I give you clothes.</span> <span id="s588">And go away.</span> <span id="s589">So we took some clothes and we start to wander around in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s590">That was a river -- the Donau River we called it.</span> <span id="s591">We used to walk around, about three, four guys, and we really didn’t know what to do with ourselves till other Germans coming up and they surrounded us and took us back.</span> <span id="s592">That was civilian Germans what they took us out, because they were afraid that we would do something.</span> <span id="s593">We’re wandering around in town, because the SS was already killed on the railroad.</span> <span id="s594">So they took us over there to the hotel.</span> <span id="s595">We didn’t know really what to do.</span> <span id="s596">Kind of dumb.</span> <span id="s597">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: That was the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: No.</span> <span id="s600">That was during the war.</span> <span id="s601">And over there, later, they took us from Regensburg.</span> <span id="s602">We were going to another part of Germany -- walking for weeks, we were walking.</span> <span id="s603">In the night we were staying in a barn by farmers.</span> <span id="s604">Sometimes the night and sometimes in daytime.</span> <span id="s605">And they just took us.</span> <span id="s606">We were walking and walking.</span> <span id="s607">That was in May, 1945.</span> <span id="s608">And some of the farmers start running out on the highway, and used to say, “ The war is over!”</span> <span id="s609">in German.</span> <span id="s610">“Der Krieg ist vorbei!”</span> <span id="s611">“The war is over!”</span> <span id="s612">So the Germans -- the SS -- they run away from us.</span> <span id="s613">They left us.</span> <span id="s614">But the war was really over.</span> <span id="s615">And that’s how we settled in this small town -- most of us.</span> <span id="s616">We settled.</span> <span id="s617">That was a small town.</span> <span id="s618">It was right on the border between Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s619">That’s how we settled over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: You were starting to tell me a typical day in the camp.</span> <span id="s621">Can you describe the food and the sleeping conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: The sleeping conditions.</span> <span id="s623">You sleep in a bunk, yeah?</span> <span id="s624">A hard bunk.</span> <span id="s625">And you have it – it wasn’t a mattress.</span> <span id="s626">I don’t know what you call it.</span> <span id="s627">It was with straw inside.</span> <span id="s628">A kind of burlap sack with something with straw.</span> <span id="s629">On this we were sleeping.</span> <span id="s630">In morning, I don’t know, four o’clock or five o’clock in the morning, they woke you up and you went out -- like soldiers for army.</span> <span id="s631">They count you.</span> <span id="s632">And then they select you for work.</span> <span id="s633">Select how many people.</span> <span id="s634">And we went back to the barracks and they were supposed to give you like a coffee -- some kind of liquid.</span> <span id="s635">Who knows.</span> <span id="s636">So, they give you.</span> <span id="s637">Some did get and some didn’t get.</span> <span id="s638">That was the guys, they call the kapos, in the camp themselves.</span> <span id="s639">And they just pour it on the floor and they tell you to wipe it off.</span> <span id="s640">And then, once a day, not every day, they give you a piece of bread and that’s supposed to last you two or three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: That’s all they gave you?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: That’s all.</span> <span id="s643">What else?</span> <span id="s644">When you eat it up, the other two days you starve for it.</span> <span id="s645">And when you didn’t eat it up, the next one stole it away from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Did you have to steal food yourself at times?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: There wasn’t from anybody to steal.</span> <span id="s648">I’ll tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s649">In one of the camps -- in Auschwitz not -- but in one of the camps, I was staying to go to work and one of the guys went out from the kitchen -- he was working in the kitchen, he was a Jewish guy from my town -- it just happened he knew my father and he remembered me too.</span> <span id="s650">So he said, “Berek, I’m here so long.</span> <span id="s651">Did you just come from the ghetto?”</span> <span id="s652">I said, “ yeah.”</span> <span id="s653">So he said, “ I take you in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s654">You will work here in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s655">You will have enough food.”</span> <span id="s656">So I was working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s657">Maybe for three or four weeks, until they sent us someplace else.</span> <span id="s658">So in that time I had enough food.</span> <span id="s659">really, to eat.</span> <span id="s660">But in the other, I was the same like anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: And the clothing?</span> <span id="s662">What was the clothing like?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: The clothing was the stripes uniform what we have.</span> <span id="s664">Pair of pants and a little jacket.</span> <span id="s665">That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Just one uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Just the one.</span> <span id="s668">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Was it ever cleaned at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Not that I recall.</span> <span id="s671">Never washed and never cleaned.</span> <span id="s672">That’s why people had lice.</span> <span id="s673">There was lice on the bodies.</span> <span id="s674">But who was young, especially people who was young and healthy, you would wash with cold water or something.</span> <span id="s675">You keep yourself clean.</span> <span id="s676">But most the people were sick and hungry, and then you get so depressed, they didn’t take care of themselves.</span> <span id="s677">I talk about myself, I can talk about some other people -- what other people did, too.</span> <span id="s678">There was people what they were smoking before they went to the camp.</span> <span id="s679">They used to take the soup -- we used to get our soup -- and they used to sell the soup for a cigarette.</span> <span id="s680">These people didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s681">And then I run into people from Hungary and they were so religious, they used to have the tefillin with them.</span> <span id="s682">Just the tefillin, not a tallit.</span> <span id="s683">And they used to go, during the day, when a guard didn’t see it, in a corner, and they used to pray, to put on the tefillin.</span> <span id="s684">I don’t know how they got it into the camp in the first place.</span> <span id="s685">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s686">But some people, someway, you know.</span> <span id="s687">And they used to pray in the corners ‘til somebody from the SS caught ‘em.</span> <span id="s688">Then they was through, too.</span> <span id="s689">Very religious people.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Can you tell me about the health and the medical conditions?</span> <span id="s691">Yours and whoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Well, my health was considered good.</span> <span id="s693">I lost lots of weight, but I considered very lucky.</span> <span id="s694">I wasn’t sick.</span> <span id="s695">And there was some minor things -- like at that time I got on my body some certain wounds or something from uncleaness, but they did go away with the time.</span> <span id="s696">But some other people was real bad.</span> <span id="s697">And then in one camp I was, the doctors -- this may be important too -- they used to take specimens from the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: What kind of specimen?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: I’d like to find the word for it.</span> <span id="s700">Not urine specimen.</span> <span id="s701">What they call it -- they’d take specimens of certain -- I’ve forgotten the name of it.</span> <span id="s702">(Laughs) So anyway, we went through lots of things, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Was there any medical provisions at all?</span> <span id="s704">They want to know what the medical conditions were like in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: There wasn’t really medical conditions at all.</span> <span id="s706">Who did care, a hundred dies, or 200, or 250.</span> <span id="s707">There was no medical conditions in the camp.</span> <span id="s708">Let’s see, not that I know of it, but I would say there was some hospitals and certain things.</span> <span id="s709">Maybe somebody got sick for some reason, but not that I know of it.</span> <span id="s710">Whether there was any hospitals, or there was sickness -- they didn’t care about sick people!</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Can you tell me about your barrack-mates -- who they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Oh, I would say, in this particular barrack, I was with the most people from my town -- from the ghetto -- what they shipped out in that time, I would say, 80%.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: So you knew them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: I went from one camp to the other.</span> <span id="s715">A few were separated to another camp, but 90% we went all the time till the end together, from our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: So some of your relatives were…</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Oh, relatives, friends, people what I grew up with together.</span> <span id="s718">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: In the same barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: In the same barracks, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Were there any differences in treatment of the Jews as opposed to other groups that were in the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: There wasn’t many non-Jews at that time, but I would say there was no difference at all.</span> <span id="s723">From the ghetto there were no non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s724">We went out with all Jewish people, but there was when we come into the camps, maybe a few remaining Poles and Russians -- there was lots of Russian people -- but they were all treated the same way.</span> <span id="s725">Except if you were in charge, like we call it kapos, or they were working in a Sonder over there.</span> <span id="s726">The rest was all equal, but the people that were in charge, kapos, you couldn’t even go close to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: You remember them.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Oh, do I remember!</span> <span id="s729">When you saw one here, you went on the other end.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Did you have any encounters with gypsies, Jehovah Witnesses, homosexuals, baptized Jews…</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Not in the camps and not in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s732">They sent out the gypsies from Poland even before the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: What about Soviet prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A; Soviet?</span> <span id="s735">I don’t know if these were prisoners, but one of the camps where I was there were lots of Soviets.</span> <span id="s736">But all these Soviets, they were working on positions.</span> <span id="s737">They were not the average prisoner -- Jewish prisoner -- but they were separated and in some positions there.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: As detailed as you can get, what acts did you see or were aware of -- such as the systematic killings or the fatalities from other causes?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: (Sigh) From causes.</span> <span id="s740">Really the killing ,what I can tell you from other causes was when somebody got so weak -- when we were going from one camp to the other for days, or for nights, they got weak -- they took them away, and they shoot them.</span> <span id="s741">They shoot mine three uncles.</span> <span id="s742">They were very strong guys, but someway they probably got sick and couldn’t walk anymore.</span> <span id="s743">There wasn’t any cause of it, really.</span> <span id="s744">They got sick or they couldn’t walk anymore, they just took them and took out their gun and shoot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s747">My uncle, yes, I saw it when they shoot him.</span> <span id="s748">We were walking, about eight or the six guys, like this.</span> <span id="s749">And he fell.</span> <span id="s750">They drag him out and there was no mercy.</span> <span id="s751">And then, another.</span> <span id="s752">I know that some people got sick in the camps.</span> <span id="s753">You didn’t see them anymore.</span> <span id="s754">They took ‘em out.</span> <span id="s755">Who knows whether they took them to the hospital or whether they killed them.</span> <span id="s756">The next day you didn’t see ‘em anymore.</span> <span id="s757">The hunger was so big -- so great -- but I saw it with my own eyes that the son used to steal away the food from the father in order to eat it, and the father dying a few days later.</span> <span id="s758">The bread was hidden someplace or under the mattress or something, and they took it away.</span> <span id="s759">People maybe don’t realize what hunger means.</span> <span id="s760">Like I said, I saw people eating flesh from dead bodies.</span> <span id="s761">They couldn’t control themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Did they do that in the camps too?</span> <span id="s763">Eat the flesh?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Not in the camps.</span> <span id="s765">No.</span> <span id="s766">That was in the boxcars -- that we used to, for days, ride in the boxcars – and the people died in the boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: What can you tell me of the systematic killings?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Systematic killing was the crematorium -- what I saw in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s769">Our barrack, happened it was close to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s770">We could smell that smoke from the chimneys what they coming out.</span> <span id="s771">And that was the systematic killing.</span> <span id="s772">Or, you were working in certain positions on digging something, and some of the people what they couldn’t work anymore, they kick you in a hole someplace and you could hear the machine guns go.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Did you see people go into the crematoriums?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s775">‘Course I saw ‘em.</span> <span id="s776">I saw my mother with two sisters and child when they took ‘em away.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Can you describe the feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: My feeling?</span> <span id="s779">You cannot describe it anymore.</span> <span id="s780">It’s so many years, really.</span> <span id="s781">Sometimes, my children and my grandchildren, they say to me, “Zayde, why don’t you tell me?”</span> <span id="s782">I never really did tell them.</span> <span id="s783">I don’t know, for one reason or another , we never talked too much about it.</span> <span id="s784">But now of course, they know what’s happened.</span> <span id="s785">In beginning, when the children start to growing up, there was nights I couldn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s786">I was still in Auschwitz and could still see everything!</span> <span id="s787">So I really couldn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s788">It was heartbreaking and everything.</span> <span id="s789">I used to cry day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Anything else about the gas chambers, killings, any other incidents that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Well we wasn’t really by the gas chambers, you know, close to it.</span> <span id="s792">You got to know that our transport from the ghetto was one of the latest, from ’44, and during from ’44 outwards ‘til May in 1945, I was maybe in three, four camps.</span> <span id="s793">So really, you didn’t see too much of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: How long were you in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: How long?</span> <span id="s796">I would say two to three weeks in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Was there a means of communicating throughout the camp with others?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: There was no means of communicating.</span> <span id="s799">You see the people was so knocked down, really, that one didn’t talk to each other.</span> <span id="s800">There it was so depressing -- I can’t describe it -- that everybody was like out of his mind.</span> <span id="s801">You know how bad it was in the ghetto -- real bad -- and here, we saw the death -- it’s before our eyes -- whether it’s going to be today, or tomorrow, or the next day, everybody knew that somebody got sick, they took ‘em out, they didn’t come back, we knew that he’s already killed.</span> <span id="s802">We knew already that there was crematoriums in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s803">You were over there, we smelled the smoke and everything, so you were waiting, that day would come, that they are going to take you.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Were you aware at all of the ongoing war efforts outside of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Of course we knew it’s a war between the Germans and the whole world.</span> <span id="s806">Of course you know.</span> <span id="s807">At that time you know already.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: But you didn’t hear anything?</span> <span id="s809">Did you hear anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: No.</span> <span id="s811">There was talking just among us.</span> <span id="s812">Everybody was more concerned how to steal a piece of bread (chuckle) to get something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: What were the names of the major German personnel at the camp -- the commander, the officers -- do you remember any at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: They didn’t come into the camp.</span> <span id="s815">There was a couple times they come in -- a high general, who knows who they were.</span> <span id="s816">But we knew about Mengele when he separated the people.</span> <span id="s817">And then they come in, some other officers -- high and everything -- but who knew the name of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Can you remember any of the behavior or actions of the German personnel?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s820">There was actions, sometimes, when they looked us up and we were staying in a line outside the camps.</span> <span id="s821">They picked some -- a number of people, not too many -- and they said to the guy what was in charge of it, to take these few people away.</span> <span id="s822">What they did with them, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s823">Nothing happened right in our presence, but they took them away.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Did you have any personal encounters with any of the soldiers or officers yourself in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: They didn’t harm you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Sometime -- all the time.</span> <span id="s828">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Tell me about your hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Well what I mean by hiding, you don’t try to push yourself.</span> <span id="s831">You didn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s832">Actually there wasn’t much what you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: What thoughts did you give to your survival, while you were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: I really didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s835">I think more that I going to be dead.</span> <span id="s836">There was no thought that you’re going to survive, really.</span> <span id="s837">There was a daily struggle to survive from hunger, keep yourself clean -- that was the survival.</span> <span id="s838">But what’s going to happen, whether you survive it or not, that wasn’t in my mind.</span> <span id="s839">I didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s840">There was no time to think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: So you didn’t think you would.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: No.</span> <span id="s843">I didn’t think I would.</span> <span id="s844">And people who survived, like me, not because they were heroes or they were strong, it’s just a “mazel” that something happened to them that they survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: You were transferred to other camps.</span> <span id="s846">Can you describe them and the circumstances that led to your transfer?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Well you talk about circumstances, for some reason or another, they send you to another camp.</span> <span id="s848">Who knows the reason why.</span> <span id="s849">And (sigh) you come to another camp.</span> <span id="s850">You do a different kind of work.</span> <span id="s851">And some camps they treat you better and some worse.</span> <span id="s852">By “better,” let’s say, the food what they give you, they didn’t throw it out on the ground.</span> <span id="s853">In one of the camps was an old German.</span> <span id="s854">(Chuckles) He was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s855">He used to be in charge of the food.</span> <span id="s856">And when something used to be left over in the kitchen -- food -- he used to call somebody over there and give ‘em a little bit soup too.</span> <span id="s857">And this same German, he survived with our group together.</span> <span id="s858">And everybody was speaking good about it.</span> <span id="s859">He was at that time, maybe about 65 years old or something, an old German.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: He wasn’t Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: You said you were at three camps altogether.</span> <span id="s863">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: (Sigh) Three camps, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Do you remember your going from Auschwitz to the next camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Oh, sure I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Will you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s869">From Auschwitz they sent us again by boxcars.</span> <span id="s870">We went in the boxcars, because we went to far away.</span> <span id="s871">That was in Germany.</span> <span id="s872">We went by boxcar.</span> <span id="s873">And from Auschwitz we stopped in Czechoslovakia in the boxcars and there was lots of sick people from us.</span> <span id="s874">And the Czechoslovakian people was staying on the railroad, and tried to give us some food and water.</span> <span id="s875">The SS didn’t let them do it.</span> <span id="s876">And then we come in one part of Germany and this was the camp I mentioned -- that Wustegiersdorf camp.</span> <span id="s877">And that was real bad because we was staying right next to the crematorium over there.</span> <span id="s878">And then we already walked to another camp -- to Regensburg over there.</span> <span id="s879">That was days and nights, days and nights, we were walking over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Do you remember how many days?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Oh, I would say a week we walked.</span> <span id="s882">Most of them they killed because they couldn’t walk so much, got sick on the way and everything.</span> <span id="s883">We used to stay, most of the time, in the barns by farmers.</span> <span id="s884">In the night we used to walk.</span> <span id="s885">They didn’t want that the Germans see us in the street.</span> <span id="s886">I have one more camp I was at, but I cannot remember the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Can you tell me about the liberation day?</span> <span id="s888">When and where were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s890">I was liberated in May in 1944 and the little town was Laufen.</span> <span id="s891">That was in Bayern.</span> <span id="s892">That was, I would say, a few kilometers from the Austrian border.</span> <span id="s893">And there was a camp over there.</span> <span id="s894">We were staying in camp.</span> <span id="s895">And then when we walked out from the camp, the Germans start, like I said before, to run out -- the farmers -- this was a farm town -- and they start to yell, “The war is over!”</span> <span id="s896">and all sorts like that.</span> <span id="s897">And at that time the SS just left us in the street and they run away.</span> <span id="s898">So we were walking around and we settled over there.</span> <span id="s899">But the Germans, later on, two days after we settled down, they surrounded us, they wanted to take us to the SS but nobody was there.</span> <span id="s900">That’s how we survived.</span> <span id="s901">We start to settle around in town and there was a camp not far from over there, Ferlausseng -- and most of them settled in the camp.</span> <span id="s902">The Germans run away and the camp was empty over there so they were living in camp for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: After you were liberated, you did live in the camp for awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s905">And then later, we got already homes.</span> <span id="s906">We opened a Jewish center over there.</span> <span id="s907">In fact, I was president over there with a few boys.</span> <span id="s908">And we used to get some clothing from the UNRRA and we used to get some food.</span> <span id="s909">it was a very small town, and people started leaving to look for relatives.</span> <span id="s910">They used to go to bigger towns, but a few did remain over there.</span> <span id="s911">I lived ‘til 1950, when I left over there, in that little town.</span> <span id="s912">My daughter was born there.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: So you weren’t in a D.P. camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Beginning, but later I and another couple -- four guys -- there was a German, he left a house, and we just moved in.</span> <span id="s915">Two Polish guys and I, with another Jewish boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Did you try to look for family after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s918">I did try, but I didn’t expect, from my nearest family, that somebody’s going to be alive, like my mother, the sisters.</span> <span id="s919">I knew they went to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s920">And my brother-in-law, I knew he got killed on one of the transports.</span> <span id="s921">So I was looking for uncles and aunties, a relation, or something, but I really couldn’t find anybody.</span> <span id="s922">So I survived by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Was there any question of choosing Palestine or the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: There was a question, yes.</span> <span id="s925">The reason why we decided to come to the United States was already my wife had a sister here.</span> <span id="s926">She was also in a concentration camp, with my wife’s sister’s husband.</span> <span id="s927">They emigrated to the United States maybe a year earlier from us.</span> <span id="s928">So the decision was my wife wanted to be with her sister together, That’s why we went to the United States,</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Where in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: In Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: You said you were in a D.P. camp for a little while.</span> <span id="s932">Can you describe it?</span> <span id="s933">And how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Well, I was in this D.P. camp several months, I would say.</span> <span id="s935">Four months at the most.</span> <span id="s936">I can describe it that we had enough to eat.</span> <span id="s937">In the beginning the Americans did help us out a lot of food and with clothing and with soap and everything.</span> <span id="s938">We had good facilities to live in it.</span> <span id="s939">It was not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Where was the D.P. camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: In Ferlassig.</span> <span id="s942">Next to Berchtesgaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: What country is that in?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Anything else about the D.P. camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Nothing special.</span> <span id="s947">I really cannot remember those details.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Which organization aided you during this time?</span> <span id="s949">Was there any particular organization?</span> <span id="s950">After the war, was there any agency or organization that helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Well, I would say the UNRRA did help a lot.</span> <span id="s952">Then there was the HIAS.</span> <span id="s953">And there were some other organizations, like from Munich.</span> <span id="s954">I don’t recall the names, but they did help out with food, with clothing, too, until we got back on our feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Can you describe in detail more about your life after the war?</span> <span id="s956">What type of work you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Well, right after the war, after I got on my feet, let’s put it this way, I lived with my present brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s958">In that time, he was with me in camp together.</span> <span id="s959">So my present wife, in some way she did find out -- that was her uncle from before the war -- so she came looking for him.</span> <span id="s960">Somebody told her that he lives over there in Laufen.</span> <span id="s961">So, when she came looking for him, of course I met her over there.</span> <span id="s962">She was looking for her sister.</span> <span id="s963">She didn’t know where her sister is.</span> <span id="s964">And her sister was in Austria -- Matthausen, someplace -- she used to live over there.</span> <span id="s965">Anyway she came back, and we got married in Germany.</span> <span id="s966">It was in 1947, we got married.</span> <span id="s967">In 1948 there was a daughter born to us, and we were happy.</span> <span id="s968">We came to the United States in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: I and my brother-in-law, we used to do business.</span> <span id="s971">We opened a store over there, and we were buying and selling.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: What did you sell?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: We had a place what used to sell fabrics.</span> <span id="s974">A factory, and we used to buy the fabric and we used to sell, and people used to come -- from places that people used to travel from, like Germany to Austria.</span> <span id="s975">That was our trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Do you maintain contact with the Jewish community?</span> <span id="s977">You’re active in the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s979">When you’re talking about Jewish community, I belong to the Adath Jeshurun synagogue.</span> <span id="s980">I go quite often to the Jewish Community Center with my grandchildren, and my children.</span> <span id="s981">And buy some Israel bonds.</span> <span id="s982">(Laughter) and anything else that we do here.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Do you maintain contact with other survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Well right in the beginning, yes.</span> <span id="s985">I know lots of people what were survivors from my town.</span> <span id="s986">We write each other and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: But you still communicate a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s989">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: From the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: From the ghetto, yes.</span> <span id="s992">Survivors from the Lodz ghetto.</span> <span id="s993">We go always on winter vacation together and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Do some of them live here?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Some live here, too.</span> <span id="s996">And some -- now they’re in Canada, already, and some, New York.</span> <span id="s997">They’re all scattered around.</span> <span id="s998">And some died already.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Berek, can you tell me what it has meant to you to be a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: For me what’s meant o be a survivor is a number of things.</span> <span id="s1001">Number one is, I raised a beautiful family.</span> <span id="s1002">I have grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1003">They’re brought up in a real Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s1004">One is Orthodox tradition, and the other is Conservative.</span> <span id="s1005">And that’s what means a lot to me.</span> <span id="s1006">And I’m happily married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Can you describe after your experience during the Holocaust, your feelings about human nature?</span> <span id="s1008">Non-Jewish, Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Well, about human nature, you see, I want to be frank about it.</span> <span id="s1010">The time heals lots of things -- the time, you forget about lots of things.</span> <span id="s1011">You try to forget.</span> <span id="s1012">What I can say for the past is, it was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: How do you feel about Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: How I feel about Germans now and like before?</span> <span id="s1015">In beginning, right after the war, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1016">We received restitution from the German government, but there was maybe two, three years I didn’t want to collect any money.</span> <span id="s1017">I was real bitter about it.</span> <span id="s1018">And one time, I was invited to a Bar Mitzvah to New York to my friend’s, and we were talking about restitution, and I told him I don’t want to take it.</span> <span id="s1019">And everybody was laughing at me, bawling me out.</span> <span id="s1020">So one of my friends called in the middle of the night, a lawyer over there in New York.</span> <span id="s1021">And he told him the whole story.</span> <span id="s1022">So, of course, I’m getting now the money, but that’s what I want to say, how I was, right after that.</span> <span id="s1023">I was real bitter about it.</span> <span id="s1024">And now, the world is different.</span> <span id="s1025">You really change, you know.</span> <span id="s1026">You cannot be bitter anymore about it.</span> <span id="s1027">Naturally you would like to know it’s peace with everybody, but that’s how it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: How about feelings about non-Jews in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: I don’t feel a difference about non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1030">They are all human.</span> <span id="s1031">You have good people, you have bad people.</span> <span id="s1032">Not all Jews are good and not all Non-Jewish is bad.</span> <span id="s1033">You cannot go around and hate.</span> <span id="s1034">Hate doesn’t do any good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Has your belief in Judaism and God changed in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Right after I survived, and I started thinking about everything, what the Jewish people in Europe went through, I really was decided not to believe anymore.</span> <span id="s1037">I was very bitter about everything.</span> <span id="s1038">How it really could have happened.</span> <span id="s1039">But I did change.</span> <span id="s1040">I believe in God.</span> <span id="s1041">I highly believe in God!</span> <span id="s1042">In the Jewish religion, and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: I want to know if you’d be willing to share any photos or remembrances or other things for the purpose of the research?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: I do have photos.</span> <span id="s1045">I have now in my hand.</span> <span id="s1046">But I really would like to bring copies of it.</span> <span id="s1047">I wouldn’t give away the originals.</span> <span id="s1048">So sometime in the future I could probably prepare some of the photos what I have.</span> <span id="s1049">I have a picture who was the leader in the ghetto -- the main German leader from the German side and from the Jewish side.</span> <span id="s1050">I have some picture of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: I’ll have someone get in touch with you about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: And then I have some other papers -- photos -- right after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1053">Some other very valuable papers and everything.</span> <span id="s1054">Somebody can make a photocopy of it.</span> <span id="s1055">A friend of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s1057">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1058">Do you believe that the films and the books about the Holocaust accurately depict it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Yes, I believe in it.</span> <span id="s1060">I tell you the films and the books cannot even tell so much what it really happened.</span> <span id="s1061">It happened more than what the books and the films are showing.</span> <span id="s1062">People cannot tell so much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Are there any particular films or books that stand out in your mind that relate to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Let me tell you something.</span> <span id="s1065">Not everybody the same.</span> <span id="s1066">I personally, when some organizations talking about the Holocaust, or they’re reading books about it, I cannot go to any meetings like this.</span> <span id="s1067">I cannot read a book.</span> <span id="s1068">For me it’s too much painful.</span> <span id="s1069">Certain people can go and see it.</span> <span id="s1070">That’s why all the years I didn’t talk to my children about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: There were a couple of recent movies on television in the last couple of years.</span> <span id="s1072">Did you watch those?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: I did watch them, yeah.</span> <span id="s1074">I feel they had truth.</span> <span id="s1075">They’re accurate, and maybe there should even be more about it.</span> <span id="s1076">Lots of things what happened in ghettos, in concentration camps, but the books don’t even write about it, or the films don’t show about it.</span> <span id="s1077">I feel there should be more talked about it -- for the younger generation, to libraries, or to books and even to films -- that the world should really know about it.</span> <span id="s1078">We are calling ourselves the older generation, and most of our people feel they cannot talk so much about it.</span> <span id="s1079">But the young generation should know about this -- the Jewish young generation and the non-Jewish young generation should know about what’s happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to tell me that I haven’t already asked you that might be important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: From now I think I feel I just don’t recall so much about it.</span> <span id="s1082">I think it’s pretty closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: I want to thank you very much for your time.</span> <span id="s1084">This completes the interview with Berek Latarus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">PAGE 24</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">PAGE 24</span></p></body></html>
