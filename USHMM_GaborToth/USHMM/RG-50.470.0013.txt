But on 29th of April when I get up and went outside I saw that the gate was open and that there was nobody at the gate. So, I took a chance, and I went outside on the main eh street of the of the camp and I walked to ...cough...eh place before the kitchen where usually there were the role were held. I remember seeing when I arrived a big tent over there in which there were clothing, all kinds of thing, you know so I hoped to find that tent and I did find found it, but it was complete, almost empty. Inhale...but still I could find in it a pair of trousers and a jacket. And I took this under eh eh eh eh with me you know and I came back to camp, to the block and by this time, everybody was already outside and there was suppose to a role call. And we assembled the role call and we stood there for two or three hours and nobody came.
Usually there would be an ____________who would come and count everybody and take the eh eh eh eh take that eh eh eh eh the m m m I mean the eh m the d____________eh to higher authorities. This time, he didn't come. Instead, we were order to go into the block and the block was closed and we were told that we had to sit inside locked indefinitely. So this is how the day started, and it really, and eh the only contact with the outside world was through the window. And when we see through the window a strange strange thing happening. Because all of a sudden there appeared a German Gestapo's with canes as a m as a guard. And they were stationed all around on all corners around this area.

And at that time, the the block shook, because eh fighting began. And it lasted about seven hours, terrifying fighting and the all the walls were were shaking and of course we immediately thought that probably this is it. You know that the Americans are coming because we know eh that the Americans are marching toward Dachau. We knew this even eh already when we were march ma marching from emb ___________brook, that they were coming.
Em the fighting eh lasted about seven hours and then it stopped. And nothing happened again. And it took about another twenty minutes before we heard a individual shot ba ba hear and there from all direction and then I look in the window and I see there are a lot of people running towards the fences, prisoners from other block which was not in the quarantine. And I see that some of them are caring guns!
Riffles already, you know. So we eh eh broke through the window outside be because door was still locked you know, and we started running toward the fences and we see that this area was completely already demolished. It took only maybe five minutes, to demolish all the fences, all the defenses of Dachau. And then I see in the front and on the corner you know, American soldier. He was walking. . beginning to cry...and eh eh behind him were eh eh eh other eh eh soldiers and he were commanding the guards that were on the Dachau, Germans, to step, to descend and to surrender. Those who were too slow to surrender were shot immediately, right on spot, you know. So, I saw this and eh eh eh but I didn't venture outside.

It took probably a minute, you know, all the decoration must must have been waiting in storage somewhere...inhale...eh in secret. It was drizzling, rain drizzling when during that eh eh hour of liberation, but half the time went by and it cleared-up.
And eh sun began to set down and there was a glorious eh eh sun-setting but there there were also a very dark clouds on the East.

nothing.
SWB: JOHN KOMSKI: The children. Looks like the the children were the the came eh eh eh with the people who work for for the Ger German farms, you know. Looks like they were born in that time when they were ey brought from the countries like Poland, like Russia, like eh eh eh ______________________this camp was primarily Polish you know. But there were few other than Pole Poles too you know. But mostly were Poles. So they they just get all were born on German soil during that war times, you know, just the same way there were a lot of children who were who were born in concentration camps, in women camps. You know women always have a represent a special problem, problem that I I don't know much about it. But when I read the books of women's camps there were all kinds of specific problems because these were these were women. You know so them thousands of children they were born in concentration camps, so I imagine the same thing also happened when the situation when eh false labor.

They were talking about the war, everybody in this times expect was expect that there would be war with the Russians. Because no body in their right mind eh after the liberation thought that that the Rus that this is the end of the war. You know half we expected war with the Communism. you know.
