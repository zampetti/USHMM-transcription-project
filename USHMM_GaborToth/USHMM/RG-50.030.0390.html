<p><span id="s43">A: My grandfather was a blacksmith in a little town.</span> <span id="s44">It was -- it’s -- it’s not a town, [indecipherable], I would say it’s like a hamlet.</span> <span id="s45">Sukachee, Sukachee, which is in -- in eastern Poland, now that’s Bellarouse.</span> <span id="s46">It’s near a big city, what’s I -- it’s around -- in the Pinsk region.</span> <span id="s47">Pep -- yeah Pin-Pinsk region.</span> <span id="s48">And if -- this was making, you know, in Eur - - in Europe, blacksmithing, it was a big, a good -- good trade.</span> <span id="s49">A -- you know, all the farmers who didn’t have any trucks and cars in this -- the farmers were depending on the transportation mostly.</span> <span id="s50">We -- summertime wagons, you know, horse and wagons, some wintertime sleds.</span> <span id="s51">And this was the only transportation which -- if the farmers mostly, it was ag-agriculture, you know, the -- Poland was agricultural country, especially in the Bellarouses, who I would say is 90 percent agri-agri-agriculture, not much industry.</span> <span id="s52">Most of the industry was located in central Poland and -- and in western part of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Did you ever visit him while he was working as the blacksmith?</span> <span id="s54">A: I didn’t.</span> <span id="s55">He was dead already.</span> <span id="s56">He was dead already, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: How about on your --</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: But, from the mother’s side, I have -- I have -- I have a grandfather what still was living in the ghetto and my grandmother passed away from other side.</span> <span id="s59">She passed away quite a few years ago, yeah.</span> <span id="s60">She had like -- we didn’t know exactly that’s cancer, she had cancer.</span> <span id="s61">And my grandfather stayed with his s-saw -- with his son for that -- for -- for this daughter-in-law and -- and he’s went with -- was still alive in the ghetto and he went with the rest of them.</span> <span id="s62">Yeah.</span> <span id="s63">Now, my grandfather was actually the very few f -- you know, f- farmers in Jewish ca -- fashion.</span> <span id="s64">He was a farmer.</span> <span id="s65">He had a -- you know, he was having a -- a good size farm with -- with 50 milking cows, those years, and there were four more additional farmers, Jewish farmers near him.</span> <span id="s66">Near, you know, where he was located in st -- th-th-the voo -- the -- s not far from the city of Frushanil, about five kilometer and the place was called Sa-Simi-Simanchi -- Simanchi -- I have a map of that.</span> <span id="s67">So there were four more farmers and the other farmers [indecipherable] had more -- 100 cows more.</span> <span id="s68">So all together, there was so much milk.</span> <span id="s69">So was established in my grandfather’s farm, a cheese factory.</span> <span id="s70">And they were making Swiss cheese.</span> <span id="s71">And -- you know, it wa -- and this sa -- selling, the Swiss cheese, they used to -- besides, it was -- I remember it -- you know, big sa -- you know, big sized cheeses and used to go on export, I think, even as they sold it, it used -- was years before the war, when -- and down even to Germany -- Germany is -- you know, and they had the big market.</span> <span id="s72">So, it -- it was -- he himself, you know, they had a concession, some -- it was a father and two daughters.</span> <span id="s73">And they set up, and they ra -- they -- they ran that -- that factory and they made the cheese and they -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Can you tell us the name of that grandfather?</span> <span id="s75">The farmer?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Ofen fidali if afrom Yitzhauk.</span> <span id="s77">Abraham Yitzhauk Kaplan.</span> <span id="s78">He was a Kaplan.</span> <span id="s79">Yeah, he was a very religious man and that’s -- we had, from -- from my mother’s -- from iss side, there was my mother and another sister and two brothers.</span> <span id="s80">There were four children.</span> <span id="s81">My -- I had four uncle.</span> <span id="s82">It means three uncles [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s83">And one of --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: [indecipherable] aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: And one -- one of -- another uncle of [indecipherable] or e -- was -- he had in Proushinna a flour mill, which was -- it was a ve -- this was considered a big, big, good business, because it was -- all the farmers were depending -- they used to bring down to the besides where they used to -- you know, make flour, you know, a flour mill -- flour to supply, there was two more for the city of residents.</span> <span id="s86">It was a big, big business for these farmers.</span> <span id="s87">The farmers depended on those -- you know, these the products from the mill, because they -- you -- they use it for baking, make into a bread and beside them, they not only u- used to make all kind of -- rye, ra -- flour for -- for -- you know, for rye and then -- then flour, for instance, for challah, you know, for all -- for all grades of -- of goods.</span> <span id="s88">And besides the farmers, they had to feed their cattle and then the -- the horses, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">So, it was -- it was considered f-flour mill a very successful business.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: It sounds like you family was very involved in business in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: [indecipherable] yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah it was.</span> <span id="s92">And the [indecipherable], he had, besides the flour mill, but he was in partnership with somebody, he wasn’t alone.</span> <span id="s93">He was in partnership with -- with -- with another -- with another person and they -- besides the -- they had -- the -- th-th-the flour mill, they had a soybean mill, because in -- in the vicinity around Proushinna territory, the farmer’s used to plant soybeans and from the soybeans, besides the -- they used to ha -- make soybean oil.</span> <span id="s94">He had a -- you know, a compressing scr -- compr -- compress the soybean, make s-soybean oi-oil and -- and I know it’s -- it’s -- from the process, the way it was compressed and when the -- all the oil got out of it, of course what’s left over, it was like this ground -- ground from the leftover, from the grain, this was used for -- the farmers use-used that for feeding their cattle.</span> <span id="s95">So nothing w -- it was nothing wasted, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Were you around the -- these factories when you were a little boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Well, I used to -- I used --</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Or farms and -- and -- and mills?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Well, I used to -- yeah, I used to stop there.</span> <span id="s100">I was younger and I used to s-stop there and my older brother, [indecipherable] he was a little older, he -- he went and -- when -- he had -- on vacation time, they used to go and work there, help -- help around, you know, uncle around the mill.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: And there -- like I say, the grandfather, he had the farm, so the son was involved in the f - - in the farming and the son-in-law.</span> <span id="s103">And my father, now, you’ll ask me that -- now my father was a Yeshivablocher, you know, you went to Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s104">And the -- in -- and it happened to be in Proushinna being Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s105">And the Yeshiva, the way it was set up, you know, each -- da -- each day somebody else used to -- you wite -- wite the Yeshivablocher for supper and on the weekends, Friday night, Shabbat, you was invited to my grandf -- my grandfather’s place and eventually he -- that’s where he met my mother, in there, and -- and he married my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: So, you’re saying that he studied and be-because he was away from his family, people in the community would invite him to dinner every night?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: That’s -- ya -- no, th-that’s the way -- that’s the way they’re set up, you know?</span> <span id="s108">We didn’t have restaurants, but that’s the way they set up, yeah.</span> <span id="s109">Each Jewish family invites a Yeshivablocher, you know, when it was a holiday Shabvas, for -- you know, for after -- after the services to come -- come from -- from Shul to come to his place.</span> <span id="s110">It’s -- it’s --as a matter of fact, he had sometimes two or three Yeshivablocher -- to -- my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: What -- what did your parents tell you about how they met?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Well, that’s what -- it was -- it was like steady -- being s -- invited there for the holiday -- for holidays and -- and the -- Friday for Shabbat, you know.</span> <span id="s113">So -- and that’s the way they met and -- and that’s the way they -- when they got married.</span> <span id="s114">Now, you cannot make a -- a she -- Yeshivablocher, you know.</span> <span id="s115">They was going to take him in in the business -- in the farm, you know, in the -- in the farm business.</span> <span id="s116">But there’s a saying, you know, Yeshivablocher, you know, learns, so [indecipherable] you cannot make a -- you cannot make a farmer out of Yeshivablocher.</span> <span id="s117">So -- so what happened, is -- this was, of course, before the first war under the Czar.</span> <span id="s118">And they had a little -- where the little f-factory, besides -- making cigarettes, just to make cigarettes and s -- and sell the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s119">But after -- after the war, when the Polish -- Poland became independent, they -- and what’s - it’s the tobacco and cigarette business was concessions -- you couldn’t -- it wasn’t -- it - it -- it -- you c -- you was allowed, they gave him a concession slip, instead they liquidated, or they took it over [indecipherable] a little factory from the cigarettes and they gave him the right, a concession to sell tobacco products.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: The government took over the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: It was in Poland you couldn’t have.</span> <span id="s122">It was -- it was concessioned tobacco, it was the same thing as liquor, it was concession.</span> <span id="s123">So they gave him half -- they gave him a permit, a concession and we opened the store.</span> <span id="s124">It -- we had the in Proushinna there was -- call it a -- on the marketplace over here, like all the -- you got your shopping centers, but those -- we had that -- we had -- in the center of the city was a marketplace and there were about - a big buildings with probably 100 stores -- you know, little stores and each store -- we mostly, mostly be Jewish merchants.</span> <span id="s125">I would say 95 percent.</span> <span id="s126">So you had a store, you know, like a tobacco concession store, hardware store, a liquor store and -- and a drugstore and you know, the -- with all this -- it’s -- store, the individual stores, selling individual products.</span> <span id="s127">And so he had a store and selling tobacco products.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: What did -- could you tell us what the store looked like?</span> <span id="s129">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Well, it wa -- the s -- the store, you -- it was all in one big building and they -- i-it was s- stores all around, east, west, you know.</span> <span id="s131">It wasn’t really square, it’s mostly I would say, shape like a -- a -- how would you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: A rectangle?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s134">So I would say the -- for some -- like a big 25 -- 25 feet or 25 feet by 15 or something like that.</span> <span id="s135">It’s not too -- not too big stores, because 100 stores in one building, not big enough.</span> <span id="s136">But that’s the way -- all the stores were the same size.</span> <span id="s137">Now we had, especially it was im-important, the textile stores located in this marketplace and because in -- in -- in [indecipherable] -- in Proushinna, you couldn’t go in and buy a suit or buy a pair of pants or buy a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s138">Everything -- you had to buy clothes, you went to a tailor -- tailor made and the tailor made you a suit or the tailor made you a pants.</span> <span id="s139">The same thing, you know, there were leather stores there.</span> <span id="s140">So you went and you bought some -- you know, you went -- actually -- I mean either you went for yourself or da -- you ordered -- you went to your shoemaker, the shoemaker went to -- what you had to buy -- leather goods in the store.</span> <span id="s141">So everyth -- ev -- every store was -- was unique, the same size.</span> <span id="s142">The only -- the only yourk occasions, the textile stores and this was a very exceptional busin-bu-business, in -- in -- in -- in push -- in the market, because all the farmers -- we used to have twice a week, it -- we call it a farmer’s market, where the -- all the stores were located and there was a lot of land -- I mean it wasn’t -- it wasn’t paved like over here, it was all with stones.</span> <span id="s143">It was where the farmers used to come twice a week.</span> <span id="s144">Used to come on -- I think it was the -- like on Tuesday and Thursday and bring down their products to sell.</span> <span id="s145">We depended on the farmers -- so all the vegetables, fresh.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">They sold eggs, vegetables, chickens, even meat.</span> <span id="s147">But most -- it mostly they was coming and selling their -- you know, the ca-calfs to the -- for the butchers, there was so many butchers around, too.</span> <span id="s148">You would -- to buy calfs and cows and -- and ships and chicken.</span> <span id="s149">So everything was brought from the farmers and there were -- they were spread out, I would say was acres, was acres of land around the -- that farm -- that marketplace where they used to, you know, they used to unload the -- and s-s-stay all day til sometimes the products were sold.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about now -- about your -- your home?</span> <span id="s151">Wh-Wh-What are some of your first memories of your parents and the house that you grew up in?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Oh, well, we -- you know, it’s -- Pr-Proushinna was a city, it -- it was not a big city.</span> <span id="s153">The population in general was, I would say, around 12,000.</span> <span id="s154">And the -- 57 percent of the population was Jewish.</span> <span id="s155">So I would say it -- it’s roughly put at 12,000 -- 50 cent -- it probably had -- had at least six or 7,000 Jewish families.</span> <span id="s156">And -- and see, we had a house on Kobrina, you know, [indecipherable] Kobrina, they c-ca -- that’s another city, they call it Kobrine, was a -- a city a-about 40 - 50 kilometers from Proushinna, so they call it Kobrinska -- Kobrinska s-street, number 25 and it was mostly -- this street where we lived was mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s157">There were some Gentiles, but a street full mostly with boys, very few girls on the whole street.</span> <span id="s158">Now, I -- I mean -- I had all my friends next, like a few blocks away, there was four boys and there was three boys.</span> <span id="s159">Now, we had -- in our family, there was two girls, they call it Kobrina street, you -- you know, if there is no girls [indecipherable] and boy street.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: What kind of games did you play with your friends?</span> <span id="s161">A: Oh, games?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s164">Well, we used to -- now you may -- you was asking about a house.</span> <span id="s165">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: We had a -- we had a good size house and in back of our house was a little pound and in - and really many times when it was raining -- of-often -- eff -- in the back were the big garden, very big garden.</span> <span id="s167">And you know, my mother and I and the children, we used to help.</span> <span id="s168">We enjoyed -- we rai -- we raised our own vegetables, that’s -- we ha -- we raised our own, even chickens and ducks and -- and turkeys and -- and in the back of the ca -- back of the -- many times in the back of the garden, there was a little -- little pound and the pound just --</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Pound?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Pound.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Pound.</span> <span id="s173">A little -- like -- like a little -- Q: Water.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Pou -- a pond.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Po -- p-o-n --</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: D.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: P-o-n-d, yeah, pound.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, pond, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s181">And what happens, wintertime, it used to freeze up, so we -- mostly the -- you know, the younger ch -- young -- we were kids, we were skating on the pound.</span> <span id="s182">It was more -- you know, it’s Saturday, it was boys and girls.</span> <span id="s183">Of course that time we didn’t have the skates like here now.</span> <span id="s184">The first skates I remember I had was made out of wood, with a steel wire attached to it.</span> <span id="s185">Eventually, you know, we got some skates, which was sf -- you had to have a special -- special shoe and s -- and the-there -- there was a latch where you attach and -- and then -- and then you had to tighten it up.</span> <span id="s186">I mean, this was a real luxury.</span> <span id="s187">This was already -- we didn’t have those -- like hockey -- hockeys boots and skates [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s188">So wintertime we used to s -- mostly skate and -- and the big sport was soccer, you know, in Europe, where kids -- especially mostly boys, we used to play soccer.</span> <span id="s189">And they would -- so each organize groups and you know, we -- the youth belong -- those years in Poland, we used to belong to certain organization, was a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s190">It was Zionist organization, consisted of so many branches.</span> <span id="s191">It was -- you had the -- you had the Shamir and you had the -- the Haroots and you had the Bitar and you had -- you know, all those -- all those Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s192">Leftist, Rights and left -- lefts -- Leftists.</span> <span id="s193">And girls used to belong to the -- those organizations and we used to meet -- meet in -- in certain halls -- we had a hall and play sometimes Ping Pong and play during the -- the weekend.</span> <span id="s194">And our -- was a big game -- boys, we used to -- we used to play chess in the evening.</span> <span id="s195">Chess was very popular, it -- as a matter of fact, my father was a Chess player.</span> <span id="s196">You learn how to play Chess.</span> <span id="s197">He was a good Chess player.</span> <span id="s198">So I used to play with him.</span> <span id="s199">And so I learned to play then.</span> <span id="s200">We used to get together in the evening and play Chess.</span> <span id="s201">Ch -- and -- but I was -- I had a -- a friend next to us, where we lived and they were -- they had a factory and they made soft drinks and seltzer water and this was a good business too, you know.</span> <span id="s202">Every -- everywhere, especially for the holidays and for Sabbath, you ordered those -- I remember the [indecipherable] where you get those, it was quess -- quess [indecipherable] seltzer water.</span> <span id="s203">Every Jewish family had that.</span> <span id="s204">And beside, they used to make soft drinks, too -- out as -- you know, bottled soft drinks, or -- and they had a radio those years, they had a radio.</span> <span id="s205">And when I was -- this was for -- when I was y-young -- 13 - 14.</span> <span id="s206">So, we used to listen, usually in the evenings, beside playing Chess, you know, there’s -- used to get together, not only s -- couple more friends and after playing Chess, we used to listen to the radio.</span> <span id="s207">This was before -- this was in the beginning -- in the beginning 30’s -- 1930’s.</span> <span id="s208">So we loved especially th-th-the favor of mine and all it was -- we used to put on the Gypsy music from Soffie -- Soft -- the capitol of -- I think it’s from Sof -- Sofi -- Sof -- ei -- onc -- I said Onc?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: [indecipherable] Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Soffi, yes.</span> <span id="s211">The capitol of Hungary?</span> <span id="s212">It’s not Hungary.</span> <span id="s213">Fwonce -- Q: Sofia?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Sofia, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: It was a -- think it’s a na -- it’s Gypsy music.</span> <span id="s217">And the -- after, you know, when it started in the 19 -- 1933 and that -- and as -- you know, when that Hitler came to power and the Nazis overtook the -- the power in Germany and I was very interested in politics.</span> <span id="s218">So, his father, the -- my friend’s father were -- you know, what I’m -- that-- we were visiting and listen to the radio and he was -- well, now [indecipherable], he was a intraer politician.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">And so that’s -- they started, you know, listening to the -- what was going on and the way Hitler came to power and the rise -- the rise of the Reich and -- and eventually, 1935, when they -- they started the -- you know, the Nuremberg laws were -- and I followed that and -- and we were still in Poland, figure well, it was -- you heard about war is going in in Germany, but so you figured, you know, it’s in Germany, but y-you -- you were concerned of course, but you still -- life was going on as normal in Poland, this was still in 1933 - ‘34 - ‘35.</span> <span id="s220">So we -- we still -- you didn’t -- I mean you heard the news, but you tried to -- you tried to -- just to, you know, to listen to the news and -- and you w -- and you were concerned and -- not much, as long -- I mean you f -- it’s far away, we didn’t expect -- you know, you know, what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s221">We lived in Poland here.</span> <span id="s222">We live in Poland.</span> <span id="s223">And eventually, in 19 -- so -- and then it was interesting.</span> <span id="s224">It was a -- a doctor, lived not far from us, too.</span> <span id="s225">And her name is -- is Ola Goldfinich.</span> <span id="s226">Can you imagine a Jewish doctor, a surgeon in those years now and she was the only doc -- Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s227">It wa -- the only Jewish doctor and -- and neighbor to the Goldbergs with their -- they -- they had the factory, the -- the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Did they [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Well, they had the radio there and so I was mixing -- what I’m mixing -- you know, there were -- I mean I’m -- little -- young boy mixing with them.</span> <span id="s230">You know, I was -- they were speaking about the politics for what’s going on -- what’s going to happen and I was sitting there and listening and listening to them and I said, I know wh -- what I’m doing there.</span> <span id="s231">I didn’t act --</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Can you remember anything that they said?</span> <span id="s233">Things that stuck with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Oh yeah, the -- you know -- I -- I remember that they -- they -- that -- well, it was the time -- it -- laws went in -- certain laws in 1935 in the Nurember-Nurember-Nuremberg laws went in and especially that happened in Germany that time that some stores -- the -- they put some law -- laws went in that -- for instance the Gentiles must -- shouldn’t -- were-weren’t allowed to go in and buy it in Je-Jewish stores and trade with the Jews and -- and eventually like teachers weren’t allowed to teach in schools any more or were restricted and you know, and -- so they were concerned too, they were concerned, but you live with that, you just listen and -- and of course that time, if -- if you would know -- if in advance what’s going to happen, you of -- for instance, you could have tried to immigrate someplace for -- I had relatives in -- like in -- in -- in -- in -- in Syracuse and in New York and we would applied -- we would applied for visas in the na -- beginning 1930’s and tried to come -- you know -- come [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s235">You didn’t know it’s going to happen, you know, atrocities.</span> <span id="s236">Y-You know, if this is -- you know and antise -- antisemi -- anti-Semitism in the smallest scale yet.</span> <span id="s237">And so you just lived with that.</span> <span id="s238">You figure well, you worry and it’ll come to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Can -- can you tell us a little bit more about your home life?</span> <span id="s240">Your mother -- what she was like?</span> <span id="s241">And your -- I’m -- speaking Yiddish at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s243">See my f -- my father’s [indecipherable] was a Yeshivablocher, he was very, ver -- he’s -- he was -- he was very educated.</span> <span id="s244">Under this -- before Poland was established, he was -- he was under the Russian Czar, so you went -- you know, you went to the Russian school and was -- became a teacher.</span> <span id="s245">Yeah, he was teaching -- a teacher, not -- not only Hebrew, he was teaching Russian.</span> <span id="s246">He knew -- he knew the Russian language perfect.</span> <span id="s247">And --and my mother was a housewife, taking care of four children and we were pretty good, I mean we would say middle cl -- we were pretty good off.</span> <span id="s248">And having -- like I say, my sadare -- he -- he was very active and he was very active in Shul.</span> <span id="s249">He was -- an-and my sadare and then my f -- my father later on, there were four -- were four in my -- you know, my father got married -- he was all re -- very active in Shul and he supplied -- as a matter of fa -- he supplied for all the Yidding, you know, where he didn’t have -- gas, gas and oil were like over here, so he had to supply lum -- wood, for the Shul, to heat.</span> <span id="s250">So that was -- he -- he supplied for the whole winter and he was a [indecipherable] and he was very religious -- very religious man.</span> <span id="s251">He went to Shul three times.</span> <span id="s252">Shul was not far.</span> <span id="s253">We had in the city about six -- six or seven Shuls in the city, a small city.</span> <span id="s254">And my father just same, he was being a Yeshivablocher, so he was almost a - they call it -- he could have become a rabbi -- smeerhassa rabbi, if he wanted to.</span> <span id="s255">He had the -- he had the capability to becoming that.</span> <span id="s256">But he’s -- he was able to read the Torah, he was reading the Torah so-sometimes a substitute reading the -- you know the Torah, the - and -- and -- and -- and many times they used to really -- wouldn’t waise farther way and the widdow waiser was a hazan sometime.</span> <span id="s257">They -- you know, they used to cantor before the holidays.</span> <span id="s258">Yeah and I went to -- every Friday -- to Shul and Saturday to Shul.</span> <span id="s259">The reason I went to Shul Saturday, because I was -- my s -- my grand -- they say that my grand -- my grandfather, after coming from Shul, he always made a kitty, you know, a kiddish, [indecipherable] mostly, you know, have a full house and I wanted to know, so I went to -- to the -- to the house, because you had wine and they -- he had -- he had wine and he had a lot of -- you know -- and -- and especially the -- the cakes and the -- they call it an torte -- torte duddee.</span> <span id="s260">The -- another honey cake, the -- how did the -- oh, let’s see, he had honey cake and -- and I like the -- the -- the plain what do you call it, what do you call it here?</span> <span id="s261">[indecipherable] So I used to dip, you know, go and dip the -- the little cake in wine, and enjoy and they had bisie ya having and -- and had a small table full with goodies -- full with goodies and the gefilte fish and having and -- even the versnapsam and whiskey always drinking [inaudible].</span> <span id="s262">And they made me seem -- even my father, because it was -- it was re-religious and every S-Saturday, after the meal, when you come from Shul, you go, you have your meal, go home.</span> <span id="s263">We had the Kiddush, then you go home and have the meal.</span> <span id="s264">So, I used to come after the -- after the meal, used to make me to recite a whole sedra from that -- from the five books of Mor, the old sedra.</span> <span id="s265">I said, “I have to do it.</span> <span id="s266">I want to go out, play.”</span> <span id="s267">And no, you got to do it, you got to say it all.</span> <span id="s268">Sedra took about an hour.</span> <span id="s269">And you had the sedra with the -- with the Aftorah -- the Aftorah.</span> <span id="s270">I still can do the Aftorah now.</span> <span id="s271">And my mother was busy, you know, busy with the four children.</span> <span id="s272">Besides, like I say, we had a big, big house and a garden, all the children, we all shared and helped.</span> <span id="s273">The garden we had our own vegetables, we had our own tomatoes and -- and -- and cucumbers and -- and radishes and -- and you name it, we had plenty.</span> <span id="s274">And besides, we had two cows, yeah, because my -- to say that it was, you know, it was a farmer, you know, so which -- you know it -- two cows, I want two cows - to take care two cows and I -- you know, you know, I all -- so the ca -- you got to milk the cows, two -- twice, three times, just -- and you know, after you -- the children -- make sure the children get the fresh -- right of the cow, fresh milk right of the cow.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: When you were growing up, were you aware of any anti-Semitism -- when you were younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Well, it happened to be that I went to the Polish school.</span> <span id="s277">My brother went to the Talbud Hebrew school, that the -- that’s the -- yeah, Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s278">See, we had -- in Proushinna, we had falshala Yiddish Shul, that means like a high school, but then we had a Talbud.</span> <span id="s279">That’s a Hebrew school which is -- they had two -- it’s little bit on the higher standard, as about -- you finish 10, see the sister was there, 10 classes in the Talbud.</span> <span id="s280">10th grade -- for the 10th grade for the Talbud, when you finish the eeb for school, you went to the university.</span> <span id="s281">Something -- yeah.</span> <span id="s282">So my brother, he went to the Hebrew school and I went to the Polish school.</span> <span id="s283">Being in Polish school, there were --</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: When you finish 10, see the sister was there 10 classes in the Talbud.</span> <span id="s285">10th grade -- for the 10th grade for the Talbud, when you finish the eeb for school, you went to the university.</span> <span id="s286">Something -- yeah.</span> <span id="s287">So my brother, he went to the Hebrew school and I went to the Polish school.</span> <span id="s288">Being in Polish school, there were mostly the -- very few -- I would say maybe 90 percent were Polish Christians.</span> <span id="s289">10 percent -- maybe about 10 percent were Jewish.</span> <span id="s290">And so they had, in the system, public school, they had that life had -- a lesson religion.</span> <span id="s291">Like, you know, like -- like history, geography -- a religion lesson.</span> <span id="s292">So they had a priest here to go, so we had to -- you know, the -- those belonged to the class, we went out for that time, outside til the class finished, 45 minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: You left the class?</span> <span id="s294">A: We left the class.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Because there -- you know, there was the pr -- it was mostly -- more -- yeah -- yes, was mostly Catholics, the Polish ca-ca-ca -- the Christian Catholics.</span> <span id="s297">So we left and -- you know, many times you came back, you know, back to -- for your next lesson in school, so you felt a little tension sometimes, you know.</span> <span id="s298">Depends what they were taught, what they were -- you know -- so it was not exception, you know, many times they came right -- you know, they calling you that -- the Jews is got something, the -- Christ killers, they tha -- they were calling you, the Jews.</span> <span id="s299">They probably -- you know, those -- th-those years, it was all, you know, it was probably in -- in the schools, they taught that, they tau --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: They were with the impression they -- that the Jews have something to do with Christ.</span> <span id="s302">So that -- is -- most like -- occasions like tha -- and -- but it was -- I mean -- it was no -- no ph-physical -- you know what I mean, there’s nothing geared -- is ni -- you were protected.</span> <span id="s303">You were protected, you couldn’t do -- I mean to -- many time, the only times you know, there was a fight, a prendfor you played -- Jewish group played soccer with a - well, is -- with soccer up in the [indecipherable] you played with a Polish -- you -- with a Polish group now.</span> <span id="s304">When the Jewish group, you know, won, then the Polish were mad, so sometimes used to be a fight.</span> <span id="s305">That’s normal, you know, you still fight.</span> <span id="s306">So you figure, well, after the game, take off.</span> <span id="s307">Take off right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Run?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Ta -- ta -- stay away.</span> <span id="s310">Stay away and -- and -- but in -- in -- it happens -- it happened one time -- it was a weekend and I was -- we had a river not far from the city where the younger generation, you know, we were young, we used to go summertime swimming there.</span> <span id="s311">And s -- s -- usually on Saturday, there was no -- Saturday was no problem, it -- like -- like I say, there was a lot of Jewish people there.</span> <span id="s312">So, what happened to me one time, from my own s-school, they made a joke, so they -- it was on Sunday and there was not too many, not too many Jewish people there.</span> <span id="s313">So let’s -- let’s take Elman and throw him in.</span> <span id="s314">We -- I had with my clothes, they threwed me in.</span> <span id="s315">They threw me in and they were -- he -- you know, and they -- we were -- so I got -- I -- I got that time.</span> <span id="s316">It’s a good thing I -- it’s a good thing I knew how to swim.</span> <span id="s317">I -- it was not -- Q: But they singled you out because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s319">Because to make it -- Q: But that was sort of a fact of -- of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Well, i-it -- we were -- you know, we were used -- you were -- we’re used to it once in awhile.</span> <span id="s321">We’re used -- we’re used to it -- to that.</span> <span id="s322">But -- but you were safe, because you see, there were some in Poland, in the religious, there was like -- there was always a blacksmith in certain territory, one family lived for this, then were a grocer in a hamlet on a village mostly -- mostly white Russians.</span> <span id="s323">And made a living, lived there runfel by himself -- very seldom, very seldom.</span> <span id="s324">Once in awhile you heard, you know, there was a killing.</span> <span id="s325">Like they say there was killing in -- in -- they killed a Jewish family once in awhile.</span> <span id="s326">But there was no pogroms in Poland.</span> <span id="s327">We didn’t have any pogroms.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: If something like that happened, the first time it happened, did you go home and tell your mother and father and what -- what did they sa-say?</span> <span id="s329">How did they help you understand it?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: You mean when -- when the -- when --</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Oh, like the -- when they called you maybe, a -- a Christ killer -- A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Did you ever talk to your parents about it, I guess is what I’m asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yes, well they knew th -- they knew that.</span> <span id="s334">It’s nothing -- that’s nothing new, because it was not -- it’s probably -- it didn’t happen only in school.</span> <span id="s335">Sometimes -- sometimes it happened in -- in -- on the market, for instance, certain -- certain farmers, if you dealt with them and they didn’t like you, they will -- you know, if you bargain with them, or -- s-so -- i-it’s not only -- it’s not only in school, it was common.</span> <span id="s336">You know, it was common.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Y-You said a couple times though, you said but -- but we were safe -- I mean, you grew up feeling very secure, it sounds like.</span> <span id="s338">Safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Well, if -- wh-when I grew up, yeah, we were safe -- was safe physically.</span> <span id="s340">You know, if I was strong, you know, and got involved, there’s many, many times, you know, you got in a fight and you beat up -- you beat up your friends, you know, your Polish friends, or your Ukrainian, yeah.</span> <span id="s341">But it -- yeah -- as -- as -- this -- you was -- you were safe.</span> <span id="s342">You were used to it to certain -- you know, to certain those a-anti -- you know, anti-Semitic expressions, words, or they’d say -- sometimes you heard, beside Christ killer, the -- they’ll -- they’ll call you a special name like bakram, you know -- up -- you know, Abraham they call you and -- I got a name, so -- it’s not -- we were used to it.</span> <span id="s343">They didn’t call me Yosef or Yushif.</span> <span id="s344">Abramshik.</span> <span id="s345">You know, what do you mean Abramshik?</span> <span id="s346">Abraham or Morska -- Moses, Morska, yeah.</span> <span id="s347">My life was going on like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Did you have friends -- close friends, boys that -- that -- who were non -- non Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Ah, as a rule -- as a rule, we got mostly associated with Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s350">Yeah, mostly.</span> <span id="s351">In school, we do -- in school you met some friends, but they will -- lived in a different section, so you didn’t -- you -- you -- you know, you didn’t -- you didn’t see and talk, only in school.</span> <span id="s352">And like I say, when you played soccer or something.</span> <span id="s353">So we were mixed, yeah.</span> <span id="s354">Well, there were some fr -- we had some friends.</span> <span id="s355">And it was very nice, you got along good with some of them, with --</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: With -- with those at school you would speak Polish?</span> <span id="s357">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: That’s Polish, strict Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: And… When you were growing up, what did you think you might do?</span> <span id="s361">Did you have ideas about what you wanted to say or be?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Real-Really no.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Really no.</span> <span id="s365">It was a -- probably -- I didn’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s366">This is in 19 -- speaking in 19 -- before ‘39, I was I was 17, still at the school, so I didn’t make up my mind yet what I was going to do.</span> <span id="s367">I figured worse, you know, being -- being in the family, you know, having in the business family, an uncle, if I would want to go work for my uncle.</span> <span id="s368">It’s -- my older brother, you know, the spare time worked there, you know, made extra money.</span> <span id="s369">And to go in in farming, I didn’t think about it yet.</span> <span id="s370">I didn’t -- it -- you know, it came, 19 - in 1939 the war broke out.</span> <span id="s371">Nowadays, I don’t know if here when you’re 17 you know what you want to do.</span> <span id="s372">You know, I probably -- I probably, maybe -- my older brother did already -- decided to u -- immigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s373">He was three years older and he applied now -- the -- now I couldn’t do it because I’m -- we were so close with the family, so [indecipherable] and so -- and I was figuring he is going to leave the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">He applied and -- in 1937, for a visa to the United States, to uncle Elman in Syracuse and it was -- it -- you know, it takes time.</span> <span id="s375">If not the war -- if the war wouldn’t break out in 1939, maybe 1939, ‘40, we’d all be in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s378">But sp -- but me, I didn’t want to leave, you know, I was close with the family.</span> <span id="s379">Q: I think we’ll stop there.</span> <span id="s380">That’s an hour and we’re just going to take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: That’s an hour already?</span> <span id="s382">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: I wanted to ask you a little bit about whether or not politics were ever discussed in your household.</span> <span id="s386">Wh-What did your father tell you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Well we -- we were disc -- yeah, we were discussing politics, like I -- I went, like I say, every quite often to the -- my friend who listened to the radio and it was already, you know, ‘35 and ‘36 -- what’s going on -- especially it started in -- in germ -- for -- in -- all -- all happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s388">I knew all the history.</span> <span id="s389">So we were speaking politics with my father.</span> <span id="s390">He was involved in politics.</span> <span id="s391">And I know all the history, like we work and -- then when it -- 19 -- the -- especially the laws, the -- in 1945, the Nuremberg laws came out, that you -- y -- y --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: 1935, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: -- you [indecipherable] you know the Jews, that they -- there was posters on the stores, don’t buy from Jews and all of j -- not allowed to buy and s -- and stay away from -- don’t use the Jewish doctors and schoolteachers weren’t allowed already to -- to -- to teach in school -- discriminated to teach in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Where is this now?</span> <span id="s395">You’re talking about in Proushinna?</span> <span id="s396">A: This was a -- when we heard it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: You heard about it, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yeah, I he -- I heard -- we -- I heard what happening, yes.</span> <span id="s399">We knew all of this -- we all knew all -- all about it.</span> <span id="s400">We’re figuring that time, geez -- well, why do they -- you know, they f -- why -- especially s -- if it’s so bad, why don’t they -- why don’t they take off and -- and -- and get out?</span> <span id="s401">Q: The Jews in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: The -- the -- Germany.</span> <span id="s403">After all, if there is the law -- that’s only Germany, you know.</span> <span id="s404">Don’t do it -- but it’s like the same, it was -- it was -- it was taw -- it was hard.</span> <span id="s405">You live all your life in a country, you build a country, so you figured some did, you know, left, who knows?</span> <span id="s406">Those -- some decided and they left, in the -- you know, already 19 -- 1936, ‘37, before they were able, they left and they had to abandoned, you know, they are -- they have to give up their businesses.</span> <span id="s407">I think in the beginning they were able to sell -- forced to sell.</span> <span id="s408">You know, it’s -- it’s the law changed so rapidly there, that in the beginning they -- they allow you to sell what you had to sell, you know, prac-practically to give it away.</span> <span id="s409">But at least you were able to sell and you were able to get out.</span> <span id="s410">You were able to get out, if you had a place where to go.</span> <span id="s411">So some went out.</span> <span id="s412">S-Some, I know, so in - some German Jews were able to get out in that time now.</span> <span id="s413">Actually where you’re going to go depends -- depends who is going to accept you.</span> <span id="s414">You see, I know that.</span> <span id="s415">My brother, he -- he had a relative, so -- so many here -- relatives here and it took -- it took from ‘37 - ‘39, two years, it was a quota -- everything was in a quota.</span> <span id="s416">Polish quota and -- you couldn’t -- you could -- there were so many, probably, applications, that you had to wait for your next.</span> <span id="s417">And probably the same as in Germany.</span> <span id="s418">Now, there was no place to go -- the only sodo -- the -- some went -- some went to -- some went probably United States, I understand now and they left for the United States, where we were able.</span> <span id="s419">I take it the majority mostly went -- if we didn’t have a Jewish state, we went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s420">Yeah, that’s the only he -- somehow, illegally went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s421">And those who remained, see, I don’t know, either they still didn’t believe -- this was before all the atrocities, before all the -- you know, before all the -- the c-camps and the -- the chambers.</span> <span id="s422">Gas chambers wasn’t heard of yet in those years.</span> <span id="s423">They didn’t know anyth -- you know, nobody knew about it yet, what was going on.</span> <span id="s424">You had some laws -- certain laws went in, okay, that ya -- there in Germany, I don’t know if they had -- in the -- where those -- I don’t think until late -- later they had -- in 1938, I think they had to wear their yellow stars, but in beginning they -- the beginning they -- the laws that -- you know, you weren’t allowed to practice your profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Y-You said that your father was involved in politics in Proushinna.</span> <span id="s426">Te-Tell us a little bit about that.</span> <span id="s427">How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: W-Well, he -- he was -- the politics -- now, the later years already, it was when -- in 19 -- in 1939 -- so we were fortunate that Proushinna -- see, the Germans started the war in -- in September.</span> <span id="s429">The po -- you know, the war started September first, 1939 -- in all the history.</span> <span id="s430">You know they requested, you know -- bef-before it -- before it started the war with Poland.</span> <span id="s431">That’s -- we call it actually when the second war started, but bef -- in 1938, the Anschluss -- you know they took over it -- they took over Aust-Austria without -- I mean the Anschluss, I mean they were invited without -- just marched in and took it over and they -- and they -- they were -- they were welcomed with flowers and they were -- they were -- you know, they were happy that -- and then I know it came with Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s432">You know, I followed all on the -- you know, I followed all the news with the checko -- in Czechoslovakia -- th-they requested the Sudinland -- Sudatenland.</span> <span id="s433">Now, Sudatenland, they choseu at that time, chare with what’s his name, that if -- a foreign -- Foreign Minister from Britain, Chamberlain, he still went down, you know, and you made -- y-y-you gave him alcage -- they agreed, the Czechs agreed to -- to -- to give it up S-Sudatenland.</span> <span id="s434">The reason -- they were greedy, they claimed Sudatenland was -- once belonged to the Germans and there was a lot of German nationals.</span> <span id="s435">So we ke -- you always exclaim, I remember exclaim -- they said they were mistreated and this and that -- the reason given why he wants to give it Sudatenland.</span> <span id="s436">So finally -- you know the Czechs, they didn’t have a choice, so they gave it off bit Sudatenland.</span> <span id="s437">But he wasn’t satisfied and -- and -- and that’s when the p -- you know, the pact was made with -- win Chamberlain and it was -- Czech, the Czech was sold out.</span> <span id="s438">See, Chamberlain thought he’s got a pact, you know, with Hitler.</span> <span id="s439">You cannot make with -- make up with a tyrant -- [indecipherable] a tyrant like that.</span> <span id="s440">And -- and that came back and this, and he says now -- peace is now -- he established peace and the world is going to have peace now.</span> <span id="s441">And the - you see the feather -- the -- the feather of the allies and finally he grabbed all Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s442">So then he started, in 1939, he started with Poland, but was -- speaking about Poland, now Poland was an -- see, they were an -- anti-Semitic later.</span> <span id="s443">In the beginning, when Poland was established, the president th -- th -- it was that Marshall Yusef Pulsutski.</span> <span id="s444">He was the one organized the army and liberated Poland.</span> <span id="s445">Under Pulsutski -- he was -- he was a social democrat iff, you know?</span> <span id="s446">And under him, it was -- the Jews felt safe and they were -- you know, incorporated as -- as democracy, treated as any other -- or a -- you know, there was not too many in Poland.</span> <span id="s447">We had nationalities here, had Poles and you had -- you had Jews and you had some White Russian, Bellarouse.</span> <span id="s448">It’s not like he -- United States, you have so many nationalities, so many groups -- or in Russia.</span> <span id="s449">So the anti-Semitism in Poland actually started after he died.</span> <span id="s450">Now, he was -- it’s -- there was rumors even going on.</span> <span id="s451">I heard that -- that th-the Jews saved P- Pulsutski’s -- you know they put the -- the -- the Russians were after him and they put -- I don’t know if -- where is common, they put a [indecipherable] on him and twirl him and they saved him and he appreciate that -- that’s fa -- you know?</span> <span id="s452">I don’t know if it’s -- you f -- where -- it’s not written in the history, but I -- that’s what I heard.</span> <span id="s453">So he was ca -- he was appreciate -- it was good.</span> <span id="s454">After he died, it -- this was in the late nine -- 20’s -- and beginning 1930’s, that’s when -- you know -- it -- the ch -- it changed.</span> <span id="s455">And what happened influen -- the German influence a lot.</span> <span id="s456">So when the war broke out in 1939, the f -- the Foreign Minister of Poland, Beck -- disappeared and you find out he was a German spy, the Foreign Minister Beck.</span> <span id="s457">Now -- and he was influential to -- you know, they -- they -- they knew in Poland that’s the war -- you know, that the Germans, first of all, they requested -- they requested Danzig, that was the first thing.</span> <span id="s458">This was the -- the international port -- supposed to be -- did belong maybe one time, to Germany.</span> <span id="s459">So, okay, they gave him -- s-so they gave him danz -- they gave him Danzig.</span> <span id="s460">But he wasn’t satisfied.</span> <span id="s461">Then h-he wanted -- he wanted the other part, we are speaking of -- about Poland -- he -- that -- the same thing in Poland, they were on that border with Germany, which -- there -- when Poland was established a independent state, there was a lot of German nationals there.</span> <span id="s462">So he -- je lee -- I remembered it exactly that the pretext that he says, you know the Poles are mistreating the j -- the -- the -- the German nationals and they killed German nationals -- is going to -- that’s why he’s going to just -- you know, is going to try and save his -- the -- his G-German nationals.</span> <span id="s463">It was a bluff.</span> <span id="s464">It -- it was a bluff, it was an excuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: When you felt things beginning to change like that, did you ever consider leaving?</span> <span id="s466">Did your father ever talk about it?</span> <span id="s467">Your brother, like it’s -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: In -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: -- it’s getting bad.</span> <span id="s470">S -- 1938, ‘39 --</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Libby -- you -- in -- this is already -- in nine -- in 1939, see what ha -- see what happened in 1939, we were saved by the -- it’s -- we ex -- the war started and the Germ -- we expected the Germans.</span> <span id="s472">And the Germans came in our town.</span> <span id="s473">They stayed a day or two, was quiet.</span> <span id="s474">You know, we were in -- outside, we had to get water, you know, we didn’t have water inside, running water.</span> <span id="s475">We had to go to the wells, get water ona.</span> <span id="s476">And the army, they -- it was -- it was quiet, he -- nothing, I mean, there was n -- and all of a sudden, overnight, they pulled out.</span> <span id="s477">So we didn’t even know there was a secret pact between -- made between Stalin and Hitler.</span> <span id="s478">And then we realized, you know, finally, you know, that that’s when it started in thir -- in ‘39.</span> <span id="s479">See, they m -- Stalin and Hitler made a secret pact and it promised -- gave Poland, it says, eventually you can -- you know, you can take over Lithuania, you can take over Latvia, you can take over Estonia and then gave him little -- if you want a little territory someplace -- you don’t want -- this is -- between the Czechoslovakia and -- and -- and Romania, they call -- that’s the part -- part of the territory they gave it to the Russians.</span> <span id="s480">And so the Russians came over to our city, that was almost -- you know, so we had from ‘39 to 1941 were the Russians.</span> <span id="s481">Well, under the Russians, when they came over, all right, I mean it was -- the system changed, but it wasn’t like in the Soviet Union, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s482">It -- the -- especially for the professionals, what somed -- was even better than -- than in Poland.</span> <span id="s483">You know, teachers were very important, you know, you could -- they had -- you remained the Jewish -- Jewish schools, the worn clothes, you went to a Jewish school, you went to Russian school, or the Polish school.</span> <span id="s484">They kept, you know the schools -- the schools the way -- the way it was before.</span> <span id="s485">And even -- even the farmers, they -- they didn’t -- they didn’t collectawhy, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Collectivize?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Co -- Collect -- you know, like in Russia?</span> <span id="s488">They -- each farmer still operated and se -- but my grandfather, they took -- my grandfather was too big, so they took -- they took the farm away, yeah.</span> <span id="s489">They took the farm away and they’ll -- they’ll let him manage to -- put it this way, I mean it’s already -- you know, and they paid him a salary -- paid him a -- paid a -- paid him a salary.</span> <span id="s490">So it means -- and -- but the profession -- doctors the same, were working in the hospitals and the -- the private practice and lawyers -- it didn’t change very much.</span> <span id="s491">So we had a normal -- we had a normal life for another two years, for 1939 - 19 -- 1941.</span> <span id="s492">So I went to the Russian school.</span> <span id="s493">So, from the Polish school I had two more years, I went to the Russian school.</span> <span id="s494">And in the Russian school we learned Russian history and there was no anti-Se -- anti-Semitism at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: What was your grandfather’s reaction when the farm was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Well, what ca -- the reaction -- of course, I mean it’s -- not much, I mean the reaction, it - it not much you can do.</span> <span id="s497">They took away the same thing, they took away my uncle’s fa - you know.</span> <span id="s498">They let him work there, he managed the mill at the same -- they took away.</span> <span id="s499">Yeah -- well, we expected the Germans.</span> <span id="s500">It’s -- you know, we expected the Germans and it’s already 1939, it’s already too late.</span> <span id="s501">Where you going to go?</span> <span id="s502">I mean, if the German would come, there is no way you can -- nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s503">It’s too late to go.</span> <span id="s504">So at least you know with the reaction -- you didn’t like it, I mean, but at least we heard what’s going on on the other side of Poland there.</span> <span id="s505">All the refugees from the -- from the western Poland, they were -- they were flooding -- you know, trying to get in to the eastern, where we -- you know, where we were under the Russians.</span> <span id="s506">A lot of them -- a lot of them, you know, from -- from big cities -- from Lódz or from Warsaw, from other cities, they were able yet, in the beginning, you know, to smuggle through -- going through.</span> <span id="s507">And the -- and the Russian accepted them in the beginning, but there was such a flood later on, there was a lot of -- came -- came over with a flood, so the Russians sent them away up sisib you know, was too many, they send them to ser -- to -- to -- not to Siberia, but you know yur, there’s a Azerba-Azerbaijan in Russia, they try to make -- now under the Russian, this was under Stalin, tried to make a Jewish re-re-repull like a Jewish state in Azerbaijan, you had the Jews there.</span> <span id="s508">Yeah, so they went there.</span> <span id="s509">[indecipherable] some of them survived.</span> <span id="s510">So it’s better than -- we heard already, it’s -- it’s -- it’s better than -- than the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Tell us a little bit about your political activities.</span> <span id="s512">You had mentioned earlier that you were involved in a youth group?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Were you still involved in it or were you involved in any other sort of meetings or discussions about politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yeah, I was -- I was all -- I was involved with each -- that’s -- you know, in -- in Proushinna we had two groups.</span> <span id="s516">There was Zionist group -- like I say the Zionist group there were -- there was Shamir -- atsa -- Holatsim and -- and -- and -- and the Istad, there is a lot ou -- ou -- a lot of groups from the Zionists and then there were the Bund.</span> <span id="s517">You know, the Bund is -- this is Socialist groups.</span> <span id="s518">They believed -- they didn’t believed in a Jewish state in Zionist, they believed that, you know, you live in Poland and you -- you got to be citizen of Poland and live in Poland and try to -- and try to get your education, you know, do the best you can and account for your livid.</span> <span id="s519">Yeah, that is the Bund.</span> <span id="s520">They were -- they were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s521">I was -- I was a Zionist and I was a Zionist and I would belong to Bitar, which is -- Bitar is the organization, they call it a leekhood now.</span> <span id="s522">What’s in Israel, leekhood.</span> <span id="s523">I always believed that, you know, if you want to have a state now -- we always -- if you want to have a state, nobody -- you have to fight for state, even if not -- but even if you -- you know, we didn’t have a Jewish state, we have Palestine.</span> <span id="s524">And so even if you tr -- you know, you -- you illegal, you get into Palestine, you have to be able to defend yourself.</span> <span id="s525">City Jews, you know, they settled there, they worked hard in the beginning and on the Kibbutzim and all that and eventually some Arabs, they came -- you know, there was a lot of -- and ca -- there was a lot of pogroms, they -- in -- in pal -- you know, in Palestine before the Jewish state.</span> <span id="s526">Because see, they didn’t believe that -- you know, the Jews that -- in -- in -- what you call it -- in fighting or something -- resisting fighting.</span> <span id="s527">I mean, even if you -- if you leave your home there and you work -- and you -- you know these people work in the swamps, those pioneers.</span> <span id="s528">We had so many pioneers from my town went.</span> <span id="s529">I had a friend, his brother went before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">He was a pioneer, went to -- if we didn’t have a Jewish state, they went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s531">And you -- you know, he survived.</span> <span id="s532">So I was -- I was a little -- they called us -- they did call us in -- in Proushinna, you know, they ca -- that time, you know, with the -- like -- in, say, the brown shirts, you know, brown shirts like, you know, fighters.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: They called you the brown shirts?</span> <span id="s534">A: The Bitar was brown shirts.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Bitar, oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Bitar, you know the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- from the other side -- from the shar -- Ha- Halatsim and Shamir, from the other Zionists, Leftists organization what it was, you know.</span> <span id="s537">They called us -- we are writers, you know.</span> <span id="s538">We have more writers.</span> <span id="s539">Zha -- Zhavit -- you know, if you know, we know the leekhood.</span> <span id="s540">I remember Shaboutinski.</span> <span id="s541">You know for -- Shaboutinski, the leader?</span> <span id="s542">He believed that -- you know -- that you try to encourage the Jews to organized in the [indecipherable] to organize and to defend yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: How had you come to have such strong feelings, though, about that?</span> <span id="s544">There you are, in Proushinna and you’re growing up, it’s pretty middle class, things are pretty good.</span> <span id="s545">How did you get such a strong feeling that you should be part of a youth group that would ultimately believe in fighting for a state?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Well, because -- because first of all my leader -- the leader of my group from Bitar, was the first one -- organized the a -- the resistance in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s547">And he was the first one who left the ghetto, which -- you know, very -- the ghetto was still existing when we were trying, you know, to arm ourselves.</span> <span id="s548">And he was the first for the 10 people who left the forest when the ghetto was still established, four months before the liquidation.</span> <span id="s549">So -- y-you know, when you belong to this group, you got -- you got somehow indoctrinated.</span> <span id="s550">I would sa -- I know indoctrinated.</span> <span id="s551">That’s for -- that’s what we were be living to, you know.</span> <span id="s552">We were living to -- you know, have all of Palestine now.</span> <span id="s553">I remember that -- oh, you know, the song, have all --</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: What’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: They dote lier dade seshelon stador, dote lier dade seshelon.</span> <span id="s556">See, I still remember [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s557">It means we will -- both side of the Jordan not enough, you know.</span> <span id="s558">We believed on the both side of Jordan.</span> <span id="s559">And now, you know, Miss Baggan, you know the Baggan, the Foreign Minister, badaway, he comes from Presque, chestatoffsk brest -- this was where the s -- a-armistice was signed.</span> <span id="s560">The first World War.</span> <span id="s561">It’s not far.</span> <span id="s562">And Proushinna was the region of -- region on the -- from Poland, it were region of Jesht.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Now Baggan was coming down, I was in the Bitar, you know, Baggan was come down in Proushinna.</span> <span id="s564">I redba -- I remember him, you know, eve already, all he is -- Baggan used to come down and we used to -- you know, we were soldiers, we used to march and salute, you know.</span> <span id="s565">Yeah, I was a Baggan man.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s567">Y-You said that you were indoctrinated at the -- tell us a little bit about a Bitar meeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: W-We had meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: How -- what would you talk about and -- and what would happen in those meetings?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: On the -- in the meetings, well, in the meetings it was social.</span> <span id="s571">We were young sometimes, it was social.</span> <span id="s572">What it -- sometimes we’re switched.</span> <span id="s573">You know, my brother was older, he switched from [indecipherable], he says, “There is nicer girls here,” he’ll [indecipherable] go, you know.</span> <span id="s574">This is stuff, we were young yet -- 15 - 16 - 17.</span> <span id="s575">So we sticked with the group and we used to get together once -- once -- at least once a week, sometimes many times you the week, we had a hall, they all -- each org -- you know, in Proushinna, each organization had a hall, used to have meetings, used to have speakers.</span> <span id="s576">Speakers used to come and speak and besides -- and there’s a lot a -- we used to have outside -- what you call it?</span> <span id="s577">a cookout -- you go out in the woods, like a -- like vashomer and went to the woods and -- and marched in the woods an-and not far from Proushinna.</span> <span id="s578">And that’s the way -- that’s the way the organization, they operated, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: D-Did your father -- what were your father -- father’s feelings about you being in Bitar and beginning to have these more political --</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Well, he really didn’t -- he -- he really didn’t care.</span> <span id="s581">He -- my father -- he really didn’t care if I was in Bitar and it wasn’t that, he -- you know, it didn’t -- it -- he knew -- he knew -- I mean the -- the philosophy of the Bitar, what it stand for and all that.</span> <span id="s582">But he really didn’t care, yeah.</span> <span id="s583">But, you see, my father was a pessimist.</span> <span id="s584">Well, he -- well right -- this is speaking about ninet -- when the war already when we were -- the war in ‘41, you know, when the st -- it started June.</span> <span id="s585">This was [indecipherable] the Russians, I t -- like I told you.</span> <span id="s586">Well, normal ristu -- in 1942, in June, 22, when the -- the war broke out with the Russians and the Germans, this was terrible.</span> <span id="s587">Now, they marched the -- first of all -- see, they did, they tricked -- they did the same thing as the Japanese did with Pearl Harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">You know, they have the same system.</span> <span id="s589">They utilize the time when the Russians were on what you call it?</span> <span id="s590">Was a holiday off.</span> <span id="s591">Most -- most of them celebrated.</span> <span id="s592">And that’s when they attacked.</span> <span id="s593">And they -- it’s about -- like I mentioned before, the border between the Polish - German, where the Germans are and here where we were is about press boog, there we were boog for -- press the tob chashed.</span> <span id="s594">The boog divided and out of sight was the Germans occupation, they were in the -- here were the Russians -- were the Russians.</span> <span id="s595">So, I remember it was the ficausit overnight they broke through.</span> <span id="s596">And that they marched.</span> <span id="s597">It was Panzer and tanks and motorcars and no one on foot.</span> <span id="s598">No one -- at -- less that, you know, through the street -- through the city and oh, outside the street for weeks, power -- open.</span> <span id="s599">I mean they -- they -- they already broke through, they [indecipherable] it from 50.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">They -- they broke through right away there.</span> <span id="s601">And we went out, we had to come out, you know, like get some water.</span> <span id="s602">Everybody was afraid what sit in the house.</span> <span id="s603">And the only thing -- they didn’t bother the army, they were marching, they didn’t bother anybody, you went out to get some water.</span> <span id="s604">And the only question is -- they were asking how far is Minsk?</span> <span id="s605">Well, I says, Minsk, you know, I was -- I was outside, too, I says, “Minsk, you just cross the border.”</span> <span id="s606">It depends -- it depends if they are from the -- you know, maybe they are from way back.</span> <span id="s607">I mean -- on the -- w-what -- the -- they probably started maybe the -- from Germany or from some -- western Poland my -- you know, the army.</span> <span id="s608">They says, “Oh you -- you have a long way to go yet, I think, to Minsk, you still got maybe a couple hundred kilometers.”</span> <span id="s609">And it was open, you know.</span> <span id="s610">The tanks were open, they broke the line.</span> <span id="s611">And [indecipherable] Russian, where we retreat.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: The Russians were retreating?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: They were in a panic, a retreated in that -- in that section.</span> <span id="s614">You know, there was three fronts.</span> <span id="s615">We were in the Bellarouse and there was Ukraine.</span> <span id="s616">They attacked from three sides.</span> <span id="s617">Now, the way I understand from -- from brief now a side, they broke through, right away they went through.</span> <span id="s618">First of all, yeah, I didn’t mention.</span> <span id="s619">When the Russian took over Proushinna, they build a big airport -- right outside from Proushinna.</span> <span id="s620">We didn’t have an airport.</span> <span id="s621">A big -- they probably prepared themselve, they -- either they knew, right near the border.</span> <span id="s622">And it was a tremendous airport.</span> <span id="s623">And -- and -- mi-military airport.</span> <span id="s624">And they were flying, training and flying pilots.</span> <span id="s625">So, in Proushinna, all the time was noise.</span> <span id="s626">During the night it was, all the time.</span> <span id="s627">And we got a kick out of it sometime, you -- in the day, you know, you saw the way the planes, you know, they do a -- they -- they -- they exercise in the planes.</span> <span id="s628">I thought, “Gee, they’re going to drop down.”</span> <span id="s629">It was -- you know, it was -- it was -- it’s exciting things.</span> <span id="s630">So they had the -- the Germans bombed the first -- right away they bombed the complete -- whatever airplanes was on the airport.</span> <span id="s631">They destroyed them all.</span> <span id="s632">[indecipherable] see?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Did they bomb Proushinna?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Not -- the Pr-Proushin-Proushinna, on the outskirts they did, but they di -- th-the airport and the outskirt of Proushinna -- so the airport was des -- was destroyed.</span> <span id="s635">And so f -- about maybe a month -- four or five weeks, that’s all, they were marching, marching through the city.</span> <span id="s636">And everybody was sitting, was -- the people were sitting inside, were afraid to go out.</span> <span id="s637">But the German army didn’t bother much.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Just bu -- before you go on, just try to remember that month.</span> <span id="s639">What was going on in your house?</span> <span id="s640">You said a lot of people were sitting.</span> <span id="s641">What was your mother saying?</span> <span id="s642">What was your father saying?</span> <span id="s643">What were you and your brother doing?</span> <span id="s644">In that month where you don’t know what’s going on and the troops are coming in -- the German troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yeah w-well -- well, we were -- we were -- [indecipherable] my mother saying that there is -- we knew -- we knew it’s going to be -- we knew it’s going to be trouble.</span> <span id="s646">I knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Not my -- we knew it’s going to be trouble eventually.</span> <span id="s648">We understood, but not -- what can you do, you know?</span> <span id="s649">You try the best.</span> <span id="s650">And so they -- wike went -- were -- the feeling - what’s -- we still -- you were still in your house, you stilled -- everybody knew the war is going starve it -- everybody prepared a little foods.</span> <span id="s651">You know, food and certain vegetables so last for awhile, whatever.</span> <span id="s652">And there’s nothing unusual happened the first month -- three, four weeks for the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s653">But after, there were some military police took it over, yeah.</span> <span id="s654">And they were used to maybe grab sometimes, you know, certain Jewish people -- younger people, for certain work -- you know, clean up here, clean up there, whatever, yeah.</span> <span id="s655">But I mean there was nothing serious, unusual, serious happened.</span> <span id="s656">But when -- after f -- about a month, then the Gestapo and the SS came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">And they took over control of the city.</span> <span id="s658">So the first -- the second day, what they did is they requested -- they, you know, they had spies from the ca -- the local population collaborated.</span> <span id="s659">Most of the intelligencia from 20 -- I think was 18 people, right away, women and men.</span> <span id="s660">And somebody, you know, a leader from the organization, a leader from the Temple and if they knew somebody’s a Socialist and somebody’s a Communist and somebody’s -- so they selected 18 men and they took him right out to the -- it was not far from Proushinna in the forest and they shot him.</span> <span id="s661">We knew that.</span> <span id="s662">We knew that.</span> <span id="s663">That was the first couple days.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: How did you know that?</span> <span id="s665">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: How did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Because -- how did I know that?</span> <span id="s668">Because it was in ghetto established and we have contact yet with the -- we were free to go out and mix with the Gentiles and they -- you know, there is some religious around there, we knew that -- that, you know, they were shot.</span> <span id="s669">We knew that.</span> <span id="s670">It was no secret, everybody knew that.</span> <span id="s671">They took him out -- there were some witnesses and this was the first two days.</span> <span id="s672">And it -- it took them about -- so i-it -- they used to grab every -- you know, every once in awhile, somebody -- we were still living -- each one in -- you know, I lived in our house, each one was living in their own homes.</span> <span id="s673">It was not a ghetto established.</span> <span id="s674">So they used to grab many times -- I remember the ghetto was established, they grabbed some people to an airport -- I think I mentioned there was a airport near the city and the Russians left a awful lot of -- you know, and they were surprised -- is a lot of clean up -- debris is clean up and they left a lot of ammunition.</span> <span id="s675">And this was -- this was wintertime in -- no, they -- no, th-this -- th-th-they came in and no, that’s not -- I’m sorry, in the winter, this was the 20 -- June the 20 -- June 22.</span> <span id="s676">So, clean the airport and sometimes, you know, you get with -- you know, y-y-y -- depends -- depends where -- which group you worked for.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Were you ever grabbed?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Oh, well, yeah.</span> <span id="s679">I -- we were grabbed.</span> <span id="s680">For instance, what happened up -- now -- we were on the airport, now, it happened to -- you know, there was an engines -- I [indecipherable] an engine.</span> <span id="s681">Big engine weighs 1000 pounds.</span> <span id="s682">And they told me, two people to lift up the engine and put it on the truck.</span> <span id="s683">It’s impossible, how can you put it in?</span> <span id="s684">I mean, you got to have a -- it weighs 1000 pounds, you’re not going to pick it up.</span> <span id="s685">The [indecipherable] for them this was already -- you know, the SS and Gestapo.</span> <span id="s686">Pick it up.</span> <span id="s687">[indecipherable] you know, with a stick, hit you over the head, bang you.</span> <span id="s688">They know you couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s689">F-For them it was -- you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s690">So, they beat you up and that -- finally, you know, they says, well, get a couple more help and put it on on the truck.</span> <span id="s691">This was I -- the first days were I experien -- really experience.</span> <span id="s692">So, but -- you mean -- you couldn’t do anything, you know, if they cat -- they -- they coo -- it was -- most of the time a cleaning up jobs -- only men, they didn’t take any women that time, only men, young.</span> <span id="s693">Mostly the younger men for ca -- all kind of clean up jobs.</span> <span id="s694">And eventually -- you know, started dill -- it came in the laws -- before they stop this, the Judenrat, it came in already, certain decree, certain laws.</span> <span id="s695">I remember that, that you know, you had to -- you couldn’t -- you still free to move outside the ghetto and deal and trade with the farmers if you had a little money and all that and so you couldn’t work already, a Jew, you had before, the arm band.</span> <span id="s696">You didn’t have the yellow star, you had a arm band on the right side, with it says Juda.</span> <span id="s697">So it means, you know, if you went out, they knew that say Juda, out -- you -- they knew you’re Juda, that’s -- they grabbed ou-ouch -- otherwise they’re going to grab somebody by the ow -- how did they know you -- know to grab -- to gr -- to grab a Jew, because it’s -- you have the arm band and they -- a Juda.</span> <span id="s698">Now, of course everybody followed, it’s -- maybe some -- it wasn’t s -- you know, you were scared.</span> <span id="s699">Inc - you -- I mean, you put on the arm band, what would happen if you wouldn’t po -- put on the arm band, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s700">I really don’t know, sometime, if they would discover it, you know, maybe they’ll kill you.</span> <span id="s701">Well, I -- it didn’t -- I didn’t experience that.</span> <span id="s702">And -- but it didn’t lasted, it lasted about a month and they started to organize the ghetto.</span> <span id="s703">So -- and they -- before they organized the ghetto -- before they organized the ghetto, they selected a Judenrat, you know, they selected each -- you know, that’s their -- that’s the system.</span> <span id="s704">And they didn’t install the Judenrat, they told the Jews that you install a Jewish council, that’s a Judenrat, it’s a Jewish council.</span> <span id="s705">Would represent -- represent a different -- different branches.</span> <span id="s706">Now, if we need labor, there you’re going to be, there’s Minister -- you ha -- you’d -- Minister of Labor, you’re going to be Minister of Sanitation and Minister of -- of Police -- Jewish police.</span> <span id="s707">You got a -- you know, Jewish police to -- you know, in the Judenrat to keep order, the Jewish police for -- you had to keep the order, you know, there was some decrees for the Judenrat and if -- for no kind of branches, you know what I mean and that’s the way and so they would select -- they try to select among the Jews, which is a select well -- in the beginning they selected, it was a a-attorney, a big attorney, Schreibman.</span> <span id="s708">All attorney -- well attorney, maybe we sho- should select Schreibman.</span> <span id="s709">And they decided, well, we going to -- they decided to select ha -- he was a big businessman, an educated -- yeah, so they -- It-Itsal Yanovitch.</span> <span id="s710">Very big extra -- you know, respective -- respected Jew businessman, respected by the -- all the community from the poor.</span> <span id="s711">You know, everybody, Poles and all that.</span> <span id="s712">And educated man, so he was the president and then there -- the important job was the -- very important</span></p> <p><span id="s713">--</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: -- ovitch.</span> <span id="s715">Very big extra -- you know, respective -- respected Jew, businessman, respected by the -- all the community from the poor.</span> <span id="s716">You know, everybody, Poles and all that.</span> <span id="s717">And educated man, so he was the president and then there -- the important job was the -- very important job is that -- in charge of labor.</span> <span id="s718">Now, the Germans now, they’re not going to pick this, you know, that’s [indecipherable], so this was the Juden -- they picked the Judenrat, which consisted of -- I think it was 22 people all together.</span> <span id="s719">Each one has his own job.</span> <span id="s720">And they told the Judenrat that we going to establish a ghetto in certain spots -- you know, they picked -- they say the spot is going to be usually they picks the spots, you know, what is slum spots, not the -- not in the center.</span> <span id="s721">Yeah, and they gave you a certain - certain -- 15 blocks or -- or so -- 20 block.</span> <span id="s722">The -- the -- the measurements exactly where the Juderat is going to be and those Jews who lived in -- you know, have their own, stayed there.</span> <span id="s723">All the Jews living outside -- on outside the Juden ghetto, had to abandon their homes.</span> <span id="s724">Of course maw -- there was very few Gentiles living in the slums, there.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">There was eve -- there was some -- they had to abandon -- they had to leave their homes.</span> <span id="s726">And so they were -- established the ghetto and it was -- you know, f-fenced, as all the ghettos -- fenced in with ba-barb wire fenced in.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Who built the fence?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: The Jews had to f -- build themselves, they told us exactly the measurement, the plan.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">You build it.</span> <span id="s730">We had to build it.</span> <span id="s731">We had to pay for -- our labor, of course.</span> <span id="s732">We build it, we paid for it, with all -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Did you -- you help build it?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Well, I really -- I really didn’t help build it.</span> <span id="s735">Th-That -- it -- it -- they had -- they had the -- what you call it, ca -- c-carpenters, they had welders and they had -- I was too young, I didn’t participate in building that, no.</span> <span id="s736">You know, professionals, which it -- and everything.</span> <span id="s737">Well, we didn’t have the machinery, everything would had to -- done by hand.</span> <span id="s738">And that’s the -- all the outside Jews were put in the Judenrat and the Burgermeister came in in town.</span> <span id="s739">That’s the mayor of the town and he had -- he had the -- the authority for the whole city.</span> <span id="s740">Includes already, I mean, his -- the Juden -- already the Judenrat and all that into -- beside the SS and the Gestapo and the other units.</span> <span id="s741">So, when the Judenrat -- we had -- our house was in the ghetto, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s742">Our hou -- because it’s -- it was the section there, somehow -- we had a big house, like it says, a pound way back in it, our house was still in the ghetto, so we remained -- we still remained in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s743">I mean, we remained in our house.</span> <span id="s744">And then, eventually the laws -- right away, laws went in that you have to -- of course you have to wear it -- that -- that you got to wear the yellow star -- yellow star on your chest, on the left side and the back, I think it’s five inches -- you know each one, a child, everybody wear -- to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s745">And everybody had a little -- still -- ver -- food saved up and stored up for -- f-for little, you know, for -- you were still be able befo -- able to go out before the Judenrat was established -- to deal with the farmers.</span> <span id="s746">You know, still free, but you still have the yellow band, you’re still free if you had -- there was no money.</span> <span id="s747">If you had money, it was mostly bartering most of the time, you know, for the farmer.</span> <span id="s748">If you didn’t have any money, so you have a pair of shoes, they gave you -- gave you sa -- they gave you, for instance, some vegetables, whatever or meat or -- or some butter or a little cheese or a suit or [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s749">This was bar -- you know.</span> <span id="s750">This was -- you were -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s751">Bar -- Bar --</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Bartering.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Bar-Bartering.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Trading.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: And -- because, yeah -- trading, because the ruble, under the Russian, the ruble was already not for -- you know, change wasn’t considered [indecipherable] at all.</span> <span id="s756">They preferred tradder -- the farmers -- they preferred tradder -- you want something, they want something valuable.</span> <span id="s757">So -- but when that Judenrat was established, this was already - rationing went in at -- to effect.</span> <span id="s758">They gave you so much -- so much bread.</span> <span id="s759">We didn’t get -- we didn’t get bread.</span> <span id="s760">We got flour.</span> <span id="s761">My uncle’s mill supplied the flour for the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s762">You know, we used to get flour.</span> <span id="s763">They figured out already, excess -- roughly how much flour -- 400 pounds, how much bread is going to come out.</span> <span id="s764">So it was -- I don’t know, 25 grams or so much.</span> <span id="s765">12 - fif - 25 grams of bread, then they rationing and so much little -- margarine for each family and little -- I think it -- they have -- it -- it was over here, what they call it, like oh, Jello type, little Jello, if you want I should, yeah.</span> <span id="s766">And then, right away l-law went in.</span> <span id="s767">They requested from the Judenrat that you have to -- half a million rul -- there’s some -- you know, you have some money -- rubles left, you know, from the Russians, rubles left -- half a million rubles and this was the -- you know, this was as function already from the police, make sure -- you know, i-if they knew that somebody -- you know, rich, poor, you know.</span> <span id="s768">So, somebody didn’t want to -- didn’t want to give the police -- the Jewish police were forced, you know -- you got to give.</span> <span id="s769">Or somebody didn’t behave or somebody -- you know, the police f -- the police function was to keep order.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">We had a lot of -- you know, there was a lot of stealing and -- and when you’re hungry, you know, you know something, you’ll grab -- so it’s got to be, you know, got to be order.</span> <span id="s771">So the p -- the function of police to keep order in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Let me just check this.</span> <span id="s773">You said there was a -- a -- a -- a law established to -- to get money from the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s774">Ho-How much did your family have to give and did you have the cash or did you have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: No, we-well, the rubles, we gave some ru -- I don’t know, it was a half a -- half -- it was a half a million rubles and it was about 10 kilogram of silver.</span> <span id="s776">It was the -- went effect right away and I think it’s a kilogram of gold.</span> <span id="s777">So, each one, you know, in orders -- the Judenrat is -- their function is to make sure that getting from the Jews and each one had to -- you know, had to give -- you know, if you had a [indecipherable] something, yeah, so that -- and besides, any foreign foreigncy not allowed, you know, that’s strict, they were going to -- if they’re going to catch you, you got caught with foreign currency, let’s say a dollar, you know, the death penalty.</span> <span id="s778">For no -- no radios.</span> <span id="s779">All the radios has to be confiscated.</span> <span id="s780">Whoever had a radio, you could not --</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: The radio next door?</span> <span id="s782">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: The Goldberg’s radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: They already had gon -- I mean, all the radios had to be confiscated.</span> <span id="s785">And all -- a Jew didn’t -- you didn’t -- weren’t allowed to own a radio.</span> <span id="s786">You didn’t wa-wa-weren’t allowed to own a camera.</span> <span id="s787">You were -- they didn’t allow to had Bell telephones.</span> <span id="s788">There was not too many telephone, radios and any other -- we didn’t have the -- had like here now, you know, the television and VCR’s and compasses -- I give you example, maps -- a map, a compass, anything like that, yeah, was not allowed.</span> <span id="s789">And had to be turned over and this is -- this is -- the first laws went into effect.</span> <span id="s790">And so it was the Judenrat in general, in Proushinna, you know, was -- did a good job.</span> <span id="s791">You know, they’ve -- some complaints in some other places, in other ghetto.</span> <span id="s792">They were -- they did a good job.</span> <span id="s793">As a matter of fact, they -- it -- it -- they came later on, in 19 -- it was establish in 19 -- it’s ‘41 -- ‘41, from some other cities to learn the system the way, you know -- to learn the system the way we in the Proushinna ghetto operates.</span> <span id="s794">Now, eventually, in late 1941, that was established in June, late f -- 1941, they brought in f -- Jews from little surrounding towns.</span> <span id="s795">Most of the little towns were liquidated for -- on the spot.</span> <span id="s796">You know, there was families, a little hamlet or village, with 20 - 50 - 100 families [indecipherable] you know, the SS, they -- they -- they killed them on the spot.</span> <span id="s797">I know a fact, it is not far from Proushinna, there was -- we didn’t have the statio-station in Proushinna, we had to go -- it’s about 10 kilometers to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s798">We had a little trolley station.</span> <span id="s799">If you want to travel, you had to take the trolley and -- to Dalinavo, which is 10 kilometer and then there was a little town -- little village.</span> <span id="s800">There were about 25 families and in 19 -- in ni -- this was in -- right away, the first -- the first -- when they arrived, the first month, they killed them all out.</span> <span id="s801">In one family, somehow one person from that family somehow escaped and came to our ghetto.</span> <span id="s802">This was -- came to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s803">So, they -- yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: I’m going to stop you there, because we’re just about out of tape, yeah.</span> <span id="s805">You know, every</span></p> <p><span id="s806">-- End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Okay, at this point the ghetto has been established, it’s still fairly early on.</span> <span id="s809">What was a regular day like?</span> <span id="s810">What -- you would wake up in the morning -- at this point you’re still in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Yeah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: What would --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: -- is -- th-the ghetto was established in -- in August fir -- in August first.</span> <span id="s814">Now, that time already, the Germans -- any part -- any di -- what you call it, like we had the Burgermeister, SS, yes and the -- the Gestapo and there was -- there was an airport and there was some warehouses, so it was already a system established, when the Germans requested, for instance, 500 people one place, 200 people here.</span> <span id="s815">So the Juden, you know, they gave an order and the Judenrat supplied, sort of in the morning.</span> <span id="s816">And you know, they kept -- bookkeeping, you know, fair -- it means if I went today, somebody else will go tomorrow.</span> <span id="s817">Now, if I like -- if -- if I like the place where I was sent and they gave you, you know, some places -- they treat you -- they gave you a s -- sometimes a s -- extra piece of bread or something -- little margarine or something.</span> <span id="s818">So you were willing to go and work there and I don’t mind going to work there another day.</span> <span id="s819">But there was some places where -- where you -- they and -- there was a -- a Leaman -- a Leaman commando, which they were in charge of the communication line and telegram and te-telegraph, telegram poles and they were rough people there, where -- you know, nobody wanted to go and work there, because they beat -- you went there and you know, they told you what to do and decided they were unsatisfied, they -- you know, they were beating you up and kicking you for no other reason.</span> <span id="s820">So, you say, “Well, I’m not -- you’re sending me back to Leaman brothers?</span> <span id="s821">I went there yesterday, I don’t want to go there,” you know.</span> <span id="s822">So it depends.</span> <span id="s823">So each -- each gr-group from the Germans, they requested some people and it - they were fair.</span> <span id="s824">They kept somehow a list and -- and you did for -- went to all kind of different work.</span> <span id="s825">Especially it was winter, you know, wintertime the airport, which so big.</span> <span id="s826">On the airport you had to go -- now, they could have -- I mean they could have af-afford and -- and clean the airport miles for the runways with -- with snow plows and bulldozers, whatever.</span> <span id="s827">So the airport, thousands -- 2000, with the shovel -- we had to have shovels and wheelbarrows, so you know, that’s cheap labor.</span> <span id="s828">So we had --</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: So you moved the snow with your shovels?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Well, you know, we get in -- we get in -- that’s in Bellarouse, in the part of Poland, a awful lot of snow and cold -- winter cold and snow, so you had to clean the -- you know and the snow, in that wheelbarrow with the -- for tu -- with the shovel and there was certain spot where you dumped it, you know, half a mile away and -- and they had cheap labor.</span> <span id="s831">So this was wintertime that lasted -- you know, had long winters, sometime for three, four, five months.</span> <span id="s832">And I was working -- everybody was working in the airport.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">And besides, you were sent some -- for instance, to work in the woods, to chop for the Germans.</span> <span id="s834">They did -- that’s the same thing, they had to -- th-th-that’s the only source of - of cooking and so -- and heating sys -- heating.</span> <span id="s835">And so you had to go -- be requested, for instance, a group of a few hundred people to go in the woods.</span> <span id="s836">Now, we were fortunate, we had woods near -- about 25 kilometers, actually -- the nearest part, we had lot of forest.</span> <span id="s837">So, they were sending in groups to the forest and sometimes for -- you had to stay there a week, you know, because it takes 20 -- no, it takes a long time til you go there.</span> <span id="s838">So -- they supplied you -- the Judenrat, with certain rationing and you had to go there and chop wood, cut logs, chop wood and then bring it back to the ghetto and for that -- for the -- outside the ghetto population.</span> <span id="s839">So, this type of work.</span> <span id="s840">And -- and any -- I mean, there is -- there -- there was no labor -- it was no machinery which they had, no machinery.</span> <span id="s841">You know they -- they used cheap labor -- machinery.</span> <span id="s842">Especi -- for instance, now, they didn’t like it -- the Germans were complaining.</span> <span id="s843">They said th-that they -- you know, when they marched in and if -- we didn’t have the roads like over here paved, sarek -- so they were complaining dowse dumb, foolish Polish, they -- and over -- it was muddy, you know, they were go-going through the tanks and the -- you know, through the roads, they made holes and they made a -- it was -- it was a -- a ma -- I mean it was a lot of mud and all that.</span> <span id="s844">He says, “They -- that -- look at the roads they have,” they didn’t like the roads.</span> <span id="s845">Build them roads.</span> <span id="s846">So, we had to -- it was a -- a -- a caroda, that’s a big job, always crush stones.</span> <span id="s847">You know, with a sledgehammer -- you know, big stones, crush stones in order to fix the roads.</span> <span id="s848">So this is -- this is all the time, hundreds of -- you know, which is -- it was hard work and how did you get -- you know, from big stones, you had to crush the stones til you -- you know, you crush them to s-small and that’s the way it -- in roads and then you filled in the roads.</span> <span id="s849">They call it gravel here, like crushed -- you know, they -- when you buy, you know, want it crush or gravel if you want stones graded up some -- some lots over here you see sometimes here.</span> <span id="s850">So this type of work -- all -- all kind of work -- all kind of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: And -- and if you were working, would there be a German supervising you?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Well, a-as a rule, when there was a group, yeah there were -- of course there were Germans, a few German, they would supervise you, yes.</span> <span id="s853">They were with dogs, supervise you.</span> <span id="s854">And even -- even -- see, my brother now, eventually my brother was assigned, in 1942, they needed some -- the -- the -- the mayor needed somebody around t-t-t-the house -- well, they call it a chores boy -- a chores --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Chore boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Chore -- I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: To help him with chores.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Ch -- yeah, ch -- yeah, yeah, chore.</span> <span id="s859">Help him get -- well, he chopped the wood and all this and that.</span> <span id="s860">So he was picked up -- even though, he was picked up every morning from the ghetto and to outside to the Burgermeister and they had them -- had a guard, you know, he had a guard follow him.</span> <span id="s861">He -- he had a mansion, you know.</span> <span id="s862">The law went in, you weren’t allowed to walk on the sidewalk, you had to walk in the -- you know, on the what you call it, drain, in the -- on the road.</span> <span id="s863">On the right side of the road where the drain exists there.</span> <span id="s864">Yeah, and the SS man or whatev -- the soldier, you know, with the rifle, was following on the s-side of -- following and y-you had to walk -- you had to walk in the dr -- on the s -- on the road -- on the right side of the road only, yeah, you had to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: But you’re -- you’re still living at home, in the house?</span> <span id="s866">A: This is still -- this was still in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Our house was still -- was still in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Are you and your brother at this point, are you still going to your political youth meetings, Bitar?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Well, this was already -- forget about -- it was already not political, no, no, hm-mm.</span> <span id="s871">Q: W-Was anything going o-on though, in terms of discussions, among friends, about -- A: Yeah, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Tell us a little bit about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yeah, yeah, we were getting -- we were getting around, you know, in the ghetto in the beginning, meeting in some houses and spend, you know, talking about a situation and -- and playing chess and -- and still -- you know, cards, chess and -- and try to spend the time, see.</span> <span id="s874">The Germans didn’t -- when the Judenrat was established, the Germans didn’t went in in the ghetto too often.</span> <span id="s875">See?</span> <span id="s876">They only came in -- you know, the Judenrat had a special building, mostly on the outskirts, near that opening -- they call it in German, shlotbarn, where the gate opens up and not far from there was a big house, where the Judenrat were -- were located.</span> <span id="s877">And it was a big house with a lot of rooms, you know, it was -- they took up -- rich person lived there.</span> <span id="s878">And the Germans used to have a -- I mean from -- from the -- not soldiers, but from the -- from the leaders, used to come down every day to the Judenrat with requests about labor, we need labor here, labor there.</span> <span id="s879">We need money here, we need always money and in the beginning, see, they could be bribed a little.</span> <span id="s880">The Burgermeister, even the SS, they could be bribed.</span> <span id="s881">They knew, you know, they mer -- you know, that they were looking for something.</span> <span id="s882">If they can get, they going to that.</span> <span id="s883">For instance, we had some selections wintertime in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s884">You know, they want to make sure -- do -- a do -- about the rationing exactly.</span> <span id="s885">If somebody dies -- many people or somebody gets born.</span> <span id="s886">So, they call that a selection.</span> <span id="s887">You had to go out and make sure, check exactly if it’s -- the number’s right or not right.</span> <span id="s888">But they really didn’t know the number and they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s889">This was just -- you know, just fun for them to -- to -- they call it a selection, to go outside, you had to be -- wintertime, summertime or wintertime, go out --</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: This is a -- a counting.</span> <span id="s891">A: Accoun -- for --</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Where they would count everybody?</span> <span id="s893">A: -- s-selection there -- for accounting -- Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: -- and lined up in four lines and they going to -- yeah, they counting -- they counting and then it keeps you -- and they counted and then you know, you freeze, with little children, crippled people, no [indecipherable] to go out and sometimes it lasted for three -- for three or four hours, finish the counting, the -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s895">Counting goo -- you can go back, you know, go back.</span> <span id="s896">Quite often they did that.</span> <span id="s897">They called it the counting.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: H-How would they call you to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Well, they -- a -- well, they call it -- it forced --</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: How would you know?</span> <span id="s901">Was there a bell or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: No, no, the Juden, see, th -- they told the Judenrat that this and this day, at eight -- such a time, and the police and you know the wa -- police and it was postered, you know, on the streets, in the -- certain places and that you had to be out -- be ready for this time, you know, yeah.</span> <span id="s903">This is -- everything, see, organized.</span> <span id="s904">They didn’t -- they had the Judenrat there to organize all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Y-You had said earlier that -- that the Judenrat in -- in your town did pretty well -- A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: If you could talk a little bit more about how people felt about it.</span> <span id="s907">Were there conflicting feelings about what the leaders were doing in terms of cooperating with --</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: I understand your question --</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: -- at some level, with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Well, see, in general they did -- the Judenrat were fair in Proushinna.</span> <span id="s913">There were some complaints, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s914">There’s always certain complaint.</span> <span id="s915">But as a rule, on the average, there were -- they were trying -- they were trying the best.</span> <span id="s916">Now, they were against organizing or something, you know, they didn’t allow that.</span> <span id="s917">They were responsible, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s918">They -- you know, if they didn’t know in the beginning, but eventually, when it came out, you know, later on, when it’s got -- wh-what I come to, the 19 -- in the 1942, I know when they start already organizing.</span> <span id="s919">So they were of course against that, because they were responsible.</span> <span id="s920">First of all, they were responsible for the population of the ghetto and they were the first one we sacrificed.</span> <span id="s921">So, you know, you -- I don’t know, you can blame him or you’re not -- you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s922">It’s a tough situation byegot, tough.</span> <span id="s923">Don’t forget that -- to that -- it was reprisals, it’s not like in normal times you get somebody or you get a -- you [indecipherable] a partisan, or a revolt or somebody -- instigator, you know, they take revenge.</span> <span id="s924">If the Germans find out -- for instance, if I did something or I’m doing something or I’m preparing for something, you know, not only -- you know they were, oh my family, my -- you know, they would get, oh my family and my ga -- uncles and -- and nieces and nephews and who knows how many, you know, responsible.</span> <span id="s925">It’s -- so it was -- it was at -- yeah, it was risky.</span> <span id="s926">It was risky.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: T-Tell us --</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: It’s very, very risky.</span> <span id="s929">You know, you didn’t want to have on your conscience, that you know, you did something on account you saw and the same thing, the Judenrat had a problem.</span> <span id="s930">The same, they didn’t want to -- yeah.</span> <span id="s931">But they didn’t know -- they didn’t know, they didn’t allow.</span> <span id="s932">They lest eventually when they did discovered, late -- in the 19 - late 1942, part of it, it was already too late, you know.</span> <span id="s933">It was already too late.</span> <span id="s934">You know, we had to -- you know, the way we -- the way you -- the -- the organization, we started it, had to be so secret, you know, you had to sa -- that you -- you -- even your own family didn’t have to know what you’re doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: T-Tell us about that.</span> <span id="s936">How -- how -- when did the idea first emerge -- A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: -- in your head, that hey --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Well, I’ll tell you, because I didn’t -- I want to say that in 19 -- when they established the ghetto in 1941, in -- in October -- now, in beginning 1942, they broke into Proushinna ghetto from surrounding towns, from Ginefcare, from Narefkar, from Bielovairsh and Karminitz.</span> <span id="s939">Four cities and then from Bialystok, those were little cities.</span> <span id="s940">And what happened, fortunately, you know, most of the little cities, you know, in 1941 or in 19, beginning ‘42, they liquidated them, you know?</span> <span id="s941">They didn’t bother even establishing a ghetto.</span> <span id="s942">They liquidate them -- they -- they killed them on the spot or they took them out in the woods -- took them out in the woods and killed.</span> <span id="s943">And then, after -- after that, it was of course -- it -- it was too much of a -- they didn’t have the power yet, the -- the -- the manpower, it was a tall job.</span> <span id="s944">And -- so they start bringing in in Proushinna ghettos, of s- some -- those that are fortunate and the ghetto swelled from about -- we had -- like is mentioned, 6000 Jews, 1000 from here, 2000 from here, so finally the ghetto swelled to 12,000.</span> <span id="s945">And some -- some were brought in by trucks from Ginefcare.</span> <span id="s946">And some were marched by foot for 80 -- you know, from -- especially from the Narefkar, the city and we had to take in a family from there and they marched them.</span> <span id="s947">They marched them, you know, the whole -- from, it’s about, I would say maybe 16 -17 kilometers, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s948">So half -- what happened to the cripples, from the children and the -- and the what you call it?</span> <span id="s949">A lot of them you know, lost -- lost parents, air children.</span> <span id="s950">They couldn’t ma -- you know and those who couldn’t make it, they shot them on the spot.</span> <span id="s951">And eventually those who made it, brought them in in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s952">So we heard -- we heard from those people, we right there you know, we had to take in.</span> <span id="s953">You had a big house, we take in some families, you know.</span> <span id="s954">Some says, you know, and they’ve lost a father or lost a -- lost a little baby or lost a child, yeah.</span> <span id="s955">And then they brought in from Bialystok, it’s a big city, Bialystok, so they brought in 2000 from Bialystok in Proushinna, in our town.</span> <span id="s956">Now, I want to mention that Proushinna and the vicinity was enclosed in the Third Reich, they call it, you know?</span> <span id="s957">They incorporated -- fer-favored the Third Reich, we going to be treated a little better.</span> <span id="s958">Wa -- the reason they incorporated Proushinna in the Third Reich, is because we were near Bielovairsh and Bielovairsh a forest, were the famous forest in Poland.</span> <span id="s959">One of the biggest famous forests in Poland, that’s about 60 or 70 kilometers from Proushinna.</span> <span id="s960">And there were famous for certain animals.</span> <span id="s961">And -- and Goering and all the groups and -- and -- and -- and Himmler, they used to hunt there.</span> <span id="s962">That’s the reason -- that’s the reason they incorporated Proushinna and even Bialystok, the certain territory and they call it to the east, Prussia.</span> <span id="s963">Not to -- you know, greater Germany is Prussia.</span> <span id="s964">So comparison with other ghettos, maybe we were treated a little bit in the beginning, better, because we didn’t have those -- th-they call it aktiones -- actions.</span> <span id="s965">The German cou -- you know, aktiones, like in other cities, they requested, let’s see, right away, 1000 inslawnie 2000 - 5000 action and they -- they took them out someplace in -- in certain, you know, ravines and certain places right away and -- even 19 -- in -- in the beginning of the war, and they killed.</span> <span id="s966">So we didn’t have that, we didn’t have the actions, you know, like [indecipherable] hundred and except -- except it was -- you know, every once in awhile, every day there was some casualties, you know we had -- you know, the -- when outsider -- some -- they took people off the stru -- 60 years old.</span> <span id="s967">So it means some -- some were mistreated and some couldn’t make it, some were weak, so there was some casualties.</span> <span id="s968">We had to bring them in in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s969">So we were told, you know, there is two or three, every once in awhile I heard that they brought them in -- in -- in the ghetto and -- for burial.</span> <span id="s970">Now -- now that -- my -- what I want to mention is this, I had an uncle the one -- the one was -- yes, you know, associated in the -- for the farm.</span> <span id="s971">Now, we had a bakery in the town -- in the -- in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s972">We weren’t getting bread, we were getting flour.</span> <span id="s973">And we were the bakery in the -- in -- in the ghetto and the fire -- the fire engine, you know, the f -- the -- it was -- it’s -- in the ghetto, we suppose we were in a fire, you know, the -- the -- we had to take care -- the fire station was in -- the same -- already was -- it was stationed in -- in Proushinna ghetto and with a -- with a hospital in Proushinna ghetto.</span> <span id="s974">So, yeah, we had to speak in my -- my uncle, so he f -- like -- was a farmer and we had some -- a fleet of horses and wagons to -- any time the German requested, for instance, if you have to take down 50 people to the forest or 100 people to forest.</span> <span id="s975">So they told us, they were -- they were the truckers, we didn’t have no truck, they were -- truck had taken the people down the forest and see, my uncle was killed.</span> <span id="s976">They -- they -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s977">The experiments with dogs, yeah.</span> <span id="s978">He was torn by dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Can you explain a little more?</span> <span id="s980">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Can you just explain a little more?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Well, the experiments with dogs are -- one dog -- how long is going to take -- how long is going to take dogs to kill a person.</span> <span id="s983">You understand?</span> <span id="s984">Ah.</span> <span id="s985">You know, th-th-they experiment, they wanted -- they wanted to know how long is going to take one dog or two dogs, finally, yeah.</span> <span id="s986">So, that’s -- that’s a -- that -- that happened.</span> <span id="s987">That made a big impression on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: When did you -- can you tell us a little bit more about when you began to think and talk with your friends about your --</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Well, this happened in 1942, this and then -- see, we had so many brought in in that ghetto, escapees.</span> <span id="s990">Like I mention, they brought some in from different towns.</span> <span id="s991">And then they used to pick some -- find some Jews from the outside -- for instance, and somebody survived and they used to drop him in in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s992">So, you know, we heard all this -- all kind of stories, so I was wondering, you know, they could have killed them, now why did they brought them in in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s993">Some work -- he was telling us that he survived somehow, I know some way and from the little village and he was wandering and they caught him and they put -- the Germans caught him and drop him in into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s994">So, it -- it mean -- it, you know, it reached your mind that understanding there is -- there is something -- you know, it’s a matter of time.</span> <span id="s995">Now, why did they have to bring in -- I was o figure, why did they have to bring in those escapees, those -- those survivors?</span> <span id="s996">They could have killed them, they dropped them in the -- you know, many -- they dropped him in in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s997">We hear -- we heard all kind of atrocities with -- you know, leaving a trai -- you know, leaving witnesses.</span> <span id="s998">So we understood that’s -- you know, there’s a matter of time, you know, it’s a matter of time.</span> <span id="s999">And -- and fortunately, when -- you know, in -- the -- when the group was established, many -- there’s a lot of -- from the group, worked in different kind of places.</span> <span id="s1000">One from our group worked in the woods, sent to cut fo -- for -- you know, for a week and he was work and they left -- you know, they stayed there in the woods for a week and at night Russian couple -- couple -- Russian partisans came over.</span> <span id="s1001">And the Germans slept already there.</span> <span id="s1002">They came over and they says, “Well, if you going to get some arms, we’ll take you in.”</span> <span id="s1003">They were -- it wasn’t organized yet.</span> <span id="s1004">You know, it was -- it was independent groups, I call it, you know it -- it was still -- you’ve -- you’ve -- you could find in the woods that time, criminals.</span> <span id="s1005">You can find escapees from -- pr- prisoners, Russian prisoners, [indecipherable] you know, they went in in the woods.</span> <span id="s1006">They had the ammunition instead of getting, you n -- take a big -- taken in prison.</span> <span id="s1007">And they -- there was all, you know, and -- and there was some -- for instance, farmers for the boys.</span> <span id="s1008">The older people -- the older, they didn’t take.</span> <span id="s1009">If a farmer had couple boys, especially boys, they used to take them to work in Germany, to work on the German farms, because you know, they needed help.</span> <span id="s1010">All Germany [indecipherable] all -- they can use all the -- all the -- all the men -- all the men they could.</span> <span id="s1011">So they can get cheap labor, so they tried farmers, get the -- get those farmer’s boys to shf -- go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1012">Now, they didn’t want to go and they knew the territory, see?</span> <span id="s1013">Thes -- they went in in the woods.</span> <span id="s1014">And -- and they stayed in -- you know, sometimes in the night they’ll go back to their parents and find out.</span> <span id="s1015">So -- so there was all kind of groups there in the woods and this is the first -- the first friend we met at two -- a Russian -- they were Russian Bitar, so they said, “Well, try and get some arms, or get some money and maybe we can, you know, if you get some ar -- money we can -- we’ll take you in some.”</span> <span id="s1016">But, you know, one of the -- the -- from the -- the man from our group was responsive for this man.</span> <span id="s1017">He was responsible for this man I mean, actually one or two or three could have -- could have -- they would have taken it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">You know they would -- they would accept two or three, three or few, not ag -- not 50 or 100.</span> <span id="s1019">But you know, he wouldn’t -- you we -- were responsible were sent for the Judenrat and -- and if you don’t come, you were accounted for the people.</span> <span id="s1020">Now, if you’ll come with three less, what happened to the other three?</span> <span id="s1021">You know, it wa -- it -- you know, it was -- y-you had the moral responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: You’re talking about why you didn’t just run away right then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Well, right then, well, I wasn’t there, but I mean, I could -- if I were there -- Q: No, right, but what I mean [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Yeah, so, that’s -- oh, there’s some partisan in the meantime in the woods.</span> <span id="s1025">so we started - you know, to get organized and try and get some arm and ammunition.</span> <span id="s1026">In the meantime, we know there’s some, you know, in the woods.</span> <span id="s1027">It’s -- this is far away actually, this isn’t avail -- over here.</span> <span id="s1028">Y-You know, this is about 50 kilometers.</span> <span id="s1029">And so the youths, in general, got thats understanding already, you know, because you don’t believe, you know, the human nature.</span> <span id="s1030">You still believe maybe you -- I mean, you have figured -- it’s - maybe you’re going to -- the time will come, maybe the war will be over and maybe something is go -- going to happen, yeah, a miracle’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s1031">You’re not going to have any miracle.</span> <span id="s1032">It was a panic already in the ghetto in 1942, we heard about all the liquidations from the cities, and from the -- from other parts, from little towns and they were bringing them in in the ghetto and leaving witnesses, so we knew what’s was going on and all.</span> <span id="s1033">So they -- every -- every -- you know, a realization that you might know.</span> <span id="s1034">There’s something, you know, there is -- there is -- tricky, we have to -- we have to do something, we have to get organized and -- and we not going to go -- we not -- you know -- when it comes for -- if and when it comes the time, we not going to go.</span> <span id="s1035">Worst if -- even if we not going to get out, we figured we going to even burn up the ghetto or do something.</span> <span id="s1036">I mean, even if you, you know, burn up, let’s -- anybody, whatever ca -- can escape, can escape, wor -- worse scenario.</span> <span id="s1037">So, y -- whoever’s can escape -- they knew already in the ghetto, their -- it -- it co -- you know, when the group was established, now -- later on, when we got established, so it was a problem to get -- how you get arm and ammunition.</span> <span id="s1038">Besi -- yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: But, bef-before we go to that, let me ask you a little bit about -- I mean, did you actually have a meeting and -- with some of your friends and say, okay, we are a group now and these are the requirements to be in it?</span> <span id="s1040">Or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Oh, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1042">We had -- we had a -- we had a m-meetings -- we used to had a meeting and each, you know, from the group, each one worked in different kind of locations and one of our group worked in the warehouses where there were -- you know, there was 50 or 100 people working there, or one or two people from our group worked in the warehouses, where was the Russian leftover.</span> <span id="s1043">And there was ammunition, they were cr -- you know, sorting and crating, to ship it to Germany.</span> <span id="s1044">And so it was a plan that time when we’re -- how to -- you could -- you know, you -- you could s-steal sometimes.</span> <span id="s1045">It’s -- it was easy to hide or something, but the problem is how you going to get in in the ghetto, you know?</span> <span id="s1046">You could have -- it -- it was -- wouldn’t be a problem to leave it outside a ghetto.</span> <span id="s1047">Very easy, because they were working outside the ghetto, you could have buried someplace.</span> <span id="s1048">But it’s -- it wouldn’t be used, you know, how you going to get to it?</span> <span id="s1049">You know, the important thing is to have it with you in the ghetto, you know?</span> <span id="s1050">The -- the -- you know, the arm -- ammunition or whatever.</span> <span id="s1051">So this was a problem, because the ghetto was -- you know, like I mentioned, was surrounded and it was patrolled all the time with -- with police and they had the -- for dogs, Germans and collaborators.</span> <span id="s1052">We had the -- we had the Lithuanians in Poland, too.</span> <span id="s1053">And it was pretty strict, you know.</span> <span id="s1054">You couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s1055">In order, you know, it was you -- you were -- you were locked in.</span> <span id="s1056">No communication with the outside at all.</span> <span id="s1057">No [indecipherable] men and you know, not far -- what I mentioned one still living in h-homes, at 60 colone.</span> <span id="s1058">We didn’t -- we couldn’t send any letters, we couldn’t communicate, we couldn’t travel, we couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s1059">So, we had some people working there in the ammunitions.</span> <span id="s1060">We had some people working in the woods, cutting the woods and we had some people -- we had a engineer.</span> <span id="s1061">We had a secret radio -- a engineer, which he fixed up.</span> <span id="s1062">We had a f -- secret radio, which we can listen for the outside world and you know, and you still worried whofer organized, a little bit.</span> <span id="s1063">But mostly we used -- we used to get the news from the papers, from the German papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">They -- I mean yid -- they let you have a paper, for you can not read it anyway or something.</span> <span id="s1065">So whatever, you know, we -- so we knew a little situation what’s going on on the front, how far they are, yeah, how far they are, yeah.</span> <span id="s1066">But it was a secret radio, so we knew a little, we’d from -- from the public -- Br-British public broadcasting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Yeah, so we -- we knew from both sides.</span> <span id="s1069">So that’s the way the group started at.</span> <span id="s1070">And -- Q: How many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: It was actually -- the group was 18 and three women is 21, and 10 is 31.</span> <span id="s1072">10 from our group was out -- they had co-contact already, s -- in -- in another part, the adkund.</span> <span id="s1073">This was -- what I mentioned they worked chopping the wood.</span> <span id="s1074">Now, this was far away.</span> <span id="s1075">Now, the nearest part from -- from Proushinna was 30 kilometers, the nearest wood.</span> <span id="s1076">This is already the -- the -- they call that the trouknavitch, that’s a mosher forest.</span> <span id="s1077">Now, we got in ki -- a couple partisans got in contact with our group and they used to come in -- the group -- our group already had a secret tunnel, I didn’t even know where it was.</span> <span id="s1078">Only certain -- you know, I -- I know there is -- there is a se -- a secret tunnel going in and out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1079">So, we s -- two part-partisans -- Russian partisans, they used to come in in the ghetto and be in contact with our group.</span> <span id="s1080">And they -- the same, they told us to get organized and try and get some ammunition or money.</span> <span id="s1081">I mean they figured money, they can buy it.</span> <span id="s1082">It was not -- you know, that -- it was still independent groups, it was not -- no organization at all, it was the rule of the jungle yet.</span> <span id="s1083">So you figured, get some money, you see?</span> <span id="s1084">So they -- eventually 10 people from our group, left in Septem -- October, four months before the liquida -- in October, they left already in the woods.</span> <span id="s1085">And they learned a little from those couple partisans, you know, from the Russians, how to make a bunker, how to live, you know, live in the woods.</span> <span id="s1086">So they stayed there and quite often they used to warn -- a few of them used to come back here and in the ghetto, we had contact with them -- used to come in, I still didn’t know how they went in through the secret tunnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">And that’s the way we had -- we had th -- th -- we used to communicate with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Did -- did you have an oath or something, when you did form your group, was there any discussion at one point saying this is why we’re doing it or I swear I will do this or that?</span> <span id="s1089">Was there ever any sort of formal -- formalization to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: It’s very secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Commitment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Yeah, it’s a ga -- it’s ver -- it’s yeah, it’s very secret, very secret and that’s -- nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s1093">It was so secret and so confidential, that you know that your own parents didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1094">Because you -- you didn’t want to -- you didn’t want to - what you call it -- tell even your parents, they wouldn’t sleep nights, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1095">They wouldn’t -- I don’t know if they would object or not object, but you -- you just -- you just couldn’t do it, yo-you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1096">In case it is -- it had to be so secret that -- in -- nobody -- nobody -- nobody knew about this group, about our group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: But can you tell us what it was?</span> <span id="s1098">I mean, did you swear an oath, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Well, we didn’t -- we really -- we -- we really didn’t swear an o-oath, but we -- you know, we cooperated.</span> <span id="s1100">We knew there was some -- you know, there was some cooperation between our group.</span> <span id="s1101">See, my brother was little older and he was more instrumental -- I’m going to go -- this is later on, I would imagine, that -- so that’s the way the group was established.</span> <span id="s1102">So the 10 were there and we were working -- the 18.</span> <span id="s1103">Now, there was some other groups, we didn’t know about them.</span> <span id="s1104">We not -- were not the exceptional, no, there was some other groups.</span> <span id="s1105">You think there are -- you know, we thought we -- we di -- we thought we maybe were the only ones, but there was some groups, eventually we met them -- a gr -- another group, we met them in the woods.</span> <span id="s1106">So, it was very secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: But you did know -- if you were in the ghetto, you knew the 18 people, you could recognize their face and they -- you knew they were part of your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Oh, we knew exactly, I mean, knew exactly.</span> <span id="s1109">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1110">So you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Each one knew exactly.</span> <span id="s1112">.</span> <span id="s1113">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Yeah, we used to get together and this group, the 18, our group, we had our own bunker, tunnel built.</span> <span id="s1115">In case -- but we didn’t have time yet to -- it was -- we found a spot somehow near the border where you can get out.</span> <span id="s1116">There was some farmland and barns.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">It’s easy to -- you know, easy to get -- easy to escape in case emergency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: So, what was your goal at the group?</span> <span id="s1119">You were trying to prepare for, is -- an escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s1121">We were trying -- we were -- actually, we knew that we were going to get -- escape.</span> <span id="s1122">We knew that we’re going to either escape, if -- if not escape -- the 10 are already out.</span> <span id="s1123">Now, we were left to organize some more, you know, til y-y -- it still, it -- it -- it -- in the beginning it wasn’t 18, it was si -- 10, then 12 and then you know, it wa -- another one because we needed -- we needed a -- a -- a carpenter, because in order to smuggle in the -- the rifles, many times it’s too long, we had to break it in half, break the wood off in order to, you know, in order to smuggle in, this is too big and too long.</span> <span id="s1124">So we needed a carpenter in order to fix -- fix the rifle up, yeah.</span> <span id="s1125">And -- and then there was couple from -- in the group and they were much older than I am -- two brothers and they were dealing in -- in -- they were dealing in -- in the -- f -- with lumber.</span> <span id="s1126">And they knew the territ -- Q: It’s easy to -- you know, easy to get -- easy to escape in case emergency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: So, what was your goal at the group?</span> <span id="s1128">You were trying to prepare for -- is -- an escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s1130">We were trying -- we were -- actually, we knew that we were going to get -- escape.</span> <span id="s1131">We knew that we’re going to either escape, if -- if not escape -- the 10 are already out.</span> <span id="s1132">Now, we were left to organize some more, you know, til y-y -- it still, it -- it -- it -- in the beginning it wasn’t 18, it was si -- 10, then 12 and then you know, it wa -- another one because we needed -- we needed a -- a -- a carpenter, because in order to smuggle in the -- the rifles, many times it’s too long, we had to break it in half, break the wood off in order to, you know, in order to smuggle in, this is too big and too long.</span> <span id="s1133">So we needed a carpenter in order to fix -- fix the rifle up, yeah.</span> <span id="s1134">And -- and then there was couple from -- in the group and they were much older than I am -- two brothers and they were dealing in -- in -- they were d-dealing in -- in the -- f -- with lumber.</span> <span id="s1135">And they knew the territory exactly, you know.</span> <span id="s1136">They used to buy logs and ta -- take it down to the sawmill -- we had a sawmill, too in Syracuse -- industry.</span> <span id="s1137">So, they knew the be -- territory a little there, so they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: In Proushinna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: You had a sawmill in Proushinna.</span> <span id="s1141">A: Oh we -- yeah, we had a sa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: There was a sawmill in Proushinna, yeah.</span> <span id="s1144">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1146">So we took now -- and they were cousins to the one from the -- the 10 who left in the woods, it was my Bitar commander.</span> <span id="s1147">He was the first one organizing, you know, th- the 10.</span> <span id="s1148">And his name was Barro Sagell -- Barro Sagell.</span> <span id="s1149">So, mostly I would say there’s a lot of -- majority is -- is from Bitar, would say half of the group is from Bitar.</span> <span id="s1150">Now, he va -- he is the first one that -- from the 10, he left his younger brother, then it went in the ya -- [indecipherable] saloontashur with his wife, he took his wife and he was a mechanic where he -- he belonged to the group and then it was a -- a britebar five, 10 and it was two from Bialystok.</span> <span id="s1151">And th-those from the 10, quite often used to come down in -- wa -- like I mention, in the ghetto and we used to have contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: So you and your brother are doing this and you didn’t tell your parents anything about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: They didn’t know, no.</span> <span id="s1154">You see, I -- like I -- I mentioned to you before, my father was pessimist a little.</span> <span id="s1155">Now, now, by ra -- by wanting -- geographically, maybe he was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">No, he was a educated man, you know, he drew a map, never forget.</span> <span id="s1157">He drew a map and he says, “Boys.”</span> <span id="s1158">We were ta -- no, we were talking some, we was talking about -- th-they didn’t know the -- you know, that we are organized, what we should do or something like that.</span> <span id="s1159">We, well -- planning, wer -- you know, saying some and w-we going to escape, no, we going to do something.</span> <span id="s1160">H-H-He knew, but he didn’t know about the group -- he knew there -- because he drew a map and he says, “Boys, look, here is Poland.”</span> <span id="s1161">And then he drew, you know, you got Czechoslovakia, he knew exactly all the -- Europe.</span> <span id="s1162">He says, “You haven’t got a single country -- neutral country.</span> <span id="s1163">You got Sweden and Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Now, all Europe was already taken.</span> <span id="s1165">Now, let’s -- even if you’ll get out the ghetto,” he says, “you got such a long way to go and you going to be ca-caught,” he says.</span> <span id="s1166">“You know, you get a caught by the -- bun -- by the certain groups, let’s see, unfriendly Gentiles, he’ll -- he’ll give you out,” because it was a prize, you know, to catching a Jew, two kilograms of sugar.</span> <span id="s1167">That’s all.</span> <span id="s1168">If -- you know, if you find a Jew hiding or if you find somebody and you deliver him to the Germans, you’ll get two kilogram of sugar.</span> <span id="s1169">And some went for that.</span> <span id="s1170">Sugar was, you know, a luxury, two kilogram of sugar.</span> <span id="s1171">So he says, “I don’t,”-- it’s a lost cause to him.</span> <span id="s1172">He says it’s a lost cause, yeah.</span> <span id="s1173">So he didn’t vel -- you know, he disco -- he well, I don’t know, he -- bara -- one thing he was right.</span> <span id="s1174">He didn’t know we had connection with Bitar.</span> <span id="s1175">He didn’t know, we didn’t tell him that already and later on the connection, and all this.</span> <span id="s1176">So he’s -- I don’t know to say if it was right or not right, who knows?</span> <span id="s1177">I mean that -- geographically he was -- he was right, because it was -- you know, it’s near, if you have a border, you could have even get out.</span> <span id="s1178">But he didn’t realize, you know, if we did know there is some woods, partisans, we don’t have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Now, if we wouldn’t have the woods near, you know, it’d be a problem, you know.</span> <span id="s1180">Oh, you know, if some -- from Warsaw, other cities, from Lódz, where they going to go?</span> <span id="s1181">You see, they fought, you know, in Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1182">They -- you know, those -- those -- the resistant lasted for month.</span> <span id="s1183">For month they resisted, it’s longer than -- longer -- longer than the -- than the -- the -- than French [indecipherable], French capitulated in -- what is it, in 10 - 12 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: So when you -- I’m jumping ahead just a little bit now, but when you ultimately did leave, you weren’t able -- I mean, were you able to say good-bye to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: No.</span> <span id="s1186">Because, you see what happened is, now we had to -- it was emergency already.</span> <span id="s1187">We didn’t expect that.</span> <span id="s1188">It came an order in -- in -- it was ninete -- in -- in 1943, in January s -- the 27 it started.</span> <span id="s1189">Sometimes a -- the 26th, came an order that -- you know, they gave it the Judenrat that the Jews from Proushinna are going to be deported.</span> <span id="s1190">They didn’t say where they’re going to be deported to Saleesia -- Salessia, a part of Poland and you’re going to be working -- because I -- I didn’t escape the first -- you know, I -- I remember the first night and the men were going to be working, y-you know, nothing’s going to happen to them and bitechis and what are you going to do the -- and the women -- and the -- all the women and the children are going to be near there, all kind of baloney.</span> <span id="s1191">Who in the hell you going to fool, I mean.</span> <span id="s1192">So we got already caught, we could have -- you know, we didn’t expect the date exactly, we could have gone out before.</span> <span id="s1193">See, we could have gone out before -- they said, you know, either through the tunnel, or we could have cut the wire, the same thing or we cut the -- break the fence, cut the wire, what we did, yeah.</span> <span id="s1194">So -- so it -- when it came out the -- they announced it -- the liquidation that time.</span> <span id="s1195">We were trying to break through, our crew.</span> <span id="s1196">And we were followed by a mob.</span> <span id="s1197">It was six o’clock, you know, it was still light.</span> <span id="s1198">And you know, the -- the ghetto was so packed, everybody’s on the street and they see you.</span> <span id="s1199">And, you know, everybody see you, everybody follows you and they figured maybe they going to go through with us.</span> <span id="s1200">And it was imposs -- I mean, they would have -- we couldn’t take a chance, because it would be a lost cause.</span> <span id="s1201">The Germans -- the Germans, you know, the patrol would have discovered it.</span> <span id="s1202">So -- I mean, such a mob.</span> <span id="s1203">So we decided we going to -- we went back to a -- where the bunker, we sit out in the bunker -- with a bunker -- and we tried for the second night.</span> <span id="s1204">But already it -- in the town, already they heard, they knew, you know, the group there, mumb boys -- there’s the group exists.</span> <span id="s1205">It was already going around in the ghetto, so the Germans probably knew -- know there is part of th-the -- you know the -- there’s a group.</span> <span id="s1206">So we hopes they’re -- the -- they -- they were saying wa -- you know, I discovered that when I was liberated, you know, some of them ca -- some of them -- I didn’t even know they were sent to Auschwitz when we escaped.</span> <span id="s1207">We didn’t know where we were going, see?</span> <span id="s1208">And so they -- s-some girls were saying I hope, you know the group survives it.</span> <span id="s1209">And maybe they going to have witnesses telling, you know, the story or whatever.</span> <span id="s1210">So, the second night, we decided we going to fight through, break through, whatever happens.</span> <span id="s1211">I mean, it’s already -- so we still -- we still -- if w-we had maybe about 50 people followed us in our group.</span> <span id="s1212">Some went through with us.</span> <span id="s1213">Older people, older men with children.</span> <span id="s1214">They went through.</span> <span id="s1215">Finally, you know, they -- they -- yeah, th-they discovered -- they did dis -- you know, eventually, they -- the guard went by and discovered that -- you know, it is a mab something went through.</span> <span id="s1216">And we f -- we -- we picked a place, exact -- you know, we picked a place where to go through, so we’ll be near the Christian side where there is some -- not homes, but f-f-farmland mostly with -- with barns, big barns and hay piles around, so you can -- you can sneak it in and as long you get out, you know.</span> <span id="s1217">So you have -- so you can -- you can take off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1219">[inaudible] End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: I want to go back on a couple details -- you jumped ahead a -- a bit, but I’m wondering if you could tell us a little bit about your brother -- your brother very active in this organization.</span> <span id="s1222">And also the planning for getting arms for your group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1224">Okay, now there were some ways of getting in the f -- arms in the ghetto through a secret -- the only way is the secret tunnel, like the first -- the first 10, they cu -- they went in and they went out.</span> <span id="s1225">So they could, you know, you could have send it out with them, a rifle, or bring it in, but in a -- in a bigger form [indecipherable] form, you know, it was a problem.</span> <span id="s1226">Because every time you entered the ghetto by the gate, you were searched.</span> <span id="s1227">All the time.</span> <span id="s1228">You were searched completely.</span> <span id="s1229">You know, maybe you have s- some -- it depends on the guard.</span> <span id="s1230">Certain guard, if he’ll find you carry a little extra bread, so he didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s1231">And if it’s another guard, he’ll stop you for -- you know, if you worked in certain place and they gave you a little extra piece of bread or something else, he’ll let you in.</span> <span id="s1232">You know, they search you pretty -- pretty thorough.</span> <span id="s1233">And it was -- it was tough.</span> <span id="s1234">Very stri -- t-tough to bring in arms and that.</span> <span id="s1235">So you had to, in order -- in order to bring in a substantial amount -- a big amount and to increase the group, you had to f -- have a certain plan, a certain plan.</span> <span id="s1236">So -- see, my brother was assigned, like I mentioned before, to work for the Burgermeister, actually for the wife.</span> <span id="s1237">So, around the house, chopping wood and cleaning and sh -- the Burgermeister’s wife was a -- what you call it?</span> <span id="s1238">I would call her a soft -- nice, soft woman.</span> <span id="s1239">And she f -- and she felt little sorry sometimes, so she’ll give my brother a little extra sometime, to bring it to the family.</span> <span id="s1240">And so we used, you know, the occasion on that, so figure -- one time he asked her, he said the mother is sick and you -- you know, and it’s cold in the house, if you can have certain amount of -- he was chopping wood for them, plenty of wood anyway and -- and if he can take some home.</span> <span id="s1241">Now, in order to -- how you going to bring it home?</span> <span id="s1242">So he says, “You know, I’m going to get a sled.”</span> <span id="s1243">And so she agreed and the Burgermeister didn’t object.</span> <span id="s1244">So we had to build, you know, we had to, you know, it’s not a sled with a ho -- with a horse pulling sled.</span> <span id="s1245">It was a big sled anyway and like I say, we had a carpenter, so we had to fix it up deep enough, make sure it’s got a good bottom, so you can put a good -- quite a few -- quite a few rifles.</span> <span id="s1246">Now, on the ammunition is where it was easy sometimes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: You made a place, a -- A: A double --</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: -- in the sled?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: It was a big sled, with a false back, enclosed, so and shou -- hollowed back.</span> <span id="s1250">So, it’s big enough in the sled, for instance to pu -- to -- two or three people to go in and hide.</span> <span id="s1251">You -- space enough.</span> <span id="s1252">So we’d -- and having those already the group -- boys, ha -- stealing and hiding, laying outside the warehouses, which is not far from the airport and it was not far really, from the Burgermeister.</span> <span id="s1253">Now, he had -- working for the -- for the Burgermeister, he was outside a ghetto, so he had a -- he had a -- a -- a paper, what you call it?</span> <span id="s1254">A -- a card, so he know -- with his picture, so he could move.</span> <span id="s1255">Sometimes she’ll send him there - so he could move himself already outside.</span> <span id="s1256">Once in awhi -- not all the time, once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1257">So, it was made the plan, that -- that is to the sled and he went to the -- you know, near -- near that contraband where it was -- where it was hidden.</span> <span id="s1258">And there was couple, the ca -- from our group -- the couple guys, they had to [indecipherable] quick and load it, filled it up with that -- with the ammunition that time.</span> <span id="s1259">You had a lot of hand grenades, especially they had type -- the Russian type ha -- hand grenades.</span> <span id="s1260">It’s a small and this was very important.</span> <span id="s1261">Yeah, you know, the hand grenades.</span> <span id="s1262">It’s light and -- and you can do a lot of damage with that.</span> <span id="s1263">It’s more than a rifle, we had a lot of this and -- and we had a -- a mach -- a machine gun.</span> <span id="s1264">I know that was -- you know, you know, you -- can you imagine with a machine gun?</span> <span id="s1265">Machine gun -- how you going to smuggle in a machine gun?</span> <span id="s1266">And seven ri -- I think it was seven rifles and a machine gun and three automatic rifles and a lot of ammunition.</span> <span id="s1267">And brought it to the Burgermeister and loaded up the wood on top of that and he had to s -- he -- he -- somehow he had -- he’s -- he is -- his assistant, whoever -- the chauffeur, you know -- you know, the bigger wintertime, say wintertime, he had a car, but wintertime he had a beautiful pair of horses and a sled, you know those -- you see it on the movies sometime.</span> <span id="s1268">Oh, what a beautiful sled and horses and taking them down, wintertime to the ghetto, back and forth.</span> <span id="s1269">And drive the car and the same thing, the SS, they had horses.</span> <span id="s1270">So, he brought it back to the Burgermeister and he loaded up the -- and one of that -- she persuaded one of the chauffeurs to attach to the s -- to the sled with the horses and I was waiting already outside the -- inside the ghetto and here, you know, he had me in leftero for the Burgermeister, they know sled is coming, deal with that, it’s legal.</span> <span id="s1271">I took it right in -- into -- I took it right in.</span> <span id="s1272">This was the time already, we lost -- our house was outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1273">We had to move out or move to my aunt.</span> <span id="s1274">We stayed with this one -- with the -- the widow, the one -- that one a -- the one lost, you know, the husband.</span> <span id="s1275">What I mentioned was killed by the dogs.</span> <span id="s1276">That’s my aunt we moved in.</span> <span id="s1277">We moved in with her and she had four children, four girls and we were four children, eight.</span> <span id="s1278">And we stayed there already and we saw -- I brought in the sled and they were, you know, that time mother and the -- and the “Oh, good,” you know, “wood.</span> <span id="s1279">Oh good, good.”</span> <span id="s1280">But you know, I had to f -- had to find a place for to -- to -- to hide that and they had -- and they -- they had, where they stayed, they had a little barn down there anyways, so that’s the way, eventually, was hidden there, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: In the barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: In the barn was, yeah -- I had to take it in and they didn’t have to -- no one in my family, they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1283">Nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s1284">Nobody knew about it, not even the -- not even the other groups, you know, they knew they wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s1285">I knew where it -- where I put it.</span> <span id="s1286">I knew where to hide it.</span> <span id="s1287">And eventually we used that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: We-Were you afraid when you did something like that [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Afraid for -- in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Well, when you were actually bringing the sled in, there are guns underneath.</span> <span id="s1291">What if you’re found out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Who, who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: You.</span> <span id="s1294">Were you thinking about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Oh, oh, well, n -- it seems to me that time, it was -- we were pretty sure, if -- pretty sure if -- it’s always a risk, but I mean, i-if was permission given and she gave -- the wife gave permission -- if you say the husband knew, because she had to tell the husband, you know, tell -- husband had to tell the chauffeur, she didn’t have much to -- much to sa -- you know, to sa -- have to say -- have the authority to tell him.</span> <span id="s1296">Yeah, the Burgermeister can tell that -- the chauffeur or -- or -- ta -- to do that.</span> <span id="s1297">N-N -- Well, it was risk -- it was a risk, but w-we’re sure that we’re going to -- this -- I think we’re going to make it.</span> <span id="s1298">We’re sure we’re going to make it.</span> <span id="s1299">As -- as -- as -- as long -- as long they going to stop it at the gate and then -- so they see it’s wood, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1300">It was a risk.</span> <span id="s1301">It’s a historical risk.</span> <span id="s1302">It just -- you know, it’s just a mazel, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1303">I mean, it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: A what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: They say Yiddish mazel -- mazel, luck.</span> <span id="s1306">Who knows, call it -- either -- either call it luck or call it -- I just -- grace of God -- I don’t know, the word just to use for that[inaudible].</span> <span id="s1307">So this -- this helped us and we had silver and we escaped the second night.</span> <span id="s1308">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Bef-Before you go to that, I want you tell me a little bit more -- what was the idea -- did you actually ya -- you said you were going to break the fence, did -- what were you going to cut the wire?</span> <span id="s1310">What was the plan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: The plan was, that time, on the second night, that we going to t-try and break through in that spot there -- where we picked out a spot near -- it’s already the farmhouses there and -- and we’ll cut, you know -- you know, we’ll cut the wire and we’ll go through.</span> <span id="s1312">And in case we not going to er -- what -- in case we have to -- dis -- we’ll be discovered, so we’ll fight through.</span> <span id="s1313">I mean, we’ll fight through.</span> <span id="s1314">There’s no other chance.</span> <span id="s1315">So it means, okay, whatever will go through, will through.</span> <span id="s1316">I mean, they patrolled a few -- we’ll fight through, whatever -- we’ll go through there.</span> <span id="s1317">We’ll go through -- we lost -- we lost three men.</span> <span id="s1318">You know, diff -- and like I said, a mob followed.</span> <span id="s1319">Even though a mob followed us, about maybe 50, but I think 30 went through with us.</span> <span id="s1320">You know, some survived.</span> <span id="s1321">Older people, they survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: S-So you told everyone to come at a certain time and you gave everyone a gun?</span> <span id="s1323">I mean, what did -- how did you distribute the arms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Oh, this was -- oh this, they are -- that time -- the arms -- this was a -- about four -- three months before -- it was in a long -- three months before.</span> <span id="s1325">Then we had to stri -- we distributed the arms.</span> <span id="s1326">This wasn’t -- this -- th-the night before -- way before.</span> <span id="s1327">This was about three -- this was like I’m saying three or four months before, when we were -- decided, you know, the you decided that we going to -- that -- that we’re going to do something.</span> <span id="s1328">We had already f -- 10 men in the woods and that’s all we are left is to -- just to organize and get arms.</span> <span id="s1329">You know, get to -- get more organize -- more important was to get the arms, because we were told the -- the few partisans, it says we can not accept you til you’ll get arms.</span> <span id="s1330">Or if -- arms or money.</span> <span id="s1331">Maybe they going to -- the money -- th -- I -- the understanding, I figure they would -- they wouldn’t -- they would take the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Those -- those time it was in the -- on the -- underground movement wasn’t organized yet.</span> <span id="s1333">Each one was -- each group was living independently.</span> <span id="s1334">So, because when we went -- you know, when we went through, we came in the woods, we expected -- we supposed to -- you know, we supposed to meet them at a certain spot there, near and we didn’t meet the 10 people.</span> <span id="s1335">And it was tough and we had to, you know, we had to wander around, almost for days and we couldn’t find them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Well, before we go on to that -- A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: I’m just trying to figure out, once you had all the arms in the barn -- A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: -- over those couple months, did you little by little say here, here’s your rifle, here’s your gr -- how did -- how did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: No, the group, it was all, yeah -- Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: It was all the -- yeah, it was all distributed to the group -- to the commander of the group.</span> <span id="s1341">We had a commander of the group, which -- he was Laser Israleet, his name and he was - served in Polish army and he was a officer, matter of f -- matter of fact, the Polish army.</span> <span id="s1342">And he somehow escaped, you know, wasn’t taken prison.</span> <span id="s1343">And so that’s why we picked him as -- as the commander, because he’s a military man.</span> <span id="s1344">He were much older and he took his wife with him.</span> <span id="s1345">He brought -- which we -- which was not allowed.</span> <span id="s1346">We didn’t even -- we didn’t consider that, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1347">We only knew -- that’s where the three women is involved, one is his wife.</span> <span id="s1348">All right, so if he brought -- he brought his wife with him -- in the bunker, by the way.</span> <span id="s1349">So he sticked out already, so sh -- yeah, but -- but the original plan was only, mostly men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1351">And, so when you left that night, when you packed to go, what were you carrying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: What --</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: The night that you escaped, what did you pack?</span> <span id="s1354">Did you take anything?</span> <span id="s1355">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Or did you just have your coat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: We sat -- we sat in the -- in the bunker and we went through, we had -- yeah, we had winter clothes there and we took certain amount, I mean we were prepared, you know, they call -- the -- over here you toast the br-bread, for instance, to last f -- to last for few days, it means when you -- we didn’t toasted that -- what actually it was always stale bread, ha -- you know what I mean, har -- we took a little bread, a little to -- food to last for a couple days, yeah.</span> <span id="s1358">But he was later -- Commandeer Laser, he was smart, he’s a miltil -- you know, military man.</span> <span id="s1359">He had prepared himself pretty good with his wife.</span> <span id="s1360">But, I mean know what -- you know, I mean they knew.</span> <span id="s1361">He even had the -- what you call it, the military, where you carry that -- that can f -- for drinks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: A canteen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Canteen, yeah.</span> <span id="s1364">A canteen.</span> <span id="s1365">We didn’t have a canteen, he had.</span> <span id="s1366">Ah, so some -- so he’ll last - so he’ll last him a little bit more.</span> <span id="s1367">So act -- we didn’t have too much, ac -- we escape with a little -- little.</span> <span id="s1368">We did have clothes, was important.</span> <span id="s1369">Had warm clothes, was wintertime, was very cold.</span> <span id="s1370">And make sure you have good boots.</span> <span id="s1371">And -- and a hat, a good hat.</span> <span id="s1372">Different kind of clothes, it was -- it was no -- you know, you know -- everybody -- everybody looks like Santa Claus or something here different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Like Santa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Wh -- Do you think your mother and your father suspected that you were getting ready to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Well, they -- we -- my father is another story.</span> <span id="s1377">I didn’t mention it there in the paper.</span> <span id="s1378">With my father is another story.</span> <span id="s1379">Now, if you want to know it, my father, will have to tell you exactly what happened my father.</span> <span id="s1380">You want that?</span> <span id="s1381">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1382">Now, in -- this was 19 -- January, 1943, October.</span> <span id="s1383">October, 1942, we got the same -- an order fr-from the SS to the Judenrat to be ready, you’re going to be taken to exp -- on transport.</span> <span id="s1384">Now, be ready at certain time, eight o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1385">I -- I mention we didn’t have the station near Proushinna?</span> <span id="s1386">It was 10 kilometer -- 10 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s1387">And we knew that’s the liquidation.</span> <span id="s1388">Somehow, was rescinded.</span> <span id="s1389">Either -- I don’t know, the per -- Burgermeister paid off, it’s rescinded.</span> <span id="s1390">The Judenrat decided that night, when the order came -- I don’t say all the Judenrat, most of the Judenrat decided to commit suicide, see?</span> <span id="s1391">And this doctor, I s -- I imagine, the Jewish doctor, she belonged to the Judenrat and she supplied pills for that -- you know, she had pills.</span> <span id="s1392">We figured, you know -- and they went to a big house -- not all the Judenrat, maybe -- the Judenrat was 22, maybe about 10 or 12 decided to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1393">And -- and they were -- it wasn’t successful.</span> <span id="s1394">Yeah, I know it was, I remember that -- I remember that they took pills and then they put their lid -- the chimney and you know, they clo -- they made a fire -- firewood and they didn’t open the chimney and they thought, you know, with carbon monoxide, somehow -- and only two died.</span> <span id="s1395">Only two died.</span> <span id="s1396">See, my father committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1397">This -- this is the same night.</span> <span id="s1398">See, he knew what was going on with the Judenrat, but he -- see, he hanged himself.</span> <span id="s1399">So, at least we had three, four months left.</span> <span id="s1400">We buried them, yet you know, in the spot in the ba -- you know and we still have time to say Kaddish and yeah.</span> <span id="s1401">That’s what happened to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Were you living at home when that happened?</span> <span id="s1405">A: This was -- we still were in our ho --</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: In the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: -- we still yeah, this was -- next month we moved to our aunt.</span> <span id="s1408">It happen about -- about maybe two months when -- you -- you know, two -- you know, both, you know, umwannus widows.</span> <span id="s1409">The three widows, yeah.</span> <span id="s1410">That happened.</span> <span id="s1411">I didn’t want to write this in the paper, but this is -- this is the story.</span> <span id="s1412">So, from -- so eanse we knew, he said all along, he says he is not going to -- he is going to -- you know, he is going to -- not going to be left -- go to the transports, you [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1413">Yeah, so he -- at least he had a little, I mean, if we had time to say -- in the same -- in the same house we stayed with my aunt, we had the meeann you know and -- and that’s -- that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: I’ve been meaning to actually ask you the name of your aunt’s husband who was killed by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: What -- what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: His name -- the last name, Maysha Shershefski.</span> <span id="s1418">Maysha Shershefski.</span> <span id="s1419">Q: And it was your mother’s sister’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: My mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s1421">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: And they had four girls and in the range about -- about the same, this -- the older girl, you know, probably was my -- maybe a little bit older than my brother and the same -- she probably was already 23 or 24 and 20 and maybe 17 - 15 and a smaller one, four girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">And I had two sisters and two sis -- shane -- my two sister, yes, so they -- they all went to the same transport the same day, probably.</span> <span id="s1424">I don’t know it.</span> <span id="s1425">I think it was the third.</span> <span id="s1426">You know, they transported -- four days took that to transport the ta -- 12,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1427">They probably didn’t have the -- the -- you know, f -- wagons and you know.</span> <span id="s1428">So it was 3000.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">They divide it when it came, yeah -- this is January the third, 20’s -- 28 - 29 -- the 30th.</span> <span id="s1430">No, it’s 27 - 28 - 29 and 30th, so -- so it was divided the city on four sections and they says east side, each day 3000 and now it was prepared, you know, you have to go to the station, we don’t have a station [indecipherable]10 miles.</span> <span id="s1431">So farmers were already lined up for miles inside the ghetto and outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1432">It came the order that you got to be, eight o’clock in the morning, to be ready, that’s all is allowed to take a backpack, certain amount.</span> <span id="s1433">It says, each one take a backpack.</span> <span id="s1434">So it means get your better, whatever, because you didn’t see the backpack anyway any more.</span> <span id="s1435">So they prepare you to take the backpack, so you -- of course you put it in, most of your better belongings, or -- you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1436">And be ready and at farmer’s market, and -- and y-you going to be sent to Salesia, like amerasion to work.</span> <span id="s1437">Nothing about -- about concentration camps, you’re going to be and the women, all this baloney [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1438">So it took them four days.</span> <span id="s1439">Some tried to escape, I found out later, you know, from the wagon, you know, go and it’s wintertime, the f -- it was way below zero.</span> <span id="s1440">Can you imagine when you have to have family, two families, 10 - 12 or 15 people in the sled with the belongings and it takes about couple hours and you know, it’s freezing, you have a child -- you saw some women and children, you know, froze to death.</span> <span id="s1441">Some of them tried to escape.</span> <span id="s1442">So, it didn’t -- if you manage to escape from all the transport, some got shot on the spot, some managed to escape and they got them in touch with a certain friend, a Christian friend and they stayed there for awhile and they were told you know, there is some Proushinna, go and this way partisans and they reached the partisans there -- if they reached, you know, and they joined, eventually, our group.</span> <span id="s1443">When we were in the woods, there was a na -- you know -- there is -- we found another group.</span> <span id="s1444">So, the second night, I say -- when we es -- finally we escaped, it took us all night to reach the forest.</span> <span id="s1445">We didn’t -- we didn’t meet those guys there that had -- and this was the worst experience of our life.</span> <span id="s1446">We -- it was cold and hungry and -- and -- it’s -- we were wondering around, maybe we’re going to found them, because they supposed to have already s -- maybe a place -- you know, they -- a bunker, you know, we all live in a bunker in the -- in the woods, camouflaged somehow, but you can make a fire and all that.</span> <span id="s1447">We did, you know, with matches, we did had -- made, at night we made a fire, emergency.</span> <span id="s1448">We ha -- li -- you know, warmed up a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">But it was -- it was rough for the older, some -- some couldn’t take it, you know.</span> <span id="s1450">It f -- and so -- so we wandered around for about a week and we tried -- the group, our group, the 18 and three women, to be independent.</span> <span id="s1451">Which -- so we tried, we knew -- made a little bunker and we had plenty of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: You dug under?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: Well, the bunk -- you know what the bunker is?</span> <span id="s1454">I-It is a -- we call, it’s more -- about three, four feet in the ground, yeah.</span> <span id="s1455">With plenty -- you know, in the woods, you have plenty of trees and logs and all that.</span> <span id="s1456">So you try to -- you brace and then you’re -- we knew -- we have an idea how the bunker -- you know, how to build the bunker so you can s-sleep about 10 on each side.</span> <span id="s1457">So -- and just high enough, six feet, so you can -- you know, you can go in.</span> <span id="s1458">And then you had the -- on both sides you had the -- what you call it?</span> <span id="s1459">B-Bunk -- the -- the bunks where you can just lay around and sl -- you know, just lay around and sleep.</span> <span id="s1460">And in -- in middle, eventually, in the middle of the bu -- middle of the bunker was a stove, made a stove.</span> <span id="s1461">This was -- this was when we -- you know, we decided we had to go to get some bricks.</span> <span id="s1462">We had to go to the farms, get bricks and ge -- and -- and build the stove, make that.</span> <span id="s1463">Then we had to go -- go to g-get some -- for the food undertaking, you know, they call it in Russia bombioshka.</span> <span id="s1464">To go to a farm, you got to eat.</span> <span id="s1465">After a week, you know, you -- we didn’t find leave -- we were hungry, starved.</span> <span id="s1466">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: But what would you do -- how would you approach the farmers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: Well, here, the first time approach the farmers, so we decided five men from the group.</span> <span id="s1469">I participated and we decided we going to go -- we were armed, we were going to go to a farm and get some bread and get some -- you know, if -- we’re around, then we ne -- after all, that’s the way they’re -- they -- they -- Russians lived there so -- for so many month.</span> <span id="s1470">They knew already the territory, they were there -- have guns to the farmer.</span> <span id="s1471">The -- lessinder -- the farmer was caught in between, let’s put it, caught watteeou in between.</span> <span id="s1472">So -- so, on the way, the first -- the first undertaking, we met on the road, it was wintertime, a sled, a farmer had a calf and he had in his sled and he had some salt and he had some flour from the mill.</span> <span id="s1473">So we took the sled and yeah, we soo -- the sled, whatever -- away from the farmer and we brought it down to the f -- to the -- he was riding just -- on the track, you know, between -- between the -- not far from the woods.</span> <span id="s1474">We brought this in the -- to our place, our home there and on the way going -- you’re going -- going to our place -- to the bunker, call it a home, we stopped another little farm, we got some bread, you know, the way the Russian did.</span> <span id="s1475">They baked a big loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1476">If you get t-two loafs of bread -- it was rationing, so it -- mean, at least you managed, you managed.</span> <span id="s1477">You know, one loaf of bread, you can -- you can make 20 or 25 portions.</span> <span id="s1478">So you s -- you stayed on a portion.</span> <span id="s1479">You know, we were -- we were fair.</span> <span id="s1480">Each one got a portion of bread.</span> <span id="s1481">These were the first days.</span> <span id="s1482">Then we discovered that farmers were coming in the woods, chopping -- chopping -- you know, they came in and they were chopping wo -- woods, logs for themselves and we are pretty close there, so we had to abandon [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1483">We had to abandon the first time with -- we abandon that place, already.</span> <span id="s1484">And, yeah, this was when we went the first time, we had to go to the farm, to the farmers to get the equipment in order to build.</span> <span id="s1485">You ha -- we had to have like a -- a s -- a saws, we had to have shovels, we have to have picks in order --</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: You didn’t take that with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: No, you -- no, we never [indecipherable] no, we didn’t have this with us, no, we didn’t have this.</span> <span id="s1488">We expected the 10 men, they going to have a place, a home for us.</span> <span id="s1489">See, we didn’t meet them for -- took us a -- took us a long time.</span> <span id="s1490">I think on the third week we met them.</span> <span id="s1491">So, the first -- so we got -- we got all the equipment to build -- to build this gym -- we call it gymlamka, it means in the -- in the ground.</span> <span id="s1492">And it was camouflaged with brush and -- and a -- in order to protect -- you know, the rain shouldn’t go in, we had plenty sand, fill up with sand.</span> <span id="s1493">But even though the sand, you know, went through, you know, it was -- it w -- in the beginning it -- it wasn’t too bad, later on there was a problem.</span> <span id="s1494">Later on was a problem, well you bose -- you know, you got loaded with lice and fleas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: With lice and fleas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: Oh, because from the sand and -- you know, later on.</span> <span id="s1497">Even -- even -- even being, you know, when we organized being in the partisan with the -- all together, the Russian partisan.</span> <span id="s1498">But we got used to is already.</span> <span id="s1499">That time, we already had -- we had -- we call it - they had a -- a steam room outside, yeah.</span> <span id="s1500">A steam room, you went outs -- I -- I don’t know, you went out of the steam room wintertime, almost naked, then you run in in order to get -- in order to get rid of them.</span> <span id="s1501">It was a problem because, you know, the bunks you slept, each time -- you never undressed, you never took your shoes off.</span> <span id="s1502">You only slept on -- you know, like -- like a -- it reminds me the concentration camps, you slept close to each other and -- and you know, it’s -- it’s bound to get from this -- from the -- from somebody else or from the sand and somehow, get infested -- get infested.</span> <span id="s1503">But we f -- we, from the experience idis we discovered, we learned, you know, we got rid of.</span> <span id="s1504">We used to make a fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: What would you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: Yeah, you know, in order to get -- in the beginning we used to make a fire -- well, this was already when we are organized.</span> <span id="s1507">So he told us, m-make a fire and the smoke, make a big smoke, take off your shirt and hold it over the fire and then alls -- you know, thens -- then they all -- they all commit -- all drop.</span> <span id="s1508">This was only in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1509">Later on, you know, we were in 19 -- so this independent Jewish group, we lived for four months independently.</span> <span id="s1510">We learned our lessons, then we moved three times.</span> <span id="s1511">Here, was in a car you know, we saw farmers there.</span> <span id="s1512">We went -- you know, like they di -- we were afraid we going to be discovered, so we decided we going to go in another place.</span> <span id="s1513">Then we discover there’s another group in the woods, about 12 Jewi-Jewish groups and there was another group, eight, there’s another 20.</span> <span id="s1514">We were already -- so, ev -- being maybe around 50 - 60, you got to have enough food, you know to -- so, we tried, the second time to go a bigger undertaking, they call it for -- f-food undertaking.</span> <span id="s1515">And it was -- we went to a big farm, not far from our town, you know this and we loaded up two loads, two -- i-it was still wintertime -- two sleds with lot of products, most -- you know bread, flour and the oats, whatever they had there.</span> <span id="s1516">Potatoes.</span> <span id="s1517">Now, potatoes wasn’t a problem with -- potatoes, the farmers added -- all the farms, they s -- they had their supply potatoes outside.</span> <span id="s1518">Supply for the whole wint -- for the whole season and the same thing, but covered with straw and then with sand, so you shouldn’t freeze.</span> <span id="s1519">Now, the same thing looks like a outside bunker, we were -- you know, we were inside -- outside.</span> <span id="s1520">So we used to go -- potatoes, we used to go in and steal, was no prob -- we can always get potatoes enough.</span> <span id="s1521">If you didn’t have food, well you got potatoes.</span> <span id="s1522">And you had a fire, so baked po -- used to bake th -- baked potatoes.</span> <span id="s1523">Or that -- I mean a -- as long so, you got -- you got a -- you got along, you did -- wa-wasn’t a hungry.</span> <span id="s1524">And the only thing is we still -- we still don’t -- where -- where is our voice?</span> <span id="s1525">Where is our voice?</span> <span id="s1526">So, we were wandering around, we met some partisans already that time in the woods.</span> <span id="s1527">And they were already as -- dressed nice and they -- you know, driving -- during the day, right on the route.</span> <span id="s1528">You know, in t -- near -- in the territory around the woods, they weren’t even afraid.</span> <span id="s1529">Driving around with a sled and the horses.</span> <span id="s1530">And they met us and they says, “Well,” -- the same thing -- those who are armed, they would take it.</span> <span id="s1531">Those who don’t -- hasn’t got any arms, he says you got to have the -- they wouldn’t nex -- they wouldn’t take it in.</span> <span id="s1532">They wouldn’t -- they -- you know, they wouldn’t accept them.</span> <span id="s1533">So, they were friendly in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1534">They helped us go, if -- you know, with our group and they participated and they helped us to go for a bigger undertaking, food undertaking.</span> <span id="s1535">They knew already how to do it.</span> <span id="s1536">See, we weren’t experience.</span> <span id="s1537">And they helped us with food undertaking.</span> <span id="s1538">So it wasn’t so bad and eventually, I think I -- on the third week, we found our group, see?</span> <span id="s1539">And they were still, already incorporated with some partisans, with some Russian partisans.</span> <span id="s1540">But it still was independent groups, each one living independently.</span> <span id="s1541">But at least we had some -- so they -- when we met the 10 groups, they were already more experienced, we took on some military missions, couple.</span> <span id="s1542">So, in order to get some more ammunition for the -- you know, where the -- you’re about 60 there, some of them didn’t -- came [inaudible] the 12 -- the 12, they only have maybe a couple rifles.</span> <span id="s1543">Now, our group, considering the way we were armed, it’s unbelievable, having -- because I -- I -- y-y-y-y-y -- in -- come to think of -- I was mention, in -- in Warsaw ghetto, it was so rough to -- you know, it was so rough to smug -- to get arms in.</span> <span id="s1544">They tried the -- the -- the -- the underground, Polish underground.</span> <span id="s1545">They supposed to help them and you know, with money to buy -- you couldn’t -- you know, you had to buy guns and ammunition.</span> <span id="s1546">Many times, you know they tak -- they took the money and they didn’t deliver it.</span> <span id="s1547">You know, they didn’t deliver it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">With so little, whatever they had -- with so little, you know, they stood out and they couldn’t and the Germans had to bomb them out, in order -- can you imag -- in Warsaw ghetto, with so little.</span> <span id="s1549">So comparison the little group, there was thou -- Warsaw ghetto with half a million Jews, 400,000 Jews, so you figured, “Gee, we are blessed compar -- unbelievable,” we were blessed comparison.</span> <span id="s1550">So -- so we managed -- you know, went to the farmers, they saw we are Jews, but what can they do?</span> <span id="s1551">They looked around, a Jew, I mean some were unfriendly farmers, but they -- we took whatever we needed that.</span> <span id="s1552">So when we met up with the other 10, we already -- I mean we got -- build some senti -- what do you call it, a bunkers, three -- three of -- 20 of -- we -- three bunkers in each side and they helped us, we went have bigger -- you know, on food a-assignment, we had already help from the Russians -- partisans.</span> <span id="s1553">They wo -- they -- they helped us.</span> <span id="s1554">And many times we reciprocated, they says, okay, wi -- you’ll have to go with us, they picked a few fr-from the -- our group, which -- you know, some not armed.</span> <span id="s1555">Over -- he says, they ouv -- they going to protect us.</span> <span id="s1556">They took us and they said we going to go on the track and you going to -- they gave us saws, he says, “You’re going to cu-cut telephone poles and telegraphs and stuff like that.”</span> <span id="s1557">The Russian says, “Oh, you do, we -- they lay an ambush,” he says, “we going to protect you, at” -- everything at night.</span> <span id="s1558">S --</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Now, this now -- th -- y-you’re talking now about a -- a mission now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Well, this is -- this is a mission, but I mean it -- okay, cut tele -- yeah, I mean -- two -- you know, the old, each one on two sides, you -- the holes, we didn’t have the electric saws.</span> <span id="s1561">Had to saw the -- cut the telephone at night, saw it -- what’s the -- through the -- disrupt the communication.</span> <span id="s1562">They had to come back, you know, in the morning, you know, and the ki -- th -- chi -- group from German would have to come back and replace the poles.</span> <span id="s1563">This was -- this was a battle for them.</span> <span id="s1564">So this we did, before we even got organized with them, they made us [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1565">I mean, it foo -- it wasn’t so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">After all, they helped us -- they helped us with food, but when we met up with the 10 -- f- first 10 already, we decided that we’ll go for a little mi-mil -- missions.</span> <span id="s1567">We’ll go -- they knew and we went, for instance, three examples I put there.</span> <span id="s1568">One time, we s -- we went to a -- to the -- to the -- there was -- I mentioned there was a sawmill in -- near Proushinna and there was a German -- you know, the German -- we went to the sawmill, there was -- they had a sawmill and a flour mill there and it’s -- and -- and it was a big -- big operation see -- badaway for Jewish engi -- contro -- Jewish -- on the -- two Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1569">So we went there and we disarmed -- we didn’t kill the German.</span> <span id="s1570">We went in the house, whatever we had, the guns, whatever we had, the gun.</span> <span id="s1571">We took his gun, we took some clothes and we loaded up our -- two -- what you ca-call it?</span> <span id="s1572">The same sleds, wagons, with how other products.</span> <span id="s1573">There’s a fa -- lot of products and we brought it in -- back to -- yeah, so -- this the -- that time, it helped.</span> <span id="s1574">It’s a little mission.</span> <span id="s1575">And -- but the main -- the main -- the main mission was when we blew --</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: -- bad.</span> <span id="s1577">After all, they helped us -- they helped us with food, but when we met up with the 10 -- f-first 10 already, we decided that we’ll go for a little mi-mil -- missions.</span> <span id="s1578">We’ll go - they knew and we went, for instance, three examples I put there.</span> <span id="s1579">One time, we s -- we went to a -- to the -- to the -- there was -- I mentioned there was a sawmill in -- near Proushinna and there was a German -- you know, the German -- we went to the sawmill, there was -- they had a sawmill and a flour mill there and it’s -- and -- and it was a big -- big operation see -- badaway for Jewish engi -- contro -- Jewish -- on the -- two Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1580">So we went there and we disarmed -- we didn’t kill the German.</span> <span id="s1581">We went in the house, whatever we had, the guns, whatever we had, the gun.</span> <span id="s1582">We took his gun, we took some clothes and we loaded up our -- two -- what you ca-call it?</span> <span id="s1583">The same sleds, wagons, with how other products.</span> <span id="s1584">There’s a fa -- lot of products and we brought it in -- back to -- yeah, so -- this the -- that time, it helped.</span> <span id="s1585">It’s a little mission.</span> <span id="s1586">And -- but the main -- the main -- the main mission was when we blew up -- this was with still Jewish group with other group.</span> <span id="s1587">We -- we crept into the -- outside of the ghetto and we blew up the headquarters, the Gestapo headquarter, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: At this point the ghetto was empty, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Empty.</span> <span id="s1590">Empty.</span> <span id="s1591">I mean we just crept in -- you know, it was at night, we went in there and yeah, we burned it up, we blew up -- burned up the headquarters.</span> <span id="s1592">It was -- it wa -- it wa -- it was a big house, where they operated from there.</span> <span id="s1593">And -- and -- and on the way back -- on the way back there were -- yo-you know, and it was already late.</span> <span id="s1594">We met -- there was three German patrols there, patrolling there, you know, we ambushed the -- he wa -- ambushed them and took their rifles away, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Did you kill them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1597">The three -- yeah, we killed the three Germans.</span> <span id="s1598">We had to.</span> <span id="s1599">We take the rifles away and es-especially the -- especially the winter, you know, the clothes and the boots was important.</span> <span id="s1600">Yeah, yeah, this is a Jewish group, the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Did you get the boots?</span> <span id="s1602">You, yourself?</span> <span id="s1603">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: Did you get the boots?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: Oh ye -- oh -- well, I -- well, I -- I wore the boots.</span> <span id="s1606">Each one -- each one -- it was if you -- everybody was running, you know, later on, when it was organ -- everybody was running for the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1607">You know, we used to -- mine, for instance -- this was in 19 -- i- in 19 -- late 1941, I think, in June.</span> <span id="s1608">They dropped -- now we were already -- it’s -- it’s almost five months as independent groups, with little Russians here and there groups, all kind of groups.</span> <span id="s1609">Everybody was independent.</span> <span id="s1610">And in s -- late May, they -- Russian planes dropped off military -- military what you call it?</span> <span id="s1611">Men.</span> <span id="s1612">And that’s when the rule of the jungle finished.</span> <span id="s1613">Finally came an order, they -- you know, they realized there is some partisans and they wanted to get organized more.</span> <span id="s1614">So, for us, Jewish partisans, it was the rule of the jungle, becau -- was ended.</span> <span id="s1615">It -- they says, no more.</span> <span id="s1616">You cannot just go around and live off of your farmers and survive.</span> <span id="s1617">You got to fight for -- you know, you got to fight the enemy.</span> <span id="s1618">So, all the groups in the woods, the surrounding whoever, they found.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Jews, Poles, Russian, White Russians.</span> <span id="s1620">Was established the young ones belonged to a fighting group, the older ones -- you know we had some older escapees and couples, married the -- and -- and a family up front, you call it a boyavoyee and a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Boyavoyee’s a fighting -- fighting brigade and a family brigade.</span> <span id="s1622">Now, the family, see the -- they didn’t break it up.</span> <span id="s1623">If you were husband and wife, it was in the family.</span> <span id="s1624">Now, my commander with his wife went in the co -- went in in the family group.</span> <span id="s1625">Older people -- you know, anything is the fa -- and the family was -- now, they had their own place.</span> <span id="s1626">We were responsible for them.</span> <span id="s1627">And all the young ones, single young ones who were able to fight in the fighting groups.</span> <span id="s1628">So that time I was assigned to the 16 of the -- all the Jewish partisans, 16 were assigned to the Kirov group.</span> <span id="s1629">They called it Kirov brigade and this was a unit of the ien Ponnavarenko division.</span> <span id="s1630">That’s what it tells you, they’re Ponnavarenko.</span> <span id="s1631">This is -- our brigade belonged to the Ponnavarenko.</span> <span id="s1632">And I was assigned and my brother was assigned to the Kirov brigade and the third battalion and third platoon somehow there.</span> <span id="s1633">And that’s the way we were assigned and th-the life of the partisan changed.</span> <span id="s1634">We were already safer, because we lost, you know, we went one time from our group, we went for a underta -- food undertaking.</span> <span id="s1635">Now we undertook too much and we came, successfully with two loaded wagons with food to our place, the bunker.</span> <span id="s1636">And we st -- I wa -- I participated, my brother participated, that time was about 15 of us went.</span> <span id="s1637">And the Germans followed.</span> <span id="s1638">Eventually it was -- at night we were safe.</span> <span id="s1639">And we were loading it, all the food and you were -- kept the -- you know the food, mostly you ke -- you kept it hidden in certain -- all around the certain places, make sure that in case you get chased out or you have to -- or you have to abandon the place.</span> <span id="s1640">You had to be careful not only about y-ye -- for the Germans, sometimes from farmers or from even a -- you know, from they’ll come in in the woods, or they had a lot of spies.</span> <span id="s1641">You see, there was -- the Germans had a lot of spies.</span> <span id="s1642">They knew there is some partisans.</span> <span id="s1643">And they had a lot of collaborators from the Russians.</span> <span id="s1644">There was a whole division, they call it the Valosoftsi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">We ca -- we called them Valosoftsi, General Valosoft -- Valosoft went, the first day of the war is the -- two more -- they surrender to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1646">Just -- and what happened, they surrendered.</span> <span id="s1647">And the Germans didn’t use them on the-- to fight on the front, but they used the all divisions, you know -- you know is a evosovla -- all army maybe, I don’t know it -- maybe -- maybe two, three division.</span> <span id="s1648">A division is 20,000 men.</span> <span id="s1649">So the German used those Valososftsi’s, they -- those are the Valosoftsi’s, as collaborators.</span> <span id="s1650">They put them for alt -- you know, to do all the kind of dirty work in the -- in the garrisons, in -- you know, all kind -- in garrisons, or in the villages, in the cities and -- and they replaced the Germans -- you know, they did the work for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: You were saying that sometimes you lost people and you started to tell a story after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: Oh, well, ye -- see, what happened?</span> <span id="s1653">So, all of a sudden the Germans, you know, there was a shot -- we had a shot.</span> <span id="s1654">And those who were outside, we were outside, just ready and so we saw the Germans.</span> <span id="s1655">So we tried to grab you -- the rifle, anything you could, we start to escape deeper in the woods.</span> <span id="s1656">And here, the Germans blew up the bun -- there was about -- about eight of -- eight -- they didn’t participated, but they belonged to our group, eight guys.</span> <span id="s1657">So they -- that’s all they did is -- is they -- with grenade, they blew up the bunkers and they -- they killed the -- thega -- they killed them all and they got one girl, they took a -- a injured girl a pri -- as a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1658">The reason -- I don’t know, they took the girl, probably they tried to squeeze -- find -- maybe to find out more information.</span> <span id="s1659">So we had the -- that’s -- we had one -- what you call it, tragedy.</span> <span id="s1660">And, so we lost at that time, seven eight men from our group.</span> <span id="s1661">And seven men from the first group got killed before we got organized, by -- by another group of partisans, for -- the only reason they got -- were wot -- killed, because -- for their clothes, for their boots or something.</span> <span id="s1662">Because it was the rule of the jungle, before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: So -- so people who were -- essentially believed in the same thing, they were partisans and they killed each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: It was not -- it was -- what I mean, this is the rule -- they -- they are in the woods the same.</span> <span id="s1665">They supposed to -- they supposed to fight and we all, but that’s the way it was, the rule of the jungle.</span> <span id="s1666">I mean, they didn’t -- if -- if -- if they figure maybe you have a watch -- I don’t know, we never -- we complained later on to -- you know, we were organized already in the -- you know, in the partisans.</span> <span id="s1667">But it was too late, we says, well, not much -- I mean, that’s -- that’s a terrible loss.</span> <span id="s1668">And the bar -- that commander and his brother got killed.</span> <span id="s1669">That -- what I say -- that Barro Sagell.</span> <span id="s1670">The first one, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Let’s stop.</span> <span id="s1672">We’ll stop now.</span> <span id="s1673">They have to change tapes again.</span> <span id="s1674">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: When your group went from being more independent to more organized, did you ever have any military training?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: Well, I did a little.</span> <span id="s1678">See, when you -- in the Russians class, when you reach 18 in Russia, they -- they taught you how to clean a rifle and take apart a rifle.</span> <span id="s1679">It’s by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1680">So, in last year, I knew out -- you know, the Russian rifle -- how to take apart and clean a rifle and all that.</span> <span id="s1681">But, we never -- we never went on the range for experience that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1683">Had you ever shot a rifle?</span> <span id="s1684">A: Did I have a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Had you ever shot a rifle, a gun?</span> <span id="s1686">Before -- A: Oh, before -- before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: I mean, when you were younger, had you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: No.</span> <span id="s1689">First of all, it was ill -- you know in pole -- in Poland was illegal.</span> <span id="s1690">It’s not like here.</span> <span id="s1691">It was illegal to have arm, any rifle, machine.</span> <span id="s1692">Only the police or certain -- it was illegal, no guns.</span> <span id="s1693">Most of -- most -- if you heard the -- what’s -- if committed murders is just -- you know -- no gun used.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: What -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: I was trained.</span> <span id="s1696">I was trained, that’s what I want to say.</span> <span id="s1697">Now, I was young and I was -- you know, I was strong.</span> <span id="s1698">As a rule, most of the Russians are a -- a liltz -- some are -- I would say Russian soldiers, majority is not like Germans -- big guys.</span> <span id="s1699">Small -- smaller guys.</span> <span id="s1700">And we -- in the third where I was assigned, in the third battalion [indecipherable] brigade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">We had a anti-tank gun.</span> <span id="s1702">This is the only gun the brigade possessed that time.</span> <span id="s1703">Now, they call that PT -- Russian is P-PTR.</span> <span id="s1704">Now this -- this gun was used mostly -- we didn’t expect to get involved, you know, with fweet -- with the German tanks or Panzers, or yur -- in battle.</span> <span id="s1705">It was used mostly on the railroad to s -- to s-shoot in their engine and stop the engine all -- blow up the engine so the train can not.</span> <span id="s1706">We were very limited in explosive that time.</span> <span id="s1707">You know, ba explosives.</span> <span id="s1708">So we used the PT and only gun.</span> <span id="s1709">The -- it weigh -- it weighed -- it weigh -- it was very heavy, it weighed maybe 150 pounds.</span> <span id="s1710">But it was -- you know, now there is -- the whole timer and it’s two parts.</span> <span id="s1711">It was -- y-y-you -- you could separate it in two parts, so I was assigned at number two and -- and there was number three -- three -- three pe -- thr-three guys used to be in charge of the PTR -- of that -- of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: To carry it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: Carry it and the number one, it was responsible by shooting it.</span> <span id="s1714">Yes, so I was -- in the beginning there, you know, the number two and fin -- I was trained then to be number one, to use the gun on missions for the trains to -- to shoot ac-actually to -- mostly what you can do is, many times it -- in engines -- make sure that either yo -- either you destroyed the engine, you know, it wasn’t -- it wasn’t -- that time -- it’s better -- I mean it’s -- it -- it is -- it is the only ti -- the only gun we used on these certain missions.</span> <span id="s1715">Now, later on, it was in the late ‘42, in the be -- in the l-late -- no, ‘42, in beginning ‘43, Russian planes already used to drop off a lot of explosives.</span> <span id="s1716">And til then, it -- we had to -- besides using that -- that -- that what you call, anti-tank gun, the partisans dependent on the dynamite explosives to -- gathered from the outside.</span> <span id="s1717">Now, how do you get it?</span> <span id="s1718">Mostly from the outside.</span> <span id="s1719">You know, the war was going on, you were finding shells here, you know, artillery shells and it was very dangerous to -- you know, sometimes a lot of them got killed in order to build a bomb -- to build the -- the -- what you call it?</span> <span id="s1720">The -- yeah, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: The bomb.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: The ex -- the explosive, yeah.</span> <span id="s1723">So, but it -- they -- we did -- you know, already at that time, there were some specialists in from the Russians, which they tried somehow to get the shell apart and to build the bomb by hand and use -- use the -- the -- the -- usually what I mentioned, the hand grenades -- the hand grenades was very, very important for the purpose of the bomb, because it’s all you had to do is pull the pin out and this can ex - you know, this was used as a detonator for the bomb.</span> <span id="s1724">But, later on -- like they -- they were -- the Soviets planes used to come down at night and drop off a lot of materials, mostly the -- you know, for the purpose of -- I would say a lot of automatic rifles, but a lot of em -- those m -- dynamite supplies, bomb supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Before you had the dynamite, just describe one mission.</span> <span id="s1726">Would you go and set up the gun alongside a train track.</span> <span id="s1727">How -- how would it work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: Well, it’s very -- see, we used to -- we used to do -- this is now where I -- where I participate quite often with that.</span> <span id="s1729">We used to reach a place, mostly at night and find a spot suitable for us to retreat in case, you know -- you know, right in the jungle or something, in the swamp.</span> <span id="s1730">Find a spot there.</span> <span id="s1731">Now, and we used to mine the -- the -- the -- the tracks, you know, [indecipherable] was -- was very -- you know -- they were in -- it was very easy, they weren’t -- what you call it?</span> <span id="s1732">Patrolled or -- and -- and watched so carefully.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">And you f -- you s -- now, you had a s -- there was so many -- there was so many brigades already in the woods that time, that each brigade had their own territory.</span> <span id="s1734">You couldn’t -- you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1735">You just couldn’t go in anywhere near here.</span> <span id="s1736">For instance, we got a section, they gave us a territory where we had to operate, far away from our camp.</span> <span id="s1737">Let’s see -- and another group was close to our camps, you know, and that’s the way it was set up.</span> <span id="s1738">So, we used to -- at -- at night, creep down, we had plenty of time -- small groups, about.</span> <span id="s1739">On this missions the mostly -- the most is four or five men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Very -- it’s all -- you go -- first of all, you -- you couldn’t find out exactly when the train is going to go, or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: Yeah, and we were operating on the main -- m-m-ma-ma-main junction, which is [indecipherable] and means komoskwa -- the main junction where all the -- where all the t-trains were going, all the traffic.</span> <span id="s1743">So, in the beginning, so you put the mine and you had to dig a little hole between the -- between the -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1744">You have the railroad, the -- the -- the -- what do you call it, the wood, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: The tie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: Blocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: The railroad tie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: Tie, yeah, betwee -- the -- the -- between the railroad ties, there.</span> <span id="s1749">And many times and it was a detonator sticking out.</span> <span id="s1750">You know, they had a detonator sticking out.</span> <span id="s1751">So the train goes by and it touches the detonator and it blows up.</span> <span id="s1752">But the Germans got smart, eventually, you know what happens, so they were ripping the trains day and night and you know, the war was going on.</span> <span id="s1753">So they tried to put -- before -- you know th -- before the engine, you know, before the engine goes, the -- first of all, the engine is going to -- what happened -- the engine comes first -- the engine blows up first.</span> <span id="s1754">So that’s -- that stops the whole operation, engine.</span> <span id="s1755">So they tried to put two flatbed cars full with sand or bricks or -- or all kind of -- th-tho -- heavy material.</span> <span id="s1756">So this should rip -- you know, it- it’ll hit -- this’ll hit first, so this’ll ge-get blown up, it’s not going to hit the engine.</span> <span id="s1757">So they -- they’re going disconnect, so they going to follow that, then it’s -- it means -- and came to point, you know, this was very -- this was very easy because they couldn’t control all the railroad.</span> <span id="s1758">They were in such a p -- they -- they were in such a trouble, that finally they decided -- you know, they took farmers each from -- from the farms and put them at night -- forced them on the tracks to watch the -- you know, to watch the tracks.</span> <span id="s1759">Many times I used to come on the tracks and there was -- you know, civilians.</span> <span id="s1760">They got caught in the middle.</span> <span id="s1761">I don’t’ know, you know, it’s tough.</span> <span id="s1762">They got -- its’ a war, they got caught in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: Well, what would happen to the civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: We told them -- well, w-we told them, “You better take off.”</span> <span id="s1765">Well, I don’t know what happened, the German ac -- you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1766">We weren’t afraid, we told them, “We’re going to mine, you better -- you better get out of here.</span> <span id="s1767">You better take off.”</span> <span id="s1768">So that’s -- it means they’re so desperate -- so -- so desperate to watch the traffic -- watch the traffic.</span> <span id="s1769">But the main, the -- finally the main -- you know, the Russian, they discovered a trick that’s -- in -- in order -- we were supplied with -- just like a bar of soap.</span> <span id="s1770">That’s all it had -- and had a little detonator there.</span> <span id="s1771">And that’s all you had to rip the tracks instead -- instead the trains.</span> <span id="s1772">Just rip the [indecipherable] rip the tracks, you know, the tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: It would rip the tracks up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: Just rip the tracks, take a fist, you know.</span> <span id="s1775">And this is so easy, we -- we went out sometimes 40 - 50 at a time for miles, miles of the track.</span> <span id="s1776">That’s all you had to do is -- as leedbat -- you know, it was something like a -- it’s not a rope, but it hads -- had -- it’s not a wire, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Leads?</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: No, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: -- the -- the fuse was -- the fuse was inside a little bar of soap.</span> <span id="s1781">Q: [indecipherable], okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: But you -- that’s all you needed is a match and five or 10 minutes, til it’ll -- it’ll burn til it’ll reach the -- til it’ll reach the tracks, so you true retreat.</span> <span id="s1783">So, we were laying right between it and it -- it fits right between the -- the railroad track, the railroad s-siding there, yeah.</span> <span id="s1784">And this was -- th-th-th -- this was -- it was the -- blowing the tracks, day and night -- day and night.</span> <span id="s1785">So this was minor tra -- this was already minor -- mi -- minor operation.</span> <span id="s1786">It -- now, the big oper -- the bigger operation it came to point when the so -- in -- this was already 1944, we told -- you know, we told our commanders that in Proushinna, there were the Leaman brother -- that Leaman for the communication and the -- and the telephone lines, and he was the one -- he was a murderer, I guess.</span> <span id="s1787">That’s him -- nobody wanted to work or -- for him.</span> <span id="s1788">So we told -- we told the commander, you know, why can’t we go on this -- on the Proushinna - Voushanna line there and -- and -- and mine the road and we’ll got -- you know, he was in charge of -- he was always in charge.</span> <span id="s1789">Mine the road and we were in the forest that time on both sides, maybe -- maybe 60 or 70 men lay in ambush.</span> <span id="s1790">So what we did is we cut the lines.</span> <span id="s1791">We knew they left to come in in the morning, during the night.</span> <span id="s1792">We mined the roads, because -- in case there was not too much traffic, only military.</span> <span id="s1793">So -- and we mined the roads just -- in -- in the -- you know, in the morning.</span> <span id="s1794">We knew that they going to s -- the minute, what you call it, sunlight, they going to ar-arrive and would -- you know, lay there in ambush on both sides and you know, two trucks, you know, with the Germans, each one -- 30 on each truck.</span> <span id="s1795">Now, the first truck, the first one hit the mine and blew up.</span> <span id="s1796">We knew -- the second one stopped.</span> <span id="s1797">We knew that the second one is going to stop and we’ll -- we’ll -- we -- we laid on both side and this was a spot we picked -- it just -- you know, has got to go through the woods, through this -- you know, through the -- on both sides we are protected.</span> <span id="s1798">Either we’re going to cut off -- we can go to the right, we can run to the left -- we are in the woods.</span> <span id="s1799">And -- and sure, the second one stopped and we opened a fire from - you know, it was from both side across.</span> <span id="s1800">We killed them all, 30.</span> <span id="s1801">Everybody was running for the booty -- you know, booty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: For the booty, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: To get.</span> <span id="s1804">To get -- you know, for -- arm we didn’t need already maybe, the only thing was important, pistol.</span> <span id="s1805">I mean we’d -- we a -- you know, not everybody had a pistol.</span> <span id="s1806">So, in order to have the pistol, a guard -- or sometime -- this was already, you know, important touch from both sides, you know, you were respected.</span> <span id="s1807">You had a pistol, you must have -- you know, already -- you were already a respected partisan.</span> <span id="s1808">You must have -- if you picked -- killed -- got a pistol, it’s yours.</span> <span id="s1809">And no -- no, you can -- cannot take it away from you.</span> <span id="s1810">If I took the pistol, it’s mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: Did you get one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: Yeah, I got a pist -- beside -- besides that, of course they had -- we took especially, the cl -- the clothes what they had and all that.</span> <span id="s1813">So, this was one of the -- one of the main -- it’s not the main mission, we -- where I participated and my brother participated.</span> <span id="s1814">Later, after that, it happened that, you know, my brother somehow -- with a post, so he fell asleep, so they s-separated them, they dropped -- there was another group, they dropped down 50 - some paratroopers and they needed local partisans, so all the three who were in the post for a punishment, he says they needed -- they send them in to the -- to the o -- to the others -- to the other group.</span> <span id="s1815">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: So, they sent your brother away from you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: The -- ma -- my brother and the other two on the post as a punishment, because a punishment could be -- you know, this is -- could be -- you can be shot when you fell asleep on the post.</span> <span id="s1818">So they -- I was separated and I didn’t hear from him for the -- all that time.</span> <span id="s1819">I didn’t hear -- I knew he is with the Capute -- eventually they joined they ca -- they call it the Capusta brigade.</span> <span id="s1820">I knew there, but we didn’t see each other and we didn’t -- didn’t ca -- didn’t communicate each other -- with each other.</span> <span id="s1821">And only once -- I heard once -- once that he’s -- you know, that he’s operating, he’s alive, so forth, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: Could you just tell us a little bit more about when you weren’t doing -- when you weren’t engaged in missions, wh-wh-wh-what would it be like back at the -- at the camp?</span> <span id="s1823">What would you do in the evening and what -- a lot of times you were working at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: W-Would it be during the day?</span> <span id="s1826">What would you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: Oh, well.</span> <span id="s1828">Well, well, here it is.</span> <span id="s1829">A lot of -- a lot of partisans were assigned at the camp.</span> <span id="s1830">Now, at the camp, mostly those who were assigned at the camp -- pardon me -- their responsibility was to go and -- on the food undertaking for themselves and for the family e -- for the family br-brigade, because there was all -- a lot in the families, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Hundreds, you know, I mean -- you know, not only Jewish already, you know, from some -- you know, from Rofe and Belagooshins ala -- there’s a -- this -- it was -- it was -- big camps, family camps.</span> <span id="s1832">And so those who didn’t participated, so they had to do local work, chop wood and stay on posts.</span> <span id="s1833">The posts, that’s boring, you know, stay on -- you know, there’s a -- posts, there’s a lot of -- y-y-you were s -- you were -- spread it for mi-miles away, you know.</span> <span id="s1834">A post here, maybe 10 miles another one, two, three on this track, on the onther track.</span> <span id="s1835">And the purpose of the post -- then you had -- they call it like a secret -- you had the secret parole they call that the secret code.</span> <span id="s1836">You know, if you meet somebody, hey, even the partisans, it’s -- you know it was every -- you know, it was concentrated with a command from the different ach -- from the different brigade.</span> <span id="s1837">He had -- he knew the code, because if they were true and they didn’t say the story, I say, “Stop, I’m going to shoot.</span> <span id="s1838">Who are you?</span> <span id="s1839">Give me the code.”</span> <span id="s1840">If he didn’t have the code, he’s a -- he’s a spy, he’s a traitor, he’s going to get killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: What was the code?</span> <span id="s1842">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: What was the code?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: Oh, they’ll say a code, for instance -- any type of code, one f -- I give you example, 15 - 10 or of Vashilare beach or -- or Josie.</span> <span id="s1845">You know, they picked any kind -- any kind of codes.</span> <span id="s1846">Like in the military, you know, yeah.</span> <span id="s1847">So it was -- you know, it was central command, very -- you know, with the discipline -- with the discipline.</span> <span id="s1848">So they -- those who didn’t participated were doing work around there, mostly on poles.</span> <span id="s1849">And so they ju -- were just sitting, doing sometime -- they si-sitting, doing nothing too, you know.</span> <span id="s1850">And that time, food were plenty.</span> <span id="s1851">Three times a day, meals.</span> <span id="s1852">Now, the meal consisted -- you know, not fussy.</span> <span id="s1853">Now, what we had -- it came to point that we went -- we had to a -- to a farm.</span> <span id="s1854">Now, our -- our duty was to go to farms to -- far away, like I say, each one was assigned a territory.</span> <span id="s1855">We couldn’t go to the poor farmers.</span> <span id="s1856">We had to go to the rich farmers, because the ch -- we knew that the Germans gave them a quarter that they on -- they can only have -- raise a pig or two pigs and the rest of them, they have to give it or sell it.</span> <span id="s1857">There has to be for the German army that stand.</span> <span id="s1858">So, and the same thing with cows and with butter, whatever they liked, you know, they call it -- cheeses and butter.</span> <span id="s1859">The Germans requested from the rich -- from the rich farmers that they s -- I don’t know if they paid them something for it, it belongs to them, you know.</span> <span id="s1860">And we had to go to those special farms to take away the German food, specially.</span> <span id="s1861">Go far away and attack wi -- you know, sometimes, if we had a -- the assignment, undertaking, were in the hundred -- you know, sometime 100 - 200.</span> <span id="s1862">Now they couldn’t -- at night they were afraid, we controlled already that time the -- the woods.</span> <span id="s1863">Even sometimes joonk -- the -- what happens, if you went for a mission and let’s say it’s late at night already, you couldn’t reach your destination to youk -- to your -- back to your -- to your -- ah, what’s with -- to your bunker or your house.</span> <span id="s1864">So, summertime, we had a -- summertime we had a privilege, you know, we used to go in and hide -- small groups.</span> <span id="s1865">I’m talking about this -- a g -- smaller groups going on mission to mine the roads or mine the bridges on -- or rip up the tracks.</span> <span id="s1866">So, we used to stop and go in in the field, you know, on the road, going in the field, sneaking in the corn field, in the -- in those field and st -- and stay up all day there.</span> <span id="s1867">It was hot -- oh, it was ho -- you know, the sun in the hot day and -- and sometimes -- oh, we had -- you know, we carried -- we had some water, we had some supplies.</span> <span id="s1868">It was so -- it - it -- it was a system -- it was a sys -- many times if you didn’t reach, many times we forced in and I went in to a village -- not, I mean a single -- not in a be -- not in a col -- yeah, in a hamlet for is -- lot of farmers, like -- they call it a hoota -- a fa -- a big farmer had lu -- has got his house by himself someplace set up in his -- in his fields there.</span> <span id="s1869">And so we -- we went in there and we kept him there and we didn’t let nobody out.</span> <span id="s1870">Anybody came in, we had -- they stayed there til night reached.</span> <span id="s1871">We impounded them and we left -- night reached, we went out, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1872">I -- I discovered -- you know, I discovered there was two advantages about -- first of all, it -- about going on the missions, you know.</span> <span id="s1873">You have two advantages.</span> <span id="s1874">First of all, the food always the same is, on the camp.</span> <span id="s1875">Three meals a day and soup and meat.</span> <span id="s1876">Now the -- the staff, at a different kitchen, see that, and they have a different -- different -- and they had that -- that cook, a different cook.</span> <span id="s1877">They had already -- we had cows.</span> <span id="s1878">It came to a point we had cows, we had horses already.</span> <span id="s1879">Many here -- I mean there was cows, let’s see, sometimes 10 - 15 - 20 cows and the cows were milked and from the milk, this is for the staff.</span> <span id="s1880">Now, when we went out, you know, you went into a farm, then you got -- first of all you got cleaned up and you had a changed [indecipherable] you know, while you -- the night you got to go in the pound and to go in and get washed and -- and take a dive, went in to the farmer and got some -- you know, und -- you -- cotton.</span> <span id="s1881">Usually the farmers, they made their own -- they made their own clothes.</span> <span id="s1882">Yeah, to change.</span> <span id="s1883">And it -- it -- I’m -- i-i-it -- and one advantage and the second advant -- and the second advantage, you -- you -- you had -- you can -- had a little milk.</span> <span id="s1884">You can -- you can have sometime only -- if you want a little booze, they used to make their own -- you know the [indecipherable] -- they used to have -- make their own, the farmers -- little booze.</span> <span id="s1885">Well, I didn’t -- once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1886">So it’s -- it’s a different -- you know, when you go out, it’s -- it sounds, it’s -- it’s March.</span> <span id="s1887">It’s -- it was safer in the smaller groups than the bigger groups.</span> <span id="s1888">Because we didn’t try to get involved the small group in the fight for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1889">You know, we didn’t -- we didn’t know we na -- we didn’t -- going to win the war fighting with the -- we just -- our -- our mission was to just -- to do as much damage -- disrupt the lines, cut the lines, mine the roads and mine the bridges and ge -- and give them as much trouble as -- as you know -- as much as we could, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1890">We didn’t expect -- you know, the partisans, but we had -- you know, we had -- l-later on -- when it already this -- with the Soviets, when they dropped down -- the planes landed, you know, they already took certain injured partisans, they took them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">They landed at night.</span> <span id="s1892">You know, there was certain spots.</span> <span id="s1893">Nobody controlled -- you know, ti -- ti -- a lot of territory.</span> <span id="s1894">Even sometime during the day, they -- then they -- they were -- they were -- I mean they didn’t have the guts to go in in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: Were there women fighters that you worked -- that you fought alongside?</span> <span id="s1896">A: Yeah, we had women, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: Tell [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: We had women.</span> <span id="s1899">We had -- like I said, there weren’t too many Jewish women, we had women, a few Jewish women participated in the -- in the -- in -- in -- in certain missions.</span> <span id="s1900">But there was a lot a girls from the C-Christians, from the -- mostly the White Russians.</span> <span id="s1901">F-From the villages, you know, there were certain -- certain villages, those were situated near -- near the -- the territory -- near the woods we have -- we operated.</span> <span id="s1902">Now, see the Germans, what they did is they put garrisons in there.</span> <span id="s1903">They knew the partisans are controlling the territory, so they put garrisons around those villages and l-lot f-from those villages, they cooperated.</span> <span id="s1904">They were sympathize with us, because some of their -- some of their boys already were in partis -- in partisans with us, with other groups.</span> <span id="s1905">And so we had -- we had g-good connections many times.</span> <span id="s1906">For instance, when we went for a mission -- for big mission for food undertaking.</span> <span id="s1907">You know, we found out before we went into village to find out if there is any Germans around.</span> <span id="s1908">Is there garrisons around, because you know, you -- to make sure that -- that there is -- there is non -- there is -- we should be safe.</span> <span id="s1909">But most of the garrisons, like I mentioned before, they were controlled by those -- by those Valosoftis.</span> <span id="s1910">There was a lot of Ukrainians there, who are the la -- this -- here the Germans, the collaborators, they put them in there.</span> <span id="s1911">Of course with the German control, there was some Germans with them.</span> <span id="s1912">But the majority, the lot of -- they gave us a lot of trouble, see?</span> <span id="s1913">They send a lot of spies in the woods.</span> <span id="s1914">They -- you know, they send the Germans, a -- a lot of spies in the woods and sometimes it was -- they -- they gave you out.</span> <span id="s1915">They -- sometimes they -- but we had good connections, we had good connections and the last -- like I say -- when we got supplied from the -- we got supplied from the planes and so we didn’t have to go look any more for this -- make up our own minds and all that -- that -- everything was ready made and it was -- it was easy and -- and it was enjoyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: It was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: I mean, I -- I -- I enj -- I -- is en -- for me, it was enj -- for me it was enjoying.</span> <span

soldier.</span> <span id="s1921">I’m -- you know, I can fight, like any soldier, can fight enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: You became a soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: Yeah… Now, we had some problems though, in -- in the -- in -- in -- this was in 1944, you know, we went -- besides, when they put those garrisons, those -- those Valosoftsis in there, we got an order to get them out.</span> <span id="s1924">A mission, you know, a mission, you know, and this is 200 here and two -- you know, and 200 there, 300 there.</span> <span id="s1925">Sometimes we went for a mission where a few brigades took part.</span> <span id="s1926">I would say 1000 - 1500, because if they had a power 600, you know, we had to double that.</span> <span id="s1927">And we had to go and to a track and to destroy the garrison.</span> <span id="s1928">I mean just many times, many times I recall, you know, it was house to house.</span> <span id="s1929">How --</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: House to house [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: House to house, itch -- you know, they were -- there were -- into -- they controlled the village now.</span> <span id="s1932">We went in and there was some those -- those Valosoftsis, you know, they didn’t wear German -- they didn’t ger -- wear German clothes -- German.</span> <span id="s1933">They had a different, what you call?</span> <span id="s1934">Uniform, yeah.</span> <span id="s1935">They have a uniform.</span> <span id="s1936">So, it came a -- came a order, we had to destroy it -- you know, vitist destroy them.</span> <span id="s1937">Yeah, we had a lot of casual -- there was casualties, you know, over time.</span> <span id="s1938">There was -- you know, Valosoft -- with Jewish -- you know, Jewish partisan.</span> <span id="s1939">One here, couple there from -- from the 16 -- from the 16, from the -- from our -- my -- my brigade, which folong you know, there’s quite a few got killed.</span> <span id="s1940">Quite a few got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: Did you ever have a close call yourself?</span> <span id="s1942">Or you felt that maybe you’d -- you know, you’d -- you’d be shot or</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1944">It -- it -- yes, it -- it happened one -- it happened one time -- we were -- we were -- we went -- we went for a mission and in the house -- it fa -- like to say house to house -- in the house was a German and I was there.</span> <span id="s1945">Right in the same house.</span> <span id="s1946">And I didn’t kill him and he -- and he took -- you know somehow, you know we -- in the same hou -- he could have killed me and I could have killed him.</span> <span id="s1947">And somehow, you know, it was -- it -- it -- it was -- what you call it?</span> <span id="s1948">That time, we had a mission to -- to take the village, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: Well, what happened in the house?</span> <span id="s1950">Did you both run away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: Well, I don’t -- I -- you know, I came out, I says -- I came out I says, a ger -- I -- you know, there is a German there.</span> <span id="s1952">Now, eventually we tried to look for him, you know, he disappeared too.</span> <span id="s1953">Maybe he got -- you know, he disappeared, you know.</span> <span id="s1954">On many occasions, you know, it was lot of occasions, where just like in the army, you know, just like in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: D-Did you have -- what was your feeling about what you were accomplishing?</span> <span id="s1956">Did you feel like you were con -- what did you feel you were contributing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: Well, first -- first of all, I felt a satisfaction that -- you know, that I’m a soldier, that I can fight and I can -- you know and I wouldn’t call, really that -- I wouldn’t call it revenge.</span> <span id="s1958">I would call it that I was maybe blessed or something.</span> <span id="s1959">That I -- I’m alive and I can fight, you know, I can fight -- fight the enemy.</span> <span id="s1960">You know, I didn’t think about -- feel like this is my -- for my father or for my mother or something like that.</span> <span id="s1961">No, I wasn’t thinking about it.</span> <span id="s1962">I was -- you know, I -- it was -- interested -- I was just interested.</span> <span id="s1963">Well, another thing I had in mind beside that, I -- my feeling was for the -- actually for the history, besides, yeah.</span> <span id="s1964">For the history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: Can you tell --</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: Th-That was -- that a Jewish fighter is -- you know, because I -- I always thought about those -- you know, I didn’t know where -- where -- where my family was taken and -- and til -- til you know, I was liberated 1944 and my feeling was that I’m doing something beside as a fighter, I’m doing a duty for the -- you know, something for the -- for the Jewish people… That -- and that -- I was able to do something… Now I -- I came back after the war to my -- I was liberated 1944, in -- in June.</span> <span id="s1967">Now, they send me -- you know, I was a decorated partisan, so most of the partisans were taken on the front.</span> <span id="s1968">The war was still going on.</span> <span id="s1969">As a matter of fact, in June, when they -- the second front started, sometimes the allied started in -- I think the same time maybe the second front started, now.</span> <span id="s1970">So I came -- they sent me and another group of -- of -- from the partisans, see and -- to Proushinna to establish my town -- to establish order.</span> <span id="s1971">You know, I’m a decorated partisan -- a Jewish partisan.</span> <span id="s1972">I came to Proushinna and I came to my house.</span> <span id="s1973">And in my -- and the house was -- that wasn’t destroyed and I found in the house was a family of -- you know, I don’t think -- I think it’s a Ballousha family.</span> <span id="s1974">Have a few children and you know, she was surprised, you know, they were surprised to seeing, you know.</span> <span id="s1975">I didn’t -- I didn’t even ask her how do you wind up in the house.</span> <span id="s1976">My duty that time was to establish you know, like -- like the front is moving, you know.</span> <span id="s1977">It’s interesting the way -- the way I was liberated, you know.</span> <span id="s1978">This is very interesting.</span> <span id="s1979">We knew already that the -- that the Russians are coming now.</span> <span id="s1980">And the patrol house already met with the Russian patrol.</span> <span id="s1981">And we were told that time that we have all the brigades what existed in the woods, that we have to mine all the roads and all the bridges and let the Ger-Germans -- you know, to sla -- the retreat -- they shouldn’t be li-living.</span> <span id="s1982">You know, they were in a panic.</span> <span id="s1983">I -- you know, that’s disati-disatisfaction they were k -- you know, they were -- they were running back.</span> <span id="s1984">They were -- the Russian were chasing him and -- and -- and bombarding them and they were running away so we tried our -- our mission was to mine the roads, not to let them through.</span> <span id="s1985">Let them go into the side, in the woods and to the -- all the other -- to all other ways.</span> <span id="s1986">And we were in the woods and -- and we were -- you know, we -- we were catching them by the -- by the hundreds.</span> <span id="s1987">In the beginning we were sniping and we was killing them.</span> <span id="s1988">I mean sniping in the wood.</span> <span id="s1989">It came to a point, you know, there was -- we caught -- you know, we were complete army.</span> <span id="s1990">You know, we were ca -- the partisans actually -- if we had an order, we could have gone in and liberate my -- liberated the -- th-the city of Proushinna.</span> <span id="s1991">The partisan were strong enough to go and liberate it -- this whole city, all the cities around.</span> <span id="s1992">You know, so they gave us the mission that -- that before I will -- came to Prou -- this was before, that we had -- had to participate and stop the enemy of -- you know, do as much damage as you can of retreating them.</span> <span id="s1993">And that time came an order, you know, we c-caught so many prisoners, we still were in the woods.</span> <span id="s1994">We already liberated, we are in the -- still in the woods, but we had to stake you know, and join -- that’s for our mission is to help the Russian army to disarm and to da -- day -- you know, and to -- to -- there -- it was a disarray.</span> <span id="s1995">I mean the -- the -- i-it -- it’s wortdill -- it’s wort -- wild to me to live through a period seeing the way they marched in with such a power, d -- you know, great big -- big, you know, army was going to conquer the world, seeing them in retreat, you know, dirty, you know.</span> <span id="s1996">They tried to -- to -- you know, change their clothes in civilian clothes, they shouldn’t -- you know, they shouldn’t be recognize as Germans.</span> <span id="s1997">You know, it unbelievable in the retreat.</span> <span id="s1998">So they tho --you’re asking me th -- to me it’s the -- that I lived through to see the biggest satisfaction with my eyes.</span> <span id="s1999">The retreat and the -- and the defeat.</span> <span id="s2000">The defeat and disarray -- the ray -- the way a -- on that front -- on -- on the Russian front, the army.</span> <span id="s2001">And the damage we did to them, yeah.</span> <span id="s2002">We were laying -- we were assigned one time, of two -- on one bri -- there was a bridge, a very important bridge.</span> <span id="s2003">Now we partisan, we had to control this bridge.</span> <span id="s2004">We mined the road.</span> <span id="s2005">Now, the German had to fix this bridge and now -- each time -- we were laying from both side in ambushes.</span> <span id="s2006">Each time they tried to fix -- they were in retreat, you know, not the -- disorganized already, you know that?</span> <span id="s2007">And they tried to fix the bridge, each time we opened fire.</span> <span id="s2008">They didn’t know if this is partisan or the Russian army.</span> <span id="s2009">I thought I will fi -- I’m -- I’m sure that they -- they thought already, if the partisan they probably would take a chance you know, and -- and -- and -- and f -- probably -- clean us -- go in a battle with us and get a -- you know, fight with us.</span> <span id="s2010">But I -- I’m sure they thought that was the Russian army at.</span> <span id="s2011">And they never -- they were unsuccessful.</span> <span id="s2012">They couldn’t -- they could -- never could build a bridge.</span> <span id="s2013">That’s why they had to go around.</span> <span id="s2014">We don’t let them through the bridge, let’s go around.</span> <span id="s2015">So, then I was sent -- that’s was already -- we already free people -- already we -- the Russian army free.</span> <span id="s2016">So, like I say, some of them -- most of them were sent on the front.</span> <span id="s2017">A lot of the farmers were sent back with the children -- families.</span> <span id="s2018">The families sent all back home and I was with -- I was -- from the -- and that three of -- three more from the Proushinna Jewish partisans, sent to Proushinna to establish the order -- establish order.</span> <span id="s2019">So my job, so I did my job, which satisfaction, I can say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: Tell us just about walking in -- on to your street to go into your house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: Oh, to the -- in my house, oh well, so I see that -- I see the family, with little children and I -- I says --</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: Tell us just about walking in -- on to your street to go into your house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: Oh, to the -- in my house, oh well, so I see that -- I see the family, with little children and I -- I says -- sh -- and she was li -- probably a little scared and I says -- she’s going to -- that’s all I wanted, give me one room.</span> <span id="s2024">You know, I had my -- my automatic gun and all that.</span> <span id="s2025">I was in like a military.</span> <span id="s2026">I had to control -- to take control of the city.</span> <span id="s2027">I says, “I don’t want anything, just -- just” -- she didn’t have much to give me anyway, [indecipherable] poor.</span> <span id="s2028">No, it’s ju -- so, I stayed here -- I slept there and eventually we -- you know, they was -- came in -- the Russian took over this -- after a couple weeks, the Russian took over the city and I was still in -- in Proushinna and my job was that I’m to try and get all - mostly identify all the collaborators.</span> <span id="s2029">All those collaborators who didn’t have a chance to escape and to find out about all the card -- all the collaborators here, yeah.</span> <span id="s2030">I was, you know, assigned, working with the -- with the -- we call that the internal police -- with the Russian internal police.</span> <span id="s2031">And they know, they -- you know, they knew -- you know, I’m Jew -- a Jew -- I probably know -- I was in the ghetto, probably if I know who was a policeman, who was this -- who was -- who was a collaborator.</span> <span id="s2032">So we’d -- we cleaned up q-quite a few collaborators and we send them that time -- you know, were sent to Siberia, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: Can you tell us a story?</span> <span id="s2034">I mean, was there a particular one who had informed in a situation and you thought -- you know, this person, when we were in the ghetto, told on us and I want to make sure -- in -- is there a story you can tell us about a particular person who was a collaborator?</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: Well, this -- there is -- well, there were a lot.</span> <span id="s2036">There were a lo -- there were quite a few, there was a lot.</span> <span id="s2037">I mean, f-f-for -- like, for instance a policeman, he was a Polish policeman and -- was cabbage -- was cabbage -- you know he was my -- probably was my age.</span> <span id="s2038">You know, th-that time -- you know, the ger -- the Germans, they didn’t appointed those people.</span> <span id="s2039">They were -- they were -- they were -- I mean volunteering.</span> <span id="s2040">You know, there’s not such a thing volunteering.</span> <span id="s2041">Not everybody wanted to be a -- a cop or not everybody wanted to be policeman, not everybody wanted to participate and go and kill and -- an-and -- an-and -- an-and do all kind of criminal -- commit all kind of atrocities like that.</span> <span id="s2042">But some figured, well, in the beginning, in ‘40, figured the Germans going to win the war.</span> <span id="s2043">They never realized, you know, everybody was -- you know, everybody was impression.</span> <span id="s2044">See, my father was a pessimist, he says, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2045">He says, “No, now boys, nothing doing,” he says.</span> <span id="s2046">“The Germans,” this was in 1941.</span> <span id="s2047">“They took -- they control all Europe, see?”</span> <span id="s2048">So then I stayed in Proushinna and I got to tell you that.</span> <span id="s2049">The doctor, which I mentioned, the neighbor of mine, that Olga Goldfein, arrived in Proushinna.</span> <span id="s2050">She was saved -- now, she escaped from the trains in -- she escaped from the trains in the -- from the station at night and she came to Proushinna to the -- to that convent -- nun convent -- Christian convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q: To a convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A: Convent, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: And she was befriended with a nun and her name -- you know, her name is DellaRosa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Because, she came with her in Proushinna, when I was in Proushinna.</span> <span id="s2056">And I was shocked to s -- you know, how did you?</span> <span id="s2057">So, what happened, she -- and she was probably -- I mean in the 50’s, you know -- not the -- not the -- maybe -- maybe 60.</span> <span id="s2058">And she escaped from that wagons and she followed 10 kilometers and she came to Proushinna to the nun.</span> <span id="s2059">The nun gave her the -- the -- you know, she got the clothes and she put a c-cross on her.</span> <span id="s2060">But the -- the -- the -- she told -- she told me -- this is after the liberation, now, she told me that sh -- now the -- the -- in charge of that convent, they call it a -- the -- what you call it a maynon orsed something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Mother Superior?</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: The mother -- the Mother Superior, of course, wasn’t satisfied, she says better take her and go away with her, deep in Poland, where nobody knows.</span> <span id="s2063">She was afraid that -- you know, sometimes -- you -- you know, you -- sometimes maybe -- maybe somebody’ll discover.</span> <span id="s2064">You can’t blame her, you know, they discover.</span> <span id="s2065">So she took -- you know, when she came in and the next day, you know, with the blessing with the Mother Superior, the blessing, she went the -- she actually comes from the different town.</span> <span id="s2066">She comes some -- the towns near Lódz.</span> <span id="s2067">And she -- they traveled somehow with her -- with the doctor.</span> <span id="s2068">And she spent all those years as a nun -- I mean as a doctor and n-not a doctor and she’s wo -- you know, s-she was giving -- helping peop -- I mean, she’s a doctor, they were so -- oh, they were surprised.</span> <span id="s2069">So when sh -- she came back, in Proushinna with this nun, [indecipherable] the nun, of course I will help.</span> <span id="s2070">So, I tried -- I cou -- was able to do a lot of things here in Proushinna.</span> <span id="s2071">Oh, anything you know, I tried to help the nun with -- with convent -- even the whole convent to supply, make sure they have enough food.</span> <span id="s2072">It was still -- you know, the wa -- still with the Russians.</span> <span id="s2073">It’s still -- the war was still -- 1944, still the war was going on and all that.</span> <span id="s2074">And yeah, she -- she’s on the list [indecipherable] Rosa, she’s on -- you know, she’s on the li -- she is on the list, I saw her in the museum on the -- from the Righteous Gentiles, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2075">The funny part is this, that this doctor - now, when I left Proushinna, my town, eventually I had to get out.</span> <span id="s2076">My brother was in Bialystok and I was in Proushinna.</span> <span id="s2077">And Bialystok was a temporary capital of Poland.</span> <span id="s2078">They didn’t take Warsaw yet.</span> <span id="s2079">So, my brother was smarter, he wanted to get to the United States, so he didn’t want to -- he knew he’ll -- that as long he can -- he was nearer there, that he g-got out to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s2080">So finally I discovered that he is in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s2081">Now, for me it was a tough job getting out from Proushinna, because of my position.</span> <span id="s2082">I told my commander -- you know, the commander from the -- from the -- from the brigade was in Proushinna too, he was there.</span> <span id="s2083">So, I told him, you know, I have only brother and he’s al -- left of family and he is in Bialystok and this is already Poland.</span> <span id="s2084">Proushinna is White Russia.</span> <span id="s2085">And so he said, “Oh yeah, you got a brother left?</span> <span id="s2086">I’m going to se -- we going to bring him, send a plane, we’ll bring him -- bring him here,” he says[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2087">So that’s up to him, now.</span> <span id="s2088">This was already a -- I was in Proushinna already about four, five months.</span> <span id="s2089">This was close to -- the war was still going on, Russia wasn’t taken yet.</span> <span id="s2090">So, finally, he would release me, my commander.</span> <span id="s2091">But he says, “It’s not up to me, I have to go up to the -- you know, to higher -- to the region commander.”</span> <span id="s2092">Now, I went down to the region commander and he send with a letter -- and the region -- you know, the reason I gave you know, the only -- family I lost -- have the only brother.</span> <span id="s2093">So the region commander says that well, that’s good, yeah, t-take fr-fr -- it’s a good -- I didn’t know they sent me with a secret letter back in Proushinna, but then I discovered that it -- he -- he mentioned that it’s a -- for me, if I want to take, you know, go on the front and kill svor -- kill as many more -- you know, take revenge for my family, as many to -- he is a good c-candidate to go on the front.</span> <span id="s2094">I’m a good candidate to go on the front, you understand?</span> <span id="s2095">It means because, well they figured the c -- well, I want to get out, you know, it was you couldn’t get out that time yet.</span> <span id="s2096">1944, you -- 19.</span> <span id="s2097">Then they passed a law in 194- -- late 19 -- after the war, you know the p -- the law was passed that all those citizens, Polish citizens from before the war, Proushinna, I was -- was Polish citizens, because mostly partisans, lot of them -- lot of survivors from the Auschwitz, you know, they came back to Proushinna.</span> <span id="s2098">And eventually was -- you know, you could apply, it was legal.</span> <span id="s2099">You could have -- you could have gone to Poland.</span> <span id="s2100">But it -- I had a tough time getting out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: I just want to go back a little bit, to Proushinna.</span> <span id="s2104">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: When you first returned and you’re staying back at your house, did you th -- were people coming back?</span> <span id="s2106">Were Jews beginning to come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: And did you think perhaps family members might come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: When I -- this was in -- I was liberated in June, 1944.</span> <span id="s2110">In Proushinna, only the few partisans who -- who were assigned to go to Proushinna and there I mentioned the doctors unusual case.</span> <span id="s2111">And no, there was -- I left -- I left Proushinna in late ‘44.</span> <span id="s2112">It means I didn’t leave Proushinna.</span> <span id="s2113">I had to take off abba partisan.</span> <span id="s2114">I knew the territory.</span> <span id="s2115">In order to -- you know it came to a point that I wanted to go to Bialystok and be with my brother.</span> <span id="s2116">And while in Proushinna, after the liberation, 1944, I wrote a letter to my uncle, which probably you read, yeah?</span> <span id="s2117">I had a chance -- it took a long, long -- I knew that -- that my brother’s in Bialystok already, so I knew that he survived.</span> <span id="s2118">So it took a long -- some -- a long, long time.</span> <span id="s2119">I think they got it in -- sometimes in 1945 in May, almost from the war -- almost fr -- the war was over kind of late, took very long.</span> <span id="s2120">And I left Proushinna in s -- close -- June, July, Aug -- maybe around September, and -- in order to get into Bialystok.</span> <span id="s2121">So in -- I had to take -- I knew the territory, so I had to take the doctor and the nun with me and we -- you know, we crossed the water.</span> <span id="s2122">It was between -- Bialystok was already Poland, not far f -- what I [indecipherable] over the border.</span> <span id="s2123">So at night, somehow we smuggled through and with the -- with -- I was -- I -- I still was in charge, I could -- I’d been assigned, I can assign a farmer -- you know, to -- for -- for the job.</span> <span id="s2124">I says, “We need you to go in here and there.”</span> <span id="s2125">So we assigned a farmer and the doctor and the nun and I left Proushinna and we were -- and we came to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s2126">This was -- this was smuggling, I mean -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2127">This was illegal.</span> <span id="s2128">It’s taking a chance for -- for that other -- other way.</span> <span id="s2129">It was deserting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q: You -- technically you were deserting?</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: Well, I -- I was -- I was still assigned.</span> <span id="s2132">They wouldn’t let me -- they wouldn’t let me go.</span> <span id="s2133">I was still assigned there, the job.</span> <span id="s2134">So, it means, you know, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: How did you feel about that?</span> <span id="s2136">A: How did I feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: About that?</span> <span id="s2138">That you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: Well, I f -- I was determined, you know, I was determined that -- that I want to -- you know, I want to go west, you know.</span> <span id="s2140">I was determined -- feel about it.</span> <span id="s2141">You know, it’s okay, I was a fighter, but I didn’t believe -- I wasn’t Communist.</span> <span id="s2142">I didn’t -- I knew that’s -- that’s -- I -- I -- I appreciate and acknowledge the help the Russians did to us.</span> <span id="s2143">But I wanted -- you know, I didn’t want to stay.</span> <span id="s2144">I didn’t know that it -- you know, that eventually I’ll be free and I’ll be able to legally leave Proushinna, like some other ones.</span> <span id="s2145">Now, I came in Bialystok, late ‘44.</span> <span id="s2146">Now, Warsaw was still -- [indecipherable] wasn’t taken yet, because there was a big, big battle [indecipherable] Warsaw, you know.</span> <span id="s2147">I remember there was the Polish army which was associated with the Russian army.</span> <span id="s2148">There was two Polish armies.</span> <span id="s2149">One Polish army was established in Russia, which the Russian took prisoners, most of the Polish army.</span> <span id="s2150">This was -- you know, when the pact -- unknown pact, Hitler and -- and Stalin made the pact and when the Germans in 1939 pushed the -- no -- attacked, most of the army retreated east, towards the Russian border.</span> <span id="s2151">And eventually got trapped in Russia and took in prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: You -- a -- a minute ago you mentioned that -- that you were -- that you had gratitude towards the Russians for what they’d done.</span> <span id="s2153">Can you just talk a little bit about how the Russians treated you?</span> <span id="s2154">Did they treat you any differently because you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s2155">Did you ever experience [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: Th-There -- well, there was a little, not -- the -- t-to say, really the Russians, they -- the westerners in there.</span> <span id="s2157">There were -- there were not so anti-Semitic than the eastern.</span> <span id="s2158">You know, we had a lot of eastern Bellarussians, you know.</span> <span id="s2159">And, very little -- there was the -- there was more, I would say, there was even in -- even in the -- in the partisans, you know, you felt like they call you some names.</span> <span id="s2160">You know, the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Were they fair to you, though, when you were under their command?</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: Oh yeah, they were f -- they were fair to me, because -- because they -- they appreciate my work.</span> <span id="s2163">Put it this way, not because -- I don’t know if I’m -- was a Jew, because they appreciated the -- the work I was doing and -- and I was devoted to doing the job.</span> <span id="s2164">That’s the pri -- that’s the appreciation, I think they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: At this point, di -- what did you know, or what -- what did you know about your f -- your family, besides your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: Well, here -- I came in Bialystok and I s -- I wind up -- so we stayed in Bialystok for about maybe three or four months.</span> <span id="s2167">And in Bialystok I met a girl, the first girl which was liberated from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2168">This was in the beginning, 19 -- I think in the beginning -- beginning 1945.</span> <span id="s2169">So, Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet army, I think it was in -- sometimes in ‘45 in January.</span> <span id="s2170">Now, she came to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s2171">She was a young girl and I met her there and she’s the one told me that Proushinna was taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2172">Otherwise I wouldn’t e -- I wouldn’t even know that they took -- you know, she told me, she just -- she was survivor from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2173">S-So I told her, you know, don’t go to Proushinna, I’m just coming back from Proushinna.</span> <span id="s2174">I can tell you who is there.</span> <span id="s2175">She thought maybe you know, maybe some survivor, something, you -- you know.</span> <span id="s2176">So, some -- a few though -- I think went back -- when they were liberated in 19 -- beginning 1945.</span> <span id="s2177">I was in Proushinna, but I know a few came to Proushinna.</span> <span id="s2178">And some -- there is a -- there is still in Proushinna I would say, a community.</span> <span id="s2179">I would say maybe a self -- some came back s -- from Auschwitz and maybe they settled there.</span> <span id="s2180">Some came back from the front.</span> <span id="s2181">You know, a lot of Proushinna maybe was in the Russian army, you know.</span> <span id="s2182">So there is maybe 50 Jews there, in the whole city.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: So when you left and you were on your way to Bialystok, when you left your house, did - did -- did you take anything from the house?</span> <span id="s2184">Something small?</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s2186">I didn’t -- I didn’t -- I d -- no, didn’t interest me, nothing.</span> <span id="s2187">No, I didn’t -- it -- the house.</span> <span id="s2188">If I wanted, I didn’t -- I wasn’t interested that.</span> <span id="s2189">I could have taken -- I have a -- I had a possibility of taking a -- a -- if greedy, taking a lot of things, because, you know, I - I was -- you n -- I -- I -- I -- I had the power -- I had the power to -- to assign and take and do and anything.</span> <span id="s2190">I just helped the doctor and helped the nun what I can and then, as a matter of fact, she [indecipherable] adopted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: We a manats -- I mean that -- I mean she -- she was like a mother to me… Yeah… So, in Bialystok, when I wrote a letter and that time I got in contact -- I was from the first -- from the first -- you know, from the first survivors, we got -- they discovered about me, my brother, that’s the organization we’re already operating in Bialystok, we had already from the -- from the Joint Distribution, we had all -- we had from -- from different kind organizations, not only Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s2193">It was a lot of -- it was at -- esta-established the capital of Poland.</span> <span id="s2194">So there was evil -- I didn’t even know the evil was there in Bialystok, so, oh you been sa -- partisan, I said par -- yes.</span> <span id="s2195">Well, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2196">They wanted -- you know, there was no survivors, yet we didn’t know about Auschwitz, we didn’t know -- the f -- we -- we didn’t know where any concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2197">So he says, “Did you kept the diary?”</span> <span id="s2198">I -- I says, “What diary?”</span> <span id="s2199">I says, “No.”</span> <span id="s2200">And they -- well they k-kept me there for couple weeks.</span> <span id="s2201">They said, “Think.”</span> <span id="s2202">You know, go home, something.</span> <span id="s2203">Think and certain dates, pick certain dates.</span> <span id="s2204">For instance, what did you do as -- in the regional part -- Jewish partisan, this -- you know, or that day -- or that day, a few days, or -- especially, you know, about -- they were interested in activities, about the life.</span> <span id="s2205">And they so -- I -- I’ve -- that time, I told them the same story.</span> <span id="s2206">You know, little bit more -- the same story about the life in the ghetto, before the ghetto and all the same and I -- and -- and -- and about my parents and -- and -- and they were especially interested about the partisan, Jewish li -- Jewish -- the activities, tell me.</span> <span id="s2207">So I told them, ya -- that we were a group and -- and -- and we escaped the same -- the date we escaped and all this, the same story of we did.</span> <span id="s2208">How we organized, how we smuggled in this -- all this business and especially and they were interested in the J -- Jewish group and then if we participated in any mission as Jewish group.</span> <span id="s2209">So I told them yes, Je-Jewish beside that, we did participated.</span> <span id="s2210">Like, I mentioned couple times that -- that we had those couple more missions as a Jewish group.</span> <span id="s2211">We went in near Proushinna and we had to get some -- you know, we had to get some arms for the rest of the boys.</span> <span id="s2212">We had a group of 60 there, you know, some olders.</span> <span id="s2213">Not everybody -- wh-when the ro -- this is before we joined, you know, before we joined the Russian, but it was the -- it is -- we’ll call it a s -- a c -- a command s-structural command -- command from Russia, an order with discipline and all that.</span> <span id="s2214">So, yeah we -- we participated in -- one time we went near Proushinna and -- and we ambushed three German soldiers, we got three rifles, so we brought three rifles.</span> <span id="s2215">This is beside -- beside what I participated from there.</span> <span id="s2216">And especially this -- yeah, the activities.</span> <span id="s2217">And I mentioned m-most of it, but the main th -- I’ve -- the main thing what I didn’t mention, in 1944, in May, we went through -- this is called -- a call -- a raid.</span> <span id="s2218">A -- a -- this mission, destroy -- the Germans mobilized three divisions.</span> <span id="s2219">One German division and two -- this was in 1945 and two Hungarians, because I didn’t know the Hungarians were allies for the -- the Hungarians, I think they -- they -- they allied -- they were with the j -- with the -- and Ro -- and Romania and Hungaria, you know, they were allies for the Germans.</span> <span id="s2220">So they -- they -- th -- I mean, you know, they were in -- in the -- in German uniforms, though, in German uniform.</span> <span id="s2221">And it came an order that we had to go through and clean them out once and for all.</span> <span id="s2222">So it consisted from three divisions, 75,000 s-strong.</span> <span id="s2223">And they came in -- we knew already in advan -- you know, we had tiptoe if we had lotake.</span> <span id="s2224">We had good connection from the villages.</span> <span id="s2225">And that time, it came an order from all the brigades, from all over stretching from this -- from eastern Poland, way up in Lithuania, whatever, deep to the Russian territory, that we have to -- this was impor -- imp -- that we, first of all, we have to mine all the roads and mine all the bridges.</span> <span id="s2226">And we’re not going to get involved in the fight with them.</span> <span id="s2227">There’s no match, because tanks and -- and artillery, there’s no match.</span> <span id="s2228">But the first priority is to save the family -- family u -- the family we -- units.</span> <span id="s2229">And that was a job.</span> <span id="s2230">So, we had to take them out, way in the swamps, you know, hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s2231">And we decided that -- that we going to -- we going to even mine the little roads where it leads to our bunkers and to our -- you know, we had the -- the fields with the cows, everything was mined.</span> <span id="s2232">We decided we’re going to retreat in certain -- way up in the pinz -- the -- that -- that was swamps.</span> <span id="s2233">So, in order to get int -- and in the swamps we had to go way up here in -- in mud, all the partisans.</span> <span id="s2234">And some of the -- you know, those -- those who couldn’t make it -- we had to help the elderly and you know, we -- in advance -- so we whack away that first olea -- the f -- the family airtrads.</span> <span id="s2235">Unfortunately there is only one occasion, there is one group, a family was abandoned, yeah.</span> <span id="s2236">It was from the [indecipherable], I think it’s 18.</span> <span id="s2237">Well, so they and from all this, they went through the -- all the woods.</span> <span id="s2238">They went in, they discovered our bunkers, they find everything.</span> <span id="s2239">But -- they destroyed our cows, they destroyed our horses, they blew out our bunkers and they destroyed our cemetery.</span> <span id="s2240">We had a ce -- yeah, they destroyed our cemetery.</span> <span id="s2241">And not a single -- we retreated at -- and well, there was 17 from the family which they found, unfortunate.</span> <span id="s2242">It’s -- we had very little -- th-there’s very -- and not much, I mean casualties, very small.</span> <span id="s2243">But, de -- what I’m saying, the big -- what they -- that’s all they could do is to destroy and -- and even to dis -- dis -- the cow there -- kill the cows.</span> <span id="s2244">They didn’t take the cow, kill the cows, kill the horses and -- and -- and -- and -- and blow up the bun -- blow up all the bunker.</span> <span id="s2245">And eventually we came, you know, they retreated.</span> <span id="s2246">They retreated, that’s -- that’s all and finally -- next -- this May -- in June we were already -- in June we already -- we’re already liberated.</span> <span id="s2247">I mean they were so desperate, they figure they will pull out the -- pull -- you know, they were retreating, they were s -- getting such a beating.</span> <span id="s2248">You know, there’s such a beating, you know.</span> <span id="s2249">Retreating in such a disarray, but it still -- they decided, well, we got to clean up -- we got to get those partisans -- to catch the partisans, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: Wh-While I have you talking about that, there was one thing I sort of skipped over.</span> <span id="s2251">When you had described the machine gun that you worked with --</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Q: And then never got you to tell us actually how it was used when you -- you shot it at the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">A: Yeah, it was a -- it -- this was -- this was very -- it’s as just the same as a -- it’s just the same as a rifle.</span> <span id="s2255">It’s a big gun, and there were more [indecipherable] the engine is so big, that you -- you know, you just place it -- you just place it, you know, and you shoot, you know.</span> <span id="s2256">If you don’t hit the first time, she hit a second time.</span> <span id="s2257">This was -- yeah, it’s -- it -- it was just a simple thing -- a simple thing.</span> <span id="s2258">You know, you did -- you didn’t -- you didn’t try to pinpoint a certain -- it’s a big, big, big engine, you know.</span> <span id="s2259">And you lay -- it’s got to go -- we were pretty close, you know, we lay in the woods there, near there in a spot, you know, waiting exactly when it’s going to reach and there’s a perfect time to hit it.</span> <span id="s2260">There’s no pro -- it was no problem.</span> <span id="s2261">This was mine -- this was -- this was minor.</span> <span id="s2262">This was very easy, minor.</span> <span id="s2263">It happened one time that -- that we were cut off and we were chased and you know, the Germans, they yugerfer -- they called reinforcement and more reinforcement and they chased us in the wood and I had, you know and I had to run with that -- with that gun and I told the commander that -- everybody was in disarray, everybody was running and I says, you know, “Save the guy, it’s heavy, I’m going to drop.”</span> <span id="s2264">I s -- told.</span> <span id="s2265">So nobody wanted to replace, nobody wanted to replace.</span> <span id="s2266">Everybody was running to -- deeper in the woods left and right.</span> <span id="s2267">The commander -- the commander -- I told the commander save that -- save that -- you know, I’m going to -- I can’t carry any more.</span> <span id="s2268">So he took it over.</span> <span id="s2269">He saved it.</span> <span id="s2270">That’s why -- that -- that’s why they decorated me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: Because you carried the gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2273">Because it’s -- it’s not so much I told him, I says, “Save the gun, don’t save me, save the gun.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">Q: Do you still have that?</span> <span id="s2275">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: That -- was the decoration a pin or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: Well, it’s not -- th-they -- they gave me a decoration, that’s -- they gave me at that time, they -- they -- you know, they -- when they -- we came, they -- they -- their trat was all lined out and they -- they -- we call it -- you know, the commander says for the bravery and this and that.</span> <span id="s2278">I mean, it was not.</span> <span id="s2279">They -- w-we didn’t -- they didn’t give any medals out like in the military [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">Q: But they honored you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">A: No, ou -- but they honored me, yeah, but I mean, it’s not only what they honored me, I mean they respected me more than honor, see.</span> <span id="s2282">That’s why th-the respect alone is worth -- they respected me.</span> <span id="s2283">And that’s why I was -- you know, they sent me to Proushinna.</span> <span id="s2284">I could have been sent on the front -- I would be on the front, maybe -- I don’t know if I would survive or not.</span> <span id="s2285">Because, you know, the front -- you know -- there’s so many -- was terrible on the fr -- the -- you know, for the German -- Russian, it was so brutal.</span> <span id="s2286">Can you imagine 3,000,000 -- 3,000,000 Russian soldiers killed?</span> <span id="s2287">Not speaking about -- not speaking about taking prisoners.</span> <span id="s2288">3,000,000 soldiers… that’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: Wh-Wh-What was it like to be back in Proushinna?</span> <span id="s2290">I mean, you’d grown up there.</span> <span id="s2291">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: I mean you had to run away from [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: Well I didn’t -- that’s -- that’s dead -- I mean, didn’t interest me.</span> <span id="s2294">Y-Y -- I mean th-they say, you came back and there’s no -- I mean you don’t have no family, you don’t have nothing and that -- it -- it why -- didn’t i-interest me very much to be in Proushinna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Some settled in Proushinna, see?</span> <span id="s2296">Well, I -- I knew I have an uncle, I have the feeling -- see, my brother, especially, we o -- he wanted to come to United States before.</span> <span id="s2297">I was too young and now -- they were going to bring the whole family, see?</span> <span id="s2298">My uncle -- I had -- I had my -- see my uncle in Syracuse was a belt -- you -- was a manufact -- pants manufacturer.</span> <span id="s2299">He’s esta-establish a factory in -- in -- I mean he had -- it’s no problem, but even though -- even though with eff -- can you imagine, when you -- in -- we came after the war, we had to be two years in those DP camps, sitting, waiting.</span> <span id="s2300">And they bombarded us with letters and my cousin wrote to -- he wrote to the consulate and -- and he says an -- those -- those little two devils, they -- who knows -- who knows -- those two devils, who knows how many -- how many se -- American soldiers they ma -- they saved through the war?</span> <span id="s2301">But you had to wait for the quota, nothing else, so the consulate -- I still have the decor -- the consulate wrote to him, sorry, you know, and he -- well, he tried to get in through the -- through the Joint World Organization, but you know, you -- nowadays you got immigration, everybody -- even, you know, it’s -- it’s so easy and here you have -- you have papers made out, guaranteed job, guaranteed home, guaranteed everything and -- and -- and you have to wait from 1945 to 1947, til June 1947, I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Two years I had to s -- be in the unrah camps, you know.</span> <span id="s2303">You heard it -- the unrah.</span> <span id="s2304">It wasn’t bad, I mean we had to -- we had -- in the camps they supplied us with already -- we had plenty of food, even beer, you know.</span> <span id="s2305">So much, each one was assigned a portion -- a ration, beer.</span> <span id="s2306">The Germans had a lot of beer.</span> <span id="s2307">I remember we used to get beer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: Wh-What was that -- tell us about when you finally saw your brother again.</span> <span id="s2309">You had been separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">Q: Where was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">A: He was in Bia -- he -- he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: What -- what were some of the things that you said to each other in those first hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">A: Well, yeah -- well, he heard -- he heard already that I’m on the way with that -- you know, that’s -- matter -- I brought a cow [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2315">Now, the only thing what I brought from -- from -- from Proushinna, when I traveled, so I had a cow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">Q: A cow?</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: A cow, yeah, attached to the wagon, with the doctor.</span> <span id="s2318">So I figure, what I’m going to take, the house?</span> <span id="s2319">I’m my -- you cannot sell it.</span> <span id="s2320">I mean the house -- y- you can -- what was -- what -- what is a house?</span> <span id="s2321">I mean there is no value.</span> <span id="s2322">I don’t know -- I don’t know there was a market for it.</span> <span id="s2323">So I figure I’m going to bring a cow.</span> <span id="s2324">At least in Poland, in Bialystok you can sell a cow and get -- and get the -- I don’t know, 10 dollars or five dollars or something.</span> <span id="s2325">And just for -- just for fun of it, sa -- that’s all is I brought -- I brought a cow.</span> <span id="s2326">So he heard already, you know.</span> <span id="s2327">I think -- I th -- I -- he heard that -- you know, he’s on the way.</span> <span id="s2328">They -- you know, from rumors, he’s on the way to -- traveling with a cow, with a doctor, with a nun.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: And how did you find him?</span> <span id="s2330">Was it difficult to find him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2332">There was -- i-it was easy.</span> <span id="s2333">You know that you -- like I say, you had that Jewish -- that’s the Jewish o -- council there and you had organization and they -- it’s -- I’m afraid -- they -- they didn’t know much about all the survivors, but they knew, you know, they knew who was in Bialystok, you know.</span> <span id="s2334">If you want to look for somebody, you go in there.</span> <span id="s2335">And -- you know, had a -- a-anybody was registered right there, you -- from all these -- from all the survivors.</span> <span id="s2336">Mostly -- eventually, like when I came, there was still -- you know, there’s still -- the c-camps were -- I did -- the camps were still -- Auschwitz wasn’t even liberated.</span> <span id="s2337">And -- and -- I didn’t hear -- that’s -- I didn’t hear about Auschwitz, even in -- see -- even in the woods.</span> <span id="s2338">You see, it was impossible sometimes -- I would say to s -- there’s never s -- never was an escapee from the camp.</span> <span id="s2339">Speaking -- they had -- they had -- they had not only Jews, they had, you know, prisoners, Poles and the Russians and they had Gypsies there, all.</span> <span id="s2340">Sometime -- you weren’t be able to escape from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: Did you find -- did you go and look?</span> <span id="s2342">Did you -- in -- in -- in the lists of people, thinking that your sisters might be there?</span> <span id="s2343">Or your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">A: Well, well, when I met the girl, the first girl from -- from Bialy -- the one in Bialystok, so I knew they went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2345">Now, I know they went to Auschwitz, so -- as a rule, you know my sister was -- the -- you know, they was -- they were too young yet, you know, in Auschwitz the way the system, so they separated those -- those -- those who are able to work yet, know -- women or men and th-they -- they weren’t -- you know, I -- I -- I was sure that, you know, they went to the right or the left.</span> <span id="s2346">They went to right, they went in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s2347">Because otherwise you know, you do -- would have known.</span> <span id="s2348">I didn’t expect my mother -- I didn’t expect -- the only thing I resent is -- you know, I could have -- if I would know, know -- that’s what -- if I would know, I -- ner -- I could have saved one sister.</span> <span id="s2349">If she would be with me -- with us in the bunker, like some other strangers, she would be -- she would survived.</span> <span id="s2350">I mean, she would went through, see?</span> <span id="s2351">Even though, well, she was -- she was -- would have been 17 years old, a big girl -- a big girl, see?</span> <span id="s2352">So it’s -- I don’t know, like I say, it’s hard to say if you did the right thing or na -- if I did the right thing or the wrong thing, I wouldn’t say -- I -- they let history say, I -- I couldn’t say the -- really, if it is the right thing.</span> <span id="s2353">You know, I was asked -- I was asked this question.</span> <span id="s2354">I don’t know, you know, if it’s, yeah do I feel?</span> <span id="s2355">That’s -- how -- about -- you know, about going through all that.</span> <span id="s2356">But I know one thing that, you know -- that it’s important as a survivor that -- I have a duty to -- to tell this -- you know, to the story for the future -- future generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: One thing I [indecipherable] think I read, that for all -- you told me too, that earlier in your life, you didn’t really like to talk about this.</span> <span id="s2358">That you didn’t -- you really --</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">A: Oh no, I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">Q: -- you wouldn’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">A: No, I didn’t, I -- right, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s2362">I -- the children knew a little, I -- I didn’t because I was -- I tried to -- I -- you know, I was raising a family, three children and I was in business and I worked hard and somehow, you know, I tried -- it was -- I tr -- I tried to -- not to advertise.</span> <span id="s2363">I mean my family knew, the children, you know.</span> <span id="s2364">I wasn’t advertise.</span> <span id="s2365">I was approached a way -- I was approached a couple times by -- you know, when it comes -- Yom HaShoah or something and I -- from the television years ago.</span> <span id="s2366">And I didn’t -- didn’t want to re-really, you know, this twa -- the -- all the -- all the stories.</span> <span id="s2367">Tried to -- I tried to, somehow to make peace with that.</span> <span id="s2368">Forget it and make peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: So what changed your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: Well, I think my son influenced me, yeah.</span> <span id="s2371">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2372">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2373">And he’s active and I’m glad about that, yeah.</span> <span id="s2374">He’s active.</span> <span id="s2375">He influenced me, he said, “Dad, you got to tell your story.”</span> <span id="s2376">And finally up in public and this -- I started -- I wrote it in the -- in that -- first I gave him a chance.</span> <span id="s2377">I didn’t want to go to the papers.</span> <span id="s2378">So, I figured for -- in Syracuse and I came ri -- you know, fir -- all the -- came right to Syracuse and it’s 50 years.</span> <span id="s2379">I decided it was 50 years, 194- -- 1994, 50 years liberation and, well maybe it’s a time to say -- 50 years liberation.</span> <span id="s2380">I was liberated in 1944 and this was 19 -- 1994, so I figured I’ll write a little -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2381">And -- and it was this -- the city was -- was shocked.</span> <span id="s2382">They [indecipherable] I’m the only -- they say the only -- we have quite a few and there is a lot -- I mean, and of course the -- it’s already the -- all the ones -- a lot of them are gone, you know, are gone.</span> <span id="s2383">How many more years do I have?</span> <span id="s2384">But as a rule, you know, I’m the young one, comparison -- I was only 20, you know when I -- 20 when I escaped, but if somebody was 30 or 25 - 30 or 40, th -- you know, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2385">So they probably gone, they -- [indecipherable] are gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Q: One story that I didn’t get you to tell then, which is about the Leaman brothers and the rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: Oh well, the -- well, the Leaman -- we killed the Leaman brothers.</span> <span id="s2388">That’s -- you know, I told you, we ki --</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q: Yes, but I didn’t know the rest of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A: I -- yeah, the Leaman brothers, you know, when we as -- we were assigned -- the partisans that time, we were strong together.</span> <span id="s2391">We couldn’t do it ourselves as a group.</span> <span id="s2392">We could never do that -- we didn’t have the power and the ammunition to do that.</span> <span id="s2393">But from an -- already being assigned to the brigade, so I told the commandeer and he said, “Hadashov we’ll -- let’s try it.”</span> <span id="s2394">I says, “We got to get -- that’s the easy job, to get this guy.”</span> <span id="s2395">Because he was -- he was a terrible Nazi.</span> <span id="s2396">And I mean, it’s -- it’s worthwhile, so we got him.</span> <span id="s2397">And the second -- you mentioned that -- yeah, but of all this, yeah.</span> <span id="s2398">I -- I found out about the rabbi.</span> <span id="s2399">Now, there’s a lot -- among the f -- 22 Jewish Judenrat, is -- only two survived -- you know, 20 perished in Auschwitz and two survived.</span> <span id="s2400">One is in -- this -- they already both dead.</span> <span id="s2401">They -- they all -- I mean, they survived.</span> <span id="s2402">One was in United States and one was in Israel.</span> <span id="s2403">Now, they wrote the same thing at Yad Vashem, they wrote their stories.</span> <span id="s2404">And the one is in -- the one was in the United States is a s -- is Sagell.</span> <span id="s2405">He was the Foreign Minister.</span> <span id="s2406">Now, he’s -- before the war, he was ins -- in the business in Danzig, somehow in the export -- import you international.</span> <span id="s2407">He s-speak fluently, German.</span> <span id="s2408">An intellectual, you know, educated man, they made him Foreign Minister.</span> <span id="s2409">So he wrote something -- you know, we had a pinkus -- you call that a me -- a memorial book.</span> <span id="s2410">From - my story is from the -- is from the evewa -- you know, eva what -- what they -- eventually was printed in Israel in Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s2411">I didn’t even know, I discovered that in the 1950’s, that they had evewa eventually printed at -- in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2412">I wrote it -- you know, I wrote it in Yiddish and I had that in book in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2413">And -- and so this Sagell, he was in charge about dealing and wheeling with the Burgermeister and all the transports, where is -- was coming in and anything coming in in the ghetto -- outside the ghetto, he was responsible, he was dealing direct with the -- with the Burgermeister, with the SS.</span> <span id="s2414">So, he says, from the Bialystok I came in -- that’s what I -- what came in a transfer from Bialystok, he had to receive them and they came in by truck.</span> <span id="s2415">Because far -- like I say, some of them had to march -- they marched them.</span> <span id="s2416">They brought in two hun -- 2000.</span> <span id="s2417">It took about couple days.</span> <span id="s2418">So, he says, here is -- you know, here is your shyser, you take them in now.</span> <span id="s2419">I don’t know if you understand in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: Here is your shy -- the Jews what from Bialystok.</span> <span id="s2422">Here is your shyser, take him in in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2423">The shyser is partly -- you know what I mean in the shyser?</span> <span id="s2424">Well, it’s a -- kitty litter [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: Here is -- you know, take -- here is your shyser, now you take him in.</span> <span id="s2427">This is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2428">Now with the rabbi, this Leaman, I didn’t know that -- you know, he took the rabbi -- it was a lot of -- he took the rabbi, he used the rabbi and he told him -- he was a heavy man, a big man.</span> <span id="s2429">And he to-to-to-told him, take the tallis and twirl it and he told him to march and run, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2430">Now, he was bribed many times.</span> <span id="s2431">He was interested -- he was so interested in the bribe, the big bribe.</span> <span id="s2432">He knew he is going to get -- he -- he could have -- I mean, actually he could have shot the rabbi, he can do anything, I mean he had the power to do anything he want.</span> <span id="s2433">But he probably wanted a big, big bribe.</span> <span id="s2434">So somebody noticed it, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s2435">You know, I didn’t see it, but somebody noticed it in the ghetto, you know.</span> <span id="s2436">You know -- you know, “The ra -- they marching the rabbi, Leaman.”</span> <span id="s2437">So they had to bribe him and in order to release him, see?</span> <span id="s2438">And what happened, he -- he went to Auschwitz the same, he went to Auschwitz, the rabbi.</span> <span id="s2439">But to them it’s -- it’s -- you know, it’s f -- it’s something unusual, right?</span> <span id="s2440">But they ne -- he knew that it’s got a twa -- a tallis.</span> <span id="s2441">They knew -- he’s got twirling.</span> <span id="s2442">I mean they -- they -- they learned, the Jewish -- th-they -- the Jewish history so much, they knew more than I do, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Q: Is there something I haven’t asked you that you would like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: Well…well, the -- well I -- well, what I would say, that m -- that the wor -- ye -- I mean, the world should -- a lesson -- they should learn a lesson from the past, what can happen to a -- what can happen to a nation, it can happen to anybody, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s2445">It means -- it means that you have to f -- you have to f-fight and educate people and -- and - and -- and hope -- and hope that -- that all those people who perished -- I would say didn’t -- didn’t go in vain, what you call that.</span> <span id="s2446">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s2447">And they -- that -- that… that’s what happened, it happened.</span> <span id="s2448">Not much [indecipherable] happened, but I hope it -- you know, it’s -- they sacri -- they should [indecipherable] sacrifice, they shouldn’t happen such a Holocaust again.</span> <span id="s2449">What else can I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: Can you show us some of these photographs?</span> <span id="s2451">Okay, he has the [indecipherable] Would you explain what we’re looking at.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">Q: Yeah, you just hold them up and ex-explain them.</span> <span id="s2453">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: Go ahead, what are we seeing here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: This -- this is a -- a group from my u-unit from the Po-Potomarenko unit partisan, relaxing in the woods.</span> <span id="s2456">I don’t see a fire, but I see a girl playing the -- the mandolin.</span> <span id="s2457">Usually we were -- you -- when we were relaxing, sometimes you make a fire -- around the fire.</span> <span id="s2458">And I think I’m here, on that side here, standing.</span> <span id="s2459">The tall one, right here.</span></p>

closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">A: No, this -- no, this is cut off.</span> <span id="s2465">That’s the same.</span> <span id="s2466">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">A: Yeah.</span>

standing.</span> <span id="s2479">The tall one, right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">Q: Closer view of that side.</span> <span id="s2481">A: Well that’s the same.</span></p> <p><span
