I want us to talk about the—actual war time now in Poland.</span> <span id="s225">This is after the Nazis came into Poland.</span> <span id="s226">You mentioned that it was September of 1939 when the Nazis came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">AS: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">JR: What was the immediate affect that it had on your family?</span> <span id="s229">What did your family think?</span> <span id="s230">What did you think about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">AS: Well, we had a little, before that we lived not too far from the German border.</span> <span id="s232">And we had an experience that the German Jews were driven out from Germany.</span> <span id="s233">It was about, I don't know before the Germans came into Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">JR: You knew about this, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">AS: I remember that, yes.</span> <span id="s236">And they brought the Germans, they threw them on the borderline, no man's land.</span> <span id="s237">And they couldn't go nowhere.</span> <span id="s238">And they were staying there, actually sleeping on the outside.</span> <span id="s239">My father, being he belonged to the Jewish community, he was in the, how would you say, Jewish organization or stuff like that, and he was a veteran, so he went, he interviewed, he talked about, he went in to the Polish government and tried to bring these German Jews into Poland, because we wanted, we didn't want them to stay on the borderline.</span> <span id="s240">So, what happened is, they allowed on one condition, that every family has to bring in a German family, into, that they'll—never come to the burden of the Polish government.</span> <span id="s241">So most of the Jews signed up and somehow we got these—Jewish families, German Jewish families into Poland, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">JR: Did someone come to live with—you?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">AS: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">JR: Do

us on the, they slept wherever we—found, on the floor, wherever we found place for them.</span> <span id="s258">Every family took somebody in.</span> <span id="s259">We, there was a—you had to do it.</span> <span id="s260">There was no way you could say, they came in to you, the Jewish organization came in and says, "Look, we gotta help our brothers.</span> <span id="s261">There's no way out."</span> <span id="s262">And my father was the organizer from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">JR: What was being said at that time in Poland about what was happening in Germany?</span> <span id="s264">Was there any...</span></p> <p><span id="s265">AS: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s266">JR: Thought that this was going to happen in Poland also?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">AS: I have

German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">JR: What did the paper say, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">AS: Well, it says that they, nobody wants the Jews and the Polish government didn't want them, and we have to do something about it, get them out of there.</span> <span id="s272">So, they had an emergency meeting right away, and that's what happened, what I told you before.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">JR: Did anyone realize, in your family realize, did you realize, did your father realize, just how serious the situation was in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">AS: That question puzzles me still till this day.</span> <span id="s275">My father was a very intelligent man.</span> <span id="s276">He was smart.</span> <span id="s277">And he had chances to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s278">My uncle from Connecticut wanted us to come here.</span> <span id="s279">As a matter of fact he wanted to send us, I have some documents, he wanted to send us tickets to come to the World's Fair at that time, just to get out of there.</span> <span id="s280">And I don't know, somehow, I don't have an answer for that, till this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">JR: O.K.</span> <span id="s282">When the Germans came in, what specifically, what movement occurred with you and your family?</span> <span id="s283">Did the Germans come in and arrest you father or arrest you or...</span></p> <p><span id="s284">AS: No, first thing they came in, maybe they were a half an hour they were asking where our father, for my father.</span> <span id="s285">And being we had a store, that by the way was only the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s286">I don't know what, what you knew, that's the regular army, the German Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">JR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">AS: The S.S. didn't come yet.</span> <span id="s289">But they came in, they said, my mother says, "Welcome to—Poland," in German!</span> <span id="s290">She spoke a beautiful German.</span> <span id="s291">And they came down, "Ach!"</span> <span id="s292">he says, "You speak German?</span> <span id="s293">It's beautiful!"</span> <span id="s294">And, he says, "What do you do?"</span> <span id="s295">"This is my store."</span> <span id="s296">"Open the store," he says, "for business!"</span> <span id="s297">So my mother says, "I told you they're not so bad, the Germans."</span> <span id="s298">And we opened the business.</span> <span id="s299">It was fantastic.</span> <span id="s300">We were doing business, because there was no, we had a lot of merchandise, and we were quite busy.</span> <span id="s301">Everybody was buying quick, you know, because everybody was feeling that they—knew their money will be no good.</span> <span id="s302">And, in about three weeks later, first of all they start the arrests already.</span> <span id="s303">The Jewish leaders, the Jewish teachers, the Jewish, they only left common people.</span> <span id="s304">And whoever was smart enough ran away from town.</span> <span id="s305">By the way, this part of Poland was also evacuated, also the Polish people had to leave that part of Poland, not only Jews, because Hitler claimed that that was part of Germany.</span> <span id="s306">So, anybody who didn't have any German blood in him had to leave that part of—Poland.</span> <span id="s307">By the way, while we're at it, I don't want to miss that.</span> <span id="s308">We had a German family—the name was Schlachter—who lived almost next door to us.</span> <span id="s309">They had a farm, dairy farm.</span> <span id="s310">And at that time the Polish Army and the Polish people persecuted very much against the Germans.</span> <span id="s311">They, in fact they were killing some of them.</span> <span id="s312">And we took that family, we hid them, in the same cellar where my father was.</span> <span id="s313">And that same man threw us out from our home.</span> <span id="s314">We saved their lives.</span> <span id="s315">It was a father, and a mother, and three sons.</span> <span id="s316">They were with us because there was bombing before the army came in.</span>

built, by the way, I built the camp, and as you know as, when you build a building, as you go higher, Jews had to bring us bricks, the cement.</span> <span id="s657">They had to carry it by hand from the—trains, freight trains, to us.</span> <span id="s658">They used to come right close to us.</span> <span id="s659">Water, whatever we needed.</span> <span id="s660">Everything was done by hand.</span> <span id="s661">It wasn't done by automation or anything like that as you see today.</span> <span id="s662">Most of them by the time they brought the bricks, by the time they went down, they have these big trains with cement.</span> <span id="s663">They used to shove them in, in the—cement.</span> <span id="s664">And they used to suffocate.</span> <span id="s665">Some of them, they took the numbers off, and they said, "Pour over concrete over."</span> <span id="s666">And we did.</span> <span id="s667">So, it was quite a sight for us to work there and see all these people.</span>

bakery, I said, "If I work in a bakery, I will, at least I can feed myself.</span> <span id="s711">I'll have enough bread to eat."</span> <span id="s712">So I went over, they volun-, they asked for people, for bakers.</span> <span id="s713">And I signed my name in.</span> <span id="s714">That was the only time I didn't work as a bricklayer.</span> <span id="s715">And the bakery was not too far

in camp was all electric wires.</span> <span id="s748">The only way you could run, you get electrocuted, number one.</span> <span id="s749">Number two, you went, as I, like I said, I was in Auschwitz long enough to know, they had three borderlines.</span> <span id="s750">In other words, if you escaped one borderline, there was another borderline, and another borderline.</span> <span id="s751">So you, actually you had to escape three zones in order, if you didn't get caught in one you get caught in the other—which I tried once myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">JR: You tried to escape once?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">AS: To escape, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">JR: Could you tell me something about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">AS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span

for almost two, two-and-a-half years at this time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">AS: Yes.</span> <span id="s761">And I got acquainted, we worked with Poles, civilians, which very few prisoners had the privilege to do that.</span> <span id="s762">So we start to organize.</span> <span id="s763">We have business with them, dealings.</span> <span id="s764">I used to bring them watches, diamonds, clothing.</span> <span id="s765">And they in turn used to bring us bread, salami.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">JR: Where did you get the watches, diamonds?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">AS: Through, inside, the people who worked with the transports that used to come to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s768">And we had the inside.</span> <span id="s769">So if you got to know, like I told you, how we—to organize food, and how to organize food.</span> <span id="s770">And as a matter of fact, one time I even brought in whiskey into camp.</span> <span id="s771">But I didn't use it.</span> <span id="s772">I sold it to somebody for food.</span> <span id="s773">Anyway, I had an arrangement with this Pole.</span> <span id="s774">We had, the toilets were outside.</span> <span id="s775">And we built sort of a drawer underneath the seat.</span> <span id="s776">I went in inside first, left my watch or my diamond, whatever it was, or my clothing.</span> <span id="s777">And after he—came in, took the stuff down, and he put his salami or bread, whatever it was, into it.</span> <span id="s778">We couldn't talk to them.</span> <span id="s779">And, finally, I got very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s780">I worked with him for quite a long time.</span> <span id="s781">And he says, "I'm gonna get you out of here."</span> <span id="s782">Being we didn't have hair, you know, I was shaved completely.</span> <span id="s783">So he says, "I'll get you artificial hair."</span> <span id="s784">That was his first thing for me to do.</span> <span id="s785">And we were, they call it an Appell, they used to count us ev-, three times a day—in the morning, during the day, and at night.</span> <span id="s786">Because we worked, they call it outside Kommando, so they were always, even though they had three zones, they were always afraid somebody's gonna take a chance and leave this place.</span> <span id="s787">So, he told me his plan was—he drove a truck, this Pole—his plan was for me to go under the sand, and he'll build an opening underneath, from boards, whatever.</span> <span id="s788">And he says, "We're gonna try to cross couple zones."</span> <span id="s789">We knew everything about the dogs.</span> <span id="s790">The dogs smelled you.</span> <span id="s791">We knew all this, all the ropes, how to escape.</span> <span id="s792">But that didn't work.</span> <span id="s793">By the time I crossed the other second zone, the firing, fire alarms went off.</span> <span id="s794">And I didn't want to, I didn't want him to get hurt with me.</span> <span id="s795">And I jumped the truck and I went on the side of the road.</span> <span id="s796">It was fall.</span> <span id="s797">And I covered myself with leaves.</span> <span id="s798">I knew, I had with me, on me money.</span> <span id="s799">I had civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s800">I was all prepared.</span> <span id="s801">But I also had my prison uniform underneath.</span> <span id="s802">Quickly, I devestigate myself from all this stuff; my money, I buried it.</span> <span id="s803">And I kept crawling on my stomach further, up, up, up, up.</span> <span id="s804">I knew the dogs would come and get me.</span> <span id="s805">Finally, I could hear motorcycles, the sound of motorcycles.</span> <span id="s806">And the dogs start to come from the rear.</span> <span id="s807">And I come out, my hands up.</span> <span id="s808">But I came out in my prison uniform.</span> <span id="s809">And I don't remember his name, he was just a, they had a trial in Germany, he just got caught only about five, six years ago, this same S.S. who caught, who found me at that time.</span> <span id="s810">And I came out, and the dogs start to rip my clothes.</span> <span id="s811">And he came close to me, he wanted to see if I have arms.</span> <span id="s812">He took all my, just left my pants on.</span> <span id="s813">And with his bayonet he start to beat me up.</span> <span id="s814">I was bleeding all over, my face and my, everything.</span> <span id="s815">And he says, "Run in the front."</span> <span id="s816">How he didn't kill me at that time, don't ask me.</span> <span id="s817">He ran—me over with the motorcycle.</span> <span id="s818">It was a heavy motorcycle.</span> <span id="s819">Maybe three, four times.</span> <span id="s820">I kept falling down, and he ran over with me.</span> <span id="s821">It was about, oh, three, four miles to camp, and I kept running.</span> <span id="s822">I don't know what maked me run that time, till this day.</span> <span id="s823">When I got to camp, they took me, and they took my head and they kept, against the wall, back and forth, back and forth.</span> <span id="s824">They kept asking me what connection I have with the Underground.</span> <span id="s825">I says, "No, I got lost.</span> <span id="s826">I was hungry.</span> <span id="s827">And I just got lost."</span> <span id="s828">They didn't want to believe me.</span> <span id="s829">Finally they put me in between the electric wires.</span> <span id="s830">When all the workers, more than 100,000 workers saw me, between the wires.</span> <span id="s831">They had a special place, people should see if somebody wants to escape, this is what he gets.</span> <span id="s832">So they had a door between the wires, and you have to stay there.</span> <span id="s833">And they have a big sign in German written down.</span> <span id="s834">And everybody kept looking at me and saying goodbye to me.</span> <span id="s835">And, finally they took me to Block Eleven.</span> <span id="s836">I don't know if you heard about Block Eleven.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">JR: Tell me something about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">AS: Block Eleven was a Block what they brought only people, political prisoners, they brought people who tried to escape, partisans were brought in there.</span> <span id="s839">Very few people came out alive.</span> <span id="s840">Here I was lucky again.</span> <span id="s841">There was a man, a Jewish man was in charge of Block Eleven.</span> <span id="s842">He happened to be, they called him The Strong Man.</span> <span id="s843">And, I was in a room, oh, I say just about, there was no bed, just cement.</span> <span id="s844">And I was pretty well beaten up.</span> <span id="s845">I was all swollen.</span> <span id="s846">And this man came in.</span> <span id="s847">His name was Kozhelshik.</span> <span id="s848">[phonetic] He was from Bialystok.</span> <span id="s849">And he says to me, "Son, you're a lucky man."</span> <span id="s850">I says, "Why am I lucky?</span> <span id="s851">To be here?"</span> <span id="s852">He says, "Whatever you're saying, keep saying."</span> <span id="s853">He says, "They'll beat you up, and I'll feed you."</span> <span id="s854">And he kept bringing me in food.</span> <span id="s855">And they took me out every day, for interrogation.</span> <span id="s856">They took me once on a, was a dark room and a candle was lit, I don't know to scare me or what.</span> <span id="s857">And there was a chain hanging down.</span> <span id="s858">And all of a sudden this German came up to me and he spoke Yiddish to me.</span> <span id="s859">And he said to me, "You know, if you're not telling the truth, you'll hang."</span> <span id="s860">I said, "I have nothing to say."</span> <span id="s861">So they put a wire bar between my legs, and they put the chain on the top here, on my neck.</span> <span id="s862">They pushed me up on this thing.</span> <span id="s863">And they was banging me here, right on my head, forehead.</span> <span id="s864">And they kept asking me, "What connections do you have with the Underground?</span> <span id="s865">Who did you know there?</span> <span id="s866">Why did you go there?"</span> <span id="s867">And I kept saying, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s868">I was hungry.</span> <span id="s869">I got lost."</span> <span id="s870">Finally I could feel the chain like drops.</span> <span id="s871">I, I fell on the floor.</span> <span id="s872">They pour a bucket of cold water on me.</span> <span id="s873">I got up.</span> <span id="s874">And by the way, when you're in Block Eleven, you get death clothes, like when you're persecuted to die, when you're set to assassinate.</span> <span id="s875">They gave me wooden shoes, a special white uniform.</span> <span id="s876">And I happened to have a, I gave to the Yad VaShem that picture.</span> <span id="s877">I hold it for many years.</span> <span id="s878">When I was in Israel, I gave it to them.</span> <span id="s879">It tells, shows you how they take you to these places.</span> <span id="s880">This man was on a bike, and I walk in the

out?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">AS: Finally, I don't know if you heard about Höss.</span> <span id="s899">Höss was the Lagerführer of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s900">He wrote a book in Poland.</span> <span id="s901">He was hanged after the war.</span> <span id="s902">And I walked in, and this was the verdict.</span> <span id="s903">And he's supposed to say one way or the other, if I should live or die or whatever, to do.</span> <span id="s904">They brought me in, they trained me.</span> <span id="s905">They told me how to report myself to him in German.</span> <span id="s906">I remember like today.</span> <span id="s907">He says, "Der Häftling number [English - this one word] sechs sechsundsiebzig, sech dreiundvierzig meldet sich gehorsam zu die Stelle."</span> <span

was sitting in a red velvet big chair.</span> <span id="s911">He had, and he come up and he says, "Why do you want to escape?</span> <span id="s912">Do you know that I can bring you a death sentence from Berlin?"</span> <span id="s913">Exactly the words he said to me.</span> <span id="s914">I says, "I know."</span> <span id="s915">"Why do you want to escape?"</span> <span id="s916">I says, "I have it good here."</span> <span id="s917">I had a good job.</span> <span id="s918">"I am a bricklayer.</span> <span id="s919">I just got lost.</span> <span id="s920">And this is the truth."</span> <span id="s921">And he looks at me, and he says, "O.K., this is the last time," he says.</span> <span id="s922">"I'll let you go."</span> <span id="s923">That's just what he said to me.</span> <span id="s924">"But you cannot work outside of the camp.</span> <span id="s925">Inside you're gonna work."</span> <span id="s926">And they gave me a red ball on my, plus my Jewish star, they gave me a red

well.</span> <span id="s937">Besides, scared or afraid, I was, once you live in that environment, you learn how to live.</span> <span id="s938">And I guess I was young, I suppose.</span> <span id="s939">They took us with a death march to Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s940">I didn't mark this camp.</span> <span id="s941">That was the first...</span></p> <p><span id="s942">JR: After this you

and Auschwitz and Buna, all these camps, they were pushing us all towards Germany.</span> <span id="s950">And every time we passed a cemetery, people who couldn't walk, they kept shooting them down, right through.</span> <span id="s951">Here I was again a witness here.</span> <span id="s952">The same man, Kadduk [phonetic] what I told you, came over to me.</span> <span id="s953">He says, "Junge, kommen Sie her."

drunk.</span> <span id="s961">And the Russian Army was in the back of us.</span> <span id="s962">We knew that.</span> <span id="s963">And he kept shooting people left and right, right in the front of me.</span> <span id="s964">And I just, I says, and he says to me, "Junge, not you, not you, not you.</span> <span id="s965">All the others no good.</span> <span id="s966">You're good."</span> <span id="s967">And he says to me, "Shine my shoes.</span> <span id="s968">Wipe me off my face."</span> <span id="s969">Stuff like that.</span> <span id="s970">And he says, "Junge, you hungry?"</span> <span id="s971">I says, "Yeah, I'm hungry."</span> <span id="s972">So he threw a, every now and then on me some food while we were, finally we arrived to Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s973">We arrived to Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s974">They picked us out again.</span> <span id="s975">And they asked me what I can do.</span> <span id="s976">I said, "I'm a bricklayer."</span> <span id="s977">And they put us on freight trains again.</span> <span id="s978">The freight train was bombed on the way.</span> <span id="s979">They gave us one slice of bread, and on the end of the bread was a piece of margarine.</span> <span id="s980">And they says, "Hold onto that bread.</span> <span id="s981">This has to last you two weeks."</span> <span id="s982">I was hungry now.</span> <span id="s983">Me, I ate it up right away.</span> <span id="s984">And, people were dying left and right.</span> <span id="s985">The S.S. were sitting with machine guns on top of our freight trains.</span> <span id="s986">And during the night, we had no—toilet facilities, nothing like that.</span> <span id="s987">We were put in there like sardines.</span> <span id="s988">So during the nights while they were found asleep, we're throwing the bodies out, to make room...</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s990">JR: O.K., let's continue with this.</span> <span id="s991">You were telling me about the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">AS: Trains, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">JR: All right, in these trains were there men, women and children?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">AS: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">JR: Or just men?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">AS: Was just men, just men.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">JR: Just men.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">AS: Just men.</span> <span id="s999">Just...</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">JR: And did you know where these trains were going to be taking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">AS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">JR: No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">AS: They never told us.</span> <span id="s1004">So finally we wound up in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1005">We were bombed and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">JR: So Dachau was the second...</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">AS: Second...</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">JR: Concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">AS: Concentration camp, yeah.</span> <span id="s1010">We wound up in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1011">When we got into Dachau, they told us to get off the trains.</span> <span id="s1012">Fifty percent of us were dead.</span> <span id="s1013">From sitting down we couldn't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s1014">So while we were walking to camp from the train, we kept walking and falling down, walking and falling down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">JR: How long was the train ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">AS: For two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">JR: Two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">AS: Because we were interrupted in between, bombing.</span> <span id="s1019">They had no railroad.</span> <span id="s1020">The railroad system was—some places we had to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">JR: Did you have any more food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">AS: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">JR: Did you have any more food in that two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">AS: No food.</span> <span id="s1025">No food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">JR: What did you do?</span> <span id="s1027">You just went without food and water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">AS: You know what I did?</span> <span id="s1029">At night, many times I thought I am finished.</span> <span id="s1030">My breath is going out.</span> <span id="s1031">So every one of us had a little pot, soup pot, whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s1032">And I had my belt on it.</span> <span id="s1033">And somehow at that time, it was winter, it was snowing.</span> <span id="s1034">And I dropped the pot, and I kept picking up snow, and I kept bringing myself back to—life again.</span> <span id="s1035">This is a very, very few people survived this.</span> <span id="s1036">Anyway, we got into Dachau finally.</span> <span id="s1037">I remember also, they were, what do you call it, blocks, whatever you call them, apartment houses.</span> <span id="s1038">I don't know who were there, S.S. or something.</span> <span id="s1039">And they watched us, the way we walked and we fell down at the camp.</span> <span id="s1040">They said, they were laughing, from the windows.</span> <span id="s1041">And this German asked from the window to the S.S., he says, "What are they, these people?"</span> <span id="s1042">"Don't you know?</span> <span id="s1043">They're all murderers!</span> <span id="s1044">They’re Murderers!"</span> <span id="s1045">So finally, we reached the camp.</span> <span id="s1046">We got in inside.</span> <span id="s1047">And then we were, I was assigned to a block.</span> <span id="s1048">I walk into the block inside, and I sees people walking like drunk.</span> <span id="s1049">I says, "What is this?"</span> <span id="s1050">So the German says, "This is quarantine.</span> <span id="s1051">You're gonna rest up.</span> <span id="s1052">And from here you go to, we will assign you to work."</span> <span id="s1053">Sure enough, we found out, all the people inside had typhoid.</span> <span id="s1054">And they wanted us to catch from them.</span> <span id="s1055">The Germans must have been injected or something when they were, the S.S. used to come in there.</span> <span id="s1056">And, finally, again to survive, we learned quickly to always hold back, every day people died, as you know, something like that.</span> <span id="s1057">And we kept hiding two or three bodies under our beds, and collect food for them, in order to survive.</span> <span id="s1058">And every time a person died, we had to put their numbers on the chest, all the way through, and they used to mark him out, make sure that this person is dead.</span> <span id="s1059">And then they took him away.</span> <span id="s1060">Whatever they did with him, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1061">I was there two weeks.</span> <span id="s1062">When this German walks in, he says, "Aren't you sick yet!?"</span> <span id="s1063">I says, "I'm as healthy as they come.</span> <span id="s1064">I'm looking for a job.</span> <span id="s1065">I want to work.</span> <span id="s1066">This is not a life for me."</span> <span id="s1067">So finally, they came in and they asked me what I can do.</span> <span id="s1068">I says, "I'm a bricklayer."</span> <span id="s1069">Here I'm a bricklayer again.</span> <span id="s1070">And they took us, they formed another Kommando, were mostly bricklayers.</span> <span id="s1071">And they sent us to a camp.</span> <span id="s1072">The camp of, this is named Mildorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">JR: How did they send you there, by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">AS: By train, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">JR: Was it the same type of cattle cars or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">AS: Cattle cars, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">JR: The same...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">AS: But I wasn't far, that wasn't far from Dachau.</span> <span id="s1079">It was only a ride three hours, that's all.</span> <span id="s1080">Well, we got off the train.</span> <span id="s1081">We walked about four miles, five miles.</span> <span id="s1082">We're walking into heavy forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">JR: O.K.</span> <span id="s1084">How long were you in Dachau?</span> <span id="s1085">How many months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">AS: Only about two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">JR: Two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">AS: That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">JR: And how many, how long were you in Gross-Rosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">AS: Oh, maybe a week.</span> <span id="s1091">Was just a..</span> <span id="s1092">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">JR: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">AS: Going by, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">JR: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">AS: Finally, we walked into a very heavy forest.</span> <span id="s1097">The boy next to me, as he lives in Los Angeles today, Polus his name was, yes.</span> <span id="s1098">He was with me right along.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">JR: What is his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">AS: Polus.</span> <span id="s1101">P-O-L-U-S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">JR: His first name?</span> <span id="s1103">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">AS: I used to call him, I just can't think of his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">JR: That's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">AS: I'll—maybe, I'm gonna think of it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">JR: O.K. We'll probably come back to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">AS: Finally, he—said, "I think they're gonna finish us off."</span> <span id="s1109">We don't see no buildings.</span> <span id="s1110">We don't see nothing.</span> <span id="s1111">Finally we walk into a place.</span> <span id="s1112">We see a big fence, but no buildings.</span> <span id="s1113">The fence made us feel a little better, and then we saw guards near the fence.</span> <span id="s1114">So we tried to put things together, and they say, "Walk straight."</span> <span id="s1115">Why, as we walked into the inside, we see people coming out from underground.</span> <span id="s1116">To my surprise, people lived underground.</span> <span id="s1117">That's the first time I saw a camp underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">JR: Mildorf was a..</span> <span id="s1119">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">AS: Mildorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">JR: Underground camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">AS: Underground camp.</span> <span id="s1123">They dig ditches, it's a ditch.</span> <span id="s1124">And on one side they left the ground higher.</span> <span id="s1125">So they put hay over the top.</span> <span id="s1126">And on the other side had hay.</span> <span id="s1127">And then over the top they put boards and stone and sand on the top.</span> <span id="s1128">And you just walked in under—the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">JR: Do you know why they built them that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">AS: I guess it was quick.</span> <span id="s1131">Finally, next day, they assigned us to work.</span> <span id="s1132">And sure enough, we find out we work for the German Air Force.</span> <span id="s1133">We built—maybe we'll find it when we go now to Germany—we built, we digged out a mountain from the inside.</span> <span id="s1134">And we poured concrete over the top.</span> <span id="s1135">And the airplanes drove in under the mountain.</span> <span id="s1136">So that was the last of the German Air Force.</span> <span id="s1137">And I saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">JR: Is this the camp from which you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">AS: From Mildorf, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1140">No, no, no, I didn't get liberated yet.</span> <span id="s1141">It's not yet.</span> <span id="s1142">It's not that easy.</span> <span id="s1143">Finally, they made us, some of us, they made us load up the planes with the bombs, but the fuses they put it in themselves.</span> <span id="s1144">But they were afraid that we might blow them up.</span> <span id="s1145">I remember like today.</span> <span id="s1146">They had two bombs on each.</span> <span id="s1147">They were light planes.</span> <span id="s1148">Underneath hanging, you know, on hangers like.</span> <span id="s1149">And while they, there were about, oh, I say, at the most, fifteen planes they had.</span> <span id="s1150">And we heard already that there were, all over spies, American spies there, between us, between the prisoners talking.</span> <span id="s1151">And all of a sudden, while they're just about, they all were ready to take off, the planes, the American Air Force came in and they start, they finished them all off.</span> <span id="s1152">They bombed them, and all night long the bombs were, kept exploding.</span> <span id="s1153">Every time the fire hit the bomb, and they took us off quickly from the jobs, brought us back into camp.</span> <span id="s1154">So whatever, the work was done half way.</span> <span id="s1155">We never finished it.</span> <span id="s1156">And they also used us in that camp, transformers, we built, because everything was bombed.</span> <span id="s1157">So, finally towards the end we got a break, in the same camp.</span> <span id="s1158">And we were guarded by the German working brigade, something, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1159">We were much easier.</span> <span id="s1160">And they help us organize.</span> <span id="s1161">They didn't have food themselves, potatoes, at least, yeah, I remember, we had sugar canes, stuff like that, just to survive.</span> <span id="s1162">He says, "We don't have it ourselves."</span> <span id="s1163">They didn't wear, they didn't have guns.</span> <span id="s1164">They used to walk with shovels.</span> <span id="s1165">But, escape was so hard, because you were all surrounded from Germans.</span> <span id="s1166">And it was all, the army, we were close, almost—on the front line.</span> <span id="s1167">It was near.</span> <span id="s1168">You could hear at night shooting, bombing, at night.</span> <span id="s1169">So finally one day they came in, "Everybody out!"</span> <span id="s1170">They put us again on a train.</span> <span id="s1171">They put us on a train.</span> <span id="s1172">While we're going through Munich, the city of Munich, that was in Bavaria already, you could see commotion in the city.</span> <span id="s1173">We looked out from the—freight trains.</span> <span id="s1174">We see Germans running with cars, with bikes.</span> <span id="s1175">I said to my friend, "Look, how close we are to freedom.</span> <span id="s1176">But I don't think these bastards are gonna let us live.</span> <span id="s1177">I think they're planning something else for us."</span> <span id="s1178">I says, "They're already finished, but they want to finish us off."</span> <span id="s1179">So finally, we went to a city, a train, I don't know how many—wagons there were.</span> <span id="s1180">And it was a very long, long train.</span> <span id="s1181">I could see it when, when it turned a little.</span> <span id="s1182">When we passed Munich, the conductor from a station, a very small station, came out, and he says to the Germans, "Do you know the war is over?</span> <span id="s1183">The Americans took over.</span> <span id="s1184">Get out of here!</span> <span id="s1185">Take off!"</span> <span id="s1186">And the Germans started to take their lapels off.</span> <span id="s1187">And they started to run, just straight in the field.</span> <span id="s1188">The prisoners are running after them.</span> <span id="s1189">I said to my friend, Polus, "Don't run.</span> <span id="s1190">You don't have to run.</span> <span id="s1191">They're gonna be free.</span> <span id="s1192">We're gonna be free here, too.</span> <span id="s1193">We don't have to run."</span> <span id="s1194">"So what do you have plans?"</span> <span id="s1195">I said, "I have plans to survive.</span> <span id="s1196">Let's go into the freight train, the wagon where the S.S. was in there."</span> <span id="s1197">We walked in there, we opened the door, don't ask.</span> <span id="s1198">Plenty of food.</span> <span id="s1199">Plenty of bread.</span> <span id="s1200">Drinks.</span> <span id="s1201">They had everything else.</span> <span id="s1202">We went in there.</span> <span id="s1203">I took a couple loaves of bread.</span> <span id="s1204">I cut them in half, put them around my pants.</span> <span id="s1205">My friend took a big salami.</span> <span id="s1206">And I says, "Let's go to that lake.</span> <span id="s1207">We'll go underneath there.</span> <span id="s1208">We'll just sit there nice and quiet.</span> <span id="s1209">Will be water, and we'll wait, to see what's gonna happen."</span> <span id="s1210">Sure enough, about half an hour after, I guess they were, they were caught between the front line.</span> <span id="s1211">We were in the middle of everything.</span> <span id="s1212">And they start to throwing back all these prisoners to the freight trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">JR: Who started to, the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">AS: The Germans.</span> <span id="s1215">And they start to holler, "What do you think just, we gonna let you live?</span> <span id="s1216">No way!</span> <span id="s1217">We're not gonna!</span> <span id="s1218">We gonna finish you off!"</span> <span id="s1219">And they, I had a chance; that time I made a big mistake.</span> <span id="s1220">I had the chance to stay there, or bury myself underground or something.</span> <span id="s1221">But I see everybody running.</span> <span id="s1222">I ran too.</span> <span id="s1223">We walked in, and that was the biggest mistake I made.</span> <span id="s1224">And they just brought back the people back.</span> <span id="s1225">I don't know how many, maybe some escaped, I guess.</span> <span id="s1226">And they start shooting into the freight trains.</span> <span id="s1227">I know one or two people next to me got killed.</span> <span id="s1228">I don't know, G-, I guess Somebody didn't want me yet.</span> <span id="s1229">And, the train, finally the train start to move.</span> <span id="s1230">The train moved.</span> <span id="s1231">We got to Tutzing, a small town.</span> <span id="s1232">It was May 1st, 1945.</span> <span id="s1233">And we hear a knock at the door.</span> <span id="s1234">And this German, he happens to be in the, in the Wehrmacht, the regular German Army.</span> <span id="s1235">I guess they didn't have the S.S. or what, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1236">And he says, "I have an order from Himmler to shoot you all.</span> <span id="s1237">But, I broke, I made the locomotive, I broke down the locomotive.</span> <span id="s1238">We're not going away from here till the Americans come.</span> <span id="s1239">If you cooperate with me, and don't give me any problems..." And, about day light, five o’clock, we could hear light machine guns all around us.</span> <span id="s1240">And all of a sudden a lot of noise, a lot of tanks.</span> <span id="s1241">We were on the top of a mountain, the train, and this, the road was on the bottom.</span> <span id="s1242">And, there was a lot of revenge at that time.</span> <span id="s1243">I guess I was very young.</span> <span id="s1244">I didn't understand.</span> <span id="s1245">I had a blanket over me.</span> <span id="s1246">I just cried.</span> <span id="s1247">But the Greek Jews—were the only ones which I never knew, that were there on the same train—they said, "It's time for revenge."</span> <span id="s1248">They were the only ones who took revenge afterward, after them.</span> <span id="s1249">And they start to shoot them down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">JR: The Greeks were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">AS: Greek Jews, from Saloniki.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">JR: Were shooting the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">AS: German, the guards who were with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">JR: Where did the Greek Jews get the weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">AS: From them.</span> <span id="s1256">Took it away from them.</span> <span id="s1257">They weren't so brave any more.</span> <span id="s1258">They were brave right along, but they weren't brave after.</span> <span id="s1259">And, finally I walked down the mountain.</span> <span id="s1260">I seen the American Army, the Third Army, crying, that's all.</span> <span id="s1261">They were throwing food at us, sardines, all kind of food, which was poison to us at that time.</span> <span id="s1262">A lot of people died from, I had a little diarrhea, but not too bad.</span> <span id="s1263">And this, this major from Brooklyn, a Jewish man, I don't recall his name, he organized the camp, Feldafing is the name.</span> <span id="s1264">And while I was standing there watching the army going by, I was thinking, I don't think anybody is alive.</span> <span id="s1265">I don't think there's any Jews left.</span> <span id="s1266">All of a sudden [pause; weeping] I look, and the tank stopped on the road.</span> <span id="s1267">And one Jewish man came out.</span> <span id="s1268">I don't know where he comes from, to this day.</span> <span id="s1269">He took out a tallis and tefillin and he prayed.</span> <span id="s1270">[weeping] And we ran over to him.</span> <span id="s1271">And we asked, "Are there any Jews left?</span> <span id="s1272">Is there anybody left?"</span> <span id="s1273">He says, "Don't worry, you'll survive.</span> <span id="s1274">Don't worry about it."</span> <span id="s1275">And, they formed a camp which, Eisenhower came to meet us, at that time.</span> <span id="s1276">And he gave an order that every German family had to bring a bed into camp for us to sleep.</span> <span id="s1277">There was no beds.</span> <span id="s1278">And Jewish boys [weeping] in the American Army, waiting on us.</span> <span id="s1279">They fed us.</span> <span id="s1280">Doctors came.</span> <span id="s1281">And they, one doctor, I don't remember, he was from Canada.</span> <span id="s1282">I don't remember his name.</span> <span id="s1283">My teeth were loose.</span> <span id="s1284">He examined me.</span> <span id="s1285">And he took me up in the air.</span> <span id="s1286">And he kissed me.</span> <span id="s1287">He says, "You're O.K.!</span> <span id="s1288">There's no trace of your..." They took me in a truck.</span> <span id="s1289">They gave me x-rays or whatever was.</span> <span id="s1290">I don't know, they had quick, and they put me on a diet, orange juice and food.</span> <span id="s1291">Within two weeks I start to come to myself.</span> <span id="s1292">And I guess that's part of my story.</span> <span id="s1293">There is, it wasn't easy to tell, but I guess I have
