id="s16">Q: Where were you born, Mrs. Szamosi?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I born in Transylvania.</span> <span id="s18">In those times Transylvania was Hungary and the name from from the little town, .</span> <span id="s19">That is in...later on it went to Roman...uh to Romania and the name was .</span> <span id="s20">But I was liv...I was living, if I can say that living several months there and my fam...our family went up to Budapest and I born in 1914.</span> <span id="s21">I once before the war, the 1st World War.</span> <span id="s22">My father was uh immediately went to the military service and I in Budapest with my mother.</span> <span id="s23">I was the last child in the family.</span> <span id="s24">It is interesting in this way to continue and my my father disappeared...not exactly disappeared...by the fact by the very beginning uh became to Russia and that was a possibility that I have heard from my mother naturally the story that about three years my mother was able to get several uh uh message and later when in there in Russia began the Revolution and and my father disappeared and he arrived at the seven years later, so this is the short story.</span> <span id="s25">He was and he grew up very close to the mother and that is our childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Tell me about where you would go to school, a little bit about your life as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: So I went uh to the school in a normal...what is an elementary school and to mention something uh I have had a very bad feeling there because in these years when I was six, seven years old, it was a big anti...anti-Semitism in Hungary.</span> <span id="s28">This was the counter-revolution after uh after a short Communist revolution in Budapest in Hungary and it was like...as a little girl I have had always a feeling that I am not in raspberries (ph)...that I was a good student but I was always dessert (ph).</span> <span id="s29">First and the second must have been...just a young girl and uh grade and everything was a big difference.</span> <span id="s30">I was a very still, very frightened as a girl and it was interesting in our family that after the elementary school there four years, I asked my mother that I want to go in a private Jewish school.</span> <span id="s31">This was uh it...this was a private school and my mother was very astonished why how I am getting in these uh in these and I told her I I must go in this school.</span> <span id="s32">I am not going farther to the to the normal school, and because I was a good student, student I get a a (cough) bonus from the from the fees what what was necessary to to pay there and in the first time when I was in this in surrounding, I became happy, very in a good mood and a quite a different person, so I was at home, and I finished four years in this school.</span> <span id="s33">THen I made a one and a half year uh course uh course...</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s36">And then I went back on to work, like a a young secretary and later I I was working.</span> <span id="s37">I have had only two...first place I was one and a half years...like a telephone and five years in one place and ten years when I was in another uh job where I where I made everything for import/export firm.</span> <span id="s38">At the time I was getting a big prices and I was keeping the books and correspondence, yeah, and everything what was uh what was necessary.</span> <span id="s39">This was still...see the last time before I became married.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: What were uh the young working woman uh just before you married...uh you were in Budapest...what was Budapest like at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Lovely.</span> <span id="s42">(Laughter) was a happy person because I have had the real feeling that it very good to be to be young in Budapest.</span> <span id="s43">It was a very very nice uh...it is a very nice town and I have had a very interesting uh company, mainly Jewish per...people but not only.</span> <span id="s44">Uh my company...I get my company...after my two sisters, because I have had two sisters in the company and I was the little one and I went in in this the same company, so in general the boys, the company was about eight, nine, ten years older than I.</span> <span id="s45">They was mainly intellectual persons.</span> <span id="s46">They was uh they came back from several universities, from Paris, Sorbonne, Rome, even Prague because there was such a anti...anti-Semitism in Hungary that for Jewish people it was very difficult to get a a place or the possibility to go in the university, so a lot of Jewish uh youths went out...mainly Paris, Vienna, Paris, Rome, Prague, to learn, so I have had a very interesting and good</span></p> <p><span id="s47">, even company and it was really a wonderful life.</span> <span id="s48">The life, it was not necessary how much is the money or how few is the money.</span> <span id="s49">Mainly if you (laughter) but there was not interesting.</span> <span id="s50">It was not depend on the on the money the good life.</span> <span id="s51">That was a high cultured life, music, museums, theater and only through strolling from Budapest it was a problem.</span> <span id="s52">In the old part, Buda...old buildings and only to sit down near the near the and to look the and the bridges.</span> <span id="s53">It was a wonderful life, and it was really...spent a very joyful youth there.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: How did you...it sounds lovely...how did you meet your husband and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: We find each other...I think it was...one moment...the very early autumn from '39.</span> <span id="s56">At those time it was very fashionable for young people to make sport and a very popular sport was to rowing on the , on the Danube.</span> <span id="s57">And in this time...this was I think the first uh uh the first groups that the Jewish young people was called in called up to make uh labor service, and there was a weekend when I was honest alone, without my company, and I decided I am going alone to rowing on the Danube and I and then I find a lady friend and we went two together and there was a little uh not restaurant...a buffet...accidentally and there we find each other...there my my later husband began to speak to me.</span> <span id="s58">I was speaking to him.</span> <span id="s59">I was in the...I was sure that he must be Christian because I was sure that all the Jewish uh the Jewish young people is in the labor camp and he was out.</span> <span id="s60">I was sure that he was a Christian person.</span> <span id="s61">I was speaking very shortly...his was the first.</span> <span id="s62">Then it was a second rendezvous, as you say, and I wanted to be very sure...I wanted to cut these connections because this was not the time to to make a connection between a Jewish girl and a Christian boy.</span> <span id="s63">Even I told to my mother that I have a rendezvous with a..</span> <span id="s64">.</span> <span id="s65">I will make this very short...and we went sitting in a terrace near the and some way it came out that uh that there was some little group, Nilos (ph) group, that this was very beginning from the Nilos movement.</span> <span id="s66">They were shouting several slogans and I thought that I hate these people and Szamosi said I hate too.</span> <span id="s67">And it was nothing to say because not every Christian person was like this uh Nilos movement and I wanted to make sure and I thought because I am Jewish and he was very uh stonish (ph) because I was very uh uptight, blonde and alive and he left, wanted to see every German in this and and he he told I am I am Jewish too.</span> <span id="s68">Then I was very (laughter) astonished, because I was sure that he is Christian and then even he told I am religious and I was very, very astonished that a young person who is going to export on the on the Danube...how can .</span> <span id="s69">Uh my company was uh better to say...how you say today leftist but there was several persons real communists, idealist communists in those time.</span> <span id="s70">That was that was under... underground.</span> <span id="s71">That in Buda...in Hungary was not communist party.</span> <span id="s72">It was forbidden.</span> <span id="s73">So I grew out uh up very lef...uh leftist company and I didn't have the to be religious and I was asking how, why.</span> <span id="s74">Your father is very uh very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">You must go in the syna...and I don't know.</span> <span id="s76">I am going from my home, and it makes me very furious and I didn't finish with this rendezvous.</span> <span id="s77">There was another rendezvous (laughter) and saw him out in the the next (laughter)...(pause)...we had a lot of the differ....different between us because I was as I told uh a leftist and I I was against any formal (ph) things and and uh he was more more...how to say this...middle class...you know, these informal to to go to a five o'clock tea, something like this, and I was heard these things so because going together about one and a half years and there was a lot of discussion between us, but this was like to to make a stone smoother (laughter) and by the end we decided when we are making so nice discussion we can married and continue this (laughter) and these wars (ph).</span> <span id="s78">Never boring.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: When did you get married?</span> <span id="s80">A: In uh '41, November.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: What was it like for your then, in '41 in November in Budapest, and you're married?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: So it was quite a..</span> <span id="s83">.</span> <span id="s84">for a short time it was...we was very happy young couple but it was a very short time because in '41...it was...was, it was more and more difficult to be free from the from the labor camp, and my husband was again this way because he decided not to go in uh till '40...'41...'42...it was not so difficult.</span> <span id="s85">A little perfection (ph) here, a little money there...something...it was...several...I was not involved in this.</span> <span id="s86">Only I know that he is not at five to go like a cattle.</span> <span id="s87">He was a very indi...individual person.</span> <span id="s88">But '42...yeah...my son born '42...and uh in '42 began the...life began to be more serious and more pressed and uh my my husband begun to make the possibility through physicians to get some false uh uh paper that he is ill in this illness or other illness, not to go in in the labor camp, but it was always more and more difficult and and dangerous to play this way, and he made some operation like like uh abscess...he got some abscess and uh profits were made on the operation then he was was always able through me to find a way to to pay somebody to help us and there was literally illness then I was able to speak with this physician or professor to pay something, give a longer time for for this illness to , but every second or third month he got there uh called up to the military service so he find a way...I don't know somebody give this ID...yes...and get and get their ID when he he can go in a in a mental hospital.</span> <span id="s89">Then the military uh military uh police cannot take out these people from there, and we paid for somebody a very big amount.</span> <span id="s90">It was...I can't remember...ten thousand penge what made ten months , but you know I will not find out that the professor who was the the head from his hospital, he was in this , but my husband went in in this uh uh mental hospital and to make a little shorter the story, he was able to spend there six months.</span> <span id="s91">That was a big, big time in in the very very dangerous time.</span> <span id="s92">I was every day there from forenoon till evening and what was quite difficult for me that the the physician...he was the respon...responsible for this for this uh part from the hospital...he never asked my husband, yeah my husband decided we didn't know what what this means to be mentally ill, because we'd never read, never learned it was so imm...immediately and my husband thought I decide not to speak with people.</span> <span id="s93">I will speak only with you.</span> <span id="s94">And and not with the physician and not others, but I didn't know that this is good or not good, so almost every afternoon, evening when I wanted to left the hospital, the physician asked me what I have seen, what was the behavior from my husband and almost day after day I was pressed to find out something but give a picture that he is really not normal.</span> <span id="s95">He was living...he had he had a separate room and he was speaking, everything, even playing a little cards, but this was not the way to to be mentally ill, so always I find out something that I wanted, that he was very depressed and I thought to play a little cards would be...but he was confused and he didn't find the the way how to play, and each time I have had the feeling I was always (laughter)...but I was forced to make always these everyday stories that my husband really could be hold uh so with this way I think it finished.</span> <span id="s96">He got the papers that he is uh mentally ill.</span> <span id="s97">This was official.</span> <span id="s98">There was a a from the state or uh supervisor, a professor to make some questions and everything and temporary he he was uh put in...what is to to say...I was the responsible for him, you you know this these...and because he had had several uh or real estate places, this was written in the register book that he is he is not right to sign this uh contract or something I am responsible uh temporary, temporary.</span> <span id="s99">It was not for another time when the when the professor or somebody will say that he is OK, he is healthy, so this was a very difficult time but on the other side it was very difficult every day to go there and to play this play, but on the other side he was safe in there.</span> <span id="s100">It was...and several times I have seen that was coming military police to look.</span> <span id="s101">He was not alone in this in this mental hospitals.</span> <span id="s102">There was about...later we find out...always about eight, ten, twelve Jewish young people but nobody knows that the other other is playing.</span> <span id="s103">That was absolute disgrace and uh when I when I have seen from above that here is a guard from the military police, then I went down down there.</span> <span id="s104">There was a public telephone like I want to speak to somebody and I was able always to speak with the people, and I take out from the officers...and what is what is the name...who are you looking for.</span> <span id="s105">I wanted to be prepared but it was quite good in this place and it was quite good as long...my my husband came out I think in the...'43...'43 autumn.</span> <span id="s106">And it was...yeah...yeah...yeah...then we leaved our quite private life in our flat, but very very often somebody...what is this...somebody's saying against against another person...yeah...yeah...why he is at home, why he is not in the military...in the labor service, and it was...we decided, my husband decided that we will take a a second flat, to rent a second flat uh place far from Budapest near near a famous lake that is a summer place but it was autumn and we did take a villa there with with our little boy and uh later lived there only to visit there from Budapest that the people will forget.</span> <span id="s107">And uh not to denounce.</span> <span id="s108">It was our place...yeah...till till December I think, uh end of December...we rented this for longer time but uh I was pregnant with Mariam (ph) and I get a very very heavy.</span> <span id="s109">.</span> <span id="s110">uh I have had this, this was , and the pregnancy made me position that in evening I get a back that I was not able to to move, so the next day we we took a ambulance, and we ran back to Budapest and we there in our flat.</span> <span id="s111">Our flat was in which is in Budapest like the Champs d'Elysee in Paris and in January Miriam born.</span> <span id="s112">I was I was very ill before birth time.</span> <span id="s113">I was very ill after that time.</span> <span id="s114">I was not able to stand up and very very heavy uh pains, so I was in very ill till March, 19th March when when the army from Hitler arrived to Budapest and this took me up from the from the bed.</span> <span id="s115">(Pause - drinking) About this date I'm sure that you have heard a lot and my husband was not working.</span> <span id="s116">He was an elected person.</span> <span id="s117">He was working with his father together, but uh before this time quite a..</span> <span id="s118">.</span> <span id="s119">I think a year earlier or what it was taken the license for Jewish people to to work in these area, so he was...we find a .</span> <span id="s120">You know what this...uh uh Christian person and the it was...then he give the name for the firm, and my father-in...father-in-law and my my husband was working in uh behind these these uh Christian men name so to make a life, but it was a quite a illegal way but a very common way in those time.</span> <span id="s121">It was a absolute common way.</span> <span id="s122">A lot of people was living in this uh living with this possibility and this was a big possibility for the Christian people to get a not to work and to get goods already, so everybody was in this way quite happy, the Christian and the Jews, so I will continue.</span> <span id="s123">The next day to a week came the order to that Jews must uh hold a yellow star but earlier there was a very terrible stress within the Jewish people and a terrible the first time, prominent Jews and uh a lot lawyers and uh like hostages.</span> <span id="s124">They didn't know what will be the fate for for these people.</span> <span id="s125">These was called in immediately, mainly disappeared.</span> <span id="s126">This was I think the first uh transport of to deported, and what was the Judenrat and you know, what is this uh....so every day a new guard order from the to this is forbidden and this is forbidden and how to how to bea...behave, how to live, and we when we arrive at this time to go out with the to wear this yellow star.</span> <span id="s127">It was a terrible feeling, that people with a sign to go on the street.</span> <span id="s128">The first uh several days mainly women went went out, not to mention that very few younger un men was at home.</span> <span id="s129">It was...the younger age was in the labor service.</span> <span id="s130">That was already taken and there were very respectable people and but the first, second day I went out.</span> <span id="s131">I have had something to in the office and I decided that I am going out.</span> <span id="s132">It was like to go in in a cold water.</span> <span id="s133">I was an and I was not uh...I was sure that I I will not incite...insult...incite.</span> <span id="s134">This was a very risky, very that somebody is going out, somebody can spot or insult or even , but I was sure that I am not that type and never I was insulted in my life, and I went out.</span> <span id="s135">It was a terrible feeling that somebody came against me, very respectable elderly person...like an aristocrat, with a yellow star, and to look each other, you you too.</span> <span id="s136">You too.</span> <span id="s137">And then please wait to go in the street.</span> <span id="s138">It was something about the...in our age, in our lib...liberated uh youth, after our liberated youth, it was so almost impossible to understand that how can people be back in this way and to live in this way, but I made a self-suggestion that it is now my shame.</span> <span id="s139">It the shame, it is the shame who made this with me.</span> <span id="s140">It was a brainwash but I made for me.</span> <span id="s141">I have a little uh story about in this office...interesting.</span> <span id="s142">I went in and there was a a automatic elevator.</span> <span id="s143">It was a two...two person was going in and this went up five .</span> <span id="s144">I went in and nearby was a..</span> <span id="s145">.</span> <span id="s146">well a gentlemen about uh forty, forty-five.</span> <span id="s147">He saw star...I was with the star, and this was a little problem, and he was looking at me curious way and he was asking uh you must wear these or...and then the question was the the that I making uh the demonstration near the uh to be sympathetic for the Jewish people but never happen in Budapest, but it was known that someplace, some somebody can make some demonstration.</span> <span id="s148">This happened in in later.</span> <span id="s149">We learned this, so the question was this that you must wear this or , and he was looking and and asked me, have have somebody in your family I understand Christian and I never left to finish the question.</span> <span id="s150">And I told yes, Rabbi.</span> <span id="s151">He was astonished.</span> <span id="s152">And he was looking, he was not from Budapest.</span> <span id="s153">I I wanted to make a .</span> <span id="s154">I told yes, I am from Transylvania.</span> <span id="s155">I born in Transylvania...I told him a landlo...landlord family.</span> <span id="s156">I told no.</span> <span id="s157">A pub-owner family.</span> <span id="s158">(laugher) Then he was looking at me and I arrived and he told me if I if I am if I am able to help you or something, my hand was the paper what I wanted to arrange there and I made so thank you.</span> <span id="s159">I will arrange alone.</span> <span id="s160">This was a sympathetic, but this was the first day.</span> <span id="s161">He wanted to help me someway.</span> <span id="s162">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s163">I was not a a dangerous type.</span> <span id="s164">I was a very Aryan type so this was a quite a good feeling to hear this sympathy of words, but I was very stressed, so this was the first uh uh experience to wear the yellow star on the street.</span> <span id="s165">Then we get the proxies later...these was in this way...and our hands like this, hands back...give me something like the hand back.</span> <span id="s166">We went from the street.</span> <span id="s167">We uh uh women's hold hands back in this way, and to...not all the time to show the...so a part I think I finished and this part from our life.</span> <span id="s168">Then came the order that that uh Jewish people must go in several houses to live, every family in one room which is not interesting how how many person...</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Please...we'd like to know about this (?)</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s171">A long, long monologue...so that was...several houses was fined.</span> <span id="s172">There was some which area, which houses will be yellow-starred signed houses.</span> <span id="s173">Naturally our our home, it was not in this uh because it was a very unelegant place, a very representative street.</span> <span id="s174">They made this into...many of the back streets and mainly the most, most people was Jews in the house.</span> <span id="s175">So not far from our house there was...the corner from our house...the corner was a very famous uh uh house, 60.</span> <span id="s176">This was a..</span> <span id="s177">.</span> <span id="s178">I cannot now remember that before the Nilos which part owned this house.</span> <span id="s179">Really I cannot now envision, but this was a famous house.</span> <span id="s180">Nex...uh next from this house in the back street there was a house who in this list that this will be a yellow-stared signed house.</span> <span id="s181">I was not...uh we was not running to look.</span> <span id="s182">We was a little bit para...paralyzed the first time, but uh somebody was ringing and coming and yelling, so and he began to say that I have flattened this house what will be signed for the Jews and I have heard the conceriege that here is a Jewish family maybe that we can change the flag.</span> <span id="s183">I was quite apathetic in this because this was sure that this is not to live.</span> <span id="s184">It is only a temporary thing.</span> <span id="s185">What will happen with us if it is not the place where we were living, and I went this young person.</span> <span id="s186">I went in the house.</span> <span id="s187">He showed me which uh...attached there is two rooms and the kitchen and the maid's room and came out a person from the house, a young man, good looking young man and he asked me uh madame, will you come in in this house and I thought I don't want to come in.</span> <span id="s188">I must come in.</span> <span id="s189">He thought come in...there was a good place.</span> <span id="s190">I have here a war factory.</span> <span id="s191">Uh I am making uh I am making uh noodle and uh macaroni for the military service.</span> <span id="s192">Here the door will always will be opened and I have a telephone.</span> <span id="s193">And this was not for me.</span> <span id="s194">I was not interested in what is this flat.</span> <span id="s195">I come back and I told Lotzie (ph)...Lotzie is my husband...I find a place.</span> <span id="s196">The main thing there is a particular person.</span> <span id="s197">He told me that the door will be always open and there is a telephone, and this was very very important and we decided to change the flat.</span> <span id="s198">We left this our flat with a lot of belongings there and we take the the minimum bedroom and something that was necessary to this flat and we made a friendship with this uh factory owner.</span> <span id="s199">He he immediately take us in like a worker in this in this uh war factory.</span> <span id="s200">That was a..</span> <span id="s201">.</span> <span id="s202">that gives a big difference because...uh I cannot remember what was the order that Jewish people from the from the signed houses can go out between eleven or...till one...something like this, for a short time to arrange something or buy something or was survival was to buy.</span> <span id="s203">But the somebody had these these uh document that he is working in for the military, military service.</span> <span id="s204">This gives a longer uh time to to to strolling outside in the street, and this was very important.</span> <span id="s205">So it was quite a, quite a good life.</span> <span id="s206">It was written...I was I uh a person always I was looking the good side.</span> <span id="s207">Now we are in one room.</span> <span id="s208">The other room is took in uh my husband's uh brother, a physician with a wife and two little children and in the maid's room there was a help for me.</span> <span id="s209">She was my cooks and she was looking always after my children, uh a Jewish person, a Jewish woman, an elderly woman and there was living eight, nine, nine or ten person in this two-room flat, but there was living.</span> <span id="s210">In uh during this time I think it was May...for that and we got a lot of control.</span> <span id="s211">I am not a historian to to...and we had heard that the...in the...what happened in the countryside everywhere and what was the meaning ghetto.</span> <span id="s212">That I think there was together and what the meaning deportation.</span> <span id="s213">Not exactly...only about.</span> <span id="s214">We didn't get any any detail how was this deportation...really mainly I, I wasn't not to think about only the bad things.</span> <span id="s215">Always I I was looking what is deportation.</span> <span id="s216">To take the people another place to work.</span> <span id="s217">Maybe uncomfortable maybe but this is the maximum what uh what I was able to imagine.</span> <span id="s218">But we have heard about the concentra...what what is happening on the country.</span> <span id="s219">In the meantime I was not very interested with uh Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s220">I have heard sometimes from my husband that he is a Zionist.</span> <span id="s221">OK.</span> <span id="s222">It's his business, and he went always out from the house...a lot of telephones and he hold his horse on connection, but I was not very interested as long...he was....I think we had had a feeling during July...it was continued this deportation from the country and we began to get the feeling that now is our turn because this deportation, this ghetto together...put together the people and put in because it came very very close to Budapest, till the suburbs.</span> <span id="s223">And it was a a feeling that tomorrow, after tomorrow our turn is coming.</span> <span id="s224">Then uh I think it may be August...we get some some information that what is stopped uh you know, ...uh stopped the deportations.</span> <span id="s225">And he changed the government and will be another uh solution but uh what will happen with the Jewish population, so we get a little breathe, and uh to change the government it really means a little more liberal and only to hear the the announced that what is stopped, the deportation, so it was a little bit out from the immediately danger, but I must tell you that I didn't shout that the deportation it is dead.</span> <span id="s226">I didn't run to understand.</span> <span id="s227">My husband began to speak about this, that you know these people is going to .</span> <span id="s228">And I told you are crazy.</span> <span id="s229">You are speaking something what is believable.</span> <span id="s230">Why?</span> <span id="s231">When when people must hear...why not in the press, why not make these organization and to take children, old people, and my husband told yes, this is the sign and when the people is taken for the work, why the children, why the old people, why the the ill people, why everybody?</span> <span id="s232">These people will bring the and I thought it is impossible.</span> <span id="s233">Don't speak in this way.</span> <span id="s234">I wanted not to hear it this way, but...so we get a little breathe, a little better feeling and even we began to very optimist, very...that the war must be finished.</span> <span id="s235">I think that uh...as a matter of fact we have heard what is the situation on the on the front and it was far uh after Stalingrad and we knows that the Russian is coming uh closer and closer to to Hungary and really I know I cannot uh mention what was the front situation, but it was a possibility to think that we had a little uh a little uh future, maybe that we will be the only person in Budapest, the only Jews to survive this with our , without without to take to deport...to be to be deported.</span> <span id="s236">That or dead.</span> <span id="s237">So it was a quite a good feeling till 16th of October.</span> <span id="s238">This was a..</span> <span id="s239">.</span> <span id="s240">if I can good remember a Sunday, a nice autumn Sunday.</span> <span id="s241">We went out, my husband and I, a little bit strolling on the on the Buda, to get a little fresh air.</span> <span id="s242">We uh carved out spot and this was a very nice forenoon only it was interesting to see that a lot of military uh vehicles went out from Budapest, German military uh uh cars and trucks.</span> <span id="s243">The direction was out from Budapest.</span> <span id="s244">We have seen this and it was very quiet in the in the town and we came back to this yellow-starred house and something was in the air.</span> <span id="s245">It was not announced anything, but everybody had had a feeling this is a strange interesting day.</span> <span id="s246">Something will happen.</span> <span id="s247">In the same day so in the noontime uh not in the our with whom we changed the the flat, he came in and he told you know Mr. Szamosi when something will change, we will change back the flat.</span> <span id="s248">We had nothing again...uh against each other.</span> <span id="s249">You are you are agreed that I didn't made anything against you, and my husband thought OK, OK, OK.</span> <span id="s250">It was so in the air even the Christian people had had a feeling something good happened in the very very next future.</span> <span id="s251">After noon we have heard the declara...uh declaration from that he finished the the the partnership with uh with the Germans.</span> <span id="s252">It was to hear it was something that we finished from our side, but in the same time we was with each other, and my husband thought interesting that they are making such a big change.</span> <span id="s253">Where is the Hungarian army?</span> <span id="s254">How can, how can we change something for such a drastic way.</span> <span id="s255">We was coming through the on the bridge what was always uh uh guarded from the Hungarian and from the German army.</span> <span id="s256">There was always guards.</span> <span id="s257">When we came back there was no guards.</span> <span id="s258">There was no Hungarian and no no German.</span> <span id="s259">It was very strange.</span> <span id="s260">It was just so...if somebody's thinking about the the , it must be something.</span> <span id="s261">We hadn't hadn't seen any Hungarian uh soldiers during our our stroll, but it was a fantastic uh several minutes to hear this, but in our our heart it was not the feeling .</span> <span id="s262">We finished.</span> <span id="s263">After a..</span> <span id="s264">.</span> <span id="s265">it was...as we we had heard this declaration twice in the radio or three times.</span> <span id="s266">Then the radio began to give German march music, German.</span> <span id="s267">There was no Hungarian.</span> <span id="s268">It was German.</span> <span id="s269">Then after the music...always very, very military uh music...we had heard voices, a message for uh Nilos uh leader people.</span> <span id="s270">There I will never forget the name that and there was a voice, please come back.</span> <span id="s271">please come back.</span> <span id="s272">A very uh prominent Nilos.</span> <span id="s273">Then I had un we understand that here happened something, what was in a good way but came out in the opposite way.</span> <span id="s274">And uh then in the same evening we have heard that uh that the declaration for is void and the new govern...government is the Nilos government.</span> <span id="s275">The leader is and several other very uh fraidful (ph) for names, anti- Semitic persons, Nilos leaders.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Maybe this is the perfect place to pause and change tapes, give you a moment... End of Tape # 1</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s279">We're starting with the end of October 15, 1943...</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No.</span> <span id="s281">No.</span> <span id="s282">Yeah.</span> <span id="s283">Fifteen October, yes.</span> <span id="s284">And and so this was the big change, all the house, all the population from this house, all the people was on the, on the field.</span> <span id="s285">Nobody went to sleep.</span> <span id="s286">We was waiting what will happen with us.</span> <span id="s287">Mainly because our house was the very first house of the Nilos Nilos government take these sixty, this became the headquarter and we was the very first house in the back street for this corner house, so we had the feeling that when they are making something, then we are the first in that area...the yellow-star.</span> <span id="s288">Everybody was standing.</span> <span id="s289">We was...like a guard closed the the door from the house.</span> <span id="s290">We was looking out in the night, during the night.</span> <span id="s291">Even the people pushed there, there was from this war factory, from this noodle factory a truck.</span> <span id="s292">They pushed this the door, not because this was something that saved the house, only a feeling something to make.</span> <span id="s293">We have seen people on the street, groups, guarded with Nilos uh people with a with a gun.</span> <span id="s294">I think it was...they went on the street with hand up, mainly men in the direction to the corner house, this headquarter.</span> <span id="s295">Nobody knows why, which kind of people, Jewish people, so this was the first night.</span> <span id="s296">Nobody was sleeping and nobody knows what, what will be the next day.</span> <span id="s297">There was order that the...after the declaration, a lot of houses...the people went to take down the sign.</span> <span id="s298">Naturally their first order was to put, to return the sign, the yellow...the yellow star was quite a big star, about almost a meter big on the on the houses, and the cur...curfew... what is the...and the naturally we...that that the Jewish people not allowed to go out from the houses.</span> <span id="s299">There was every house there was a conceriege or somebody who was responsible.</span> <span id="s300">Every house was a list with a with a..</span> <span id="s301">.</span> <span id="s302">tenants...how many people is there, who is there, and this was the order that nobody can leave the houses.</span> <span id="s303">Uh my husband began to speak about leaving...we must run out from this house.</span> <span id="s304">This was not a question to go out, because the conceriege was sympathetic and that was this...a good friend is factory owner and he was able, every every time to open the door and to to make something.</span> <span id="s305">This was not a question of where.</span> <span id="s306">Where.</span> <span id="s307">And this was the first time that my husband took in his pocket our uh second identification what he bought...he bought in the very beginning when when the German army came to to Hungary.</span> <span id="s308">He had had a imagination that uh he will be able to disappear when we are when we are taking other identification for the family like Christian people.</span> <span id="s309">When I have heard about this and he bought...I cannot remember what was the connection, how he bought this from a Christian family...uh the father and the mother about the same age like my husband and I with two children.</span> <span id="s310">Accidentally the name from the children was Peter and I think my daughter was Mariam... .</span> <span id="s311">It was not very far, about the same age and in those time my husband paid paid a nice sum from this but I wanted what to took in my hand.</span> <span id="s312">It was something what normal person cannot imagine how I carried with that name and other identification and I thought I will not see these.</span> <span id="s313">You must put this someplace.</span> <span id="s314">I cannot take in the hand.</span> <span id="s315">If I different name and they different person and this was the time when my husband took this false identification and he put in his pocket and he told he must walk go out from this house.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">And I thought no where.</span> <span id="s317">I don't know where.</span> <span id="s318">I don't know where.</span> <span id="s319">There was Miriam.</span> <span id="s320">It was October.</span> <span id="s321">She was nine years old...big, uh nine months old.</span> <span id="s322">Little baby, and my son was two and a half years old, and I thought I don't know where...I I'm not able to go on on the street.</span> <span id="s323">Where?</span> <span id="s324">Where?</span> <span id="s325">And he told very very strong, I am going and I will be and he gave me an address, a Christian woman...she was my sister's business companion and uh my sister and my sisters was living in the same house before the...and he told I will be there and there's where you...and he went out with uh with my son.</span> <span id="s326">I wanted not to go but he was sure that when he is going out with my son I will blind go after him, not to think.</span> <span id="s327">I was putting something in the carriage for the baby and something...I I cannot remember what, diapers...something what I put together and I went with this carriage after my my husband and in this house in a very elegant area from Budapest in the downtown, but the downtown was very elegant and I went in in this flat.</span> <span id="s328">The woman was at home...a little flat, neat, very neat, a private flat, an older flat and the woman was occupied to airing the fur coats and everything for the next winter and we was, and I arrived there like in a trance.</span> <span id="s329">She was speaking...I don't know...she told me...this I remember...she told me you know that you cannot remain here because the concereige knows you, and I said yes, I know.</span> <span id="s330">But only I want for a little bit to sit down and to think what to make.</span> <span id="s331">We went out from the house because there was no place and there was really no place because the concerige was .</span> <span id="s332">I was almost every day there in the in the better time when my sister was living there, so we went from the street, afternoon, late afternoon, little rain and what an idea what we are making during the night uh during the night and slowly slowly it became dark.</span> <span id="s333">Then I find out that a goes in from Transylvania.</span> <span id="s334">She married a Christian person and she came several months earlier, left Transylvania what was closer to the to the Russian Russian frontier and I don't know how I was able to remember for this address, but I am going this is my only person, half Christian...they they was living like Christian because her husband was Christian, and I thought this is the only address I can go in.</span> <span id="s335">Now I I cannot remember which direction, which place was this.</span> <span id="s336">I find with , and there was a sub-tenant in a flat.</span> <span id="s337">We went in.</span> <span id="s338">The lady from the...the owner from the flat let let us in, come in and I told to my cousin that we had no other way.</span> <span id="s339">We must remain below some some roof because it is raining and dark and there was there was black-out and cur...curfew and uh she was a very lovely person.</span> <span id="s340">She told OK.</span> <span id="s341">If you have a possibility, you must speak with this lady from the from the flat, and I immediately find out this...I went on in the corridor and I told that we are living...we are a family and we are living in Buda.</span> <span id="s342">I don't know that you get information from Budapest that it is two part...Pest and the Danube and the other part is Buda and bridges two part, and I told that we are living in Buda.</span> <span id="s343">We was in the other part, in the part of Pest, and we wanted to go home but the, all the bridges is blocked with the with the Nilos soldiers and uh forbid for people to to cross the bridges.</span> <span id="s344">We are not able to go home.</span> <span id="s345">We must spend one night here in this side from Budapest.</span> <span id="s346">If it's not against this that we remain here in this uh....and she told OK.</span> <span id="s347">This room was, I cannot say in feet...it was five meters.</span> <span id="s348">It is a maid...it was for a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">There was one bed and maybe another place like one of the half bed.</span> <span id="s350">We made some arrangements for the night.</span> <span id="s351">The two men was on the floor, lying on the floor.</span> <span id="s352">My cousin and I in the bed, and near our feet my two and a half year old boy, and Miriam in the carriage for the for the night, so we spend the night there.</span> <span id="s353">To spend the night but not to sleep, and this was the second night that I was not sleeping for a minute, only to think about what will be tomorrow.</span> <span id="s354">How we are....how we can continue tomorrow.</span> <span id="s355">We left this house on the second of daylight.</span> <span id="s356">Then we find out that this uh...I mentioned earlier that uh this woman where we find each other before my husband was the business company and from my sister.</span> <span id="s357">The business was a a lady hat salon.</span> <span id="s358">One was in the same house, but another another house after the corner.</span> <span id="s359">This was a modern uh shop with toilet and with telephone and my husband decided that he will make his investigation what we can make during that time and he will spend the night in this shop.</span> <span id="s360">The woman will close the shop and he will be inside and I thought OK and I am going to look after a flat like a refugee from Transylvania, like a family who was afraid from the Russian and I am a refugee, refugee from Transylvania.</span> <span id="s361">I was without any papers.</span> <span id="s362">I went with the carriage and near, near the carriages.</span> <span id="s363">My son Peter and I went from house to house.</span> <span id="s364">I went in to ask the concierge can you find in this house a free room.</span> <span id="s365">I am a refugee from Transylvania.</span> <span id="s366">It was...I was never afraid that I am suspicious like a Jews because I was very very uh Aryan type and the two children was blonde Aryan type, like Hitler looking.</span> <span id="s367">And I went from house to house knowing this was no house.</span> <span id="s368">The...what can you say that the...it is not right here in this house, not free uh free room to to let it, but here, there is a family, a couple with a child and a very big family and the woman is a very good woman.</span> <span id="s369">She is working in the Hungary in the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s370">It was not the best thing for me because the Hungarian Red Cross was very anti-Semitic, but she's a very good woman and I am almost sure that if you are asking personally she will give you temporary a room because there is a lot of room.</span> <span id="s371">I went up and I was speaking with this woman and she was very kind.</span> <span id="s372">She give me in in the flat, there was a room with a bed, a big room, a big...very big rooms, these old fashioned houses.</span> <span id="s373">So I get their roof.</span> <span id="s374">This was maybe noontime, something like this.</span> <span id="s375">I was able a little bit to rest but I was not able, not to eat, not to think about to eat something.</span> <span id="s376">I..</span> <span id="s377">.</span> <span id="s378">even I can cannot remember what I gave for the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Surely I gave something.</span> <span id="s380">Surely I put something in their carriage.</span> <span id="s381">It was in early evening when came back the husband from this woman.</span> <span id="s382">They invited us to the uh dinner and I was not able not to eat.</span> <span id="s383">It was a little bit maybe suspicious that I am such uh stressed that I am not able to speak.</span> <span id="s384">I apologize that I have had from my things I hid all of it and I I was able to swallow a tea, and this was...and they were speaking that tomorrow you must uh go to the to the office where all the all the refugee people will gather identification and everything and I put a story that uh I left the same little town in Transylvania from from where my cousin where spent earlier, earlier what I was not and I told I am, I was living in was the name from the little town and my husband is in the military service but I don't know...several months I didn't get any message from him.</span> <span id="s385">I don't know which place he's in and it came out, this was my story that uh accidentally there that was a a truck, an auto with several people who was facing to Budapest, and they told me well you can with us to Budapest.</span> <span id="s386">We have some place to to pick you up, and I decided to get to Budapest with this uh with this uh uh with this...not truck, truck...and I arrived to Budapest and now I am looking for some friend from my husband who is, who will will be able maybe to find me a place to live.</span> <span id="s387">This was my story to give to this person.</span> <span id="s388">And then it was early evening and we were were strolling a little bit in the in the big big flat and I don't know how it happened that uh my son came in alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Immediately I have heard that terrible screaming and I ran what happened with my little son and a woman saved me.</span> <span id="s390">I wanted only to help him to make peepee.</span> <span id="s391">I saw that he wanted to make peepee and my son was screaming and I thought oh thank you very much.</span> <span id="s392">Will you the help to the to wash, wash the children and I told thank you.</span> <span id="s393">I will make alone.</span> <span id="s394">She wanted to see the children, mainly my son.</span> <span id="s395">Only she wanted to help me.</span> <span id="s396">She wanted to to make a bath, and I thought thank you, I will make it alone.</span> <span id="s397">Thank you.</span> <span id="s398">I left to her the little bit to Miriam.</span> <span id="s399">You understand what I was meaning, so they went to...I had put the children to sleep and I went to the bed and I had a feeling this is not the place for me.</span> <span id="s400">I..</span> <span id="s401">.</span> <span id="s402">and this woman is suspicious.</span> <span id="s403">She's looking and and asking questions.</span> <span id="s404">This is not s place to remain.</span> <span id="s405">And what what how can I make out every day.</span> <span id="s406">And I was under in the bed during all the night, not a five minute to to able to sleep.</span> <span id="s407">This was the third night without to sleep.</span> <span id="s408">And I was thinking and thinking what to make, how to make...I must escape from this threat, because this is a threat for me.</span> <span id="s409">How can I escape not to make suspicious that I am running out from a very good place, a very lovely person.</span> <span id="s410">The second day I was standing near the window.</span> <span id="s411">I was looking out.</span> <span id="s412">There was opposite another house and I was thinking what to make out to make the woman will you go to the office to to arrange your papers.</span> <span id="s413">I can help you.</span> <span id="s414">I will go with you.</span> <span id="s415">And I told thank you, very nice, thank you, but maybe I am waiting because now it's raining and and I must take the little baby's a little later, and I was looking out.</span> <span id="s416">She was standing behind me.</span> <span id="s417">This I don't ever forget, this voice...I was looking out and the opposite house was people was moving and she told me now these people there, and I was asking which kind of people is living there.</span> <span id="s418">She told Jewish people.</span> <span id="s419">I was standing like like I got my eyes in my in my heart and I was able to look.</span> <span id="s420">Why can't I..</span> <span id="s421">.</span> <span id="s422">don't really here in Budapest still the Jewish people in our place there.</span> <span id="s423">Since the summer time is no more Jewish, not one.</span> <span id="s424">I was able to speak...even today I get in my heart a..</span> <span id="s425">.</span> <span id="s426">it was something terrible feeling and I told this woman...this was my luck, in those times that every one every flat was a with telephone, and here was no telephone, and I told this woman that uh I am going down to look a public telephone.</span> <span id="s427">I must find this friend from my husband and maybe that I can get a connection that he will arrange a place for me.</span> <span id="s428">And this was quite a logical way to go out from the house and I took Peter with me and I left Miriam and I went there.</span> <span id="s429">A corner I made and someplace a find a public telephone and I find my husband in this in this shop, this salon and I told to my husband that I am not able to stand this situation.</span> <span id="s430">I must came...I must escape from this house.</span> <span id="s431">I am in a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s432">You must come and play like you the friend from my husband and you are the person to help me, that you have a place for us and took us away from this house because I am not able to stand this situation.</span> <span id="s433">I was not eating third day and I was not sleeping the third day.</span> <span id="s434">Then when I finished this, I was coming out from the little shop where was this public telephone and I didn't understand how this happened.</span> <span id="s435">I told my address to my husband.</span> <span id="s436">I came out and I forget the address and I forget that which... what is the name from this family where I was living and I was standing with the carriage, maybe that I was very wild and I get a panic, that I left my daughter and I don't know where, which house.</span> <span id="s437">I will never find my daughter.</span> <span id="s438">I forget the name.</span> <span id="s439">I forget the street, which number.</span> <span id="s440">Where was this house and I I don't know...never ever I should not more in my lifetime I get such a panic.</span> <span id="s441">And I went in the middle of the street and I don't know how was my face, but one or two persons was coming to me...women...what happened, if you can...can we help you with something.</span> <span id="s442">And I began to say I am a refugee from Transylvania, and I get a a a room the last uh night, but I have I have forgot the name, the address.</span> <span id="s443">Nobody was able to help me and I thought OK, I will find...and they began to ask which way, which how how looks like this...and I thought that when I went in there was in the middle was the staircase and something I thought and then I thought OK, I will find.</span> <span id="s444">I don't know how long I was in this this panic, but I find the house, but I was in a terrible panic when I went up, and always with my with my son.</span> <span id="s445">My son was only near me.</span> <span id="s446">This was identification what could be a catastrophe when somebody find out that he is Jewish.</span> <span id="s447">I went in in the flat and I told to this woman that uh luckily I find this friend from my husband and he thought that he will come to take us uh to a certain place.</span> <span id="s448">Thank you for your hospitality.</span> <span id="s449">I'm very happy and thank you, and I went in the room and I began to speak with my son, two and a half years old.</span> <span id="s450">And I told Peter , Poppa (ph) will come but you must not make any sign.</span> <span id="s451">You cannot cry and you cannot speak.</span> <span id="s452">Please not cry, not speak.</span> <span id="s453">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s454">OK.</span> <span id="s455">We came back in our home...if you are, if you will not make any sign.</span> <span id="s456">Poppa will be here but you will not men...you will not cry and will not say any word.</span> <span id="s457">So my husband arrived.</span> <span id="s458">He was uh good-looking Christian person and I made this and this.</span> <span id="s459">I am happy to see you, and he told OK, I have heard about you and I have a place for you, a ticket, and took your children and they are going...I have a little flat for you, and we escaped from this house.</span> <span id="s460">Then on the street I told to my husband that I am not interested in what will be tomorrow.</span> <span id="s461">Maybe that we will die.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">tomorrow.</span> <span id="s463">I must go home.</span> <span id="s464">This home was not the real home, but it was my furniture, my...I thought to be with the best for the children, to go in my bed and to sleep a night and what will be tomorrow, we will die.</span> <span id="s465">I don't know.</span> <span id="s466">We will see what will be tomorrow.</span> <span id="s467">And this was our our way back to this house.</span> <span id="s468">In the meantime the population, there were people from the house not happened anything and we went to sleep and the next day to go through in this drama...my husband, early morning he went out but earlier there was a round-up.</span> <span id="s469">In the house two Nilos with a gun came in.</span> <span id="s470">Every man down to the courtyard till sixty year old with some one day food.</span> <span id="s471">They are going to digging uh traps for against tanks, in Budapest.</span> <span id="s472">My husband went and didn't went uh didn't go down.</span> <span id="s473">It was...he was young.</span> <span id="s474">He was not in this age to be at home like a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s475">And I went out and I went uh I told my husband cannot go, and the Nilos asked why.</span> <span id="s476">I told he's he's very ill.</span> <span id="s477">What is his illness?</span> <span id="s478">I told I told he is mentally ill.</span> <span id="s479">They told OK, remain at home.</span> <span id="s480">So later my husband went out and arranged with the Zionist organization that beginning from this story and other story that uh they are making several children home and my husband came back and told me and earlier whenever I have heard about Zionist organization or something only I have heard that uh in the summer time that when will go a group out from Hungary to Palestine through Romania, we are in this list.</span> <span id="s481">This was the whole what I had heard earlier I forget about it.</span> <span id="s482">Then my husband came back and he told that there will be a uh children home for is exist.</span> <span id="s483">We are...we get the permission to go in with the children and we can work there.</span> <span id="s484">And we went.</span> <span id="s485">And this was in the ...it was a very Jewish surrounding but it was out from the ghetto area, so we went in.</span> <span id="s486">There was about forty-six uh children, almost the same number adult people like uh like workers is...they are working with the children and the first evening and I take something from myself and I take my typewriter because this was my like in my hand.</span> <span id="s487">If I have heard about to work something, it was always in my mind connected with my typewriter.</span> <span id="s488">If I am working, I am working with my typewriter because I was not able to make any other work, so I took my typewriter and it was sitting there in an office room like half from this.</span> <span id="s489">Zionist people, my husband was uh knows several people from this...I, first time I have seen these people and uh there was some very peaceful uh discussion about uh when we are taking in in this home the children, which way we will educate the children.</span> <span id="s490">Uh it was a quite a a leftist uh influence.</span> <span id="s491">I think it was absolute curious for me that while Zionist Jews, Jews...what is the difference.</span> <span id="s492">What can be different they leftist or...we will...I was absolute out from these and my husband was sitting there.</span> <span id="s493">He was very tight-lipped, tight-lipped.</span> <span id="s494">He was not speaking one word.</span> <span id="s495">I have seen on the face that something he was not satisfied.</span> <span id="s496">Later I learned that this was not the thing what was so interesting to speak about the education, how they are educating the children.</span> <span id="s497">So the second day he disappeared and went out and after several hours he came back uh some kind of carriage...carriage uh platform (ph), two wheel and somebody was personally to to pushing this and uh and there was a lot of uh dry noodle from this war factory and uh some some uh margarine, some very important cleaning things, again supplies, games...several very practical things, and he put these in and it was a little bit interesting for the leaders from this group that here is a person...he was not uh saying convert, and he is making what is necessary to make, so to ask the leadership that I have right to buy these or to bring these in, so it was quite an effective uh beginning to work in this in this chil...children home.</span> <span id="s498">So in a very short time my husband took in his hand to, how to fill up with children these not to be very care...very careful how many children we can give place or what or which kind of children over.</span> <span id="s499">With this, in this time outside from this children home, becomes the the to take the Jewish people all in the all that people didn't...certain area what will what will be the ghetto, but the ghetto was already opened.</span> <span id="s500">The very old people must go in the in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s501">The people till uh sixty must go in a certain place like a horse racing uh area.</span> <span id="s502">Women in another area and there was a in a block out on the street.</span> <span id="s503">Uh children above sixteen must go with the with the adult people.</span> <span id="s504">Below this remain in the house.</span> <span id="s505">A woman, women with uh with less than one years old baby can remain with the baby in the Jewish house.</span> <span id="s506">So it uh produced a lot of children without parents in these yellow-starred houses.</span> <span id="s507">Their mother went in this way, the father there and there was the concierge to be responsible that all these people went, left the house and not remained or hidden in the house.</span> <span id="s508">So that began to...that meant a lot of children from one, one and a half year till fifteen, fourteen, fifteen and on without without parents.</span> <span id="s509">This was the first to make this children's home, to bring in these children in a home and this action made by Otto Komo (ph).</span> <span id="s510">Have you heard about Otto Komo.</span> <span id="s511">He was the president of the Zionist uh Hungarian Zionist uh organization and he was a leader who get the leadership to to save the children and the the how to say umbrella was the uh International Red Cross to give a section and above this was the Swiss Embassy.</span> <span id="s512">From the Swiss Embassy the the help gave with their .</span> <span id="s513">Later we learned that he was an absolute perfect savior during all the time, without any uh bit of or or something, but this is another story.</span> <span id="s514">I cannot go...yeah...so my, our home became this children home.</span> <span id="s515">The two children was in a room...I don't...I I cannot remember exactly because my husband took in almost immediately his brother's wife with two little children and my my sister-in-law, she told you can be occupied in the office.</span> <span id="s516">I will occupied with the children, your children together with mine, and I was occupied in the office.</span> <span id="s517">I wanted immediately to make lists about the names.</span> <span id="s518">There was children and I told who knows who is these children.</span> <span id="s519">Must take out if somebody is in the age to tell the name is OK or an other from the neighbor knows that this is this younger child, what is the name.</span> <span id="s520">I was such a person to make some organization, some order, and I began to make some lists who is the children, what is the name, which house they was coming in.</span> <span id="s521">If somebody will ask or might be a person, if a person, not a , so this began to be my occupation and my husband went mainly out and he goes...he went in the headquarter from this International Red Cross organization, the children from the headquarter was in the or .</span> <span id="s522">This was a very famous uh headquarter for the Zionist organization and this was the source later for the shutzpasses (ph) and the several places including uh uh storage where was where was food for the children homes and everything and my husband began began to work at on the outside.</span> <span id="s523">He was not able to sit down.</span> <span id="s524">From place to place and to get frequent information to put that information to to look always a little bit farther what to what to what is necessary to made, what and this...he went to see other children home that there is the food and everything is going OK.</span> <span id="s525">He was not nominated for this, never.</span> <span id="s526">He made this because he has had a feeling that somebody not make this the practically way, and uh so he become to be a a living, moving connection between the several uh several uh I say houses...uh children home or offices and these children homes get permission to remain for a certain time outside from the ghetto, and what Komo take is who was the person who was looking after the house, several houses, empty houses that is good for this for uh , enough place for to make a contract with the owner to rent and this was Otto Komo's work and uh these homes was very very short time full with children, and the these homes was very uh uh not uh not together, not in a certain uh part from the town.</span> <span id="s527">It was several very, very uh different places.</span> <span id="s528">Then we was living in this house and then began the shutzpass area.</span> <span id="s529">Can I take a..</span> <span id="s530">.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Please.</span> <span id="s532">Take your time.</span> <span id="s533">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Uh lot of uh men who was who was in the labor camp, they came out...there was two way to make a little bit easier the life.</span> <span id="s535">One way was to...uh these people was naturally without any uniform.</span> <span id="s536">Everybody was in the in the sport...something what they was able to to get and the sign was a yellow band that they are belonging uh belongs to a a labor group.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">There was a some possibility...you know there was some uh like a like a secret telephone.</span> <span id="s538">When they somebody get some an information that something will occur is the way that these went like a like a fire that...the information that if somebody will be combatted (ph), a Christian will not take will not go out from Hungary, will not go to Germany because this was the frightening this labor group will will be taken to Germany.</span> <span id="s539">Then a lot of big...it is is not uh not like depor...deportation.</span> <span id="s540">Like workers group to work in Germany, but not out from the Hungarian borders.</span> <span id="s541">That a lot of people was running to the next church to be converted and to get a white band because there was the that these groups with the white band, they will remain in Hungary, so it was a a mania to learn the...uh I don't know how to say this, praying some very common praying uh in the Catholic uh way and to con...to be converted.</span> <span id="s542">And uh when somebody, the men get this uh this paper that he's converting Jews to Christian, then he get this white uh band.</span> <span id="s543">A lot of people made these without the without the holy water.</span> <span id="s544">Paid something and get the paper and immediately was in the a little bit back uh uh but it was not so very interesting, so then came out the new uh possibility that if somebody has a a shutzpass, what was a..</span> <span id="s545">.</span> <span id="s546">how to say...a document that the certain person who has a a passport from a from a neutral country or a collective passport or something like this, that he get a a document and this name became shutzpass.</span> <span id="s547">It is save saving passes, something to translate.</span> <span id="s548">The first shutzpass we have heard about from about Wallenberg, but this was a very elegant, very very noble shutzpass.</span> <span id="s549">We had heard only that the Swede con...uh embassy is giving shutzpass for people who have relatives in Sweden or business connection with Sweden, or who has had.</span> <span id="s550">Hungarian people was very far from Sweden, and it was very when we have heard that somebody is uh have a Swedish shutzpass.</span> <span id="s551">It was like a like a letter for the lifetime.</span> <span id="s552">We was not thinking about to get uh near to Swedish because we hadn't had relatives, haven't had any connection with the...so the the Swiss Consulate begans to give shutzpasses for people who was under under uh...how to say...uh on this list two thousand people who was uh taken in in in a group to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s553">This this group never was able to left Hungary because uh in the meantime...this was, I think the beginning was August or what July...in the meantime Romania made the...came out from the Axis uh not made but it surren...surrendered and uh there was no more possibility to to to make a way through from Hungary through Romania to to the seashore to get a to send a quite a big group to Palestine.</span> <span id="s554">But there was this list, and that was a collective passport, like a collective passport and this was the basic to from the Swiss Consulate to give out shutzpasses.</span> <span id="s555">So we was between the first uh group to get the shutzpasses because we both , our name, our family was in this uh in this list.</span> <span id="s556">The headquarter to make this shutzpasses was in the .</span> <span id="s557">This was a house uh what uh created from the Swiss Consulate, because the Swiss Emb...the Swiss Embassy was not uh...it was it was a very tumultuous work, very violent work and it was much better to put in a quite separate house and this became the very famous uh glass (ph) house, this uh .</span> <span id="s558">There was uh there uh began to work the leaders from the from the Zionist organization, several prominent uh Jewish person, later more and more relatives and and they began to work and to give out this shutzpass.</span> <span id="s559">This was working in in a certain way that these people who went to the to the horse horse racing place, or in other case the women, they was put in a brick (ph) factory.</span> <span id="s560">As long they will be uh deport...deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Were you to be deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Waiting for the deportation, not very enthusiastic waiting to go there.</span> <span id="s563">And that was several days that that was a possibility to find people, so at all apart from the family was going to the street, this glass house to get the the paper and went to the to this place to show up this place piece of paper that this person is saved.</span> <span id="s564">He had uh he had a right to remain here, and this worked.</span> <span id="s565">When a person was still there, naturally it was a possibility that he was sent for another place to work, to make against the tanks or something, so it was not hundred percent and this was not such an organization but was working like a clock work.</span> <span id="s566">It was everything was accidentally, so the street began to give these shutzpass and several days later we was, we get a a certain amount of papers from this shutzpass that you in the street, if you have somebody in danger, you can you can make this uh shutzpasses for the names what when you know this is actually in the danger whoever .</span> <span id="s567">We get these papers.</span> <span id="s568">It was nice to see and I began to make the shutzpasses.</span> <span id="s569">We was asking the last childrens who was coming in in the house, who is your...who was taken out from your family, your father, your mother names.</span> <span id="s570">We made the shutzpass and we send to the brick factory...</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: I just want to make something very clear.</span> <span id="s572">Were you working in the glass house to make shutzpasses...?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: No.</span> <span id="s574">No.</span> <span id="s575">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Where and how were you making the shutzpass?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: We get the paper from the glass house, and I was always sitting in the double...in this children home.</span> <span id="s578">There in the little office, there was a desk and there was my my uh typewriter.</span> <span id="s579">We get...and we was very happy when we could get fifteen, twenty paper, shutzpass and we asked the children, name your father, your mother and to make the shutzpass and then we find out that this letter from my my typewriter is the same like in the in the glass house, and we was so happy because .</span> <span id="s580">We saw that it will be very important for the for the Nilos that this is the same source or another source, but we was people grow up (ph) ...it was still not uh going in that...we and we can live.</span> <span id="s581">It was a big happiness that the same letters, the same same style writer...we saw that the real passport from the from the glass house.</span> <span id="s582">And I made these shutzpasses, ten, twenty a day.</span> <span id="s583">Uh we find uh young, very intelligent intelligence uh boys that was able to run on the street and to go to the brick uh factory and to ask and these people .</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Nobody knows how many times these was help or not help, because we was not looking after the same person who was coming out from the brick factory, and when he was able to go to a Christian friend or some other way to disappear, it was very OK.</span> <span id="s585">It was not...we get back only these people who was absolute helpless.</span> <span id="s586">Not a or these people who knows that my children is in this this home, in this very home.</span> <span id="s587">So it was not a control how many times these shutzpass helped people or not helped.</span> <span id="s588">We get back several shutzpass when we get back that this name was not appear.</span> <span id="s589">Nobody appeared in these names.</span> <span id="s590">Then we get back the shutzpass.</span> <span id="s591">Then we began to work a little bit with my uh , uh to wri...to wri...</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: To erase?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: To write the name...</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: You're erasing the name?</span> <span id="s595">You're taking...you're changing the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s597">Yeah.</span> <span id="s598">To use once more this paper.</span> <span id="s599">It was a very careful made work to take out with a..</span> <span id="s600">.</span> <span id="s601">with a to write out the name and to put another name, because it was very big value this paper with the stamp from the Swiss Consulate.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s603">This is a good place to pause.</span> <span id="s604">We will breathe a minute... A: Very good.</span> <span id="s605">Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">End of Tape # 2</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: We have begun.</span> <span id="s609">Will you tell me while, please, while you were typing the shutzpasses, what was your husband doing?</span> <span id="s610">Can you describe it and how you worked together?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: So I think in this time that I mentioned...we arrived the beginning November...uh my husband was in all the time...I cannot remember that he was sitting in the office from the children home.</span> <span id="s612">He was in and out, in and out.</span> <span id="s613">Only the night he spent there and very little there together in the same office, with eight other people.</span> <span id="s614">Uh in the same time, my husband began began to work...how to say to work, to influence uh his uh business friend from the Spanish Consulate who was the the name Dr. Farkas Zolta (ph).</span> <span id="s615">I am saying Hungarian way the name and he was the uh legion adviser in the Spanish Consulate.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Earlier he was a business client to my husband but they they became so better connected like only business.</span> <span id="s617">He bought uh brought from through my husband' office or something something from...it is not interesting...this was a a good business connection and he was uh for sure he was not an anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s618">But for sure he was not a Jew.</span> <span id="s619">And my husband...this I didn't heard immediately.</span> <span id="s620">I learned this after when happened something that my husband had kept a a idea that there is a neutral consulate, neutral consulate, the Spanish Consulate, maybe that they can help like the Swedish or like the Swiss Consulate.</span> <span id="s621">Naturally my husband began to to work to for our family and uh he asked some paper that uh which kind of paper can (cough) get Dr. Farkash (ph) from the Spanish Consulate, what can...what we can use like uh a shutzpass or maybe more, maybe a a passport.</span> <span id="s622">But this this uh Farkas was a very careful person.</span> <span id="s623">And uh a real bureaucrat because he was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s624">He was not uh thinking about swindle way what to make.</span> <span id="s625">He wanted to make something uh what is a in in the frame of the of the law.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Something what is uh what is looks like logical and uh and uh some .</span> <span id="s627">But but the beginning I hadn't heard about this.</span> <span id="s628">I was occupied in the children home.</span> <span id="s629">My husband was occupied around the town, somewhere from morning till afternoon, late afternoon.</span> <span id="s630">What he's doing, which place he went I didn't know in those times.</span> <span id="s631">Lately I have heard about the Spanish shutzpass, but this Spa...Spanish shutz...shutzpass, it was coming out in a very certain way.</span> <span id="s632">People who was before the to uh to to be the dep...deported, when the first time when they get...this was the earlier in the and easier way to get a Swiss shutzpass...I must finish with the with the Swiss because this was uh...originally it was a higher higher and it was possible for a higher number to give about thirty (ph) thousand people to give, and uh some how it began...it was the very very uh good stamped paper from the Swiss Consulate, but later several young saviors (ph) find out that another place uh workshop can make the same thing, and to make a made a false uh stamp and to made more and more from this, from this shutzpass.</span> <span id="s633">This was a very short time help from place to place.</span> <span id="s634">Maybe that later it was not interesting, but every half an hour, every minute was a was a question of life.</span> <span id="s635">The the Swedish...oh the Spanish began if I remember...that my husband began to...no...people was caming back from the or individual escaped from the group to put in the brick factory or something...</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: I don't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: There was groups to take from the Jewish houses, groups to to bring to to the brick factory.</span> <span id="s638">Several people was able to escape from from the group, but it was naturally not a lot.</span> <span id="s639">Then...now I know the connection...(laughter)...I must make a little order in that...uh there exist already for the for the uh Swede protegees was several houses where out, far out from the from the ghetto area, several houses.</span> <span id="s640">These houses in the protected area, protected Jewish area...it was a quite a different section from the and there was on the house that this is protected by the by the Swede by the Swedish Embassy.</span> <span id="s641">The same thing made made after this the Swiss to put the people who was bringing back and who was not able to find in a place to put in these houses, these protected houses, and there was written this is uh the Swedish...this is protected by the Swiss Consulate.</span> <span id="s642">Later when more and more people was saved by the Swiss that day my husband and the leaders from this uh movement in the in the glass house, that we can make other houses like uh like uh saved by the International Red Cross.</span> <span id="s643">This was a little bit crazy because Swede is uh Spain... is a a state of Inter...International Red Cross is not a state, but we was always, we must uh we must think about this with the time went we was connected more and more primitive people from the Nilos.</span> <span id="s644">The prominent people was going slowly out from from Budapest, not uh not remain as long the Russian will will make something.</span> <span id="s645">So it was, it work and then my husband began to work with with uh we we get shutzpass, our family.</span> <span id="s646">We get the passport, uh Spanish passport.</span> <span id="s647">That's mean that there was the law if somebody has a a passport from a neutral neutral uh country, he is out from the deportation, from the danger from the deportation.</span> <span id="s648">It was nice to get this.</span> <span id="s649">But my husband had testing more more possibility to use out after when he made for our family, for the father and the mother...passport they didn't get...only shutzpass, the other part from the family.</span> <span id="s650">Then he has seen more possibility to use out these neutral consulate and and to involve in this in this...uh there was some connection between Komo Otto (ph) and the Spanish consulate earlier, but it was uh nothing came out from this and my husband made a a agreement with the Dr. Farkas that if you can influence the charge d'affaires that he will be ready to give out shutzpasses, I will give you a piece of plot, and what a piece of plot uh uh what we, what was in our ownership to like a payment uh and he always wanted to buy this piece of...this was a little, very quite a valuable little plot.</span> <span id="s651">He wanted to buy this earlier uh Farkash but there wasn't reason for our way to sell this, but in this, in this time my husband told if you uh could be able to influence the Swedish Consulate to involve this, I will give you this this piece of uh piece of uh building place.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: So so he...you were holding... A: Bribed.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Bribing.</span> <span id="s654">You were bribing Farkash with the building lot...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s656">It is not it is not a bribing...it is to to make a little bit uh motivated in these things, because uh people is uh was absolute not motivated why I am going to help Jews.</span> <span id="s657">To to make a little bit uh and he was he was very very uh fond for this piece of land.</span> <span id="s658">It was a gentlemen agreement, not by in ink and after...I don't know...several days, weeks...every week was a like a lifetime...he wanted to put down this uh in like a contract and we made this contract.</span> <span id="s659">I have in my documentation.</span> <span id="s660">It was a short contract that uh we are like selling this this piece of land for Dr. Farkash and he wanted a little bit...yeah...in those times it was uh forbidden to uh Jewish uh uh belongings to to sell, and it was impossible to write in the register book so it was uh more than a gentlemen agreement, but it was making like in a time when we was in a very strong need.</span> <span id="s661">He wanted another paper that when we change the situation, every situation we are spending in this uh contract, that we are we are ready immediately to to say that we will never return our worth or to say to leave is that we made this in in a such situation that this was a life, a question of life and death, so there is another letter and they have this that we we signed this that no way when change the the situation, we will take back this this, and this was a value about in those time hundred thousand penge but was about eight years already.</span> <span id="s662">It was a..</span> <span id="s663">.</span> <span id="s664">but we was thinking about our life and not the not the belongings.</span> <span id="s665">And this made the...motivated Farkash to go in and to make something.</span> <span id="s666">I must immediately tell you that nobody in that area was giving so much because he was in in his soul he was involved, maybe that he has forget the in the meantime the the sum or the value what he get.</span> <span id="s667">He was working like a person.</span> <span id="s668">He was looking that I am able to help, I am able to help and it worthwhile to help people and this I must tell you that it is not interesting that somebody by the beginning was bribed or paid.</span> <span id="s669">The main thing what he made, and he made the maximum, Farkash.</span> <span id="s670">The maximum.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Tell us exactly...</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: So, they began to give uh shutzpass my husband, and other people...there was several Jewish people uh sheltered in the in the Embassy.</span> <span id="s673">They began to make shutzpass with uh photograph, almost the same text like the like the Swiss shutzpass, only it was more interesting with the with the with the photos, that people is uh getting to get a Spanish citizenship.</span> <span id="s674">The people...first we give the next uh family friends when he knows where is this and we was not together.</span> <span id="s675">My husband make a a list uh the families from this house where where what we lived before we went in the children home near the near the headquarter from the Nilos.</span> <span id="s676">There he get the whole list.</span> <span id="s677">I I mentioned that every uh signed...uh I become to be uh tired...uh every Jewish house with the with the yellow star, there was a list from the name exactly who is there.</span> <span id="s678">My hus...my husband get from this house the com...complete list and he made for everybody a shutzpass and naturally not every every shutzpass was with photo.</span> <span id="s679">Only when we find the people, when we find the people then my my husband will give me the photo from the family.</span> <span id="s680">He went in the Consulate, made the the shutzpass, and gave back to these people.</span> <span id="s681">And nobody knows why.</span> <span id="s682">Nobody knows why they get these, because we was...first of all there was not the was that people who is connected or people who have relatives in Spain, and this was more uh far to connected with Spain from Buda...from Budapest like uh Sweden, not a lot of relatives from Budapest was, Hungary, was in in Spain.</span> <span id="s683">So the people who get this uh the Spanish uh uh shutzpass, it was quite an exclusive and and elegant shutzpass, much more respectable than the Swiss because from the the Swiss began to be very much, and the Nilos began to uh re...realize that uh it is too much and it cannot be and cannot be uh respectable and uh they began to turn these and go out when they made a roundup, not to accept the...not everywhere but they began to...these these uh tendencies, .</span> <span id="s684">With the most the more respectable was this the Wallenberg shutzpass, the Swedish, but beginning the most was the the Spanish, and that was a a argument what uh Dr. Farkash used, may maybe some breathe that we are the the...someplace was very flexible and it was not a very difficult thing to to make an influence to help to the Jews.</span> <span id="s685">He was very helpful.</span> <span id="s686">He was not a hard bureaucrat or far not an anti- anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s687">So the most res.</span> <span id="s688">.</span> <span id="s689">respectable was the Spanish, because there was an an argument that the Spanish government, the only government he accepted the Nilos government.</span> <span id="s690">The very simple people on the street didn't understand what is accepted and not accepted.</span> <span id="s691">This was something.</span> <span id="s692">Gives gives a .</span> <span id="s693">The low end was the Swiss uh Swiss uh shutzpass.</span> <span id="s694">The next was the Swede and the highest was the was the Spanish shutzpass.</span> <span id="s695">It was not a big amount.</span> <span id="s696">It began to be more...yeah...it was a certain amount.</span> <span id="s697">Naturally when somebody was sheltered, Jews or even Christian there in the Embassy, and he had heard that I had a a neighbor or a friend from my neighbor or somebody use it a shutzpass, there was even, but never was uh there a line to to stand before the before the embassy like before...before the Swiss Embassy there was every day tumult, uh violent people to go in and to ask and to get these uh shutzpass.</span> <span id="s698">Almost the same thing but less was before the uh before the Swede Consulate.</span> <span id="s699">Here before the Spanish, there was never a line because the people don't know what is what is the way to get this.</span> <span id="s700">They...if somebody get it, it...they get, not asked.</span> <span id="s701">Mainly maybe that there was several people to ask Farkash or some breathe or I don't know...maybe by luck or can you can you get me, can you get a shutzpass.</span> <span id="s702">It was always valu...valuable for for people who was who was asking, but not from outside in a line and violent uh tumultuous uh scenes.</span> <span id="s703">This went very very discreet.</span> <span id="s704">My husband, when he went out and to give for the for for the people the shutzpass, never told that I am Szamosi or who I am.</span> <span id="s705">First of all because in the there's another uh other date because he was...I must here a little bit make order...he was...my husband was in the background and and the key position was for Farkash .</span> <span id="s706">My husband asked something from Farkash and Farkash made this, made the influence to get this from someplace.</span> <span id="s707">And this was such a shadow work.</span> <span id="s708">It went for a certain time when it was a little bit more and more valuable this uh shutzpass and they made Spanish houses for the for the protected uh people, and it was almost the same area...not always.</span> <span id="s709">It was it was far from the ghetto, but this was a certain area in Budapest uh in quiet a little circle, and this was became the name the protected ghetto.</span> <span id="s710">There was Swiss, uh Swedish and and uh and Spanish uh protected houses.</span> <span id="s711">People went in in these houses.</span> <span id="s712">My husband wanted to work more effective and there was there was a lot of handicap in the meantime that they already wanted to bring in the children home in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s713">And to go in to the police uh headquarter to speak in the in this to to get another term, to hold out the children from not to to put in in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s714">And so speak with these people and my husband was without any identification, only that he is a worker to the International Red Cross.</span> <span id="s715">There was not written that these Jews or not Jews.</span> <span id="s716">It was a a certificate.</span> <span id="s717">I get these two who who was working with the International Red Cross.</span> <span id="s718">It was a little uh uh like a booklet, hard uh cover and quite inside with the with the picture that this person is help, a worker in the International Red Cross.</span> <span id="s719">This was an old identification but he hold but he had had a feeling that this is not very much.</span> <span id="s720">He can be choosed with this be...like Komo Otto was a head worker for in the International Red Cross and not and everybody knows that he is a Jew and uh he wanted to get some nomination from this uh Spanish Consulate that he is working in the frame from the Spanish Consulate.</span> <span id="s721">Uh this was not an easy thing but immediately my husband wanted to put in Otto Komo (ph) to this position, because he had had an imagination that Otto Komo in a very big danger.</span> <span id="s722">He said there's known Jews.</span> <span id="s723">He he was working always against the the the the wave to save the Jews, and he was a very prominent person and he was Jewish and all his uh identification like a Jewish leader person.</span> <span id="s724">And my husband had had an imagination that he, Komo Otto is in a very big danger.</span> <span id="s725">And he was speaking with Komo Otto that uh that come in in the Spanish Consulate.</span> <span id="s726">You will be in a safe place, in a neutral in a in a neutral consulate.</span> <span id="s727">He wanted not to get these these uh personal uh exception or something, because he thought I am I am legal.</span> <span id="s728">I am sitting here in my position legal, absolute legal.</span> <span id="s729">But it was...he was a little bit , Komo...Komo Otto.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">He was a little bit uh look in the future that immediately it will be finished and then I can continue my work and to take the these orphan children and uh poor people to send to to Palestine and to make a a make a new home for the Jewish people, but in the meantime there was...the front was closed but to close it was a matter or something, something like this.</span> <span id="s731">Nobody knows how long it is for, and my husband beg...began to worry the very very deeply for Komo Otto.</span> <span id="s732">Then Farkash often spoke with to to prepare these nomination for Szamosi and Komo Otto.</span> <span id="s733">Somebody started OK, I am ready but what is there what is their rea...what is their basic.</span> <span id="s734">I must get a letter from , from the International Red Cross, that he asked me to make this this nomination for these two person.</span> <span id="s735">It was not a simple uh thing to influence what was much harder, a very...how to say, tough bureaucrat.</span> <span id="s736">There was...uh Komo Otto has a lot of fighting with the with uh .</span> <span id="s737">By the end uh was ready to give this letter, to send this letter to someplace, to the Spanish Consulate, and they get a letter I have in my my documentation that the Spanish Consulate nominated uh Szamosi and Komo Otto like a a co-worker or officer in the in the frame in the Spanish consulate.</span> <span id="s738">It was very important for my husband because while...have you some question?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Explain what you mean by nominating him as an officer in ?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: (Cough) When here you don't know this when somebody was...an an inside worker in a in a neutral consulate.</span> <span id="s741">These people was uh accepted for for any uh inside.</span> <span id="s742">They was free to go on the street and and to arrange things.</span> <span id="s743">This I have forgetted that this this was a made a to go in in several office uh police office or ministerium (ph) or something to speak in the in the interest for the Jewish people, so they get this uh identi...identification.</span> <span id="s744">Komo was not ready to use this.</span> <span id="s745">Still he he saw that he will take uh several several rooms in the Ritz (ph) Hotel.</span> <span id="s746">This was not bombarded, that there will be the... immediately after the war there will be the officers to organize the groups and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s747">And my husband everyday told me but hear this, these several days, what will happen.</span> <span id="s748">So this was this was always an like a mania in in the mind for my husband and this and this person is in danger, personally.</span> <span id="s749">So when they when they get this nomination...this was in mid-...I think after one day, two day the left Budapest.</span> <span id="s750">And this was a very nice day because there was .</span> <span id="s751">He get a breathe that I have no more boss.</span> <span id="s752">I must look influential and ask and to and to make the whole the whole ceremony to get something, almost and once more I am I must uh say that he was not a heavy person, ...helped, he was helpful.</span> <span id="s753">Uh but it was a very nice uh situation.</span> <span id="s754">We are here.</span> <span id="s755">The Embassy is here.</span> <span id="s756">The stamps, the papers, everything is here what we what we need, and we...and we are free.</span> <span id="s757">We can make what we want without control.</span> <span id="s758">But uh Farkash was a law...a lawyer.</span> <span id="s759">A person he was not a partisan.</span> <span id="s760">He was responsible to to make something in the Legion forum as it was OK we were free to make, but if somebody will ask that where is the where is this charge d'affaires, then then we cannot be uh Spanish, I the Hungarian Farkash or you the Hungarian Szamosi.</span> <span id="s761">And uh that was like I told I had heard...now I can hear my husband's voice.</span> <span id="s762">He told that Farkash happily told me that you know in our house there is an Italian.</span> <span id="s763">He will be good like a like a Spanish.</span> <span id="s764">Who knows that he is Italian and not Spanish.</span> <span id="s765">The name is quite good...Per...uh Perlasca.</span> <span id="s766">He will be the boss and so Perlasca became the boss.</span> <span id="s767">His was the nomination.</span> <span id="s768">This was...and now I must...if I am not going to wait to Perlasca because it is another uh but uh when the first interview about...after the when he get in the , the writer's gentile and every honor...there was a big interview in the Jerusalem Post and I wrote this uh...I was very...at first I was laughing on this on the situation, but I became a little bit bitter but this is a story and I did speak about this, that I was earlier too, so he told in this interview, Perlasca, that the first day I awake...I awake a nice day that uh somebody's left Budapest.</span> <span id="s769">The first day I didn't know what to make, but later I came in like a fish in the water, so that means that the first day he didn't know what to make but it was not uh very much to make.</span> <span id="s770">My husband was very happy to get somebody who give him a a to to help his uh appearance, and there remains the diplomatic car from the Spanish Consulate.</span> <span id="s771">My husband was a chauffeur what in those times was not every day.</span> <span id="s772">Not every people was a chauffeur because in those time was very few car and very few uh gentlemen chauffeur, but he was always work uh working with the car and he was a chauffeur, and he was happily he took the car and put near by Perlasca and he went there every day too to look after uh children homes and what need and what and which paper, who needs some shutzpass, what is the name, uh where is this people, and it was a big help with the car to make this and not on foot, but earlier he made on almost every day by foot.</span> <span id="s773">And he put that Perlasca that too I have a big help because he was able when when that he went in in a police station that I am here with this Spanish uh charge d'affaires and he was able to speak, because earlier once he was uh uh making a very difficult uh agreement with a police, in a police station for a children home what was surrounded to put in in the in the uh ghetto...my husband was alone to speak with this person that here I have a paper from a higher officer that this children home can remain in the place till 24 in December and this happened uh one week or ten days earlier, and this was a uh this uh uh argument between my husband and police uh chief there, and this was the only uh day when the police chief asked who are you.</span> <span id="s774">And then he take the paper from the Spanish Consulate that I am an employee, employed in the Spanish Consulate, and to this appearance it was a big help that he was able immediately to say that I am here with the Spanish charge d'affaires in this thing to arrange to arrange to look after somebody who was disappeared from the house, maybe that he is here in this police station or another.</span> <span id="s775">And he went every where in the in the children home and the...and to look the the the protected houses for a certain time with Perlasca, but for a certain time.</span> <span id="s776">Later Perlasca was not very much interested to to go out because the the whole situation was more and more dangerous plus the bom.</span> <span id="s777">.</span> <span id="s778">bombs because it was more and more closer the front and every day, almost every every hour was uh non-stop bom...bombs.</span> <span id="s779">So he was not uh...he left out slowly slowly from these these activity to see the and to take uh food or something.</span> <span id="s780">It was not his work.</span> <span id="s781">My my husband knows where is the storage from the International Red Cross, where is the food.</span> <span id="s782">The food was mainly some margarine, some mainly milk powder but was like stones what was necessary first to to make a powder from this, some uh uh very simple uh medicine and bread.</span> <span id="s783">The bread was very important.</span> <span id="s784">Naturally it was not in a very hugh amount but uh they made a agreement with a bak...a bakery who was ready I think hundred or some amount of bread to make every every day for the International Red Cross for the uh what my husband parted with the Spanish uh uh protected people to...because these people wanted to get a good paper when will change the regime that they was helpful for for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s785">So it was a..</span> <span id="s786">.</span> <span id="s787">to to be protect, to be protected when the change will come, so there was a..</span> <span id="s788">.</span> <span id="s789">I don't remember...I think in the but it is today not interesting that it in the memoir that where was the storage and and where and this uh bakery where where my husband was able uh to get some food.</span> <span id="s790">Later...this was the only bakery...uh to get some some bread and my husband took into Spanish consulate because there was the storage for food not very very uh luxury food but to to survive but the bread was an every day ration.</span> <span id="s791">So...yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Let's pause a minute because I want to be...I know there's a disagreement about Perlasca and I just wanted to be clear.</span> <span id="s793">Uh you feel that your husband initiated everything and did everything and Perlasca was only along...</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: He was a..</span> <span id="s795">.</span> <span id="s796">he gave us support.</span> <span id="s797">He gave us support for my husband because he was sitting there and he gaved for my husband appearance that some more and more and more stress that I am here with somebody.</span> <span id="s798">Later he was not ready to came out then uh what was often brought in in the house, not .</span> <span id="s799">Somebody was asked for for Farkash to to bring in in the Spanish Consulate in the building several gendarme.</span> <span id="s800">You know what is gendarme people?</span> <span id="s801">These was the most brutal police people from from the countryside.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">These people was not working in Budapest, but the most most brutal persons.</span> <span id="s803">And uh it was a little bit uh not uh comfortable for my husband and there was several Jewish uh Jewish person but it...now I get the picture but that in the in the Consulate there was another section for the Christian people.</span> <span id="s804">Refugees, Christian refugees like Perlasca, Italian and I don't know who others, but this was separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Did you know about this at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: In those time I did not know about this, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: We need, for this interview, we need to talk about only what you knew at the time.</span> <span id="s808">Not what...</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s810">In those time I didn't know this.</span> <span id="s811">Only I I I know that that Farkash all time was always very very careful what he is making not to make a big uh a big advertisement that we are giving uh even after when somebody's left the house.</span> <span id="s812">He was always always very careful not to make a big a big advertisement we are giving out shutzpasses.</span> <span id="s813">This was a very secret, very very very uh bad action.</span> <span id="s814">I had heard from my husband about Perlasca when when they was very happy to...he was very happy that I have somebody to go out and then from the residents, from the every day residents, slowly slowly went out the name from Perlasca.</span> <span id="s815">It was not a..</span> <span id="s816">.</span> <span id="s817">my husband began to be more more uh he get more uh more...he get in more in this in his actions and he went alone.</span> <span id="s818">He was not alone.</span> <span id="s819">Never he was alone.</span> <span id="s820">He was putting in the car uh somebody to take from this place from another place, or a Jewish person from the from the Embassy to bring to another to the where is...to the uh uh headquarter to the , or to give several lift to give for several people and when when uh Perlasca was not ready to co..</span> <span id="s821">.</span> <span id="s822">to came out, then my husband influenced these these uh man from this gendarme to sit near near by, near my husband.</span> <span id="s823">This was a very picture that somebody is going with a gentile.</span> <span id="s824">This was not .</span> <span id="s825">This went in this way, so my...one day my husband came home with a big bandage on the on the head that he went out from the...every every uh late evening, early afternoon, my husband came home limping...there is not connection.</span> <span id="s826">I with the children left the children home in a certain time and sit in the middle of in the middle of November or late November because the tendency began to be that this there was the paper that all child...children home must be in the ghetto uh 24th December.</span> <span id="s827">Then it was a tendency to make less people to remain in the children home, and uh my husband began to inform the people who is able to go in to this...well to find some hidden place...go out from this because this home is no more safe, no more than 24th December.</span> <span id="s828">They must put in in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s829">And a lot of people who was in the meantime...as I am speaking this story...there was some periods about I I think this is written in the memoir because I never I made a a how many people, children is there.</span> <span id="s830">Hundreds and hundreds children and more adult people who jammed jammed out from the and ran back, escaped some individual way and was coming in the in this house to get one night shelter to or to find the children or to find the the woman or only to find a roof for a night.</span> <span id="s831">And my husband began to say to these people it is not a safe place.</span> <span id="s832">If somebody has to have the possibility to disappear, then when not with uh Christian paper then there then in the protected ghetto with shutzpasses, uh Swiss or Spanish shutzpasses and only the volunteer people can can remain here with the children who is mainly every woman who has no place to go and not want to be in the pro...protected houses.</span> <span id="s833">This minimum people will remain here and we will see what will happen after 24th Nove...uh November and in the same time my husband finds some some somebody who finds for us a empty flat in an earlier Jew's uh family and we became a..</span> <span id="s834">.</span> <span id="s835">we became to live with this uh this second identification what my husband bought in the very beginning and I wanted not to see that I will live with another name, another identification, but this was the time when this was the only way and we went in in a house in uh near to the to the Danube, a flat like a Nilos family, this Christian name and and we get this flat.</span> <span id="s836">We was living there for a quite a short time.</span> <span id="s837">I don't know exactly the date...it was Christmas.</span> <span id="s838">On Christmas Day.</span> <span id="s839">He is so much lying, so much happening in this very short time that almost I am not able...my husband always ask asked me to write down during the all life time I was not ready to write all this, because I rather not to go in in my head and heart to to live through this period, and I am not a writer.</span> <span id="s840">I am only a typist, so this was 20 20th in December.</span> <span id="s841">In the in the meantime every...this headquarters for children children's homes...the people began to be less and less because this was clear that this is not a solution for the to be saved.</span> <span id="s842">All these children home and and headquarters and this must must go in the ghetto and the ghetto will be closed.</span> <span id="s843">The ghetto is already crowded, terrible uh terrible situation.</span> <span id="s844">A lot of...very few uh uh food.</span> <span id="s845">To give, to help to to supply these the ghetto was Komo Otto's work and several people who was helping for him and the remains the the children children home only with the children.</span> <span id="s846">The little children because when somebody was fourteen, fifteen years old, these children was able to find some hidden place alone, and this was an interesting period.</span> <span id="s847">My husband get a..</span> <span id="s848">.</span> <span id="s849">I think I never write on and I cannot remember which cloister (ph) was this that my husband went in and asked papers, Christian origin papers for girls, certificates, born certificate or parents uh uh marriage certificate to...some certificate to to make a person Christian.</span> <span id="s850">A born certificate.</span> <span id="s851">My husband bring these...I can't remember...this was quite a lot of papers and he get these from a from a clo...cloister and began to ask uh younger woman who is about this age, who can, who can use these.</span> <span id="s852">This was born in this age, some similarity some similar age, and this paper was enough to go out and to to be to get a job like a postman was not working, postwoman was not working very much in this but the tram...tramway, tram, electric tram on the street...this was working and there was to sold the tickets, the women work, and the the new the Nilos regime is very primitive.</span> <span id="s853">Woman became the first persons.</span> <span id="s854">There was no more more ready to work in this very simple work.</span> <span id="s855">So that was job available, and these Jewish women went to be a conductor on the tram.</span> <span id="s856">Get a hat and a something what was absolute perfect the uh identification for a Christian person so this was a a this was a way to to lower the the the population in these very crowded children home.</span> <span id="s857">This was a way the individuals disappearing was another way and the and the shutzpass, but already all these protected houses, it was full, full, full with people but it was not a question that people can live under under staircase or someplace, only inside someplace.</span> <span id="s858">Ten person in a room.</span> <span id="s859">It was not interesting.</span> <span id="s860">It was sure that this is not for a long time, but it was sure that this is not a life-saving.</span> <span id="s861">It is only a time .</span> <span id="s862">Never I was able to use this that we saved, we saved lives.</span> <span id="s863">We helped to survive from day to day, because somebody went with the good shutzpass, went from one place to another.</span> <span id="s864">It was very possible that a gang, a Nilos gang took this, these people and took them to Nilos headquarter or another not very headquarter and to began....where are the Jews, where are Jews and to make the torture and and to make the nice uh what was the only occupation from the Nilos uh uh...I cannot say this was not an army...gangs.</span> <span id="s865">This was the only...there was not very much to to .</span> <span id="s866">Only to make the personal hate and and to laugh on the...the torture people all the night to hang on the trees and with a paper that this is the fate the hidden Jewish people, all people who was hidden Jewish people when...and so and it was every day more and

Jewish person.</span> <span id="s878">He...my husband wanted to put in another place...I don't remember where...when I get a splinter for a bump.</span> <span id="s879">That was a time that these two people was jumping out.</span> <span id="s880">The gendarme and this Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s881">I am sure that the gentlemen was not thought about that this is the Jews, and they was uh uh wounded.</span> <span id="s882">That was quite...that was two gentile and one was died.</span> <span id="s883">That's not right.</span> <span id="s884">There was only one and nobody else died.</span> <span id="s885">My husband ...yeah....my leaved leaved the gendarme on the street because he would be and could be able get any any first aid or help because he was a gendarme, but he took these wounded Jewish boy, young person, returned to this first aid place to get a a help because he was a Jewish and he was he was hitting in the hip.</span> <span id="s886">And uh my husband was wounded here in a place and the piece from the from the...it was blood and and the auto was like a but the motor was still working and he told me the story when that he was able to to drive and he was holding

tapes and go do a short, another half hour and finish up.</span> <span id="s894">Would you like to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s896">Yes.</span> <span id="s897">Yeah.</span> <span id="s898">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s901">We're on.</span> <span id="s902">You and I were talking before about uh Perlasca.</span> <span id="s903">Could you tell me, explain for the interview what we were talking about and how you feel about Perlasca and the roles of your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s905">So I have heard the the name Perlasca when I..</span> <span id="s906">.</span> <span id="s907">I had heard the say we have a charge d'affaires.</span> <span id="s908">An Italian.</span> <span id="s909">It was...I I think the only humorous part from all the history because there was not a lot of part to smile or...but this was this was a little bit like a comedy, that an Italian can be can be a Spain.</span> <span id="s910">I had heard not much, not very much on this in this time about Perlasca.</span> <span id="s911">Only my husband, I went with Perlasca, with Perlasca.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">This was a like a safety belt for my husband.</span> <span id="s913">And naturally Perlasca went because he didn't know what he was not speaking Hungarian, so later, several days...this is the whole period this was quite short, short...I haven't heard so much about Perlasca, but when after during the war, my husband wanted from me to write down in his memory, then he he was always very over-joyed with this person in the right time that that was this Italian that he was able to use like a Spanish, like a a Spaniard, like a charge d'affaires.</span> <span id="s914">It was a short time, but every short time it was a question of life and and and dying.</span> <span id="s915">Later I haven't heard and I today I know that the only person who write down and give gratitude Perlasca, my husband, in my husband's memory, because all the other things, it is all created, these...it is not not interesting.</span> <span id="s916">It is a ridiculous, pompous words and and but here is the fact, that my husband and Farkash was very very thankful for for the to find for the fate to find a person who was playing this role, and other uh very important thing that after when somebody's left their embassy, the the power went to the .</span> <span id="s917">He was their legion adviser for the embassy, the only person to continue something only to to be responsible for the building and for everything.</span> <span id="s918">This was the Dr. Farkash that...</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: While your husband was doing what he was doing, Perlasca was doing what he was doing, and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Perlasca made Perlasca made the in about all the Farkash was told we are making these.</span> <span id="s921">We are making these.</span> <span id="s922">As long he was ready, but not till the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s924">Thank you.</span> <span id="s925">Now you had something you wanted to tell us about Otto Komo.</span> <span id="s926">A: In this uh this new beginning or...</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: In the new beginning, we are now where...at the end of December of '44, early January?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s929">This is this is the very tragic time.</span> <span id="s930">Otto Komo prepared himself.</span> <span id="s931">He get a a help from the earlier early December, November from Switzerland because as I told I am very sorry but if I am against the history, but Frederick Bond (ph) was a very heavy person.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">And uh they asked from from Switzerland a help with more more uh flexible to help and to to take this this uh and they arrived in Budapest uh .</span> <span id="s933">He was a person...he was he was occupied to be with Komo Otoo and to help to Komo Otto.</span> <span id="s934">He was a very helpful per...person, and they made a good friendship, Komo Otto and .</span> <span id="s935">Almost every every day they was together.</span> <span id="s936">But as the time went closer and closer to the end, my husband was worried more and more for for Komo Otto and he prepared a place in the Spanish Embassy for Komo Otto, a nice, comparing nice office building, uh telephone, everything because all the building was empty.</span> <span id="s937">The people who was uh refuge refugee there, Jews or Christian people was under shelter, because almost non-stop was the bomb, bombs.</span> <span id="s938">And my husband began to speak very serious with Komo Otto.</span> <span id="s939">Come in in the Spanish Consulate.</span> <span id="s940">You can continue the same work.</span> <span id="s941">You can continue your your connection.</span> <span id="s942">There is telephone and and come in because you are in danger in the Ritz Hotel.</span> <span id="s943">It is more and more uh shining that he is living such a..</span> <span id="s944">.</span> <span id="s945">he was not a pompous person.</span> <span id="s946">He wanted to make in the Ritz Hotel an office for the for the...to send the people in after the war in uh in Palestine.</span> <span id="s947">And when, and he was always no...I am I am in secure here.</span> <span id="s948">I have here and I am in the in the spotlight from the Wallenberg, , a general come and other neutral uh Portuguese...I don't know the name from the Portuguese.</span> <span id="s949">He has had a feeling that he is OK.</span> <span id="s950">It is absolute legal in this place.</span> <span id="s951">Then my husband began to speak the with the with the wife and to influence that bring in in the Spanish Consulate, so this was a very from my husband because he was looking at Komo Otto like a he take care of, he was.</span> <span id="s952">He was.</span> <span id="s953">He was able to go in the very beginning with the personal group and leave Budapest and he chose to remain there, like the Jews.</span> <span id="s954">Not a very few lived there, Jews lived there.</span> <span id="s955">Was able...not quite a few but I think no one was ready to make the choice that I I can leave Hungary and I remain because I have a a work to make this, so it was really in the like a romantic hero, and my husband was very very fond for Komo Otto.</span> <span id="s956">So it went this influence as long as he was ready.</span> <span id="s957">The 31st December that my husband will will go there and will bring Komo Otto and the wife in the Spanish Consulate with their belongings.</span> <span id="s958">This was the very day when my husband earlier went to to make this tour to put this physician to the place and then get these bumps and he remains there uh uh un...unconscious, my husband, there in this first aid place.</span> <span id="s959">Several hours he was lying there and then he came back and was the motor was still working and he was able to bring the car back to the Spanish consulate.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">His uh head was full with blood, with a big bandage, and he bring back the auto and and the very place the auto died.</span> <span id="s961">No more work.</span> <span id="s962">It was a miracle that it was able to bring back.</span> <span id="s963">I..</span> <span id="s964">and the next day my husband...yeah, my husband called from the from the embassy Komo Otto that this happened in the mean time.</span> <span id="s965">I was not able to bring you because this and this happened, but tomorrow morning I will find a car and I will go to bring, bring you in in the Spanish Consulate, and this was the OK.</span> <span id="s966">And this was the very evening, 31 uh 31 December evening when there in the hotel was standing Komo Otto together with the and the and the wife...came in two or three Nilos person and they was speaking very polite that we wanted only several question to to ask from you and would you be ready to come in, to come out from and he went out from and he disappeared.</span> <span id="s967">He was kidnapped and how he was tortured it is no question and no fantasy to think about this.</span> <span id="s968">The second day that my husband called that I am ready to bring in the...the woman told my husband he disappeared.</span> <span id="s969">And there was no way to...there was no way to ask questions.</span> <span id="s970">Naturally my husband asked Wallenberg to ask, to look somewhere, someplace, some police station, some Nilos uh uh headquarters.</span> <span id="s971">No more.</span> <span id="s972">And this remains in in my husband's life like a a something he was never out from this that he was able to help.</span> <span id="s973">He had seen that this that this person in in such a danger, and it happened that he was not able to help.</span> <span id="s974">That what he made when he went to Israel.</span> <span id="s975">First of all, there was not any credit in his behalf on Komo's name.</span> <span id="s976">Nobody was interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Nobody knows about who was Komo, what, what happened.</span> <span id="s978">Most of Hungarian people was not interested because a lot of Hungarian people there in Israel is from country or from from Transylvania.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s980">I need to...we need to stay with what happened during the war.</span> <span id="s981">You need to tell us briefly what your husband did in Israel, and then we need to go back and finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s983">These these uh this was the most tragic day in our life, when my husband came back home even in our home and he told me Komo Otto disappeared, and then was the feeling that every person, every minute, everywhere can disappear.</span> <span id="s984">It was not a question before.</span> <span id="s985">No more, no more leader.</span> <span id="s986">No more to ask somebody to help.</span> <span id="s987">The only person he managed to help it was Wallenberg, and no more other, because there was uh diplomatic persons who was not coming out like it is not a to mention Shalutz (ph).</span> <span id="s988">He was help everything but personally he was not going to to to making...to be uh in touch with the Nilos people.</span> <span id="s989">He was not ready for this.</span> <span id="s990">.</span> <span id="s991">Even not .</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: You said Wallenberg helped.</span> <span id="s993">Uh tell us about Wallenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: In those time I was not very in...informed what he is making, only I knowed and I have heard that Wallenberg was ready to go after the people, not only to give a paper and goodbye, you are you are going away with this and help these people, paper .</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Then he was personally ready to to be touched with with the with the brutal uh uh low lower ranking people till the ministers and everybody, and to speak with with the whole uh possibility to the welfare for the for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s996">He was the only person, he was make he made this personally.</span> <span id="s997">Not by letter.</span> <span id="s998">Not by uh sign a a piece of paper personally.</span> <span id="s999">This I have heard.</span> <span id="s1000">And this was the uh example uh this was like a a..</span> <span id="s1001">.</span> <span id="s1002">Miriam, help me.... (say it in Hungarian)....uh .</span> <span id="s1003">(Example).</span> <span id="s1004">Exactly.</span> <span id="s1005">This was the example how what other persons can can make like (cough) when there in ...this is a other uh other section when when the death march went to ...he sent his people on the way to help and they helped people.</span> <span id="s1006">He went...I don't know personally or even his people to at least that these people is saved by the Swede uh Embassy uh Con...uh Embassy and these people I I have right to to bring back.</span> <span id="s1007">Immediately their the brain-trust in the Swiss Consulate began to make the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Then it was and this was the example and to send the the the note and peoples and peoples to bring back people and in in the way to help or to bring some uh some people what is possible from the death march.</span> <span id="s1009">The was active immediately after is the Spanish Consulate.</span> <span id="s1010">Then we can make a list for our person and my husband gave to to Wallenberg when your pers...personal personally was somebody from from your help go, bring this with.</span> <span id="s1011">This is another list, and these were these went in this way the work.</span> <span id="s1012">It was a little period when my husband was ready to go personally to , very risky for a Jewish person, but it was everything was risky, even to live in Budapest was risky.</span> <span id="s1013">But uh when came out that Wallenberg told my husband you remain here and when the people came back, you can you can arrange from the wagon to to bring back some place.</span> <span id="s1014">Uh Wallenberg sent his person personnel to bring back the Swedish people but there was International Red Red Cross, then Swiss and Spanish.</span> <span id="s1015">This was...this remains for my husband, and my husband took the people when somebody was able to go on the foot it was there was a very very terrible uh uh situation.</span> <span id="s1016">These people after the death march and to back with uh with uh train naturally like a like a cattle...</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Let's let's...I need...let's pause a little.</span> <span id="s1018">Let's tell...bring it back to the end of the .</span> <span id="s1019">We need to know what happened to you and your husband as the war drew to a close.</span> <span id="s1020">I need to know how the war ended for the two of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1022">The war ended in in
