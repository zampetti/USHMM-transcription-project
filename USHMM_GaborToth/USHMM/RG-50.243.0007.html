After group in 1985 1:8:32 In the early 70's my interest shifted, being a PhD candidate, from mental illness to mental health.</span> <span id="s14">Part of what I said to myself was that before we talk about mental health, we have to learn what it means to be alive and we have to want to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">1:9:11 I asked what makes people want to stay around to begin with and what occurred to me at the time was that it was hope.</span> <span id="s16">I brought that idea for a doctorate to my advisor and he got quite excited about it too.</span> <span id="s17">I set out to study what I sought to understand as the</span></p> <p><span id="s18">psychology of hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">1:9:58 At the time I was teaching at Brooklyn College and all of my students got nuts with me.</span> <span id="s20">We tried to encompass everything, that is, any challenge to hope- starting from missing the subway or failing a course to losing your job, getting divorced or becoming</span></p> <p><span id="s21">physically handicapped.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">1:11:00 I sought the extremes and the extremes at the time, being the late 60's and early 70's, were unusually troubled.</span> <span id="s23">I also got into serious work with the terminally ill and their families.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">At the time, everybody, every poor student of mine got into the act and it made them quite happy, even though we were researching very sad things, hopeless things.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">1:11:53 We were asking the whole range of questions from total hopelessness, or what seemed to be, to total hopefulness, what does it mean.</span> <span id="s26">Well, that led me to a range of interesting and exciting findings and yet one of them kept working at me- every survivor I spoke to felt quite isolated and strange and had negative reactions to other people.</span> <span id="s27">What kept striking me over and over was that every survivor ended up saying that nobody had ever talked to me or nobody has ever believed me when I tried to talk about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">1:13:17 I kept hearing tales that nobody wanted to listen and nobody could possibly understand, even the mental health professionals who they had sought in therapy.</span> <span id="s29">Here I was, a growing mental health professional, hearing all of this about my fellow colleagues.</span> <span id="s30">It didn't look like they had lived up to their job, which was to listen and to understand and I was getting</span></p> <p><span id="s31">progressively indignant.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">1:14:05 I interviewed survivors at their homes.</span> <span id="s33">They told the same tales- nobody wanted to hear about this, if they mentioned it to their friends, they were thought of as freaks.</span> <span id="s34">People said the same things: "this is America now...put away the past...you're being</span></p> <p><span id="s35">morbid."</span></p> <p><span id="s36">1:14:46 At the time it seemed like the only real way to go was to get people together in groups, because if survivors feel that no one understands them and that no one will listen, the logical step would be to bring survivors together.</span> <span id="s37">They wouldn't feel mistrust and isolation in a group.</span> <span id="s38">I also figured that it would help mental health professionals because if they are not listening or if they could not understand, there would be survivors there who would.</span> <span id="s39">It seemed like a good idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">1:16:17 I had a personal struggle at the time deciding whether to work with cancer patients or survivors.</span> <span id="s41">However, being a very proud Jew, I decided to work with my people at the center for this type of study, in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s42">I asked for a list of every mental health professional who had ever called the center, with the logic that anyone who had ever called would naturally have some interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">1:16:58 I called each one and asked them if they would be interested in volunteering.</span> <span id="s44">The idea behind volunteering was that no one had ever been trained in this field, no school or program of study had prepared people to work with survivors of the Nazi Holocaust and their children.</span> <span id="s45">I figured that since the survivors were going to provide the training, it would be like bartering.</span> <span id="s46">It seemed fair and all things seemed right.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">1:17:50 We started in about '71 or '72.</span> <span id="s48">We got the groups and it was quite an incredible experience because the kind of togetherness that we experienced was unheard of at the time.</span> <span id="s49">It was really wonderful and people kept talking about having a family again.</span> <span id="s50">That is essentially what we were building, an extended family and a</span></p> <p><span id="s51">sense of family.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">1:19:45 Survivors say that now they can finally talk and understand each other.</span> <span id="s53">We started with survivors and the notion of course led to the name, Group Project.</span> <span id="s54">I know how sensitive survivors are to being called sick or insane, so there was no way we were going to attach ourselves to an institution.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">1:21:13 You all know what sensitivity is when we talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">There are many feelings here that lead to sensitivity.</span> <span id="s57">One is the history of euthanasia in Germany.</span> <span id="s58">It of course didn't start with the final solution of the Jewish problem.</span> <span id="s59">It began at the very beginning of Nazi Germany, even before the War began, with the gassing of imperfect Germans, the mentally retarded etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">1:21:50 Later on, after '42 when the final solution came about, if someone was sick, thus incapable of work, he was gassed or killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Being sick therefore was certain death.</span> <span id="s62">Many survivors feel that it is a posthumous victory for Hitler that if they feel that they aren't healthy and can't raise children who are physically healthy- they cannot survive.</span> <span id="s63">Every child thus became a symbol of happiness and hope and of the future.</span> <span id="s64">All of that got into the idea of bringing new life into the earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">1:24:26 We saw these survivors not as sick but as people who had adapted miraculously to situations never encountered; isolation, hunger, distress, betrayal.</span> <span id="s66">We figured that after the War, the term "getting back to normal" didn't apply.</span> <span id="s67">There was no longer anything normal-no home, no family, no community.</span> <span id="s68">Instead of trying to get people back to normal, we tried to find out what they meant by normal.</span> <span id="s69">We learned a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">2:00:20 I study different families.</span> <span id="s71">One type is a family of fighters.</span> <span id="s72">When I say fighters I don't mean fighting ensured survival.</span> <span id="s73">What I mean to say is these people chose to feel like fighters after the War probably to counteract the feeling of the victimized Jew.</span> <span id="s74">Families of fighters knew that they had to be strong and couldn't be weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">2:3:18 The children of these families also felt the need to be fighters.</span> <span id="s76">They told me stories of how they would go to marches and demonstrations and yell at the cops.</span> <span id="s77">In their relationships they couldn't be soft and tender.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">2:3:18 The most tragic kind of family is the numb family who are survivors who usually lost both their parents and their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">In these families, the parents still behave as if they were in total shock, no feelings are allowed at all-no bad feelings and no excitement either.</span> <span id="s80">The children in these families are tragic, they are left to fantasy and imagination-they are left alone and neglected.</span> <span id="s81">They are afraid to succeed and have never been given guidance or been taught.</span> <span id="s82">Because their parents don't understand success, it is hard for their children to understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">2:6:40 Another kind of family is "those who've made it".</span> <span id="s84">These are usually the ones who've made it American style.</span> <span id="s85">Even though I talk about families whose marriages are mostly bickering or marriages of disparity, rarely do survivors divorce, they don't destroy families like that.</span> <span id="s86">Those who've made it are usually younger, they were too young after the War to immediately marry.</span> <span id="s87">Their motivation was to beat the Nazis, however they could-study, be famous, be rich, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">These are the people, who, when they came to America, took out the numbers.</span> <span id="s89">They were not going to let anybody know that they went through the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s90">If they married survivors, they tended to divorce and marry non-survivors, thus denying by saying, "I don't belong to these people".</span> <span id="s91">They assimilated into American society.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">2:8:50 Something gets lost here.</span> <span id="s93">Because what becomes important is what is displayed.</span> <span id="s94">What matters is to succeed, relationships get lost.</span> <span id="s95">Children of these families only get noticed when they succeed.</span> <span id="s96">These children usually find out about their heritage not in the home, but from a stranger and this creates pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">2:12:15 I want to make a drawing.</span> <span id="s98">The very middle is "I" with the next circle as family.</span> <span id="s99">Concentric circles continue with the next ones being community, religion, nation, international... Ideally, people have a life which is free flowing and they move from the past to the present to the future through these realms.</span> <span id="s100">When victimization occurs, there is a rupture in the circles.</span> <span id="s101">The more areas it hits and the earlier it hits, one's ability to succeed is reduced.</span> <span id="s102">It is harder then to move into the future remaining fixed in the present.</span> <span id="s103">When fixity occurs, therapy, getting people together, creating a family and a community is a necessity.</span> <span id="s104">As long as you are stuck, options are not there.</span> <span id="s105">Therefore, hope is not there.</span> <span id="s106">As much as you feel better,you cannot get better.</span> <span id="s107">To get better takes a lot of work, to escape the fixture and not be stuck.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">2:19:09 The meaning of getting better is to explore, to see beyond.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Getting better says that I can really become aware of who I am and what disrupted me.</span> <span id="s110">Then it is possible to again gain a sense of continuity and start the free flow.</span> <span id="s111">I was born and I grew, no matter what the Nazis did to me or how I had to act to adapt.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">2:26:25 When survivors are finally able to mourn and let go of their guilt, they are transformed.</span> <span id="s113">They can fall in love, succeed in relationships, stand up and say "I am alive and I like myself'.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">That takes a lot of time and very hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">2:28:14 I want to talk about survivors' guilt.</span> <span id="s116">Guilt is a very powerful obstacle to living.</span> <span id="s117">Originally survivors' guilt was a feeling of why was I spared?</span> <span id="s118">Carmeli(ph) tried to transform this and she believed that if all these survivors had survived, there must be a reason for it.</span> <span id="s119">She separated what she said was passive guilt-"I was spared the fate of others"-and active guilt which occurs legitimately when we compromise our sense of values or when we don't do something that we should do.</span> <span id="s120">This was a helpful</span></p> <p><span id="s121">distinction.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">2:31:59 Guilt is the most powerful defense against the sense of existential helplessness.</span> <span id="s123">Guilt creates a lie, it wasn't that I was helpless, I could've done something, I just didn't.</span> <span id="s124">This implies that you had the options and the power to exercise a choice and you</span></p> <p><span id="s125">choose not to.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">2:32:38 This is an invention to defend the hopelessness of the situation, actually there was nothing you could do.</span> <span id="s127">Every child of a survivor, out of great love, wants to undo the Holocaust, both for their parents and for themselves.</span> <span id="s128">They want to have a community of love and trust and to have opportunities that were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">There is so much love in survivors families, but a big part of it is a love that says "I wish I could".</span> <span id="s130">Children of survivors like to try to play God and take the bad away.</span> <span id="s131">This creates acute guilt and a feeling of helplessness, there is nothing they can do to save the Jews from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s132">This helplessness is very painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">2:36:28 One function of guilt is plain loyalty.</span> <span id="s134">The feeling of wishing people were there.</span> <span id="s135">A survivor believes that he is alone and therefore wishes old family members alive.</span> <span id="s136">This keeps the dead with them and is a kind of loyalty.</span> <span id="s137">Part of this loyalty says then, that to be loyal is to be sad and to suffer.</span> <span id="s138">It is a living commemoration of the dead, but since these people didn't have graves, their relatives often walk around as tombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">2:40:02 You may ask yourself would it have been better to have died, this is not to deny the pain.</span> <span id="s140">An ironic function of guilt is that the murderers do not feel it.</span> <span id="s141">The victims are feeling the guilt.</span> <span id="s142">But this guilt is a sign of morality in a world that is seemingly immoral.</span> <span id="s143">This is warped but it is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">2:42:45 Survivors age prematurely and die prematurely, usually from cancer.</span> <span id="s145">There is a chronic sadness with survivors, but also a sense of hope and a joy and an appreciation for life.</span> <span id="s146">The Nazis deprived the Jews of the natural process of growing, aging and dying.</span> <span id="s147">Normal aging does not exist for a survivor.</span> <span id="s148">He encounters the same situations, but feels them deeper.</span> <span id="s149">Retirement is very difficult because of the notion that salvation and life only come through life.</span> <span id="s150">When people retire, they have more time to think and they review their life.</span> <span id="s151">In the case of survivors, as they age and review, they are attacked by memories.</span> <span id="s152">Their bodies are not as strong and they get sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">2:47:03 Being sick is a problem for survivors.</span> <span id="s154">Their families feel unable to put them into old age homes.</span> <span id="s155">Know that there is a special need for these aging survivors.</span> <span id="s156">Bring them in, take care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">You will get a sense of doing something really good for people who need it.</span> <span id="s158">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">.</span> <span id="s160">END.</span></p></body></html>
