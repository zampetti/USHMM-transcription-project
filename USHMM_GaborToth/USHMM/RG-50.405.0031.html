included.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">I am thirty-seven years old.</span> <span id="s12">In Russia I intended both elementary and high school, and then came college.</span> <span id="s13">Five years of college, that is the usual term.</span> <span id="s14">I have a Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering.</span> <span id="s15">In Russia I was an Electrical Engineer, here Electrical Designer.</span> <span id="s16">Not as high a level here.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">I make design projects for nuclear project stations.</span> <span id="s18">Some kind of paperwork and wiring design and design of electrical devices; how to use them.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">My father's name is David and my mother is Sofia.</span> <span id="s20">Before she was married, my mother's last name was Jashinsky.</span> <span id="s21">My father was born on August 23, 1927.</span> <span id="s22">My mother's birthday is October 29, 1931.</span> <span id="s23">I was their only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">I did not belong to any religious kind of group in Russia.</span> <span id="s25">Here, I do not belong to a synagogue but we attend some Jewish holiday services.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">I was born in a little Ukrainian city, Romny, and I lived there for one year and then our family moved to Lvov, a big town.</span> <span id="s27">I lived for a long time in Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">In Romny, we lived together in one apartment with my grandfather and grandmother and my mother's sister.</span> <span id="s29">We were all in two rooms.</span> <span id="s30">I remember the apartment because they are still living in it.</span> <span id="s31">We used to visit my grandparents every year after we moved to Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Maybe I can remember a little of my life before school years.</span> <span id="s33">I remember a little about the winter in Romny.</span> <span id="s34">Around the apartment it was very cold and in the room there was a special heater which burned coal.</span> <span id="s35">It was warm in the room.</span> <span id="s36">They cooked on this heater.</span> <span id="s37">Romny is a little town and people in little towns don't move very often, so I remember all my neighbors from when I was a child, and they are the same ones when I grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">I spent a lot of time in Romny when I was small.</span> <span id="s39">It was difficult for my parents to be with me when I was little, because my father worked and my mother worked, and they didn't like that I changed Kindergarten.</span> <span id="s40">So a lot of time I spent in Romny with my grandmother and grandfather.</span> <span id="s41">I knew them both very well but they have died now, a few years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">It is difficult to talk about the neighborhood where we lived in Lvov.</span> <span id="s43">We lived in big houses.</span> <span id="s44">Most of the apartments in Lvov are not such as in America.</span> <span id="s45">In every apartment building is many floors.</span> <span id="s46">It was a four floor apartment house.</span> <span id="s47">I had friends and very often we played together.</span> <span id="s48">I think there were good friends but, by the way, when I said my name in Russian it was "Slava."</span> <span id="s49">This was maybe a Polish name, maybe Ukrainian but not Jewish.</span> <span id="s50">I was not the only Slava on our street and when they wanted to call me or one of the others, I was "Slava-zhid."</span> <span id="s51">I played mostly with non-Jews.</span> <span id="s52">I had only one Jewish friend and he was a little older.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">So all my friends were very Ukrainian, Polish and a little Russian.</span> <span id="s54">All the Jewish families were scattered around every where.</span> <span id="s55">They were not living close together.</span> <span id="s56">This made very mixed feelings for me.</span> <span id="s57">Mostly I felt comfortable with my friends but I remember, and my mother remembers, when I once said, "Mother, I don't want to be a Jew."</span> <span id="s58">I said it once.</span> <span id="s59">Sometimes I had problems.</span> <span id="s60">They threw stones at me.</span> <span id="s61">Mostly we shared a common place as children but sometimes I remember one case when I was alone and all my companions threw stones at me.</span> <span id="s62">I did not understand why nobody helped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">My grandparents lived -.</span> <span id="s64">I don't know about my grand-father, maybe he lived all his life in Romny.</span> <span id="s65">But it seems to me my grandmother lived in a little village not too far from Romny.</span> <span id="s66">At that time, people married others from the same area.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">My grandmother did not work, not for her whole life.</span> <span id="s68">My grandfather was a beautician.</span> <span id="s69">He worked with women and men.</span> <span id="s70">He was very famous.</span> <span id="s71">I remember, at the time of the war, my grandfather was a soldier in 1942 and he lost his leg.</span> <span id="s72">He was demobilized from the army he continued to be a beautician in Romny and I remember that many women liked to go to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">My grandparents did not try to teach me any Jewish traditions.</span> <span id="s74">I remember my cousins, they are older than I, and they knew something more about this.</span> <span id="s75">They could understand when someone spoke in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s76">I can say that my grandparents talked in Yiddish when they didn't want me to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">I knew that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s78">I couldn't not know it.</span> <span id="s79">When I told my mother I didn't want to be a Jew she explained to me that you can't be ashamed that you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s80">Just as some people are something else.</span> <span id="s81">You should be careful when you are in company with other people, because you can have some problems if they know that you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s82">So my parents and grandparents tried to keep me away from Judaism so that I would have less problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">I don't know what their parents were like, not where they lived or what they did for a living.</span> <span id="s84">There was a separate Jewish cemetery in Romny and every year we would go.</span> <span id="s85">There are no graves there for my great-grandparents.</span> <span id="s86">Maybe they are in another place.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">When I started elementary school it was in Lvov.</span> <span id="s88">I didn't feel anything there about being a Jew or being different from others.</span> <span id="s89">Maybe Anti-Semitism is more popular among the Ukrainian people.</span> <span id="s90">But in the community where I lived it was a Russian community because it was a community for military brass and soldiers.</span> <span id="s91">The school was a Russian school, and I was all right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">But in high school -- When we lived in Lvov my mother was home before I left for school.</span> <span id="s93">She worked some years but not all the time.</span> <span id="s94">When I studied in elementary school, my mother did not work until I was in third grade.</span> <span id="s95">Then I went to school and back by myself because then I knew my way and the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">My father was a worker.</span> <span id="s97">I don't know how to explain his occupation.</span> <span id="s98">He was a steel worker.</span> <span id="s99">He worked on a machine that did something - a machinist.</span> <span id="s100">My mother sewed things at first, a tailor, then she changed her profession and she was a quality control person in a factory for television sets.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">The situation of education in Russia is different than here.</span> <span id="s102">Our children have some homework.</span> <span id="s103">So I played with my friends and did my homework.</span> <span id="s104">I did some things for our home.</span> <span id="s105">I remember it was at the time of Khrushchev and it was a time of food shortage.</span> <span id="s106">It was unusual before this.</span> <span id="s107">But sixteen years ago it was very bad in the country.</span> <span id="s108">There was no bread and I would come home from school and then I would stay in line for a long time to get bread and butter.</span> <span id="s109">And then my parents would take my place in line.</span> <span id="s110">I would stay in line for two hours or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Then I remember Khrushchev was discharged and the U.S.S.R. bought bread in Canada.</span> <span id="s112">They changed gold for bread and things were better so I lost my job of standing in line!</span></p> <p><span id="s113">I remember my grandmother sent us, at the time of Purim, it was my grandfather's birthday and my grandmother sent us this special Jewish food.</span> <span id="s114">Hamantaschen.</span> <span id="s115">They didn't celebrate Jewish holidays but every year she made this special food.</span> <span id="s116">That I remember.</span> <span id="s117">Maybe when she was a child she did celebrate the holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">We would have political holidays and we would have a day off.</span> <span id="s119">We would meet with relatives and talk together.</span> <span id="s120">Not really a celebration.</span> <span id="s121">Russian families often discussed politics.</span> <span id="s122">My parents criticized the government regime, just about every one, but when I was younger I was against this criticism.</span> <span id="s123">I said this was not a good idea because if they make mistakes, it is the fault of the times.</span> <span id="s124">I believed in the system, but they did not.</span> <span id="s125">This is the way Russian education works.</span> <span id="s126">Communist ideas are the best ideas in the world.</span> <span id="s127">Capitalism is the worst thing for people.</span> <span id="s128">The whole party line.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">No one in my family belonged to the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s130">They wanted my father to become a Communist because he was a worker.</span> <span id="s131">It is an interesting system in Russia, if you are a Communist you get some privileges.</span> <span id="s132">You get to be a supervisor and you can get a better salary and promotions and apartments.</span> <span id="s133">But not everybody can be a Communist, only a quarter, I don't know how to put it.</span> <span id="s134">Only a certain percentage of engineers, or other positions could be a party member.</span> <span id="s135">It is very difficult for a Jew to be a party member because they feel Jews were not reliable party members.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">I didn't understand many things that happened to me back then.</span> <span id="s137">I didn't understand this seriously until I entered my college.</span> <span id="s138">High school was mostly all right, I had some incidents.</span> <span id="s139">I had some problemss with my math teacher.</span> <span id="s140">She always gave me the worst grades even though my papers were correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">She knew I was Jewish because everybody fills out an application when you attend school or even Kindergarten and every class has a big notebook with all the data about all the pupils.</span> <span id="s142">Being Jewish is put in under nationality.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">In college, we have exams before we can become a student in the university.</span> <span id="s144">There is a competition to be accepted.</span> <span id="s145">And they have a quota for Jewish students.</span> <span id="s146">This is illegal because the law says that all nationalities should be represented, everybody should have equal rights.</span> <span id="s147">In my town, Lvov, it may have been worse than in other Ukrainian towns.</span> <span id="s148">There was more Anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s149">I know that it was something special when a Jew entered into medical college in Lvov or to the university.</span> <span id="s150">Mostly they were Ukrainian colleges.</span> <span id="s151">Before World War II, the population of Lvov was approximately one-third Jewish.</span> <span id="s152">After the war there were lot of Jews, but when the Jews started to emigrate, a lot of the Jews from Lvov emigrated.</span> <span id="s153">When I was a child, I remember there was a place in Lvov where you could meet with Jews.</span> <span id="s154">Now the only place you can meet Jews in Lvov is the Jewish cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">When I left my high school I was interested in History but I understood that I did not have a chance to be a historian because it is a political subject and it is difficult to enter this program.</span> <span id="s156">Then I understood many things at this time and I became in opposition to official history and the official way of explaining many subjects.</span> <span id="s157">I understood that I could not be a historian because I would have to be untruthful.</span> <span id="s158">Most of them knew that it was not accurate, it was more like propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Maybe in tenth grade I understood many of these things because I began to listen to the Voice of America, I began to discuss some things with my friends and with older people.</span> <span id="s160">Maybe it seems strange to you but our teacher of social subjects was a very interesting woman.</span> <span id="s161">She was young woman and a progressive woman, very smart.</span> <span id="s162">She gave us some unofficial information and we began to think.</span> <span id="s163">She told us about Soltshynitsen.</span> <span id="s164">I didn't know about him until her lessons.</span> <span id="s165">She explained to us maybe not all the truth but something to think over.</span> <span id="s166">She was Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">I was not a fanatic.</span> <span id="s168">I believed in my ideas and I had some arguments.</span> <span id="s169">When she proposed me another argument and I compared the arguments, it was not a surprise for me.</span> <span id="s170">It was not that one day I was a communist and the next day I was anti-communist.</span> <span id="s171">It was step by step, one stage to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">I think some of my friends also grew in this way.</span> <span id="s173">We began then to discuss politics among ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">(Were you ever drafted, Stan, like Afghanistan?</span> <span id="s175">Or how do they draft into the Army?)</span> <span id="s176">I was drafted at the time of the Institute.</span> <span id="s177">I had a military course.</span> <span id="s178">In college, yes.</span> <span id="s179">I had military officer's position.</span> <span id="s180">In this case, I wasn't drafted but every two years I should go to military camp and have some training.</span> <span id="s181">Just like your reserve years.</span> <span id="s182">This training was to last until I was thirty-six and forty, nobody is sure yet.</span> <span id="s183">(He participated in this camp training maybe three or four times during our marriage.</span> <span id="s184">- Elen) (If you were still in Russia, you would still be going?)</span> <span id="s185">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">I worked at this time and my wife was a student, this was two years after I completed the five years of engineering college.</span> <span id="s187">I worked for four years in Lvov after college and I had frequent business trips, mostly to other Ukrainian towns, power stations, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">We met at a party.</span> <span id="s189">I had a cousin in Kiev, I visited her for a weekend.</span> <span id="s190">It was about a year after we met that we decided to get married.</span> <span id="s191">We could only meet when I had a trip to her town.</span> <span id="s192">It was important to me that I marry a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s193">I understood that I would not be happy with a Russian girl.</span> <span id="s194">Because most of the Russian girls, they may not be anti-Semitic, but Jewish families have some different attitudes.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">My father said to me that it is better to have a Jewish girl because they have some experience.</span> <span id="s196">They gave me some examples about Russian and Jewish young women and young men had problems.</span> <span id="s197">He said to me that Jewish people keep together.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">We were married in Kiev.</span> <span id="s199">Almost the whole family came.</span> <span id="s200">There was nothing Jewish about the wedding.</span> <span id="s201">We were married in the Palace of Marriages.</span> <span id="s202">We had strudel at the wedding party.</span> <span id="s203">This is only a Jewish food in Russia.</span> <span id="s204">We also had Gefilte fish.</span> <span id="s205">The first day we had a party in a restaurant, the second day we had a party at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">After we were married, I moved to Kiev.</span> <span id="s207">This was four years after I finished the institute.</span> <span id="s208">At first I had the same job because I was stationed (with my work) close to Kiev, for about one year, and then this project budget was finished.</span> <span id="s209">Another reason to change my job was that in Russia they have records about where everybody lives.</span> <span id="s210">My records said I lived in Lvov, so I could not live in Kiev legally.</span> <span id="s211">Not more than one or two months and we needed an apartment.</span> <span id="s212">So I changed the record in my passport because we were married and I changed my residence to Kiev.</span> <span id="s213">It was not easy, but eventually I got a job in Kiev.</span> <span id="s214">I started to look for a job before I left the job in Lvov but until I finally found one, it was a very hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">We lived with Eleonora's parents for a little time.</span> <span id="s216">But her grandmother had a one room apartment.</span> <span id="s217">We did what they call a family change.</span> <span id="s218">We moved into her grandmother's apartment and she moved in with Eleonora's parents.</span> <span id="s219">It was very lucky.</span> <span id="s220">All of our friends were envious!</span> <span id="s221">It is not very easy to do this.</span> <span id="s222">For example her grandmother said that she needed to move because she was very old and needed to move in with her daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Eleonora was still in college at this time.</span> <span id="s224">I had made good money at my previous job and on the long business assignments the pay was better.</span> <span id="s225">The first job I got in Kiev was with a little company that made adjustments of equipment in different plants and it was some engineering position.</span> <span id="s226">It was a little bit different; more as a worker and not engineering.</span> <span id="s227">So then I had to do my engineering with my hands.</span> <span id="s228">In Russia, engineer is not too prestigious a position.</span> <span id="s229">Politicians there cannot understand the importance of having highly educated people.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">We were married in 1979 and we came to America in 1989.</span> <span id="s231">We tried to leave Russia in 1979.</span> <span id="s232">Before we got married we had a long talk and we both agreed that we should both emigrate.</span> <span id="s233">Eleonora's family had an invitation to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s234">But we needed an additional invitation for me to go.</span> <span id="s235">She would not leave without me.</span> <span id="s236">We asked all our friends and relatives to try to get another invitation for me.</span> <span id="s237">If we had gotten one, we might have left for Israel in 1979.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">We did receive one, but too late.</span> <span id="s239">They had interrupted emigration permits.</span> <span id="s240">It was closed in October.</span> <span id="s241">Brezhnev was in charge and they stopped it.</span> <span id="s242">This was before Afghanistan, but there was some political reason for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">It was a very hard time to find a job then, particularly for all Jews, because everyone was afraid the Jews would leave and they would question the employers.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">We were married for three years before Julia was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Every boss has to be a communist and, you see, in Russia, we have three bosses.</span> <span id="s246">Questions are decided not only by the boss on the job, but a second side is the professional union, and third side is the party committee.</span> <span id="s247">And everybody should be a communist and if anyone should leave the country from this place of employment then it means trouble for them because they could lose their job or their position.</span> <span id="s248">Ten years ago this was a reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">There was more than one reason that we wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s250">We were opposed to the regime, we had no kind of freedom.</span> <span id="s251">We felt that the society was "sick".</span> <span id="s252">I felt some experience in anti-semitism when I was trying to find a job.</span> <span id="s253">There are many examples.</span> <span id="s254">You read in newspaper an advertisement that they need some kind of position and you call them and they ask you to come to an interview.</span> <span id="s255">You go for the interview and they ask you to show the passport.</span> <span id="s256">You show them the passport and they say, "Good-bye."</span> <span id="s257">Right now.</span> <span id="s258">Some of them were so polite they would say they just hired someone yesterday.</span> <span id="s259">But others just say they don't need you.</span> <span id="s260">But the head of Personnel Department is a kind of KGB department altogether.</span> <span id="s261">He said to me that there was no position in his company but he knew another head of a Personnel Department at another company and I will call them and you can go direct to them.</span> <span id="s262">He gave me the address and I go to this address and I show them my documents and they would say, "Sorry, we don't need you."</span> <span id="s263">When I was studying at college I met with professors that I had some problems with.</span> <span id="s264">Because I saw my colleagues had an exam and what was their knowledge and what my knowledge and then I saw our grades and they did not compare.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">After 1979, we thought we would forget about emigration.</span> <span id="s266">It was our luck, maybe, that we had just started to apply, we didn't sell any furniture or anything else.</span> <span id="s267">When we heard later that the emigration was open again, we applied with our old invitation.</span> <span id="s268">Everybody applied to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s269">Then they could change their mind when you are out of Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">When we applied this time, it took about nine months.</span> <span id="s271">Now it was very different situation in Russia.</span> <span id="s272">It is much better than ten years ago.</span> <span id="s273">First, nobody can fire you for wanting to emigrate.</span> <span id="s274">My supervisor, when he knew that I had applied to emigrate said to me, "Good luck."</span> <span id="s275">There were really no changes when we leave our country.</span> <span id="s276">We could say things more openly.</span> <span id="s277">But first we think that there will be some kind of change but then we saw that while it will be one communist party in this country there will be no great changes.</span> <span id="s278">Because what they want is only to improve their power, to improve the communist system.</span> <span id="s279">They understand they should let people have more freedom to talk, but not to do.</span> <span id="s280">They try to control the situation so that there will be no changes.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">It was worse for Jews because there is more freedom for people, they didn't have it before and they didn't understand what it means.</span> <span id="s282">They think that freedom means that you can do everything, you aren't responsible for anything.</span> <span id="s283">You feel anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s284">you can say it freely!</span> <span id="s285">If they said this before only in their families now they say it on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">The anti-Semitism among the Ukraine is sort of Jewish knowledge.</span> <span id="s287">It really isn't documented.</span> <span id="s288">But everyone feels that it is better to enter the institute in Kazan, in Russia, than in the Ukraine, in Kiev, for example.</span> <span id="s289">A lot of Jews in the Ukraine have a high education but did not get it in the Ukraine, in their native town.</span> <span id="s290">Everyone knows which are the best institutes or colleges to enter.</span></p></body></html>
