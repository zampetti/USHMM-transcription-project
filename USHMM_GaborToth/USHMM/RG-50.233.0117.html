we stayed there for a week.</span> <span id="s531">That was the hell of everything, this brick factory, because we were in the open air, nothing was there, no facilities, nothing.</span> <span id="s532">One or two wells for water, that was drinking water and everything.</span> <span id="s533">You couldn’t wash yourself, you had to sleep on the earth.</span> <span id="s534">If you had some blanket, then you were lucky.</span> <span id="s535">As I remember, we had some blankets but it was summer and it was no rain, but that was the hell of everything.</span> <span id="s536">Then they

last transport, it was not so crowded, these wagons, as usual, because there were not so many people -- already dead.</span> <span id="s552">We were only 70 or 80, not more but that was much too.</span> <span id="s553">I remember that my father told me during the first night, we were sitting so, that I never thought that your first journey abroad will be like this.</span> <span

World, it was Slovakia and it is Slovakia even today.</span> <span id="s580">A Hungarian gendarme came to the wagon and told we should give everything we have then, I think it was a private business that we should give everything which we have from Ladaad or if we have anything, water, somebody had nothing.</span> <span id="s581">Anyhow, the German will take everything from us and we should give

reddish.</span> <span id="s641">My mother was very proud of it and when they cut my hair, she just thought, oh your beautiful hair!</span> <span id="s642">I remember.</span> <span id="s643">Then we entered this thing and then we met the girls from Czechoslovakia who were there already three years.</span> <span id="s644">Only a few of them remained alive after three years and they were the kapos, not kapo, lageraltester.</span> <span id="s645">They were who ruled the barrack.</span> <span id="s646">Lageraltester that was the end of the whole lager.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: They were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: They were Jewish.</span> <span id="s649">Every barrack had a head.</span> <span id="s650">Lageraltester, that was the German name.</span> <span id="s651">They were these Czechoslovakian girls.</span> <span id="s652">They were telling us just at the beginning, do you see the smoke there?</span> <span id="s653">That is your relatives, your parents.</span> <span id="s654">I didn’t want to believe it.</span> <span id="s655">I was a humanist like my father.</span> <span id="s656">I remembered that we had a dead person in our wagon already when we arrived to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s657">I told my mother, they are so, I’m sure many people were dead during this long journey.</span> <span id="s658">Therefore the crematorium is running because they have to get rid of the dead people.</span> <span id="s659">I didn’t believe that they were killing the people.</span> <span id="s660">But later on, very soon, I knew they were right.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Your father and brother had gone into a different part of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Yes, because men were separated and women were separated.</span> <span id="s663">So I was together with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Did you see your brother and father again?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I have seen my father once with some others.</span> <span id="s666">What we did with this lager where we go.</span> <span id="s667">That was, in Birkenau, Auschwitz is the main lager and we can now six kilometers away.</span> <span id="s668">When the Hungarian people came, these last transports of this brick factory, it was called the sigarnalaager, gypsy lager.</span> <span id="s669">The number of the lager was called 32C.</span> <span id="s670">Later, I learned that the gypsy people were living there with family.</span> <span id="s671">It was a family lager.</span> <span id="s672">They killed them before the Hungarian Jews were brought there because they needed the place.</span> <span id="s673">Very few gypsies who were in Auschwitz survived Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s674">Most of them were killed at that time.</span> <span id="s675">We came there and the second day or the third day, we were newcomers.</span> <span id="s676">We were very stupid.</span> <span id="s677">We didn’t know the regulations.</span> <span id="s678">For instance, we got some bread.</span> <span id="s679">Then people were coming and telling if you give me a piece of bread, I give you this pot and you can eat from this pot.</span> <span id="s680">One of my friends bought a pot to have a pot from barrack.</span> <span id="s681">Later on came, not the Germans, Port, ‘toot’ and then came another one and took it away because it was not allowed to have the pot.</span> <span id="s682">The pots were distributed before getting the food and then it was collected again.</span> <span id="s683">You couldn’t own a pot and the people who sold the pot for bread knew it but she was hungry.</span> <span id="s684">Morika, that was Morika.</span> <span id="s685">We were stupid and I don’t know, somehow, they arranged a transport from Yangers and we were standing there and one person was missing.</span> <span id="s686">I think one person was running away from this transport and they needed somebody.</span> <span id="s687">We were standing there with mother and they just took me and pushed me in this transport and we were separated.</span> <span id="s688">If I were not so stupid, some days later, I would run away again but I didn’t run away.</span> <span id="s689">That was the transport, I was separated from mother.</span> <span id="s690">Then they took us to the next lager, took we to be which had only the wire, which was separated with this electrical wire from the other one where mother remained.</span> <span id="s691">I was there.</span> <span id="s692">I sleep and I heard they wanted to send for work, these transports.</span> <span id="s693">But it turned out that somebody had scarlet.</span> <span id="s694">Scarlet fever from these transports.</span> <span id="s695">So they stopped all the transports and we had to remain there.</span> <span id="s696">So mother was here and I was there.</span> <span id="s697">I could speak to her.</span> <span id="s698">It was not so easy but I have spoken to her every day, but in the very early morning because there were these towers in Auschwitz and in every tower was a German, an SS.</span> <span id="s699">If he thought that at the wire, there are too many people, he shot.</span> <span id="s700">I have seen with my eyes two girls who were shot.</span> <span id="s701">One was speaking with her sister who was on the other side and one was speaking with her mother.</span> <span id="s702">I have seen two girls who were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: It was risky?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: It was risky.</span> <span id="s705">So I told mother, I will come only in the very early morning when he is still sleeping and not awake.</span> <span id="s706">We spoke every day.</span> <span id="s707">In this ____, to me it was better because this was people whom they wanted to go to work.</span> <span id="s708">The circumstances were better here than with mother and I had more to eat and I could give to mother something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: What was your mother doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Nothing, very few people were working.</span> <span id="s711">We didn’t work either in this

transport was the same -- that you had to go to the main scrag of the lager and then they selected you and from then you were taken away.</span> <span id="s953">I went with them to this place.</span> <span id="s954">Then I felt that I can’t go away; the mother is here.</span> <span id="s955">I can give her food, I can see her, I can’t leave my mother here and I just escaped and went back.</span> <span id="s956">I didn’t went to the transport.</span> <span id="s957">Then I was smart then, at that time I was smart enough, I knew that nothing will happen.</span> <span id="s958">When the number is filled, they will take the transport and finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: They won’t miss you?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: They won’t miss me.</span> <span id="s961">In the evening, I told my mother I couldn’t go away.</span> <span id="s962">I remain here.</span> <span id="s963">Somebody was with my mother and other mother who had three daughters in the group.</span> <span id="s964">She ask me do you know anything about my three girls?</span> <span id="s965">I told her yes, they went.</span> <span id="s966">She said, oh they left me here.</span> <span id="s967">To tell the truth, they were smart.</span> <span id="s968">Later it turned out, when I was at home, it was years and years after, I met a girl, I met a girl with whom I slept under one blanket.</span> <span id="s969">She told me that this transport was already good.</span> <span id="s970">They went to a small town somewhere in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s971">They worked in a factory.</span> <span id="s972">The work itself was not too hard.</span> <span id="s973">The people in these small towns were very helpful.</span> <span id="s974">They gave them food whenever they could.</span> <span id="s975">Only one person died.</span> <span id="s976">It was six hundred people and only one died, one of them with natural -- something happened to her.</span> <span id="s977">That was not a bad trip.</span> <span id="s978">All the others came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Do you know what they were making in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s981">I was not so interested in that kind of factory.</span> <span id="s982">It was maybe a textile or something.</span> <span id="s983">She worked in Tunsaran.</span> <span id="s984">She was from Budapest but she worked in Tunsaran and so she was as the sister of your friend.</span> <span id="s985">.</span> <span id="s986">So she was taken away.</span> <span id="s987">It was not allowed to commute, the Jewish people couldn’t commute.</span> <span id="s988">They were exempt, they saw they are exempt and they worked in Tunsaran and they used to leave that.</span> <span id="s989">Then the German took everybody who was working in Tunsaran.</span> <span id="s990">Tunsaran is a big factory which exists even now in Hungary.</span> <span id="s991">The bulbs, they are making bulbs and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Oh, light bulbs.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Yes and it was a very important thing and the first Jewish people who worked there were exempt.</span> <span id="s994">They can stay there and work.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: This was in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: It was Ujpest, the suburb.</span> <span id="s997">So that is that.</span> <span id="s998">It is one of the biggest factories in Hungary.</span> <span id="s999">So I couldn’t go away and some weeks later, mother was taken away.</span> <span id="s1000">I told myself, now it is no reason to stay here any more and I go away with the next transport.</span> <span id="s1001">The next transport where I went, which was chosen, went from one part of the lager to the other part.</span> <span id="s1002">That was the whole transport.</span> <span id="s1003">It was the oldest part and all the circumstances were much worse.</span> <span id="s1004">It was Ausenkommando, I told you, we had to work.</span> <span id="s1005">We had to dig potatoes in the pun ____.</span> <span id="s1006">We had to put potatoes in heaps and cover with earth.</span> <span id="s1007">It was raining, everything was wet; all the potatoes got rotten.</span> <span id="s1008">One day we were -- and it was a very heavy work because you had to carry it across; it was a hard work.</span> <span id="s1009">You had to carry the potatoes.</span> <span id="s1010">One day it was put there, the other day we had to remove them from there.</span> <span id="s1011">It was silly work only it was very, very difficult, very hard work.</span> <span id="s1012">In this potato, I got ill very soon.</span> <span id="s1013">I was not so strong any more.</span> <span id="s1014">I never was a strong person and I got ill.</span> <span id="s1015">In the meantime, the evacuation of the camp was continued and we were taken from this old part of this lager back to where I used to be, back to this relatively new part, this B2B where I have known all the physicians.</span> <span id="s1016">Them I felt ill and I was ill and I sent to these physicians whom I knew and they put me in this rever _____, you know what a rever ___ is, it was a small hospital where ill people could stay as long as they were not selected.</span> <span id="s1017">At that time, the selection was not as bad any more.</span> <span id="s1018">After they knew the crematorium didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1019">I hoped that maybe if I can regain force and if I go to the rev ___ that was in the rev ___ you didn’t have to stay this active (?)</span> <span id="s1020">because that was awful, to stay and stay and it was cold and it was dark in the evening.</span> <span id="s1021">What happened to me during this potato work --one day we had blocksperesh where we had to stay in the barrack.</span> <span id="s1022">We had to come back from the potato field to stay in the barrack.</span> <span id="s1023">I had one only ____ to sleep, underwear.</span> <span id="s1024">I hated it, you can imagine.</span> <span id="s1025">I hated it, it was so --.</span> <span id="s1026">I have worn it day and day and day after this one only thing.</span> <span id="s1027">We were there and I thought -- I washed it and it was wet.</span> <span id="s1028">We went to sleep and the wet underwear was somewhere there.</span> <span id="s1029">It was stolen.</span> <span id="s1030">So it was November and I had to stay the opel and I had no underwear.</span> <span id="s1031">Even today, I am very sensitive.</span> <span id="s1032">I got cold, you notice, the weather and even today I suffer with it.</span> <span id="s1033">Then, it was some days I was walking without this underwear and then we went somewhere there was a bath, where there was warm water and you could take a bath, there and somehow there, we manages to buy for me, I was with a friend together -- I always looked for a friend to have somebody, not to be alone -- and this was a very good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1034">We went there and we bought for a bread because we had, in this work, in this potato work, we got more bread than usual.</span> <span id="s1035">We had bread and we bought for me underwear, warm underwear for one bread.</span> <span id="s1036">We put together our -- and then I had it.</span> <span id="s1037">I remember it was such a cold, I got such a bad cold, because to stay out as long without underwear, that I had diarrhea and I had to urinate always, I was really ill.</span> <span id="s1038">It was while we were standing in the opel and I found that I must go up.</span> <span id="s1039">I told Markget, I’ll sit down and I’ll manage my work.</span> <span id="s1040">She began to cry, Eva don’t do it.</span> <span id="s1041">If the German will see you, what you are doing, she will kill you.</span> <span id="s1042">She will hit you, beat you until you are dead.</span> <span id="s1043">I told her, I can’t help, I must.</span> <span id="s1044">I had the chance, I was not seen.</span> <span id="s1045">It was dark already and so I could manage it.</span> <span id="s1046">I felt that I must do it because otherwise -- it was stupidity because standing is possible --but I hated it.</span> <span id="s1047">To get dirty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: It sounds horrible.</span> <span id="s1049">You stayed in Auschwitz --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Yes, then I -- I missed the schedule because that was during this potato work, all these things that we bought for me the underwear and that we had to stand.</span> <span id="s1051">What I thought then, decided to ever ___ this old part of the lager and we went back to this B2B which was one of the best parts of the lager.</span> <span id="s1052">Then the physicians who knew me took me to the revier, to the small hospital.</span> <span id="s1053">But I missed you a very important -- I missed a very important detail of the potato.</span> <span id="s1054">In this potato field, we worked together, Ukrainian girls who were from the countryside, who were big and strong and for whom this work was nothing special.</span> <span id="s1055">We used to live in the same block together with them.</span> <span id="s1056">They were very, very rude with us.</span> <span id="s1057">In the morning they took -- in Auschwitz you are not allowed to drink water, there is no drinking there, many people died because they drank this water and typhus, I don’t know what and died in diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1058">They took the -- in the morning they brought tea.</span> <span id="s1059">It was not tea but it was something but it was boiled water.</span> <span id="s1060">They took this hot water and they washed themselves in it.</span> <span id="s1061">We remained, we didn’t get anything to drink in the morning, so they were so rude.</span> <span id="s1062">We had to go to the kitchen and steal tea which is a stupidity to steal boiled water but we had to drink something.</span> <span id="s1063">If the German see us, that we are stealing the tea from the kitchen, it would be a bad story.</span> <span id="s1064">We had to do it because we knew we have to drink and we are not allowed to drink the water.</span> <span id="s1065">That was our drink for the whole day.</span> <span id="s1066">Then they carried a big -- these Ukrainian girls , they were strong -- and they carried many potatoes.</span> <span id="s1067">We can’t keep up with potatoes in this carriage.</span> <span id="s1068">She told the German officer, look, the Jew has so few potatoes and I am carrying so much.</span> <span id="s1069">We managed to escape somehow from the German that she couldn’t observe that we are carrying a few, only on the bottom of this thing.</span> <span id="s1070">But she told the German, look what they are doing.</span> <span id="s1071">Then we got hit.</span> <span id="s1072">We were beaten, They were really very, very -- [“So they were not Jewish”] No, no.</span> <span id="s1073">They were from the countryside.</span> <span id="s1074">I can’t help but these are my memories from the Ukrainian girls.</span> <span id="s1075">They were even worse than the Germans with us.</span> <span id="s1076">That was the end of my working career in Auschwitz, when I got to this revier.</span> <span id="s1077">I don’t know why, I could do eel and eel.</span> <span id="s1078">I couldn’t recall why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: It’s still 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: That was 1944, that was November, late November already.</span> <span id="s1081">In Auschwitz, there were two reviers for ill people, not two parts, two sections.</span> <span id="s1082">One was the E section for women, it was only one and F section for men.</span> <span id="s1083">In the small revier, in B2B, they couldn’t help me and if you are more serious ill, you had to be taken to this E section.</span> <span id="s1084">I was taken to this E section and later I met one girl of Ujpest, of my town, saw me when I was taken to the E section -- not alone, with several people.</span> <span id="s1085">She told me later in Ujpest, I was sure that you are taken to be killed.</span> <span id="s1086">I never thought that we will again meet each other here in our town because I was so upset and I was sure that you were taken away to be killed [“Who?”]</span> <span id="s1087">I tell you later.</span> <span id="s1088">I don’t know only the name but several times I have met her in Ujpest.</span> <span id="s1089">I was taken to this E sector and that was maybe December already.</span> <span id="s1090">In January, 18th of January, and I was bad, and I had malaria because I had temperature; the temperature rose suddenly disappeared.</span> <span id="s1091">I had four or five of these and I was again without a temperature.</span> <span id="s1092">I was there with many other people.</span> <span id="s1093">It is January.</span> <span id="s1094">It was told that everybody who can run, who can walk have to go and to leave the camp.</span> <span id="s1095">A transport will go and it was told that there are no trains, you have to walk.</span> <span id="s1096">All my clothing was ___ wrong, it was greenish, something green and the very same one and a pair of shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: That’s all you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: That’s all what I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: A dress and a pair of shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: When you get ill, they take all your dresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Oh, so you just had the gown, the nightshirt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Nightshirt and a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s1103">But then we managed some and everybody in the revier had clothing.</span> <span id="s1104">But somehow, we managed to get clothes.</span> <span id="s1105">Then it was not the strict order anymore.</span> <span id="s1106">My friends brought me some clothes.</span> <span id="s1107">It was a coat and a Jacket.</span> <span id="s1108">I got some clothes.</span> <span id="s1109">Then it was a full day, everybody got a loaf of bread and it was told that everybody who can walk must go.</span> <span id="s1110">Then we were some young girls and we decided not to go.</span> <span id="s1111">We thought we are not strong enough, we cannot walk.</span> <span id="s1112">They will kill us if we can’t walk.</span> <span id="s1113">The only chance to survive is to stay here and to see what will happen.</span> <span id="s1114">That’s the only chance.</span> <span id="s1115">If we go, we are sure that we will be killed.</span> <span id="s1116">We were maybe five girls.</span> <span id="s1117">We decided to stay and we will see at that time, we had the clothes ___ and we will see what will happen.</span> <span id="s1118">I remember it was a girl there from the first group whom I knew from the first group when I was first time in the B’s, 2B, and she was rather ill.</span> <span id="s1119">She wanted to go and she decided to go.</span> <span id="s1120">I told her but you are ill, you can’t walk.</span> <span id="s1121">But I want to be alive -- that was her answer.</span> <span id="s1122">It was so funny, I didn’t answer anything but it was that I want to be alive as well.</span> <span id="s1123">Therefore, I want to stay here and she went.</span> <span id="s1124">I don’t know what happened to her but it was so striking to me, I want to be alive.</span> <span id="s1125">That was her answer.</span> <span id="s1126">We stayed there and we were there more than one week alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Just the five of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: No, two thousand, seven hundred, I don’t know how many, ill people.</span> <span id="s1129">Everybody was ill and sick.</span> <span id="s1130">Of course, there were other people who had the same idea then.</span> <span id="s1131">It was a big battle, very close to Auschwitz, a big battle, where Res ___ is, very close.</span> <span id="s1132">At the river, was a big battle.</span> <span id="s1133">It lasted two days.</span> <span id="s1134">It was on the 27th, we have seen and we have heard the battle.</span> <span id="s1135">That was our chance.</span> <span id="s1136">We had no electricity in the camp and we had no water.</span> <span id="s1137">It was ____ ____ in the case of fire, this water, because there was running water in the camp.</span> <span id="s1138">It was not anymore running.</span> <span id="s1139">We had fuel, we had coal to heat, we could heat the barrack.</span> <span id="s1140">Many people died during these ten days.</span> <span id="s1141">Because all of them were ill people who stayed there; some of them were well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: You didn’t have very much to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: We had this bread and then somehow, people managed to get from the storage, some food.</span> <span id="s1144">I remember we got beans and we cooked it 24 hours in this fire.</span> <span id="s1145">It never got soft, but we ate it.</span> <span id="s1146">It was so old that it -- we just wanted to cook it in water.</span> <span id="s1147">We had something to eat.</span> <span id="s1148">______ was a big thing.</span> <span id="s1149">On the 27th when the cannon, in the morning everything it was silence, stopped, the cannon stopped and everything stopped.</span> <span id="s1150">At noon, the first Russian soldiers arrived to the camp.</span> <span id="s1151">They were wearing this white gown, it was winter.</span> <span id="s1152">At twelve o’clock, I went to bring some coal to heat this, because it was a long, long oven along the whole barrack which could be heated.</span> <span id="s1153">It was not warm but it was not ice cold in the barrack and we could heat it some of.</span> <span id="s1154">We went to bring fuel and then we have seen the first two soldiers who were coming.</span> <span id="s1155">That was the first camp where they found living people.</span> <span id="s1156">People who were alive.</span> <span id="s1157">They passed already, the Russian army, passed already Treblinka and Majdanek and nobody was there alive.</span> <span id="s1158">It turned our that Auschwitz was undermanned too but I had no time anymore to do anything.</span> <span id="s1159">They just run away, the Wehrmacht army never came to the camp who were fighting back.</span> <span id="s1160">The SS run away and the Wehrmacht didn’t come.</span> <span id="s1161">In the afternoon came a high ranking officer, a Russian officer, early afternoon.</span> <span id="s1162">He went in every barrack, it was only two parts of Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1163">He told us that this is a surprise for them; that they can find here people who are living.</span> <span id="s1164">They are not prepared for that.</span> <span id="s1165">They can’t give to eat anything else but tea and sweet.</span> <span id="s1166">That they bring as much as we want and he will promise that in five days we will have everything to eat.</span> <span id="s1167">That was our chance.</span> <span id="s1168">Because these ill people who were starved, that they couldn’t eat anything else but tea and sweet, that was the best solution for them.</span> <span id="s1169">American and English soldiers made a big fault when, for instance in Bergen-Belsen, the English people gave food, rich food for these people.</span> <span id="s1170">We know it because a cousin of his was there and many people died because of the rich food.</span> <span id="s1171">Here in Auschwitz everybody had to eat because they had nothing.</span> <span id="s1172">But in two days, we got food already, not in five, in two days they could give us food.</span> <span id="s1173">Then they took everybody from Birkenau to the main lager where the barracks were bleak.</span> <span id="s1174">It was an old soldier camp from the Polish army, the main camp in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1175">Everybody was taken there from these wooden barracks/ Everybody was -- it was a military hospital for at least ill people.</span> <span id="s1176">Sorry to say, there were many people who died later on because they were so ill, that they couldn’t be cured.</span> <span id="s1177">I must say that maybe they had not the best and the most up-to-date medication, but they were very, very careful.</span> <span id="s1178">I got the best treatment, the best care.</span> <span id="s1179">I thought and I am -- and then afterwards I went down.</span> <span id="s1180">You were elevated.</span> <span id="s1181">They didn’t have to keep me anymore and I was very, very ill.</span> <span id="s1182">When I went in my -- four people were very Ill afterwards and I was one of them.</span> <span id="s1183">I was 27 kilos that was the lowest weight because I couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1184">I got more to eat and better there than anybody else.</span> <span id="s1185">They couldn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s1186">I got every day an egg and milk, it didn’t help me.</span> <span id="s1187">What was the most important, I got a weight gain.</span> <span id="s1188">Somebody had to sit beside me, beside my bed all the night and to tell the physician if I don’t feel well.</span> <span id="s1189">Somebody helped me, to call the physician.</span> <span id="s1190">One night, I was really very ill.</span> <span id="s1191">I remember the physician was standing beside me.</span> <span id="s1192">I don’t remember when I lost consciousness but I remember that the physician stood beside me and was feeling,my pulse and asking me do you feel better now?</span> <span id="s1193">I told her yes, now I feel better.</span> <span id="s1194">Because in the evening, I told the person who had to sit beside me, he was a man.</span> <span id="s1195">That I feel very bad today.</span> <span id="s1196">I had a very bad day today.</span> <span id="s1197">I don’t know when I lost my consciousness but the doctor was there.</span> <span id="s1198">In the morning came, it was called in Russian, a Stiab.</span> <span id="s1199">It is a German name that it was a military staff and the head was a physician and he was a colonel and he knew everybody.</span> <span id="s1200">That was in the night and at 8 o’clock in the morning, he was at my bed and asked me what happened to you, in the daytime you were not so ill.</span> <span id="s1201">I have seen you at noon and everything was okay with you and what happened to you in the night that you were so ill?</span> <span id="s1202">He knew everybody and he visited and from that time, I remember, that several times at midnight, I awake that he is standing at my bed and feeling my pulse, my heart rate.</span> <span id="s1203">He knew everybody, he was an excellent person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: You didn’t have any contact with your father, your brother there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: They were taken away in September, from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1206">I was there.</span> <span id="s1207">I am the only person who remained in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1208">They were taken to Mierdoff.</span> <span id="s1209">It is in Southern Germany, Bavaria, Southern Bavaria.</span> <span id="s1210">I know because I got everything.</span> <span id="s1211">My father was dead in December, my brother survived him and my brother died in March, three weeks before they could liberate his camp.</span> <span id="s1212">Actually he fell asleep during the night.</span> <span id="s1213">That’s a typical test of the starvation.</span> <span id="s1214">He fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1215">I know that his heart was very -- because of the starvation and everything -- his heart was not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Your father and brother left Auschwitz in September.</span> <span id="s1217">Was this for labor or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: It was another camp.</span> <span id="s1219">I don’t know -- don’t ask logic.</span> <span id="s1220">There was no logic, one camp was like the other.</span> <span id="s1221">They don’t wanted you to work; they wanted you to die.</span> <span id="s1222">In these big camps, there was very few work.</span> <span id="s1223">It was, then it was like this _____.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Someone from Budapest told you later about what happened to your -- some survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1226">Actually, a cousin who came from Transylvania and who found my brother dead in this camp by chance.</span> <span id="s1227">He was in _____ camp and he could move.</span> <span id="s1228">That is a good feeling, he was not alone and this cousin could give some food for him.</span> <span id="s1229">He was very happy, the cousin told me that he is not alone and he had somebody.</span> <span id="s1230">So this was not so bad.</span> <span id="s1231">The physicians who were there, they have no wonder that he will die, he is so ill that he will die.</span></p>

told you my father was a humanist.</span> <span id="s1236">He died because of illness, that’s my theory, but because that was such a great disappointment for him in mankind, that such a thing could
