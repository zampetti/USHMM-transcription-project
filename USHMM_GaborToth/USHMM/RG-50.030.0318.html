1995</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: I'd like you to start off by telling me your name, date of birth, place of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My name is Harold Zissman, although it is not my birth name.</span> <span id="s13">My birth name was Zuckerman, same Harold.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Poland in a city called Austrofmazotyetski (ph) and that was about a hundred kilometers east from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s15">My parents and grandparents and many generations before them were of the Hasidic belief.</span> <span id="s16">However, they were involved in business from crockery, porcelain, glassware, and they used to distribute it to the stores in the vicinity and in further away places, maybe 200 kilometers to 300 kilometers from base.</span> <span id="s17">It was a divided territory that they shared among the other and it was their territory.</span> <span id="s18">They would supply to the stores.</span> <span id="s19">My father, like my uncle, like his son, all were part of the operation who used to, by horse and buggy, deliver goods to the various clients each week.</span> <span id="s20">And this was the means of making a living.</span> <span id="s21">It was three generations involved in it -- my grandfather, his children, which that means my father's brothers and sister, my uncle which it was, again, part of the family.</span> <span id="s22">So, it was a family owned and operated, a closed corporation that all these families lived out of this business.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Just for the record, I don't think you told what your date of birth is.</span> <span id="s24">A: My date of birth is 19, ah, May 10, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Well, my personal life was brought up a real strict, devote Hasidic kind of way.</span> <span id="s27">Besides all of that, my father was a Corporal in the Polish Army, during World War II, and life was strictly on a military basis, with the command, you had to do that, you were told to do it.</span> <span id="s28">If you didn't do it, you had to report.</span> <span id="s29">So, it was really a strenuous life, that it was in the house, especially for me since I was the oldest of four.</span> <span id="s30">I had two more brothers and a sister, who vanished in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Did you, you went to a religious school?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: I graduated a tri-level school, which it was a private school, influenced by Zionist organization, Mesrah (ph), to which my father was a member and a member of the board on top of it.</span> <span id="s33">Tri-level because it was Yiddish, Hebrew, and Polish; it was not just for linguistic-sake, but in history and geography and literature and so on.</span> <span id="s34">And later on, I graduated equal to a college, as we talk about the modern way; the name was Dachkemone (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Did you have contact with non-Jewish people as well?</span> <span id="s36">What was the, sort of the population of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: When you talk about scholastically at the time, it was a sectarian school.</span> <span id="s38">It was strictly boys, without girls, and it was strictly influenced by religion, so it was a boys' religion type of school; if you wish to call it parochial, would be in place.</span> <span id="s39">However, from the outside world, we were living on both sides for Gentiles.</span> <span id="s40">So to say that I associated with Gentile boys, yes, I did, played maybe soccer with them, or just like neighbors sometimes get together.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s43">As a kid going to school, it would have been sort of different as to bring it out in today's world, as we live in, in the 20th century.</span> <span id="s44">We used to, for instance, to give you an example, going to school early in the morning, carry a lantern, for instance, to go.</span> <span id="s45">The boys of the neighbors at that particular time, maybe would walk their dogs or stuff like that.</span> <span id="s46">And it was nothing odd to see this dog was sent against us.</span> <span id="s47">Although, we were going sometimes two, three kids together, neighbors; or maybe throwing, for the sake of play, throwing a rock at us.</span> <span id="s48">I did not see friendliness in it.</span> <span id="s49">I sensed that because the words that would follow it would be sometimes easily recognizable: "dirty Jew."</span> <span id="s50">And the likes that kids were ready, even at that age, and I'm talking now by the age of seven, eight, nine years of age.</span> <span id="s51">And you probably did not, I did not get the training of hatred, but I felt my neighbors kids do what they did to us was hatred.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: How did you make sense of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: There was no sense.</span> <span id="s54">You do what you've got to do.</span> <span id="s55">At times, sometimes maybe you throw a rock back.</span> <span id="s56">And that's when a fight would ensue and you'd come home and have to pay for it because the parents did not like for you to fight on the street.</span> <span id="s57">So, to resist was bad; not to resist was also bad.</span> <span id="s58">So, it was a mix of no decision and no resolve.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Before 1939, what did you know about Hitler or Nazis where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: First of all, it was in our history books in 1933 when Hitler did come and became Chancellor of Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s61">So we were aware historical from school.</span> <span id="s62">Second of all, come 1937 when Hitler drove all the Polish citizen Jews out of Germany where they had to come back, although Poland didn't claim them, but they were Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s63">We were exposed to them real early because our city was about 40 kilometers from Prussia; in other words, the location would be to go about 135 kilometers from Kinegsburg (ph) which was Prussia, and we were about 100 kilometers from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s64">So, for us to see scene at that particular time was a real scene to see.</span> <span id="s65">The people came to the city and they had nothing with them; all they had with them was their belongings that was on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">And I remember we would learn as a child that kitchens were set up for those people so they could come and have something to eat.</span> <span id="s67">And it was cramped quarters for the people that somebody moved in with somebody else and so on.</span> <span id="s68">So the story in 1937 was not just a story that one read in the paper or one heard on the radio if, occasionally you could, because not every home did have a radio, but you used to listen in sometimes outside near the windows of the houses that did have a radio.</span> <span id="s69">And it looks like the people didn't mind; they were all aware of it.</span> <span id="s70">So it was no longer a story that was told, but it's a story that was seen.</span> <span id="s71">It was real; the trap is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Do you remember your family talking about what was happening or whether there was anything for you to do, or whether it would come to your town, these kind of problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s74">It was, a few months later, I'm talking now '37, come '38, this scene became more vivid locally.</span> <span id="s75">We had the river Nalif (ph) going through our city.</span> <span id="s76">And it may sound a little funny that in 1914, during World War I, it was Germany that was occupying the area, not this type of German's that they build a bridge that was still considered new in our city, crossing that river.</span> <span id="s77">And at that particular time, the Polish Army started to start building dams; in other words they wanted to flood the on-coming German Army.</span> <span id="s78">This is how they thought yet in their minds, that it would be.</span> <span id="s79">So basically, being that you were a youngster like I was at the time, that in the summertime going to the beach which we used to walk and share our fun there, areas near the beach became restricted because they were building the dams.</span> <span id="s80">So one could not help but see a war, sort of this kind building up.</span> <span id="s81">We only did not know how long it would take.</span> <span id="s82">So, to answer, as I just stated, we did know something tragic as war will come, but we did not know when.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Now, was there any talk of your family of trying to leave that area, or at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes, it was a personal tragedy at my house.</span> <span id="s85">I lost my mother at that time and tragedy was home already.</span> <span id="s86">As a gesture, my mother's sister which still alive in here -- she's in a home now -- and her brothers, which with they are no longer alive, tried to save me.</span> <span id="s87">Since she had a letter in her possession, the last letter which I have, with my mother pleading for her to save me and bring me to America.</span> <span id="s88">They did send me the papers and as time that I wanted to leave, I didn't make it.</span> <span id="s89">Hitler beat me to it.</span> <span id="s90">By 1939 in September, I was supposed to come for the visa, but September 1, the war broke out.</span> <span id="s91">So, yes, as I said, we felt it and we knew it, the other tragedy.</span> <span id="s92">Personally at home, the size, the eminence of the other tragedy to follow, with Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Tell me of your memories of the war beginning, in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: The preparation before the war, as I mentioned about the dam and the mobilization it started already, in early '39.</span> <span id="s95">And at that particular time became month by month, the news became as an echo, closer to the cities, especially like ours.</span> <span id="s96">For instance, on market days, before hostilities had started, we used to have an exchange of German people coming in to purchase their eggs, buy their chickens and so on, because it was an open market and Poland was willing, we had an over abundance of food in Poland and they were good customers so therefore, we saw all at once that not so many Germans coming to market days because Poland did not now want to sell it to them, so before making it a total restriction, there was limitations of how much they could take out, or how much they could buy.</span> <span id="s97">So, one could sense a change and all of this here affected a little bit of the economy because you were built up and ready.</span> <span id="s98">The other part, my father would come home with stories telling of sometimes inticinating (sic), stone throwing, and so on.</span> <span id="s99">So, on every occasion, being from school, being from for instance religious upbringing, as we used to come.</span> <span id="s100">I was singing in a choir at that time with one of my friends who were the cantor's children attending the same school as I did.</span> <span id="s101">Yavnev (ph) was the name of the school, by the way for the record.</span> <span id="s102">And the tune of the high holiday 1938 was no longer the same as it was in '37 or prior to that.</span> <span id="s103">It was sort of more solemnity.</span> <span id="s104">So in every way of life, from school to going to synagogue to going to the beaches, one could sense a change all over.</span> <span id="s105">And you did not have to find out what; everyone was tuned to the news very much and the newspapers.</span> <span id="s106">And, in our own family, we started to prepare ourselves and my parents and grandparents remembered that in World War I, our city of Stranlinka (ph), which I am speaking of, at the time that I was, we were living in Stranlinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Because prior to that, my family were in another city, the city of my birthplace, Astramocietska (ph) involved in the same business as I aforementioned, but they were forced, of their personal matters with one of the partner's bankruptcy, to move and they moved to Stranlinka (ph) in 1929, re-starting again only a family operation, not like before when it was multi-families.</span> <span id="s108">And therefore they decided, since they were remembering that in World War I, Ostranlinka (ph), the city was totally burned down by Lastrovmazofyetsky (ph) not having a river nearby, not having the main station railroads remain quiet, so they decided that probably the war would not reach in Lastrovmazofyetsky (ph) but it will be only in Ostralinka (ph).</span> <span id="s109">And, as a means of dividing, so they also took are merchandise from our warehouse and try to put it in hiding in the other city, so in case it gets destroyed here, they'll have something to live on there and vice versa.</span> <span id="s110">So, yes; the family began to know before September 1 that world, not knowing to us that World War I was going to be named but that some war is going to break out any time, any moment.</span> <span id="s111">And that was what they decided to do, basically, is to divide.</span> <span id="s112">And closer to the war, the family, all of us, were in that city of Lastrovmazofyetsky (ph) and in Ostralinka they left the homes, the houses that we were living in, as sort of to the outcome it will be.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: So, you all moved back before the war.</span> <span id="s114">When you talked about going to school, which city were you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Ostralinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Ostralinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: While I went to school, see again, I started school, looks like my parents did not know what to do with me at home.</span> <span id="s118">So at three and a half years old I was sent to a private, to like a malamet (ph) as we say in Hebrew, which it means a tutor translated into English.</span> <span id="s119">And it was private.</span> <span id="s120">That tutor had about ten, twelve kids and it still is, I'm of age now, but it's still the picture of that one room and with all the songs surrounding it, you know, with the story of a tutor still is very vivid to me to this day.</span> <span id="s121">So, three and a half years of age, I already was a student in school.</span> <span id="s122">However, it was again another story.</span> <span id="s123">When I reached the age of seven, school in Poland was compulsory.</span> <span id="s124">You had to start at 7 o'clock, at seven years old.</span> <span id="s125">So therefore, when I reached the age of seven, we were in a new city already, moving into Ostralinka (ph).</span> <span id="s126">At that particular time I was very advanced in my Yiddish and in my Hebrew teachings.</span> <span id="s127">However, Polish I could speak but I did not know enough to qualify to be in the first grade.</span> <span id="s128">And since it was a private school, so my father would be involved paying extra money for three years for me to catch up because, according to the exams, I would qualify to go into the third grade, but I did not, they wouldn't let me be in the third grade since I did not know, had enough education in Polish.</span> <span id="s129">So my father hired a tutor to tutor me at home in Polish only and with permission, and I was transferred into the second grade.</span> <span id="s130">However within the first year and the tutor, I was able to go in immediately, not even finishing the year, to third grade.</span> <span id="s131">So, it was rough on me even then, already, you know, as it was the rest of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: What do you remember about the very beginning of war?</span> <span id="s133">Was your town occupied?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s135">At the year that I'm talking about, to make it vivid, it falls out before the high holidays, as we call our Rosh Hashanah, the way it would be.</span> <span id="s136">So the day before Rosh Hashanah, while we were in Ostrovmazovetsky (ph), that's when the Germans entered the city.</span> <span id="s137">That first hello from them that we had was the same very day, within hours, they occupied the city.</span> <span id="s138">They started to round up Jews, in other words, coming in with their guns drawn in their hands and you they rouse, "Jew out".</span> <span id="s139">And we were all gathered at the place over there, where it was the high school, which had a big place, you know.</span> <span id="s140">But, I mean the place that was the playground that they had.</span> <span id="s141">And we were made to be seated, hands over our head and the war, I cannot exactly tell you the amount, but there were a few thousand of us.</span> <span id="s142">On the balcony, we could see a machine gun, a big machine gun drawn.</span> <span id="s143">We were surrounded in lines in between, with German soldiers, be they had carbines, some of them had automatic weapons.</span> <span id="s144">And for what reason we were there, what, known knew.</span> <span id="s145">But we expected the worst in the position that we were.</span> <span id="s146">After an hour of sitting over there, and it's already curfew time near, all of a sudden, looks like it was a command and we were told to get up and round back.</span> <span id="s147">As we found it out, the next day late, that Army was called to help some on the front line while they were going towards Warsaw at that time.</span> <span id="s148">In the days of the war, it was probably the fourth day of the war, and so take it, more or less, that it was September 4 at that particular time.</span> <span id="s149">And we were driven, sort of to go back to our homes and shots were followed, a lot of them were killed on the way.</span> <span id="s150">Like, this year, my father, and as we were split up because we were not together there, and my father was running in another direction and since he was a military trained person, he knew how to go on his stomach and so on, to get out of the fire's way and he, when we came home, everybody was there but my father and we took it for granted for that night that probably he was killed.</span> <span id="s151">However, in the morning, he made his way to meet us and it was a joyful thing that my father was not killed, and he told us that story.</span> <span id="s152">So, yes.</span> <span id="s153">The first day of greeting, we found other casualties, the rabbi of the city and a lot of people from the, from one type of synagogue near the house, were driven with their shawls, or , as we call it, to the area where we had a lake.</span> <span id="s154">We did not have a river in Ostravmazofyetsky, but lake.</span> <span id="s155">At the lake there, there were lined up German cars, that they were asked to wash them with their shawls and then afterwards they were asked to go through.</span> <span id="s156">They did not know how to swim, so some of them drowned, you know, we knew right there.</span> <span id="s157">And when they came out, they were beaten.</span> <span id="s158">So, there were begin some casualties really known.</span> <span id="s159">We again found out that now, in order to, you cannot buy anything so there was lines lined up near the bakery in order to get bread.</span> <span id="s160">And soon enough, the police, the local police, which it was organized with arm bands.</span> <span id="s161">And the Germans started to pull the Jews out of the lines that the Jews cannot stay in line for bakery goods, to get.</span> <span id="s162">So, yes.</span> <span id="s163">We immediately knew the expectations to a wait; that it will not get better but it will only bet worse.</span> <span id="s164">And it was a matter of when.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: The next thing that had happened, a local government came in there.</span> <span id="s167">By that particular time, it was about a week later already into the war and the following the holidays it was already , which as you know, it follows Rosh Hashana, Yom Kipper, and five days later, Sucot (ph).</span> <span id="s168">And the family decided to go back.</span> <span id="s169">We went back part, my father, I, and a few more.</span> <span id="s170">We were afraid to move, to touch the merchandise that was there because it would have been confiscated.</span> <span id="s171">However before that happened, I must not forget to tell an incident that a rumor had it that leather, shoe leather was hidden someplace because the Poles used, at that time, cooperated very easily with the Germans and the German demands were met.</span> <span id="s172">So if sometimes, they knew who the merchants were and who what, and they were aware that a lot of people were hiding their goods because they were afraid in case, so they couldn't find it and we, for what it's worth, that's my grandparents, both of them, my father and I were among the 10 or 12 hostages that were lined up again and they said if somebody's not going to tell them about where the shoe leather is hidden, we will be shot dead.</span> <span id="s173">So the first time in my life, I had the fear of being almost lined up against the wall.</span> <span id="s174">Luck was with us that the building next to us, the leather was discovered and we were let to go home.</span> <span id="s175">So, sort of to speak it, you were counting your blessings.</span> <span id="s176">So the second time that ever it happened that we were lined up, that we came out whole as far as the family, no casualties.</span> <span id="s177">But there were casualties already there.</span> <span id="s178">The chores immediately had started.</span> <span id="s179">The Jews had to line up on the outside in a given place and from there cleaning the streets and so on was the kind of work that we were ordered to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">And, of course, let me not forget to say it was without pay, for pay the billing was in order.</span> <span id="s181">And we decided at that particular time we had to have a paper that allowing us because without a paper who knows who could happen on the way?</span> <span id="s182">So we managed to get a paper, as refugees, that we were running, during the war to return back to our place.</span> <span id="s183">And, the Germans gave, not the Germans but the local, from the local area we got there.</span> <span id="s184">And we were on our way back.</span> <span id="s185">And on the way back, every time we were traveling, we were stopped by the Germans and they made us get off from the wagon and start to look but we did not, we did not yet had anything to be heard, until we neared one place, a village, I think it was, maybe, I would say maybe 20 kilometers from our city.</span> <span id="s186">In that village lived one of our relatives and he had a store, a general type store and we found out, because we stopped to find out what to do, we found out that they already had a small massacre of the Jews and his family was among them and the store was no longer in his hands because it was confiscated.</span> <span id="s187">So we found out a little bit of mishap on the family right on the way there.</span> <span id="s188">No sooner had we got to Ostralinka, back to our home, our home was not robbed or anything like that; it was still there because the rest of the people in the building were there, so it was sort of like was somebody to watch it.</span> <span id="s189">So once we were there, again the chores started, the same as over there.</span> <span id="s190">My father was ordered and they put him into jail for a day because he was cleaning.</span> <span id="s191">That was the main chores that Jews were given to do, street cleaning or any of the office buildings and so on.</span> <span id="s192">And we noticed at that particular time in Ostralinka that it was less of an uprise, less going on than in Lostravmozavensky, which we found out later the reason.</span> <span id="s193">The Soviets were only at that particular time sharing the city, so one part of the city at the other end, one day the Soviets would come in, the other day the Germans.</span> <span id="s194">So we took it as an interpretation that since the Soviets were part over there, the Germans did not try to act out in the same way as they did for instance in Lostravmozavensky.</span> <span id="s195">That was never supposed to be belonging to the Soviets so they had a more free hand.</span> <span id="s196">That went on for another few days while we were in town until one day, it was still the Jewish holidays of Soco (ph), the second days, so the, it was placed notices all over town that within ten hours, the Jews are to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Officially it said you could take all the belongings that you want.</span> <span id="s198">In our case, since we had a horse and wagon, so there were three of them so we shared it among the family and besides the furniture, we tried to manage to take some of our clothing and so on and to leave with that.</span> <span id="s199">Immediately, the same day, the Poles from farming and the other places came into the houses and they were not asking, "Do you sell it?"</span> <span id="s200">or anything, but they took the furniture out of the house.</span> <span id="s201">So our house was emptied out of furniture within a few hours.</span> <span id="s202">And there was known to stop them.</span> <span id="s203">We tried to open up the store and maybe muster to get a few, some money out of it, of whatever it is, and no sooner we opened up the door to our store, a Polish person brought the Germans here.</span> <span id="s204">The Germans start to ask who the owners is, I was there with my uncle.</span> <span id="s205">As soon as we realized the questions, we took the first chance and run away from there, back home, and that was the end.</span> <span id="s206">So in other words, that was confiscated.</span> <span id="s207">So however, the other part in hiding was, still in Lostravmozavetsky, where I and a cousin of mine, in a few months, almost two months later, make a chance and cross the border with the horse and wagon, dressed as farmers and we make an attempt, the Germans almost caught up with us and we salvaged some merchandise from there, from the hiding place, which it gave us an ability with, money- wise, to have for the first winter that we were over there.</span> <span id="s208">And it's a long story to tell until we get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: I have one question.</span> <span id="s210">I'm a little confused.</span> <span id="s211">These two towns, were they close to each other, because you seem to go back and forth a bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: 40 kilometers, which, in our miles-way, we were talking about 20 miles.</span> <span id="s213">So you must understand, 20 miles driving with a car is nothing, but with a horse and buggy, it would take, with the horse and buggy, you know, it would take a few hours which you would be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: But, you seem to have the freedom to choose between these two places to go back and</span></p> <p><span id="s215">forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: When do you talk about, in the first days of the war?</span> <span id="s217">Yes.</span> <span id="s218">Until we were sent out from our city, you needed to have a piece of paper, that in other words, you were permitted.</span> <span id="s219">So once you had a permit, you were stopped.</span> <span id="s220">They checked the permits but you could move about.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: How long did it take before certain decrees or rules were implemented by the Germans and Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s225">All the German forerunners were on motorcycles.</span> <span id="s226">That's how they were, that was their infantry, starting with motorcycles and then trucks and so on and armor would follow them.</span> <span id="s227">Immediately, their crews would post posters on lighting poles or whatsoever, wherever posters could be posted, telling the new ordinance, what it is: A.</span> <span id="s228">That it was curfew hours.</span> <span id="s229">B.</span> <span id="s230">That the Jews must be identified and must carry identification and in the early part, at least in our city, we were supposed to wear a band with the Mark of David, with the Star of David on it.</span> <span id="s231">And it was told immediately if one is caught, they will be shot.</span> <span id="s232">That was for anything that one violates, violating the curfew was shot.</span> <span id="s233">It was immediately declared that Jews cannot walk on sidewalks.</span> <span id="s234">So, the identity was the arm band and you must not walk on the sidewalk; you must walk just on the streets.</span> <span id="s235">And the same story was, in reading on further, one would know that Jews no longer can attend any schools, Jews can no longer own any businesses, Jews no longer have rights and that was stating according to the rules of Nuremborg.</span> <span id="s236">Therefore, for the time being, the ghetto was not erected as yet, that was not talked about as yet, but they always must report every morning to their assigned places for the assigned work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">So in the first days of entry, when everyone got out of their hiding places, running away from the bombings, they were faced immediately with the rules and arm bands affixing and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Did you always follow those rules?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s240">One did not try to there because we saw the consequences how easily it was for a German to draw his pistol and even without anything, can be just target practice and there wasn't a day or anyplace, as soon as they came in, that killings were not going on.</span> <span id="s241">And they were not re meditated; they just a lot of times were out of laughter.</span> <span id="s242">And I've seen with my own eyes where a mother and her child were target practice, to shoot, to see that one bullet should kill both of them at one time.</span> <span id="s243">And it was not to save a bullet, but it was just that the rest of the Germans would laugh, you know what I mean, you would see a scene much rather than a murder being committed.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: What were the Poles doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Well, the Poles at that particular time, please understand, immediately remained as, those who worked in offices were left working in offices.</span> <span id="s246">Those who were formerly in the police, a lot of them escaped for fear and a lot of them were drafted to the services, so a new police force was being organized.</span> <span id="s247">Also they were carrying bands to identify the police.</span> <span id="s248">So the Poles were pretty much back to their normal lives, whatever they had to do, you know toying around with a new regime, you know.</span> <span id="s249">But the important thing was, as a Jew, immediately your businesses were confiscated, you know, and if you had lived someplace in a nice area, it was nothing to hear new that you were pushed out.</span> <span id="s250">But, as I said, that was in Lostrovmozavetsky, in the first few days; but we came to Ostravlinka as I for mentioned before, things were a little bit different and not so rapidly, due to the fact that we were sharing the Soviets on the other side and the town and one did not know that they may not occupy the whole town.</span> <span id="s251">So, therefore it was a little bit easier.</span> <span id="s252">So when it happened, it happened to us rapidly; ten hours and the Jews must leave the town.</span> <span id="s253">When we came to the borderline with bayonets they went through our belongings and if like pillows, you saw feathers fly everywhere, so in other words, and if it's anything valuable, they tried, nobody dared to carry open gold or rings or anything like that, because that was confiscated on you there.</span> <span id="s254">So then, you would still get a few biddings and go to the borderline.</span> <span id="s255">And there was a no-man's land shortly in that part than over on the other side.</span> <span id="s256">In our group, the family, my grandmother, my mother's father, he spoke Russian yet because he knew to write and to read Russian.</span> <span id="s257">So he served at that particular time for us as the interpreter and we crossed over on the Russian side.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Now, at what point did you decide to go over on the Russian side?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: It was not a decision at what point.</span> <span id="s260">As I said, when the posters were posted that this is declared to be a city of the Third Reich, according to the Nuremburg laws, a Jew was not permitted to dwell in the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s261">So we were given ten hours, as I said, to move out.</span> <span id="s262">So, as I said, we had ten hours to leave and we had two choices to make: either to go, as we called it at that time, Congress Poland, which it means out of our city to any other place, or we could cross the border to the Soviets.</span> <span id="s263">The Soviet border was remained open for all who wants to cross and to come there.</span> <span id="s264">That was the part that it helped a lot of people be saved or rather, that it saved their lives crossing like my family did.</span> <span id="s265">And that we went on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s267">Continue on.</span> <span id="s268">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s270">We went to a city 36 kilometers from our city called Lunja (ph).</span> <span id="s271">And from there, about another 15 kilometers or so was a city called Yedvobno (ph).</span> <span id="s272">Yedvobno translated from Polish to English would be silt; the silt city, Yedvobno.</span> <span id="s273">In that little town, our family probably from the shakot (ph) to the rabbi to anybody else was somehow related, you know; second cousin, third cousin.</span> <span id="s274">And the family sort of found ways to get situated among all that family.</span> <span id="s275">So even if it was only one room that it was given to go in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">And immediately, we had to register with the police ask so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s277">And youngsters were asked to go back to school because it was September, and the school year was disrupted for a little while.</span> <span id="s278">School had started.</span> <span id="s279">I enlisted in school at that particular time, again.</span> <span id="s280">Since Russian was not my language, but I had to study so instead of coming in according to my education, I should have at least come into the tenth class because the Russian had a ten-year school.</span> <span id="s281">I came in at the ninth with an examination because on everything I tested but Russian and I was back into school and it started a new life, sort of, in a way feeling of joy, even though everything was left behind and all of a sudden we were supposed to be the proletariat.</span> <span id="s282">And of course, the identity that my father was a businessman was a shameful thing to say, shameful enough that you could have been arrested and sent to Siberia which the bad thing for one, which like it happened to some of the family, turned out to be good wishes for later, because it since they were sent to Siberia, they survived the war without a lot of these problems that the rest of us had to go through, those who survived.</span> <span id="s283">So, at that particular time, started a new life.</span> <span id="s284">I, as a young person, was starting again like all young people used to get together after school in the evening and it was the Russian system, which they called "Dacadumcrasne ami" (ph), which it means the house of the Red Army.</span> <span id="s285">And the Red Army used to supply dances, sort of in playing, and it was, you know, that was part of their propaganda, how Stalin cares for the youth and Stalin loves us.</span> <span id="s286">And all of a sudden, a new life had started, to listen to politicians talking and voicing opinions that we should learn the constitution of the Soviet Union and that they came to liberate us and so on.</span> <span id="s287">It was a new lexicon for me and many of us to indulge and I remember it was influenced on me as a young person; after all, I was only 17, going into my 18th year of life and everything coming on so fast.</span> <span id="s288">So, I remember when I used to come home, starting to talk politics with my father and tell him the wrongs, the way he was doing before, without realizing, and my father told me, "Wait, son.</span> <span id="s289">While you're in school and you come home, you have a clean bed and you have food to eat.</span> <span id="s290">It's very nice for you to talk of it.</span> <span id="s291">But, when the day will come that you will have to earn your living, you will see who is wrong."</span> <span id="s292">Because my father, and the rest of the family, first being religious, second they were against communism or socialism to begin with and it was sort of life at a time rolled back to working with them, being school influenced on one side, and being influenced on the other side.</span> <span id="s293">For me, I felt good, that no longer I have to go and go attending religious upbringing and so on.</span> <span id="s294">So as I lot of youngsters, you choose what it's easier and better.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">And especially, you come at night, and you go out with all the boys and girls and it's dancing, it was sort of a different life without knowing.</span> <span id="s296">And you know, that was, that's blind thing that it was put up.</span> <span id="s297">Before long I joined even an organization called Soviehem (ph); it was a sports organization so you get involved in sports and it didn't take long, when we were asked to take our passports and after then we took out the passports, things became a little bit more strict.</span> <span id="s298">We were restricted as we cannot live 100 kilometers from the border which that city of Vadlov (ph) was less than a hundred kilometers, you know, to the border, so therefore as refugees, we had to start moving.</span> <span id="s299">So the first time winter we through there, come spring, new problems had started even on the Soviet side.</span> <span id="s300">Now we had to leave all this family, leave all the people that you knew and move to at least a hundred kilometers away.</span> <span id="s301">We choose, Galestov (ph), for instance, was the big center.</span> <span id="s302">Big centers were forbidden for these displaced persons to live in there and we had to .</span> <span id="s303">That's how it happened that we came to the Ratchen (ph).</span> <span id="s304">The Ratchen was a city that it was far enough from the borderline and we were permitted.</span> <span id="s305">However to get housing, was again another problem over there.</span> <span id="s306">They were not prepared to take in this many refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: One question before you tell me more about the .</span> <span id="s308">Were you able to continue practicing your religion?</span> <span id="s309">Were you able to be a Jew under Soviet occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: I would say that even at the time, if it was not officially restricted at first, and we are talking about not even a year there, but people were understanding of the circumstances so they did, after escaping the Germans, everything that the Soviets had to offer was good.</span> <span id="s311">So, therefore, instead of violating the rules so people, yes, did practice in hiding.</span> <span id="s312">It was another way like we were for instance, which I didn't tell at the beginning, on the first day of Rosh Hashana, that we descended in a cellar at that time, and my grandfather at that time, and on the top, going down to the cellar on the top we put on a piece of the furniture so it should not be visible in the event the Germans come in to see.</span> <span id="s313">And I spoke to my grandfather at that time and I say, "Now I understand what they went through in Spain, in the year the Jews were practicing."</span> <span id="s314">And he says, "Be quiet my son.</span> <span id="s315">Don't talk now.</span> <span id="s316">Pray to God maybe we'll survive."</span> <span id="s317">So, that's how deep the religion was in these people.</span> <span id="s318">They saw only one way out of it was through religion.</span> <span id="s319">So, now when we're on the Soviet side, they did practice religion but no longer did I have the discipline that my father would ask me, "Did you pray this morning?"</span> <span id="s320">Because I went to school again and he realized that I'm becoming brain washed with something different so it was sort of a "Don't talk.</span> <span id="s321">Don't tell.</span> <span id="s322">Don't ask," situation that I was brought into to live in the new life.</span> <span id="s323">And, as I started to say at the outset, getting situated in the regimen was not an easy task.</span> <span id="s324">For instance, a whole family moved into one single room next door to a guy who is making harnesses for horses and so on.</span> <span id="s325">And that room used to be his workman place.</span> <span id="s326">But it looks like all the bitterness became sweet and everything was well.</span> <span id="s327">After all, as I said, for the first winter, the merchandise that I and my cousin being risked our lives and brought it in, lasted for that time.</span> <span id="s328">But all of a sudden, everybody had to get work.</span> <span id="s329">My father, since he still had the horse and wagon and that gave him a good way hiding than he was not a businessman but he was a working man, earning a living through that.</span> <span id="s330">So now, he used to do with his horse and wagon taking some merchandise from, which they used to call it Soluzatil (ph) which it was scrap metal and so on, and he would have to take it to another city to bring it in to the big warehouse.</span> <span id="s331">So he had a job for this year and that helped him to do black marketeering while under the cover of this merchandise that he had.</span> <span id="s332">He would go ahead and smuggle like saccharin maybe, and other things like that.</span> <span id="s333">So, when you were going to Sloyen (ph), you would take along some eggs, butter, whatever it is to trade.</span> <span id="s334">There was no money.</span> <span id="s335">Trading was the important thing, and come over there, buy flints for instance, for lighters.</span> <span id="s336">That was a big thing because matches were in a scarce place; getting sole, which it was a very scarcity item or sugar.</span> <span id="s337">So, it was a matter of black marketing.</span> <span id="s338">It was against the law.</span> <span id="s339">If you were caught with it, five year jail was the term.</span> <span id="s340">But need and the necessity to go on does not get scared by five years imprisonment, you know.</span> <span id="s341">And we went on and at times, at first I still was in school, didn't get involved.</span> <span id="s342">So I tried to go ahead and listen to what they told me in school and I involved myself to become a working man.</span> <span id="s343">And school at that particular time taught you and they kept saying that no matter what we do, we must go ahead to do work.</span> <span id="s344">And I registered to go to Galistog (ph) to a place and I wind up in a place were they were building actually housing for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s345">And as a youngster I never did this kind of work before and there I have to take the wood barrels and fill them.</span> <span id="s346">After a couple of weeks of work, I thought I'm going to collapse and I returned back home.</span> <span id="s347">I got a permit and I returned back home and I had to find another job.</span> <span id="s348">My father at that particular time was afraid continuing with the work that he was doing over there, so we decided we are going to go to the forest; which, this going to the forest would build up the future later, serving as a base, that I knew the roots of how to escape from the ghetto, although we didn't do it with that in mind, but it turned out to be, yesterday's bad things turned out tomorrow's safety and so on.</span> <span id="s349">So we came there, over there with a horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s350">We were loading trees that were cut down and taking them from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s351">The other part behind it was that we worked close to the farmers so we could deal with the farmers and that black marketeering was still a part and before long, my father's influence worked on me that I got involved doing the black marketeering in the same way alongside of him.</span> <span id="s352">And for a while, we thought that it couldn't be any better because the shortage of food was no shortage to us.</span> <span id="s353">We always had enough food to bring home; not luxury food, you know, good food that we wanted, but food was around the table, you know.</span> <span id="s354">So you had bread, you had butter, you had cheese.</span> <span id="s355">You were able to get a chicken even though you couldn't get your steaks and so on, but you could have a chicken and so on.</span> <span id="s356">And was the other problem was at that time with kosher slaughter.</span> <span id="s357">Kosher slaughter became a problem.</span> <span id="s358">I did not go into the political part of it, to tell you of Poland before the war.</span> <span id="s359">I don't know how much to tell or how much you can give me the time to tell, but talking about kosher slaughter, even through 1937, through a woman by the name of Pristo, Madam Pristo, and she served in Polish Congress.</span> <span id="s360">And she was a humanist.</span> <span id="s361">She said that killing an animal, as the kosher slaughter was, takes too much time for the animal to be dead; therefore, we were doing an inhumane thing to the animal.</span> <span id="s362">So therefore, kosher slaughter should be forbidden.</span> <span id="s363">It stirred up a tremendous out pour throughout Poland because the Polish constitution of 1918, when they gained independence, and Pilsutsky (ph) at that time being the head, and since the Jews saved his life, he owed a debt to the Jews and he kept all these anti-Semites (ph) in place.</span> <span id="s364">He couldn't stop them altogether, but he, like a dictator, kept it undercover and control.</span> <span id="s365">The Jews had elective officials, even to the same as they were called the same, Senate, house of Congress, as you would call it, you know, and the Senate.</span> <span id="s366">And the law, and it posed tremendous protest.</span> <span id="s367">But I blame the Jewish leadership for not coming up at that time immediately to squelch all of this here that in turn led to the officials handling black candles and they called a fast that we have to fast and punish ourselves so that God will help us, that this bad law will be change.</span> <span id="s368">Well, we know the outcome, that it didn't.</span> <span id="s369">And the hypocrisy worked on me even as a youngster.</span> <span id="s370">Because why?</span> <span id="s371">Instead of forbidding the kosher slaughter, we were given a contingency; in other words, you can kill so many so that, in its, tells the wrongs.</span> <span id="s372">If it is right to kill 100 pieces of cattle, why is it wrong to kill 150 or 200.</span> <span id="s373">So in it, one so blatantly, that anti-Semitic out burst against the Jews, even though they were constitutionally protected, that it's a part of religious ritual to do.</span> <span id="s374">So know, on the Soviet side, all people who are before, remembered this here case and no one sort of dared to make an issue of it.</span> <span id="s375">However, kosher slaughter still went on in hiding, as sort of to speak that if you want a chicken to be slaughtered properly kosher, you could, there was somebody who would do it for you.</span> <span id="s376">But, it sort of, since the towns were small and the NKVD as we called it at that time, or KGB did not penetrate so much and the local people were working in the government so some how rather, it was "Hey, I don't see it."</span> <span id="s377">And, of course, in many instances, you paid off for all of these goodies doing it in the say way.</span> <span id="s378">So, religiously, again, which it was a big upheaval for people like in my family at that particular time.</span> <span id="s379">And I as a youngster, did not feel the hurt so much because I was young and foolish as the saying would be, not understanding tomorrow, you know, what it is going to bring on us later.</span> <span id="s380">So, as I said, I already got the taste of the coming Soviet working and being privileged to find out at that particular time, that in the Soviet Union, workmanship was by right; in other words, the bricklayer did not earn as much money, or maybe more money as the guy who was mixing the cement.</span> <span id="s381">So, it was not the Soviet system of socialism but it was again, capitalism.</span> <span id="s382">In the capitalistic system, we know there are different rates of pay, even for the same work.</span> <span id="s383">So, I began do get a little doubt in the system to what is going on.</span> <span id="s384">And that was own a year and a half on this sort of living conditions.</span> <span id="s385">I still was in school and I came back from Devon (ph) back into school and all of this kind of life lasted, as I said; with working in the forest and doing all the means.</span> <span id="s386">And at that particular time, I used to talk to my family, why don't they try to go ahead, go move further east, but their mind was that the work cannot be a lasting one, that the war should be over and we'll be able to return back to the area that we had to run away from.</span> <span id="s387">However, the 22nd of June, all of the dreams of yesteryears became too evil for that same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: 1941, the 22nd of June, Hitler attacked.</span> <span id="s390">I don't want to have to put it in, but maybe we have to.</span> <span id="s391">If anyone's seen on television not so long ago, it was brought the story back to life, the way Stalin was forewarned about all the things that Hitler was going to attack but it did not want to listen to and he even went away and executed some guys, calling them propagandists and until the war broke out, he didn't want to believe that that would be the case.</span> <span id="s392">That's a point I want inserted because it's a true fact, the way it was.</span> <span id="s393">He began to see it immediately.</span> <span id="s394">The local population then, in that city, Rachen (ph), that I was, we were hiding from the bombings, when the Germans attacked and they kept saying they wished the Germans would come in already.</span> <span id="s395">And after us telling them we already experienced the Germans, I hope that the Russians shouldn't lose and be able, because at that particular time it was a few days the Soviets, a few days the Germans, until it was settled.</span> <span id="s396">Because within ten days at that particular time, it had reached almost near to be the Mensk (ph), you know, and Hitler at that particular time was the blitz , it was named, that he'll be in Moscow within ten days.</span> <span id="s397">And he almost succeeded, you know, to be there.</span> <span id="s398">So things began to turn real fast in a different way.</span> <span id="s399">Again, at this time, in '41, like it happened in '39, the first thing when the Germans sent it in the Rachen, the Jews were called to meet on the place in the center.</span> <span id="s400">The center of the city of small towns, like in most cases in the United States also, have also, you know, they call it the plaza over there, what we call the marketplace or whatever.</span> <span id="s401">So that was usually the center for the Jews to be gathered.</span> <span id="s402">And they drove us out over there and, again, if you want to call it a miracle be it; to me it is a miracle but it happened.</span> <span id="s403">While a man, a German uniform went out and spoke to us in perfect Russian and he was a, I believe a captain, if higher, spoke to us in perfect Russian and started to tell us about the new law and all of us were searched and if anybody has jewelry or anything like that.</span> <span id="s404">So, we had a taste right away early to put it up and all of a sudden while we were there, looks like, you know, a piece of artillery that it was the wrong way, hit the corner part of the church and when that hit and another one followed, the Germans started it and they were being attacked now, so we were dismissed.</span> <span id="s405">But the machine guns were surrounding us at the time.</span> <span id="s406">We were not there to listen to speeches.</span> <span id="s407">We were there to follow through.</span> <span id="s408">They started to segregate all doctors needs to go to one side; you know, the right and left, if you ever heard about it, that's what, we were a part of it.</span> <span id="s409">To the right, to the left; no one knew whether the right line is the right line or it is the wrong line, you know, to go.</span> <span id="s410">And you had no choice about it.</span> <span id="s411">They would go ahead and look, right, left, and every time they was said, was always with a and that saved us, that explosion from this here artillery piece and all of a sudden the Germans were starting to run around like mice and we were returned back to our houses.</span> <span id="s412">Until a couple of days later, the front line started to come for fuller, the Soviets, whatever was left, retreated and that was when life under the occupation with the Nazis began.</span> <span id="s413">A Univad (ph) was formed in the city.</span> <span id="s414">A Univad means actually a government -- it was not appointment.</span> <span id="s415">It wasn't even elected but then, we would line up.</span> <span id="s416">He would point the finger to one, he would go out to the right or to the other one and they would appoint about maybe ten people.</span> <span id="s417">Then they told them, "You are the Univad," and they said, "You are going to be the president and this is where we'll begin to have a government," and a ghetto was formed.</span> <span id="s418">So, for the first time, a new life starts again, ghetto; which it meant they mapped out a few blocks of the city which could house only probably a tenth or maybe less than a tenth of the population, and it was with barbed wire surrounded all the way around, with doors and we had the police, the local police which they assigned to; it used to be on the outside.</span> <span id="s419">The Germans could always go inside to the police, but the restriction was for farmers or Gentiles to go inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s420">We could only go out with a "shine" as they used to say in German; in other words, a paper which was a permit and groups used to be started in the morning.</span> <span id="s421">We would line up near the Univad; these ones are going, those are the carpenters.</span> <span id="s422">They're going to do carpentry work.</span> <span id="s423">Those are the electricians, going for electrical work.</span> <span id="s424">The other ones we'll send to cleaning the various types of offices or the streets or whatever ensued later, like it was winter for instance, to go to clean the snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A. . . . arithmetic of the case, since Jews were only 10 percent of the population, how come so much anti-Semitism could reach.</span> <span id="s428">(Another speaker, unintelligible.)</span> <span id="s429">Amoshik (ph).</span> <span id="s430">So it could not be right.</span> <span id="s431">(Another speaker; "They wouldn't have to kill anybody.")</span> <span id="s432">It means the three half million people, all turned onto families.</span> <span id="s433">The families, let's say make it 3 or 4 per family, so it would be a fourth of that would have been.</span> <span id="s434">So they should have been. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: I think you were talking about (unintelligible)?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Life in the Rachen (ph) on the occupation and with the ghetto and Univad (ph) in full swing, brought new problems and killings day by day.</span> <span id="s437">They were not killings because they were called for, but it was the criteria I have aforementioned.</span> <span id="s438">If a policeman wanted to have fun, he killed a Jew.</span> <span id="s439">Or, when he was working something and if he did not work as fast as the policeman told him to do, that was a good way to basically not shoot him, but beat him to death.</span> <span id="s440">So everyday used to go on in the same.</span> <span id="s441">I had in the ghetto with me a brother to my father who he was, in part, responsible for helping me with my religious education and he was a graduated rabbi.</span> <span id="s442">We still used to, by his demands, when I would come from work and we used to sort of talk about the Torrah, a little bit here and then the other.</span> <span id="s443">All of that was very distasteful at the time to me, but I loved him enough to listen to him.</span> <span id="s444">He's the man at that particular time came to me since maybe I didn't mention, and I use that word, "ota defid" (ph), you know what I'm referring to?</span> <span id="s445">That's a French saying for "burning" and that was sort of burning on display.</span> <span id="s446">All religious scripture, be the Torrah, be books and everything, were ordered by the Germans to be making in a bonfire which they had burned it.</span> <span id="s447">They were so scared for knowledge that people could be aware that this was, again, a part of showing to the Jew which it belonged to a part of the de- humanization program.</span> <span id="s448">Because, you must remember that we went through certain stages.</span> <span id="s449">As I have aforementioned before, the laws of Nuremburg were the first laws to give them the guide.</span> <span id="s450">And in these laws, a Jew was not a human.</span> <span id="s451">A Jew loss all his rights and therefore he was a person without rights.</span> <span id="s452">So, the same as I have aforementioned before, when the ghetto started, it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s453">Inside the ghetto, a Jew could walk every place.</span> <span id="s454">But even by marching to work or doing your chores that you were ordered to do, the sidewalk was forbidden for a Jew to walk on.</span> <span id="s455">So, . . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: You mean outside?</span> <span id="s457">?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s459">Even while you were doing your duty.</span> <span id="s460">The only time he could walk out was when he had a broom in his hand and sweeping the sidewalk so therefore.</span> <span id="s461">But otherwise, this was forbidden for Jews to walk on those sidewalks.</span> <span id="s462">Every time you saw a German, a Jew was asked that he must salute him and say "Good morning" and so on.</span> <span id="s463">If you didn't, that was good enough cause for the Germans to beat you, kill you, or whatever it is because we had no rights, so he did not have to bring in front of the court or anything like that.</span> <span id="s464">You were executed on the spot.</span> <span id="s465">Quite often when the killings went on, I would come home and talk to my uncle and say, "Look, I'm very despondent today.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">I've seen a child being molested and killed."</span> <span id="s467">Or, "I've seen another instance where that happened."</span> <span id="s468">And basically, that was, then the dig.</span> <span id="s469">They started to do a dig at that particular time in the out skirts of the town.</span> <span id="s470">A pit big enough for a truck, mind you, to go around and turn.</span> <span id="s471">And that ultimately was supposed to be the burial places that was intended for the ghetto, but it did not happen that way because of the Protestants in the area, which I'm going to get to it a little bit later, when we get to talk about the Protestants.</span> <span id="s472">But, right now, I'm only trying to touch base with life and what went on, the kind.</span> <span id="s473">Let's say when the winter came, a lot of Jews were killed and lost by sending them to go ahead to clean the snow.</span> <span id="s474">And they did not have the proper equipment.</span> <span id="s475">The Germans didn't provide shovels, it was our job that we, the Univad (ph) of the Jews had to have shovels.</span> <span id="s476">And to get tools at that time, it wasn't like you go into a store and buy it.</span> <span id="s477">You paid dearly through the local population to get it for you because Jews could not travel around and go to purchase things.</span> <span id="s478">So, in order to purchase things, that's what you had to do, the outside connection.</span> <span id="s479">Another thing which I do not want to leave out: the creation of the Univad, a new thing and a new word began to make its place.</span> <span id="s480">The word was called "contribution" .</span> <span id="s481">Now, in the normal language when we use a contribution in the United Nations United States, we talk about a donation.</span> <span id="s482">You contribute something to a welfare, to a cause.</span> <span id="s483">That word "contribution" was done exactly opposite; that was a punishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">In other words, it means the Univad could be called and was beat up to the office of the Gestapo and they were given an order that within, for instance, ten hours for so, this community, this ghetto is to write one kilogram of gold.</span> <span id="s485">They did not care whether you had the gold, but if you didn't have the gold, they wanted a kilogram of gold.</span> <span id="s486">Maybe they were successful to bring 14 ounces; they accepted the 14 ounces, and but on another contribution, which in other words.</span> <span id="s487">So, little by little, all the laws began to be of that nature.</span> <span id="s488">Jews cannot wear leather shoes.</span> <span id="s489">Jews cannot wear any leather clothing.</span> <span id="s490">So, in other words, all of this type; if you had boots or you had shoes with leather, you had to turn that in.</span> <span id="s491">So all of this here was the part of the dehumanization program and the part of breaking us morally and shy away how to resist the enemy, you know.</span> <span id="s492">So you haven't got this and you haven't got that and you can't get the others and before long, and we used to have to come every morning and stay in line to receive the amount of ounces of bread prescribed.</span> <span id="s493">In other words, it wasn't a matter that you go out to buy, but it was a bakery and the Jews used to be delivered bread and the bread was not made of flour.</span> <span id="s494">If you heard stories that were, you know, putting in sanding from the wood, you know, things like this.</span> <span id="s495">It was true.</span> <span id="s496">It was like that.</span> <span id="s497">And that the Jews had to pay for it.</span> <span id="s498">Labor, you didn't get paid.</span> <span id="s499">So you used to go through all of this here, stay in line to get the ration for the day of bread.</span> <span id="s500">So food became a problem, and talking about smuggling was again an issue.</span> <span id="s501">Since my brother used to know the farmers, that he used to speculate before with the Russians, now he used to, as a child it was easier; he was four years younger than I was, so we split up at that particular time.</span> <span id="s502">I was with the family of my father's and my brother, my two brothers and my sister went to live together with my grandfather.</span> <span id="s503">My grandfather on the father's side was dead; he died already.</span> <span id="s504">But my grandfather from my mother's side was still alive and he was there.</span> <span id="s505">So he was together with his son and his wife already was dead, left a child behind and then he had the three children, his grandchildren.</span> <span id="s506">So my brother used to be the one who would steal his way out and if my uncle would find something that he should give him to trade for food, he would go.</span> <span id="s507">And as a kid, but he was very well equipped to be able to do it because necessity at a time mother of invention and since we had to make the life of black marketeering, you know, that's what it was.</span> <span id="s508">I did not tell you this point, that at this time in my life my father was no longer alive here.</span> <span id="s509">As I aforementioned before, that my father used to go ahead and carry on the sayuzatil (ph) which is I said metal scraping, to he used to have to go to Slonum (ph) with it, a big city from the Rachen (ph), and in the meanwhile he used to be able to take passengers along who would pay him money and they were also black marketeers.</span> <span id="s510">So it happened in that winter of 1942.</span> <span id="s511">Now, I got to be careful; not the winter of '42.</span> <span id="s512">It was the winter before the Germans; it was the winter of 1940.</span> <span id="s513">So while he was traveling to Slonum, at that time was a big snow, we had maybe 10 to 12 inches of snow.</span> <span id="s514">And halfway, the horse couldn't pull the sled anymore because he was sinking, like there was no route yet made, so he decided to come back.</span> <span id="s515">A friend of his who is still alive in Israel today, who was the firsthand story to tell me how it happened, so he decided to come back.</span> <span id="s516">And he came back; I jumped up from my bed listening.</span> <span id="s517">It was something terrible to hear, you know, that he came back.</span> <span id="s518">I was wondering what it is.</span> <span id="s519">And he told me that it is impassable, the road, and he decided to come back.</span> <span id="s520">He was a hauset (ph), like I say, in a lot of Hasidic way, prejudiced about some of these here things.</span> <span id="s521">For instance, you don't go back the same way; if you forgot something in the house and you came out to get it, they wouldn't go back the same way.</span> <span id="s522">They got to go back the other way.</span> <span id="s523">So why do I say that?</span> <span id="s524">Because two of the passengers kept insinuating (sic), "Why don't we go back?"</span> <span id="s525">Instead of being the wall behind the sled, and if the horse stops, you help him.</span> <span id="s526">And some how or other, my father listened to their pleas and he decided to go back.</span> <span id="s527">So afterwards it happened when the horse got stuck, it did not have a whip on it or anything like that.</span> <span id="s528">He went over to the first tree, broke off a branch and came over and the horse wouldn't pull and he hit him, the horse, and the horse pulled up his left foot and hit him right in this part (point to his head) which actually, the way the doctor told me later, he busted an inside artery, you know, and he was bleeding internally.</span> <span id="s529">When he came back for the second time from the turn and he was already laying, crying, I immediately took him to the hospital with calling the doctor.</span> <span id="s530">And the doctor told me that it would be the best cure for him if we could get him to Slonum (ph) to a hospital because he'll need surgery; he's bleeding internally.</span> <span id="s531">He was a strong man, my father, that he could hold pain.</span> <span id="s532">And no matter how much effort by morning I tried, that the Red Army should take him with the ambulance to the other city.</span> <span id="s533">No matter how much influence I tried to use, and I did not have the influence to take him and within 24 hours, he was dead.</span> <span id="s534">So I had the second personal tragedy awaiting me after all this year that now my father remarried after my mother's.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">He remarried in 1938 and here we're talking about three years later, that we thought that it was a good thing it happened to us because the stepmother, she was very good to my younger brother and the others, and my sister, and the house began again to be in order.</span> <span id="s536">So we were very appreciative to it.</span> <span id="s537">And as I aforementioned, I, at the time, thought that I'm going to leave for the United States, and I couldn't.</span> <span id="s538">So know it looks like trouble followed trouble, one after the other.</span> <span id="s539">So this time, while we are there and we're doing all this here black marketing, my father is dead now.</span> <span id="s540">But the family's got to go on.</span> <span id="s541">His father was still alive and he was so proud of me that I can go and keep the family together.</span> <span id="s542">It looks like he couldn't die until I would be back.</span> <span id="s543">On his dying bed, he kept on talking, "Where's Harold?"</span> <span id="s544">And, it's when I came back, I used to travel by night and came that morning.</span> <span id="s545">My stepmother said to me, "You better hurry to see grandpa; he's in bad shape and he keeps asking."</span> <span id="s546">I came to his bed and he was hardly breathing but he recognized me, hugged me and within a few minutes, he was dead.</span> <span id="s547">We had a clinic across the street where my grandpa was living at that time, the Soviets, and I called the doctor.</span> <span id="s548">He was in right away and it was all over.</span> <span id="s549">So both of my grandparents were fond of me in many ways.</span> <span id="s550">Now, this grandfather from my mother's side had his love for me in another way.</span> <span id="s551">And with him, he was behaving well until one day, he wanted to go commit suicide.</span> <span id="s552">And suicide, by Jews, religious Jews, is a no-no.</span> <span id="s553">He couldn't take all that was going on.</span> <span id="s554">He couldn't take his life, his religion.</span> <span id="s555">So somebody stopped and they saw what he was doing, that he was trying to cut his arm and they started yelling and then my uncle got him back home and we started to calm him down.</span> <span id="s556">But, the man lost his and he couldn't go out.</span> <span id="s557">All of that took place until I was taken to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s558">The story starts like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: I just wanted to get a sense of time for clarification.</span> <span id="s560">This is, was, all of these episodes you're talking about prior to the ghetto being formed?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: What I said about my grandfather was prior to the ghetto being formed.</span> <span id="s562">My father's father, when he said he couldn't die until I was to his bed, now I'm talking about my other grandfather who also was fond of me and he, looks like, wanted to commit suicide by not being able to see life what had been ensuing in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s563">You follow me now?</span> <span id="s564">Because, in the ghetto, as I told you, my brother would risk his life and go out to get a little food to keep for them going.</span> <span id="s565">I had to go working and a few times then round ups were, by that time I already built a hide out in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Let me ask you a few questions about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s567">How did your brother get back and forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: As I say, he would steal his way out, as a kid, and you know, he was four years older than me and even the other kids.</span> <span id="s569">And if he would go sometimes with a line up of the people who were marched out to go to work, he would crawl in to there.</span> <span id="s570">And who these days, on the Jewish side, from the Univad (ph) cared that they saw another guy.</span> <span id="s571">They were not accountable that much, so he would go with us on that line and in the meanwhile, he would get lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Were the Univad and the Jewish police, were they --?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: In our ghetto, we did not have Jewish police.</span> <span id="s574">The Jewish police was in the bigger ghettoes like Warsaw, Vilna (ph), Veilostok (ph), large, you know.</span> <span id="s575">But in the smaller town there, we are talking about a city right now that prior to World War -- to the outbreak of the war probably, maybe, had 3,000 people in total population.</span> <span id="s576">So, you know, and then there was an influx of the refugees, you know, more like the way I said that we came.</span> <span id="s577">At the time when the ghetto was created, some Jews escaped from other ghettoes and they came in here.</span> <span id="s578">So, our ghetto, I would say from that city at that particular time, when we are talking about in the Rachen (ph) probably must have been maybe 2500 or 3,000 people of population in all.</span> <span id="s579">In the ghetto, there was no more than about a thousand to 1200 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Were the members of the Univad good to you?</span> <span id="s581">Were they good people?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: That's a bad question and you'll please forgive me for saying this.</span> <span id="s583">Serving in a Univad could never have been a good and bad question because when the Gestapo imposed that you have to deliver and they used to have to go from door to door and really knock on the table and say, "You are going to turn it over or we have to turn the house apart and you are going to have to give it if you have gold, or if you have money."</span> <span id="s584">You know, they were searching and doing partially before their scheme, and second of all, that was the only way you could do it in those days.</span> <span id="s585">It was not a matter that someone was going to go to their bank and take out, you know, what I mean, from the hiding and take out his gold or money.</span> <span id="s586">There was no such thing.</span> <span id="s587">Anything what anybody has, was told all the time in hiding, people would have buried some things that in case they're searched or anything like that.</span> <span id="s588">We had to go ahead to buy things from the local population or through them to satisfy the Germans.</span> <span id="s589">So we didn't have gold but there was money available to be gotten together, American dollars or whatever these people had it, so the means was that the Germans did not look for us to better ourselves.</span> <span id="s590">They would come at the worst, they can make how much more miserable in the ghetto could become.</span> <span id="s591">And this was part of the, as I used that word, the dehumanization program that it went out to suck, like to say sucking our blood.</span> <span id="s592">Picture when you cannot wear, the men cannot wear -- the fur that men used to wear was inside fur.</span> <span id="s593">I'm not talking about the people of old Mensk (ph), you know, but the average person.</span> <span id="s594">Used to take from a lamb skin this part if it was a healthy one, so he had it to the outside finished, you see, and so it was sewn in things and it was decorative and so on.</span> <span id="s595">But the poor guy had something else, a fur lining in there to keep him warm because that was a good item to keep away from the cold.</span> <span id="s596">Now you had to turn all of that in.</span> <span id="s597">So, what I did, I had a piece of fur in a car coat and I took that and sewed on a lining to cover it.</span> <span id="s598">Sure you tell me, Harold, what would happen if they would discover it?</span> <span id="s599">If they discovered me with it, I'm dead.</span> <span id="s600">I ran away to the forest with that thing.</span> <span id="s601">But, you have a risk to life.</span> <span id="s602">This is why I still say to this day, not only were we heroes in the forest, everyone in the ghetto, everyone in concentration camp who managed to survive, is a hero because that was exactly anti- what Hitler wanted.</span> <span id="s603">So no matter by what means, that one could prolong life and survive, that is the heroism that the people of our stature like myself.</span> <span id="s604">Sure, I am happy that I went to the forest and had the opportunity to lead a platoon and to go ahead and do diversionary work like burning bridges, downing railroads, as I get to it a little bit later.</span> <span id="s605">But every time I could, of not giving the enemy what they wanted out of me, I already was a hero at that time.</span> <span id="s606">And so, getting killed; sure.</span> <span id="s607">That's what the meaning was.</span> <span id="s608">That's what we were waiting for.</span> <span id="s609">And the people of sound sense knew about the time that we had.</span> <span id="s610">However, a lot of people in the ghettoes still believed that a miracle or something will happen and they will be able to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">But, those who are hoping for the survival to come, like this here, did not survive.</span> <span id="s612">Those who acted in no means or ways, we would have run away, did whatever they did, survived.</span> <span id="s613">No 100 percent, but a bigger percentage survived and that's what it was the case.</span> <span id="s614">So, as I was saying at that particular time, I, my little family was split and my brother was helping out.</span> <span id="s615">He was the helping hand there.</span> <span id="s616">And then one morning, which I had that chapter in my own manuscript, the 33 pages.</span> <span id="s617">And I called it my "Escape to the Forest" and I want to tell you in detail right now how that came about until I came to the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s619">I want you to tell me all that, but I just want to ask you a little bit more about the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Good.</span> <span id="s621">You go ahead.</span> <span id="s622">You're commanding me and I'm listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Within this ghetto, I know it wasn't a big place like Lojur (ph) and Warsaw.</span> <span id="s624">Was there any semblance of normal life, in terms of friendships or activities?</span> <span id="s625">I'm trying to get a sense of what it was like living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s627">The important thing, the life, for instance, picture yourself at a house, for instance, of European standard, at the area where I'm referring to.</span> <span id="s628">A house consisted of maybe two or three rooms.</span> <span id="s629">Now, these two or three rooms, if a family was living there with 3 or 4 kids, was not accommodating, as you know.</span> <span id="s630">Picture that same house now, putting in ten families.</span> <span id="s631">Now, you picture ten families, ten families cramped into a place like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Somebody's going to pick on someone.</span> <span id="s633">"How come you snore?"</span> <span id="s634">"How come you keep waking up in the middle of the night?"</span> <span id="s635">So therefore, when you say, when you use that word normal, that's a word impossible to refer to at that era because that's what the Nazis planned.</span> <span id="s636">Then you are going to be so cramped in, you're not going to be able to live with each other.</span> <span id="s637">And that's what they want.</span> <span id="s638">Therefore, you cannot unit; therefore you cannot do all these things like that.</span> <span id="s639">So, during the day men and women were out at work and it was not bad.</span> <span id="s640">But, at night, can you picture; it's like sardines in the cans.</span> <span id="s641">Kids, no kids, everything was together.</span> <span id="s642">There wasn't a question.</span> <span id="s643">Even if there was one kitchen, I mean one part, and if somebody could go ahead to boil some water.</span> <span id="s644">It was all tragedy; where do you get the wood to use to make, you know, the firewood.</span> <span id="s645">To have to prepare everything became a problem.</span> <span id="s646">And know, who's going to be first to use, if they had some things.</span> <span id="s647">If they had some food, they had to hide it because somebody will take it.</span> <span id="s648">They did not take it with a gun or a stick; they'll take it one way or the other.</span> <span id="s649">So all of this here, to use that word as I said before, the Univad; no, the Univad was not made to please the Jews.</span> <span id="s650">The Univad was a sign for the Germans to have a conduit between them and every dweller in them and they would put out the clothes, for instance they needed to have a count.</span> <span id="s651">Everyday they had to present a count.</span> <span id="s652">And when somebody died, to go ahead and take them for burial, again, that was all going through.</span> <span id="s653">There was one thing about it, they did keep good records, the Germans, and they knew.</span> <span id="s654">However we out smarted them.</span> <span id="s655">No ghetto ever had the amount of Jews in there.</span> <span id="s656">It always had less in their ways.</span> <span id="s657">So therefore, I'm coming to what I said.</span> <span id="s658">Food was the big problem to cause and why it was because we knew it from here and from the other.</span> <span id="s659">There are too many Jews in this so they have to kill.</span> <span id="s660">So when they killed out, just for the sake of talk, if a thousand people were, according to the accounting, was over there with the Nazis and they killed out 500, all of a sudden if you were to take a head count, really, you'd find out there was probably 700 to 800.</span> <span id="s661">So, how many to keep up the lease and how to keep that, was never a factual thing that everybody knew.</span> <span id="s662">But everyone looking around him could see from another ghetto that all of a sudden we had another few people that was not here.</span> <span id="s663">So, it was dog eat dog and everybody was not telling the truth to each other because you couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Everybody shivered; they were scared for their own head.</span> <span id="s665">You never knew when it was.</span> <span id="s666">And on the other hand, it's very hard for me to make a person understand how we did not become insane and all of us lose our senses, to kill ourselves off first.</span> <span id="s667">Do you follow me?</span> <span id="s668">When I came to New York in March of 1948 and I gathered with my wife to the family, until 2 o'clock in the morning when I told them.</span> <span id="s669">The question came, "So, how did you survive?"</span> <span id="s670">and, "Since it was so terrible, did you tell us a story or, we believe what you told us is true, so how did you survive?"</span> <span id="s671">And this is the miracle.</span> <span id="s672">If you believe in miracles, every survivor survived by way of a miracle.</span> <span id="s673">He was not that smart; he was not that schooled.</span> <span id="s674">He had plans and that helped him survive.</span> <span id="s675">If you have a more questions about the ghetto, I will gladly fill you in.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: You, so I think what you are saying is that you didn't resembled the Univad; they did what they had to do.</span> <span id="s677">Is that what you are telling me?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s679">I personally, I speak for myself in this case and I hope every person who I'm saying understood them.</span> <span id="s680">That's why we listened and we tried to do what they wanted us to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Another question, when we've changed take place, is were you able to practice your religion at all during the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: There was no such thing.</span> <span id="s683">I said it to you the story about my uncle.</span> <span id="s684">I did not get to tell you the rest of that, that by his demands, I took as we call a shatz (ph).</span> <span id="s685">A shatz is six of the, you know, the Homaj (ph), the Tomat (ph) and all of that, and he had all these books and I told you about the alta dufar (ph), he made me take a whole set which it was a Torrah and other religious things and I built it underneath the roof to make a double and put it in there.</span> <span id="s686">Again, as I aforementioned, would they find it what would they do?</span> <span id="s687">They would kill.</span> <span id="s688">But they'd kill anyways.</span> <span id="s689">But I pleased him to death.</span> <span id="s690">I liked him and I discussed with him some of the things.</span> <span id="s691">Like he would tell me at one time, and when I told you when I came there was killing.</span> <span id="s692">He said, "Look, you are a student," he said to me.</span> <span id="s693">"And you are a very good student.</span> <span id="s694">You remember what happened in Spain, that what they did to the Jews and all of that."</span> <span id="s695">He says, "God had an opportunity at that time to play with the Jews of Spain because they were devoted.</span> <span id="s696">He knew that they will not put him down.</span> <span id="s697">But can you imagine if the Jews of today were to give a choice, what would happen?"</span> <span id="s698">he said.</span> <span id="s699">"What would happen?"</span> <span id="s700">This is how much devotion he, my father, my grandfathers, all of these here people, there was no "ifs".</span> <span id="s701">There was, that is the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: I will have to come to you to tell you about my escape.</span> <span id="s705">This is how, we called it a selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s707">If you're going to get to that, that's fine.</span> <span id="s708">You mentioned something that I just wanted to ask you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Did we have that story part about hiding their religious things on the tape before?</span> <span id="s710">No.</span> <span id="s711">We didn't put it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Okay so, you were talking about your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: I often used to, after work, have discussions with my uncle, not about my wanting to, but by his making me talk.</span> <span id="s714">Maybe in his way, it was a means of keeping my moral going instead of down.</span> <span id="s715">And he would talk religious things.</span> <span id="s716">In one particular day that I vividly remembered, and we were working already that day about digging the big pit as I have aforementioned before.</span> <span id="s717">And I literally had seen on that particular day, some gross, inhumane ways of the way a policeman, because the way it used to be over there, there was maybe two Germans and maybe 10 or 12 from the police.</span> <span id="s718">That's the way it used to be.</span> <span id="s719">They used to use a couple of Germans and the local people who were drafted as policemen or so on, they were the ones.</span> <span id="s720">And, of course, they had the "life of Riley;" their family, nothing was done to their families but good things and all that they robbed from Jews were free for them to, for their families to have and to enjoy.</span> <span id="s721">So, that particular day, I had seen a if you occasions where the guy was bidding the guy at work for no other reason but just his blood-thirstiness was in him to show off to the German that he needs to be promoted because he is doing, really, the job that the Germans wanted.</span> <span id="s722">So, then he started beating on that particular person.</span> <span id="s723">It was at first, you know, the guy was starting to yell; the more the guy yelled, the harder the beating went on.</span> <span id="s724">So, if you could make sort of to yourself or a thing to remember; when they beat you, you perhaps don't cry so much, so they don't get the enjoyment, realizing how much you hurt.</span> <span id="s725">So, if you didn't cry at all, they beat you a lot; if you did cry a lot, they beat you a lot.</span> <span id="s726">So which way to choose?</span> <span id="s727">You had no way to choose.</span> <span id="s728">If you survived, you survived and if you didn't, you were left maybe to bleed to death or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s729">And then they would ask some Jews, to ask the Jews to go ahead to the burial place and the burial place could be anyplace, and put them in there, as a reward to them, they were shot and they would bring up.</span> <span id="s730">So sometimes it used to be going up.</span> <span id="s731">I remember times when they used to bring the big trucks in our area.</span> <span id="s732">In our area, they experimented a lot of things but few, if ever, were taken to the main concentration camps as we know, the Auschwitz, the Buchenvald (ph) or the other one.</span> <span id="s733">Of course, we found an uncle's brother first and he related that he was from Sladen, the city aforementioned, and he was taken among many more.</span> <span id="s734">So, I don't want to rule it out, so I say it the way it is.</span> <span id="s735">In our place, we did not know or any round ups that were made to that I them to concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Did you know about the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: We didn't.</span> <span id="s738">We didn't, in our area, until we did not get out of the forest, and we found out that Jews were remaining a life and they were in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s739">The important thing, when I use that word "dehumanization" was another part; lack of communication.</span> <span id="s740">The Jews could not get papers, the Jews could not hear anything.</span> <span id="s741">But every ghetto Univad would pay basically to send Gentiles to the Slovan (ph) ghetto or to the other ghetto to find out what's going on.</span> <span id="s742">What everybody wanted to do was to learn a lesson: how to survive.</span> <span id="s743">Unfortunately, they paid their way and the survival was not in place because what they did not ghetto in Slonya, not necessarily did they do in the ghetto in Jatel (ph) or in the Rachen or someplace else.</span> <span id="s744">They wanted always that surprise, that different way so Jews did not have an opportunity of surviving or resisting.</span> <span id="s745">They did it both ways.</span> <span id="s746">They used to get the round ups where all the population was driven out, even the Valde Univad was to the marketplace, and line up over there and it was the right, left, right, left idea.</span> <span id="s747">And one morning, that's what it was the case.</span> <span id="s748">And I usually knew one man in the Univad quite well because he happened to be a personal friend for many years from before the war of my father.</span> <span id="s749">He was a personal friend.</span> <span id="s750">So a lot of times when a round up used to happen, since he was in the Univad, I would go ahead to ask him whether the Univad has any knowledge what's going to take place.</span> <span id="s751">That round up, what it happens to be now, I've been denied before somehow or other the rumors; rumors were, all the time we were living with rumors, all the time.</span> <span id="s752">And the rumors one day happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: That's still I'm talking about in the ghetto like before.</span> <span id="s755">Year, approximately again, because I escaped in 1942.</span> <span id="s756">So we are dealing with the era within ' 41 and ' 42, May.</span> <span id="s757">See, that's the interim period, that's when I'm talking ghetto life, you know.</span> <span id="s758">Because I escaped at that particular time, about this time of year, more or less, which is April; that's when I escaped.</span> <span id="s759">It was like the spring of the year.</span> <span id="s760">We did not have calendars, believe me, to know exactly.</span> <span id="s761">So I went to him, Veinstock (ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s762">And he says to me, Harold, you don't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s763">Because, I, on a number of occasions, had my hiding place where I used to not show.</span> <span id="s764">And therefore I wanted to know at that time, too.</span> <span id="s765">My horse that I had, by that time was gone already.</span> <span id="s766">I did not have any horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s767">So, I did not, I couldn't go; I had to do the different kind of chores that I did before, so I wound up at that round up in the morning.</span> <span id="s768">That morning they all came out.</span> <span id="s769">Fritz was the name of the head from the ghetto, from the Gestapo by us, and he used to be a lover of horseback riding.</span> <span id="s770">And he came out with a big whip in his hands.</span> <span id="s771">The whip they didn't use for the horse, but that whip, that used to be his best way.</span> <span id="s772">That was a special love affair, it looks like for them, beating a person much more than shooting or killing them.</span> <span id="s773">They used to have their victims done so that they begged to be dead because that's how they used to.</span> <span id="s774">And we were made lines and in every line, there were police in the middle.</span> <span id="s775">So, I mean, you had a police line in this line, you had a police line, and we were the column together.</span> <span id="s776">So you couldn't move or you couldn't turn and at one times that's what we were told to do and we were searched, sort of displicably, to see.</span> <span id="s777">And at first they would say, "Anybody who has knives or any weapons to throw them out," you know.</span> <span id="s778">"If found, will be shot."</span> <span id="s779">We were, at that particular time, picked out approximately 350, give or take, or 400, all young people in most cases.</span> <span id="s780">Some middle aged people, too, the same way.</span> <span id="s781">When the selection, it used to be called selection, as it's known; when the selection ended, Fritz on his horse, some police and Germans on motorcycles formed a column on the side and we were told to run, who knows where?</span> <span id="s782">Before long, we knew we were running on the street that was leading to Slonov (ph) and of course, they were changing all the guys who were, for instance, keeping us and running alongside of us, were given a place to go into the trucks that were following and stuff like this, so they got in case we got worn out.</span> <span id="s783">And our guys from the running and beating each time, you would see a few guys were left on the side.</span> <span id="s784">Those who were left on the side were left.</span> <span id="s785">In other words, if some of them survived and could escape someplace is a question because behind were trucks and with the trucks, they could see and they had their machine guns tuned easily.</span> <span id="s786">So I don't know what happened because I was not there.</span> <span id="s787">What I saw, the way of the scenery went up, we were driven all the way to Slonum (ph).</span> <span id="s788">Slonum between the Rechen was approximately about give or take about 40 kilometers, and 40 kilometers, as I say, is less than 20 miles, but you just take and start running under the circumstances for the 20 miles and you just see what is left of that, you know.</span> <span id="s789">So, the majority I would say, if at all, we were left about 150 people.</span> <span id="s790">That would have been -- I did not count, so I don't want to put the finger, and it was given to me, but were driven into the jail in Slonov.</span> <span id="s791">In that jail we found people from other surrounding small towns around who were also, probably been through a similar situation.</span> <span id="s792">A Gestapo man came in in order to keep quiet and we shouldn't talk.</span> <span id="s793">That was the means, a shot was fired.</span> <span id="s794">"Ach tung (ph)," they yelled.</span> <span id="s795">And that's when the Commandant came in and he started instructions that you will be marching to work, and giving us all the stories.</span> <span id="s796">"Anyone of you who fails to do his job will be executed immediately at once."</span> <span id="s797">The next morning we were taken again, I was with a group so I don't know how many, but all the jail was empty.</span> <span id="s798">We were taken to the railroad.</span> <span id="s799">At the railroad beyond a reasonable doubt, we have seen a train, like it was partially of, maybe it was tipped over, you know, some of it.</span> <span id="s800">Later on, I knew what it was because I was already knowing that it was a de-railment caused by the partisans.</span> <span id="s801">It consisted of bombs, you know, whether they had the capsules in there, I don't know.</span> <span id="s802">I wasn't that kind of an expert to tell you, but they were all crated and we were asked to get all of this here back on the trains and load it up.</span> <span id="s803">And the yelling and beatings, the normal situation; that was the lexicon now.</span> <span id="s804">At night we were driven to jail again and we were given something to eat which it looked like soup and a slice of black bread.</span> <span id="s805">The soup was like a mixture of corn meal with water, not like this here, but as hungry as everybody was, they were ready to eat each other, you know what I'm saying?</span> <span id="s806">And the next morning when we got out of jail, a new assignment awaiting us, they drove us again on a road which the road was a connecting road between Slonov and a city called Lida.</span> <span id="s807">And on that road, near a small community town called Kovlofschezna (ph) and Puzavich (ph); it's a name you'll find on the maps.</span> <span id="s808">I have the maps with me at any time if you need it, with a lot more information than you think, such as how many escaped to the forest at times from ghettoes and the annihilation.</span> <span id="s809">So if you need any of that information, I have it yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">So, over there you were put in three barns.</span> <span id="s811">There were three barns only; there was an office and we saw a military kitchen.</span> <span id="s812">Otherwise, surrounding, it looked like everything was with barbed wire around, even if it was a labor camp.</span> <span id="s813">Immediately when we were lined up over there, I think there were maybe two Germans in all and it must have been Ukrainian and the other Russian police over there.</span> <span id="s814">They were supposed to be our watchers and so on.</span> <span id="s815">And after the line up, we were told that we were going to build a road.</span> <span id="s816">Actually, they started to build roads, you know, and that's what they did.</span> <span id="s817">And we were to be the -- and I don't have to tell you building roads, it's heavy work and here you were working with people who hardly got enough food to sustain themselves.</span> <span id="s818">So everyday there used to be casualties.</span> <span id="s819">So, I mean, I mention that really, before you ask me about it.</span> <span id="s820">There were casualties everyday.</span> <span id="s821">We thought, being shot, but just beating, beaten to death.</span> <span id="s822">One day it happened to me.</span> <span id="s823">I got a beating.</span> <span id="s824">I got a beating by the foreman, supposedly.</span> <span id="s825">He was a Pole and at one time when he talked to me and I'm realizing that he's Polish, I spoke to him in Polish and sort of, and he started beating on me.</span> <span id="s826">He says, "I have to do it.</span> <span id="s827">If I don't do it, I'll be beaten."</span> <span id="s828">Because his superiors, this is how the chain of command was.</span> <span id="s829">You are told that you have to so don't dare not to, because if not, you're going to get a beating.</span> <span id="s830">And, I was out.</span> <span id="s831">First out, he took water, you know the military buckets with water, poured over my head and revived me.</span> <span id="s832">And I came through, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s833">I thought, it's just like coming through from death.</span> <span id="s834">Understand, I didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s835">He says, "Look, I didn't want to do it what I did, but I had to do it."</span> <span id="s836">And I thanked him yet.</span> <span id="s837">I said, "Thank you."</span> <span id="s838">He revived me, he tossed me a piece of bread afterwards and that's how my day of work ended and we came back to the barn.</span> <span id="s839">So, when I say a barn to you, how do you picture a barn?</span> <span id="s840">As you see, a barn in Europe is built a little different than the barns in the United States because here they keep, which I've seen the way it is, but in that barn there were two like layers, wood and straw, so it was a top and I bottom.</span> <span id="s841">Nothing to cover yourself, heavens forbid, or, you know, now we talk about mattress.</span> <span id="s842">That's what I told you.</span> <span id="s843">It was lots.</span> <span id="s844">And all of a sudden, you say what's going to be the case?</span> <span id="s845">And before long, a delegation came from the ghettoes and they brought supplies.</span> <span id="s846">I had no one to send me supplies.</span> <span id="s847">I didn't have anybody.</span> <span id="s848">But I see and I found out, they paid off enough to let it happen.</span> <span id="s849">They got some soap, they got some thread, they got some salt, little things, you know what I mean like this here.</span> <span id="s850">I quickly got myself another friend, you know, you make association.</span> <span id="s851">I says, we got to survive.</span> <span id="s852">He was from the other side of the road from the small towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Your brother was not with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: No.</span> <span id="s855">No, my brother was left there yet.</span> <span id="s856">I'll tell you the story about my brother when it comes later.</span> <span id="s857">I decided we're going to go black marketeering under the eyes of them.</span> <span id="s858">Again, necessity is the mother of invention.</span> <span id="s859">I got, each of the barns were assigned to someone in charge.</span> <span id="s860">In other words, you are responsible that the orders are carried out.</span> <span id="s861">I took him to the side and I says, "Look, the people got here thread, they got here this.</span> <span id="s862">I and are willing to go ahead and go out by night.</span> <span id="s863">We'll get to the farmers and maybe we'll be able to bring some food."</span> <span id="s864">So, this here, you know, that's how you bartered sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">They give you this and you barter to bring maybe some old bread, old potatoes, or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s866">And it was risky again.</span> <span id="s867">They say, you risked your life.</span> <span id="s868">Of course.</span> <span id="s869">You could be killed.</span> <span id="s870">Of course.</span> <span id="s871">You knew that death is looming every move you make.</span> <span id="s872">No hiding.</span> <span id="s873">But it took determination, like I had, to lead on.</span> <span id="s874">Let's go.</span> <span id="s875">And on a few occasions, three times we did it.</span> <span id="s876">The third time was a longer time until we came back to base and that head of ours, the supervisor, says no more.</span> <span id="s877">He says, "I couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s878">I was worried stiff.</span> <span id="s879">Maybe they catch up with you and if they catch up with you, they'll come and they'll murder us all."</span> <span id="s880">He says, "Harold, that's it.</span> <span id="s881">You're not going anymore."</span> <span id="s882">Fine.</span> <span id="s883">Lucky for us, about two nights after that, the partisans came and they broke camp.</span> <span id="s884">And, of course, the Germans and the police ran away.</span> <span id="s885">They came dressed with white sheets like the Ku Klux Clans were; I didn't know it then, but I know it now.</span> <span id="s886">They wore robes, not with the thing on the top, but the bottom.</span> <span id="s887">Because the moon was shining at night and with a white sheet over, you cannot see objects and that was their camouflage.</span> <span id="s888">They had machine guns with them.</span> <span id="s889">The first time I saw like soldiers dressed in uniform, like it was from the Red Army, the way they left us.</span> <span id="s890">What is that?</span> <span id="s891">They told us we are partisans; we don't want that road to be built.</span> <span id="s892">You have two choices, either to be killed by the Germans or we'll kill you.</span> <span id="s893">We don't want that road to go through the forest and you are going to choose whichever way.</span> <span id="s894">Tomorrow you have a choice to break out.</span> <span id="s895">They're going to kill our families behind.</span> <span id="s896">We have told you.</span> <span id="s897">There was no compromise.</span> <span id="s898">I ran over and started talking.</span> <span id="s899">"I would like to join you."</span> <span id="s900">No, you can't join me now.</span> <span id="s901">I says, "Then what good is all your talk?"</span> <span id="s902">Okay.</span> <span id="s903">We decided, the mean the head of barn and all of it, next morning that we are not going anyplace.</span> <span id="s904">We are waiting here.</span> <span id="s905">That the Germans, mind you, how bad it was that we have to cooperate with the enemy instead of working against.</span> <span id="s906">The first thing everybody said, we'll wait over.</span> <span id="s907">If no police or commands had shown up, we'll decide what to do.</span> <span id="s908">After nobody the whole day came, all of a sudden, understand, you were afraid even to move about or to know what to do.</span> <span id="s909">So trained were we as it would be like robots.</span> <span id="s910">No one dared to say, hey, I am with you.</span> <span id="s911">And why?</span> <span id="s912">This is what I mean when I said the dehumanization program.</span> <span id="s913">That's how successful the Germans were, to instill that fear.</span> <span id="s914">That was the cooperation they got from us because of that fear.</span> <span id="s915">That looks like everybody knew he was going to die, or going to be killed.</span> <span id="s916">But it was sort of a own personal desire, maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow, you know.</span> <span id="s917">So you did not, you know, if you went the other way around, so you were dead; that's all.</span> <span id="s918">No big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Then when the partisans, like I say, so the next day they didn't come.</span> <span id="s920">The next day everyone went on their own and in small groups through the forest.</span> <span id="s921">We did not have a compass either.</span> <span id="s922">But we knew more or less the direction and the hope of the group that I was with were all from the Rachen.</span> <span id="s923">We said, hope, let us find partisans.</span> <span id="s924">We did not want to come back to that ghetto, but where do you go.</span> <span id="s925">You cannot start a partisan on your own; you have no weapons, you have nothing.</span> <span id="s926">I say at that time, we made groups of about 20, no more.</span> <span id="s927">Because, again, of self-preservation.</span> <span id="s928">If the police catch you, it will be 50, they'll kill 50.</span> <span id="s929">So, they would better kill 20 or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s930">And everything had to be thoughtful and organized.</span> <span id="s931">While on the way walking, when we came to parts where there were farmers, in the morning we saw the smoke coming out of the chimneys, you heard the noises from the livestock and so on, they would go in back some of the farmers responded favorably.</span> <span id="s932">They'd say, "Well, we just got through breakfast."</span> <span id="s933">You know what I mean and they would give us, otherwise would give us a bigger part of bread, you know, to take along or whatever they could.</span> <span id="s934">Other ones would lock the door.</span> <span id="s935">"You better get out of here before I'm going to kill you.</span> <span id="s936">The Germans find out that I helped you, they'll kill us."</span> <span id="s937">Other ones were overwhelmed with fear and didn't want to help us.</span> <span id="s938">And you couldn't afford to fight, you know.</span> <span id="s939">The fact remains on three days it took us marching like that until we came to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s940">We didn't meet a partisan.</span> <span id="s941">Nowhere, as we marched.</span> <span id="s942">We didn't realize where the partisans, sure by night you would have probably run into partisans.</span> <span id="s943">By night we stood in the forest and slept.</span> <span id="s944">After working all day, if somebody would get up near you, you probably couldn't hear it either.</span> <span id="s945">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s946">You were weak enough already.</span> <span id="s947">We made it to the ghetto, looks like the ghetto knew about it, the Univad, and there was sort of no punishment on us or anything like that.</span> <span id="s948">On the second day, a guy comes over to me.</span> <span id="s949">And I came back.</span> <span id="s950">I started to organize a group, guys that I knew from the ghetto, and I had 22 guys that are willing to escape with me to the forest.</span> <span id="s951">And I have gave them an order, already was in my mind a commander.</span> <span id="s952">I said, "Tonight, everybody says goodbye to their families.</span> <span id="s953">Not tomorrow, not maybe, but tonight."</span> <span id="s954">That included myself; I came home, got my people together.</span> <span id="s955">Not from my brothers and sister and uncle, because my grandpa was no longer alive.</span> <span id="s956">When I came back from that, my uncle told me that grandpa died.</span> <span id="s957">I still don't believe he died.</span> <span id="s958">What I mean is, I think he committed suicide, where he didn't want to tell me that.</span> <span id="s959">I went over and called him to the side and I said, "I'm deciding to leave, after I told you what had gone on with the partisans, maybe I'll get to join them."</span> <span id="s960">I said, "I cannot take my brother with.</span> <span id="s961">You need him here to help you."</span> <span id="s962">It was punishing me many years of my life of how I left my brother behind.</span> <span id="s963">I had no way out, taking him.</span> <span id="s964">This way I hoped he'll help the others.</span> <span id="s965">Then I said goodbye to him, to my uncle, which I wasn't ready yet.</span> <span id="s966">He had still an American $20 bill because they used to send it to my grandpa, money to him from the United States.</span> <span id="s967">He sewed it in my pants in case I'll have money for something.</span> <span id="s968">Then I came to the family of my father, my aunts, and uncle and I tell them.</span> <span id="s969">They all roused up.</span> <span id="s970">"Look, what would your father say?</span> <span id="s971">What would your mother say?</span> <span id="s972">What would this one say?</span> <span id="s973">Because of you, the Germans will kill us."</span> <span id="s974">And I was strong enough in my mind.</span> <span id="s975">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s976">You want me to die with you.</span> <span id="s977">Because of me, the Germans will not kill you.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">But that's what you wish.</span> <span id="s979">You might think that it's going to be better for you, that I'll die with you, but I have decided that if I die, I'll die alone.</span> <span id="s980">But I will fight not to die."</span> <span id="s981">And therefore, it started the fights and I left the house.</span> <span id="s982">And where did I come?</span> <span id="s983">I came into the synagogue.</span> <span id="s984">In the synagogue, people were living there, too; it was no more synagogue services.</span> <span id="s985">People were living on the floors and my uncle came after me, which it was, he was actually a first cousin to my father and he was married to my father's sister.</span> <span id="s986">That same uncle used that hiding place which I had built for myself and during the massacre, he and his younger son came to the forest and with cries and hugs, he says, "I wish we'd all listened to you."</span> <span id="s987">To make a long story short, after that it happened.</span> <span id="s988">I did not want to go back to the house there to be with them.</span> <span id="s989">I ran away to go to my next in command.</span> <span id="s990">He was with two sisters and a mother; no father.</span> <span id="s991">No sooner did I open up the door, his mother jumps on me, grabs me, "Tomorrow I'm turning you in to the Gestapo."</span> <span id="s992">I says, "What's wrong with you?</span> <span id="s993">I just came to tell Capel (ph) was his name, I just came to tell Capel that I resigned from the whole thing; we're not going."</span> <span id="s994">"Oh, that's good."</span> <span id="s995">And I left.</span> <span id="s996">Since nothing came out, a couple of days later when we were going to the line up of the Univad, a man walks over to me.</span> <span id="s997">His name was Schumel Bilinstein (ph).</span> <span id="s998">He survived; he's in Israel right now.</span> <span id="s999">Through him I got the book about Dr. Atlas.</span> <span id="s1000">It was published for him.</span> <span id="s1001">He wrote it in Polish and it was translated into Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1002">But it looks like there was no one to translate it into English.</span> <span id="s1003">You know, it's a lot involved and it's one chapter, you know.</span> <span id="s1004">If I ever could do it, get the rights if my book was published, I would probably incorporate it, but I still so far have doubts about it.</span> <span id="s1005">He says, "Harold, I want to speak to you.</span> <span id="s1006">I understand you are organizing a group to escape to the forest."</span> <span id="s1007">I was shivering just from the sound of what he was talking to me.</span> <span id="s1008">I said, "You must be mixing me up with somebody else.</span> <span id="s1009">You are crazy."</span> <span id="s1010">He hugged me; he says, "Please, Harold.</span> <span id="s1011">I know what I'm talking about.</span> <span id="s1012">I talk to you because I want to join you.</span> <span id="s1013">I can help you.</span> <span id="s1014">I've got with me a girl who was a nurse and she had helped amputate the part of the arm from a captain who is in the forest that we know.</span> <span id="s1015">So if you take us, we'll be of help to you.</span> <span id="s1016">I have one more guy who is from another ghetto, an escapee who wants to join us."</span> <span id="s1017">"Well," I said, "no."</span> <span id="s1018">I did not want to admit, but evaluating the facts of the nurse and so on, I said, "I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s1019">I've reached a decision.</span> <span id="s1020">Tomorrow at 6 o'clock, whoever shows at the fence as soon as night falls, we are going to escape.</span> <span id="s1021">Do you guys have weapons?"</span> <span id="s1022">He says no.</span> <span id="s1023">"I have a bayonet outside of the ghetto near that little river."</span> <span id="s1024">I says, "I know where it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">At least we'll have one weapon."</span> <span id="s1026">The next thing, I did not want to talk about it anymore; I was too much in pain.</span> <span id="s1027">I wouldn't go back home for that night, for that time that we came home from work.</span> <span id="s1028">The next day, I told my brother; I went over to him, the younger one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">That was my way of saying goodbye to him.</span> <span id="s1030">I says, "Take my car coat to the tailor."</span> <span id="s1031">We knew a tailor who also survived later in the massacre; Nvetsky (ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s1032">"Take it to him and he'll have to sew on something for me."</span> <span id="s1033">Really, that was just an excuse for me to sort of see him for the last time, which it was.</span> <span id="s1034">He did.</span> <span id="s1035">He took my car coat there.</span> <span id="s1036">I didn't go inside but my youngest sister or brother, I couldn't face them anymore.</span> <span id="s1037">As soon as he left the coat, I saw him from a distance; I saw the guys scatter because there's one thing I told him, when you come, do not come as a group.</span> <span id="s1038">You must come distantly seeing each other, not as a group.</span> <span id="s1039">And they listened.</span> <span id="s1040">As soon as I saw him, I ran in and I took the, no, I took the coat from him before he had gone into the house, from the tailor.</span> <span id="s1041">I says, "I must go someplace right now."</span> <span id="s1042">And I ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: We would know that no matter how much there is, when singled out, it never was in any catastrophe, or in any event what it happens.</span> <span id="s1046">If everybody could think positive, obviously, Hitler would never be able to succeed.</span> <span id="s1047">But because he could divide and conquer .</span> <span id="s1048">.</span> <span id="s1049">(empty space in the tape) .</span> <span id="s1050">.</span> <span id="s1051">to give all the time, about the fights.</span> <span id="s1052">And mind you, that town of the Rachen, as partisans we occupied later.</span> <span id="s1053">We held it for three weeks.</span> <span id="s1054">But, this little group of mine that we come to the forest, could not convince the commander to attack it before.</span> <span id="s1055">Later, after the massacre we attacked.</span> <span id="s1056">Okay, I know where I stopped right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Oh, you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: As I aforementioned, to relocate my story right now, my rest of the guys, two men and one young lady, were getting to the point where we are to meet.</span> <span id="s1061">I met with them and I said, "Now, it's a little bit too light yet.</span> <span id="s1062">I did not want anyone to see that we are going to have to dig our way out underneath the wires.</span> <span id="s1063">So we must wait until dusk comes, a little bit darker."</span> <span id="s1064">And I know people were not on the outside in those days, in other words.</span> <span id="s1065">But still and though for the if and I wanted to dig out my bayonet from underneath there for that.</span> <span id="s1066">So I waited until it turned a little bit darker and we started with our bare hands.</span> <span id="s1067">We did not have no shovel; with our bare hands to dig a path underneath because it was in the ground, that's on the other end, and it was the time of year when it wasn't frozen.</span> <span id="s1068">And we made a dig over there so that we were able to lift up the wire and one by one, we slid on the other side, pushed back the sand to demarcation, so it should not be a mark seen that someone was doing that.</span> <span id="s1069">And, we immediately went to the place where I said I had put my bayonet in there.</span> <span id="s1070">And I had a part of a piece of grass over there that I knew once I pulled it out, I wouldn't have to dig because I wanted to be on the ready with it.</span> <span id="s1071">I got my bayonet, put on my car "and everybody held whatever they had with them.</span> <span id="s1072">That's all we had, was coats.</span> <span id="s1073">We didn't have anything else.</span> <span id="s1074">And we started on our way.</span> <span id="s1075">I knew my directions and I therefore, at this time I'm explaining it to them.</span> <span id="s1076">I says, "Look straight ahead and you'll see from a distance the lights.</span> <span id="s1077">That's where the hospital is.</span> <span id="s1078">We cannot go this way straight because we may run up on police or Germans.</span> <span id="s1079">So, what we will have to do is go out of way until we cross the main road leading from Zulva (ph) to the Rachen to Slonya (ph).</span> <span id="s1080">That was the main artery road.</span> <span id="s1081">Once we crossed the road, we have to go to the other position.</span> <span id="s1082">So, I explained to them that that's going to be, and I explain to them that that's going to be, and I tell them, "We are not going to go like a column, but we're going to be spread out."</span> <span id="s1083">So, the four of us, in case someone sees, you know, should not be able with one shoot to do it.</span> <span id="s1084">So, we will keep distance, distant enough.</span> <span id="s1085">We will not talk loud at all.</span> <span id="s1086">If you have to say something to somebody, come over, make a marker to stop and we'll talk because we definitely do not want anyone to hear.</span> <span id="s1087">The language that we will talk will be Russian and, in part, we will talk Polish.</span> <span id="s1088">So, that if somebody should hear us, should hear any of the two languages; but definitely, by all needs, no Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1089">To camouflage our whereabouts and who we are.</span> <span id="s1090">We came, as I showed it to the road and we started to check and in the same spread out wing, we ran through the road.</span> <span id="s1091">It was not a big road.</span> <span id="s1092">We ran through the road, away from the road, inland, which it was like shrubs and so on.</span> <span id="s1093">And we turned, as I say, and I knew exactly the locations where it was going on by this particular time.</span> <span id="s1094">We had to turn a little bit forward ahead because we were getting to be closer to the place where in that forest, that little forest area, they were making a big dig which I said.</span> <span id="s1095">And be that it is at night, I still was afraid who knows whether police or Germans, you know what I mean, may not be in the vicinity on the other side.</span> <span id="s1096">So, everything was thought out by me and I outlined, I explained it to them, that's what it's going to be.</span> <span id="s1097">And after that, we have to cross another artery road which was leading into the Rachen and then with the fields alongside that other road, we would walk until it becomes forest.</span> <span id="s1098">Forested area, from that point of view that we were from the city of the Rachen would be about maybe 10 kilometers, here you're talking about five miles; that forest would start.</span> <span id="s1099">So it was a smaller forest area, where they used to have hay, you know, to cut hay.</span> <span id="s1100">And at certain times of the year, there used to be water, you know; it was not that you could sink in, but it used to be the water.</span> <span id="s1101">That's why they used to, some of them, have to store their hay on elevated things for the farmers so in the winter they could come back with sleds and get the hay for the feeding of their cattle and so on.</span> <span id="s1102">We did achieve that and I explained it to them: by good working through the night, we should achieve a target which it was called at that time, there was maleojaky (ph) and bulchenavitz (ph), the small lakes was called one settlement and the bigger lakes was the other settlement.</span> <span id="s1103">I knew that I had some Gentiles, farmers, over there that I dealt with, with the hope that may be they could help us out.</span> <span id="s1104">I also did not mention over here that in the winter, I was working with a fishermen's crew while in the ghetto and this crew purposely was sent to bring fresh fish for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1105">So, while we were working on the ice over there and wherever we were sleeping, they were given barns to sleep in, so I knew again.</span> <span id="s1106">So I tell them, I says, "Tonight, this was going to be for me to know that I'm on target.</span> <span id="s1107">I'll have to hear that much.</span> <span id="s1108">And, we'll have to go out to the road to see because there's signs, certain signs on the road.</span> <span id="s1109">So we planned in the little forest away from it, over there we will have to spend the day.</span> <span id="s1110">And that's what we were planning to be our march, which we were talking about give or take at that night to make no more than about 10 to 12 miles.</span> <span id="s1111">Because, remember, we cannot march.</span> <span id="s1112">We did not have our dinners and suppers and breakfasts before going, so we sort of gone, it was sort of carrying us, the will was doing it, not that physically we were built to be able to do it.</span> <span id="s1113">And as prescribed, we came to the same, I said the small pond.</span> <span id="s1114">There were more than one pond, so let's call it pond instead of, you know, water ponds.</span> <span id="s1115">And now by that particular time that we got that far, we were already seeing that daylight was coming.</span> <span id="s1116">And with daylight coming, we were fearful; we were fearful of anything.</span> <span id="s1117">We were fearful for the forest, we were fearful for the road.</span> <span id="s1118">So we decided to break and go into the forest, find a bushy place and one would stay awake while the other three would be asleep and we would sort of maneuver around.</span> <span id="s1119">So it was all planned out well and that's how it was done.</span> <span id="s1120">They realized in the morning, now, you will see the shepherds because the area used to bring out the cattle for the grass feeding and so on.</span> <span id="s1121">And at night, evening time, they were taken back.</span> <span id="s1122">So since we didn't eat all night and the walking, so we decided to send Heinka, was the girl's name, Heinka, that I said she was a nurse.</span> <span id="s1123">Somehow or other, a female could camouflage their way more as a farm girl or farmhand than we, as men.</span> <span id="s1124">And she was speaking good Polish or good Russian so we decided to send her out, to the closest chimney, so out to the edge of the forest and you could see the smoke coming through the chimney, so that means, they were over there.</span> <span id="s1125">So, we picked a singled out farmer, away from all the rest, and she went in there.</span> <span id="s1126">She said to them that she is looking for work and she mentioned settlements quite in the area where we were, going to hit; in other words, that she comes from Warla.</span> <span id="s1127">Warla was the name of, I don't know how to translate Warla, the meaning of it in English.</span> <span id="s1128">But, you know, when a chicken, where the food comes in over there on the little part, that's a Warla, for instance.</span> <span id="s1129">You know what I'm saying.</span> <span id="s1130">So, that's the pocket over there.</span> <span id="s1131">So, that was a name, also there was a Big Warla and the Small Warla.</span> <span id="s1132">So, she was saying that she comes from that.</span> <span id="s1133">And why Warla?</span> <span id="s1134">That was poor farming over there.</span> <span id="s1135">There was nothing but sands so the fields were so bare they could only grow red potatoes.</span> <span id="s1136">And the people from the settlements used to come to the forest to work to earn a living, or there was a place where they used to make turpentine and the other one.</span> <span id="s1137">So all of them used to, that was their means of making a living.</span> <span id="s1138">So she pretended, because often people from that would be looking for farm work.</span> <span id="s1139">And she came in to that woman, and told her that she was looking for work, and if they could use her.</span> <span id="s1140">And they told her, no, they can't.</span> <span id="s1141">She says, "Do you mind sharing some food with me?</span> <span id="s1142">I don't have any."</span> <span id="s1143">And the woman asked her to sit down and eat but she did not want to.</span> <span id="s1144">She says, "Give me some food."</span> <span id="s1145">And she brought, you know what I mean a piece of bread and everything like that.</span> <span id="s1146">Now, all four of us were sharing it and we decided to sort of sleep awake, awake and sleep; you know what I'm saying?</span> <span id="s1147">So we heard the shepherds coming nearby with their cattle and shepherds usually baked potatoes; that's the old time trick which shepherds would do.</span> <span id="s1148">They'd make them in the fire.</span> <span id="s1149">So we hoped that some potatoes is going to be left, which, again, if they cannot eat it, they're not taking them with.</span> <span id="s1150">You cannot re-bake it.</span> <span id="s1151">So, the same day after the shepherds left, we immediately went to follow these places to see and dig in and sure enough, we did find a few potatoes that were left over.</span> <span id="s1152">So there again, we had our food source for the day and that's what it was.</span> <span id="s1153">And we decided to march again.</span> <span id="s1154">So, to give you the perimeter, we would manage to be, assuming in our language, about two to five hundred yards away from the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Therefore, you saw the telephone poles as it was.</span> <span id="s1156">So he could go by that perimeter because once you got into the forest, you forget where north and south and east and west is, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1157">So, this sort of gave me like a compass-way, being in danger, when we heard any movement, either trucks or stuff like this here, we immediately retreated deeper into the forest and stay on guard, which it happened through the course of the night, that you would see some traffic going through.</span> <span id="s1158">And our hope was, maybe we'd encounter partisans so we can surrender to them and beg them for help.</span> <span id="s1159">To make it a little bit shorter was, it took us three weeks until I finally stumbled on to one farmer -- and here I want to explain something as a note, footnote.</span> <span id="s1160">After two weeks almost walking around and not achieving anything, that same Soneg Bornstein (ph), he used to be in large, before the war, a columnist writer to a Jewish/Polish paper, in large, that guy.</span> <span id="s1161">He says, "Harold."</span> <span id="s1162">He says, "I think we are losing track.</span> <span id="s1163">Look at it.</span> <span id="s1164">It's two weeks.</span> <span id="s1165">We haven't seen or heard one partisan."</span> <span id="s1166">So, I said to him, we used to call him Sonic (ph), at that time, like in Polish.</span> <span id="s1167">I says, "Sonic, so what do you want me to do?"</span> <span id="s1168">He says, "Why don't we take and make a vote whether we go forward or whether we go back."</span> <span id="s1169">I says, "You know, we were four of us.</span> <span id="s1170">If all three of you want to go back, you are welcome.</span> <span id="s1171">I am not going back.</span> <span id="s1172">If I have to be killed, I'll be killed here.</span> <span id="s1173">I'll go to achieve my goal, what I set forth to you."</span> <span id="s1174">So, they looked sort of at each other and says, "Well, we'll go with you."</span> <span id="s1175">I says, "Let it be clear; I will not stop.</span> <span id="s1176">I will not go back.</span> <span id="s1177">I feel as bad as it is."</span> <span id="s1178">Until finally, one, a few, I mean because right away that it happened; it happened quite a few days afterwards.</span> <span id="s1179">And I'm already by distance into the bigger forest area.</span> <span id="s1180">And over there, they had more like colonists, you know, one farm, maybe two, three farms; you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1181">But not a settlement anymore.</span> <span id="s1182">And the settlement, the last one, was Slechy Podraberska (ph); again it's a name that's on the map, mapped out.</span> <span id="s1183">And in front of that settlement was the river Shars (ph).</span> <span id="s1184">And on that river used to be, before the hostilities, it used to be a prom (ph) as we used to call it.</span> <span id="s1185">A prom is like a passage way, you know, that they lead it, that it's built like on barrels like this here.</span> <span id="s1186">So they come and they cross the cattle or trucks or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1187">And at that time, later on, the partisans destroyed it by the way, because we did not want to make it easy on the Germans to be able, if they go to the police, to go through.</span> <span id="s1188">We destroyed it and the Germans started to build a bridge that they wanted and after they built the bridge, we needed it too, so we let the bridge be there.</span> <span id="s1189">But that prom as we would call it, that passage way, we didn't like the idea.</span> <span id="s1190">Not we, I mean, the partisans in general, the command decided that they were going to destroy it.</span> <span id="s1191">So we come there and from distance I remember the house because I used to deal with them often.</span> <span id="s1192">The father was with one leg, and he was, and so I remember.</span> <span id="s1193">And his son was a blonde guy.</span> <span id="s1194">I recognized that I knew him.</span> <span id="s1195">As I come near, that dog is beginning to bark.</span> <span id="s1196">And the dog was on a chain, running around the farm.</span> <span id="s1197">That dog just was tearing my heart out, he wouldn't stop.</span> <span id="s1198">Before long, they're in back of me and I'm at the edge of the forest.</span> <span id="s1199">All of a sudden, I see a guy coming out without his shirt on, in pants, and I take a look.</span> <span id="s1200">He has tatoos on his hands.</span> <span id="s1201">With tatoos on his hands, it leaves me to believe immediately that he is Russian because local people did not have tatoos on their hand.</span> <span id="s1202">It wasn't, but the Russians, quite a number of them, especially a lot of them who used to serve in the Army or Navy for so many years and part of makeup, you find it a lot.</span> <span id="s1203">As I take a look and come closer, I see a gun.</span> <span id="s1204">It is in his pocket, hanging out.</span> <span id="s1205">I hope that you will believe me that when I tell you is exactly the way it happened.</span> <span id="s1206">I froze.</span> <span id="s1207">He pulled out the gun and he told me to stop, halt.</span> <span id="s1208">I halted.</span> <span id="s1209">And I say to him, I mentioned the farmer's name.</span> <span id="s1210">I say, "I want to see him."</span> <span id="s1211">And the son, after all of this here, seeing that the -- the guy's name is Misha Dubakof (ph).</span> <span id="s1212">He's a Soviet as I expected.</span> <span id="s1213">I came out and I recognized him, calling him by name.</span> <span id="s1214">He said right now to the Soviet guy, or I will call him to the easterners, is an easterner.</span> <span id="s1215">He says, "Put, Misha," he says, "put your gun in your pocket.</span> <span id="s1216">That's a friend.</span> <span id="s1217">I know who he is.</span> <span id="s1218">Let me go ahead and talk with him."</span> <span id="s1219">So I un-froze, sort of and I start going and I come in to him.</span> <span id="s1220">I shook hands with Misha first, and then with him.</span> <span id="s1221">And he starts asking me, "What are you going here?"</span> <span id="s1222">I says, "I'm looking to join the partisans."</span> <span id="s1223">I tell him the story already about it.</span> <span id="s1224">He says, "Tell them they are safe.</span> <span id="s1225">Let them come in here."</span> <span id="s1226">I start, they saw me and what had happened, they immediately run away further.</span> <span id="s1227">Now I have a hard time with my yelling and talking, bringing them back to me.</span> <span id="s1228">And I keep talking to them in Yiddish, basically to understand that if I talk Yiddish, I'm safe.</span> <span id="s1229">And I tell them, "We are all right.</span> <span id="s1230">Please come out here, all of you."</span> <span id="s1231">And they finally come out and we all go into the house.</span> <span id="s1232">I get that man from the house and I hug him and tell him, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1233">By that time, he asks me about my brother and this and that and the other.</span> <span id="s1234">I says, "I cannot tell you anything."</span> <span id="s1235">I says, "You know, I just escaped from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1236">It's been three weeks that I've been away from there.</span> <span id="s1237">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1238">Have you heard anything?"</span> <span id="s1239">He says, "No, nothing special had happened.</span> <span id="s1240">You usual."</span> <span id="s1241">Because this gentle people used to keep, were the ones who would keep tabs on the partisans in the same way, and they knew what had happened in the city.</span> <span id="s1242">So, at this particular time, he introduces me back to Misha Dubakof (ph), as he's the partisan.</span> <span id="s1243">I says, "I have one favor from you."</span> <span id="s1244">I did not mention it at first.</span> <span id="s1245">On my car coat, I removed the star I used to wear.</span> <span id="s1246">At one time we were wearing round things, yellow, and at one time we were wearing the star.</span> <span id="s1247">I did not remove that from the bottom, but I removed it from the top that it shouldn't be seen.</span> <span id="s1248">Be for what it's worth, .</span> <span id="s1249">I says, "Misha, do me a favor and have the honors.</span> <span id="s1250">I want you to cut this identity of mine.</span> <span id="s1251">You know, as I use the word the shameful thing of recognition.</span> <span id="s1252">And I says, "From now on, I won't need it anymore."</span> <span id="s1253">I says, "I hope I can become a partisan."</span> <span id="s1254">We are served to eat right now and for the first time we are seeing food?</span> <span id="s1255">And the farmer keeps talking to us, "You can eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Eat."</span> <span id="s1257">I says, "We've not had food in months and months so much, so we'll just eat a little bit."</span> <span id="s1258">And we thanked them, we did not know, crying, all of us, how to thank these people for what they did to us and he explained to us that a commander in charge of the local partisans will be here maybe in a few, not tonight, but maybe in a few days.</span> <span id="s1259">And Misha Dubakof (ph) therefore, is taking charge of us and he is going to go ahead and keep us comfort and covered until the, the name of the commander was Zotsof (ph).</span> <span id="s1260">Zotsof is rabbit, from a, like Mr. Rabbit; you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1261">Zitz (ph).</span> <span id="s1262">Zitzaf (ph) was like a tartar, if you know what I'm saying about a tartar.</span> <span id="s1263">You know, there is a nationality in Russian, the Tartars.</span> <span id="s1264">They are all short people and their skin is like with little holes and so on, not a smooth skin but like this here.</span> <span id="s1265">This man was a lieutenant in the Army.</span> <span id="s1266">He was left; he did not want to go to the prison of war camps.</span> <span id="s1267">And now I must tell you how the partisans got started with.</span> <span id="s1268">Like Misha Dubokof (ph), like Zitsof, many decided that they did not want to fall into the hands of the Germans and they remained in the forest with the retreating armies.</span> <span id="s1269">What they used to do, find farmers who needed help.</span> <span id="s1270">If maybe the son was drafted or killed or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1271">So, they would cork for their keep, only for room and board.</span> <span id="s1272">By day, they would help him and if the Germans would come, or the police would come to the area, they would be signaled by one another.</span> <span id="s1273">They kept on a tab and they would escape to the forest to hide themselves.</span> <span id="s1274">This is the way that the partisans really had started.</span> <span id="s1275">With the local people who had to run away because they were working with the former Communist government, and they knew that they must stay away, otherwise they would all be killed.</span> <span id="s1276">So in certain areas, some of local area turned in those people, to make good with the Germans; you follow me?</span> <span id="s1277">So, between the local left overs that were involved and between the retreating armies, those who didn't want to become prisoners of war, this is where they choose that life.</span> <span id="s1278">And later on, the Germans got hold of it because the Volasof's (ph) Army already was surrendering and they had all a new Army of Ukrainians who used to work for the Germans now and fill-in for whatever they need, in local or on the front line.</span> <span id="s1279">So the Germans permitted all the farmers who do need help, if they see a prisoner of war, because that's how they were able to get hold of the prisoners that were in hiding, that all they have to do is register them.</span> <span id="s1280">Once they're registered them, they can keep them as working.</span> <span id="s1281">A lot of them did register and then they went on the Germans side, joined the police force or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1282">Others were really killed; you know what I mean, by the Germans or sending them back to the camps.</span> <span id="s1283">But, I'm talking about those who succeeded in their mission to stay out, becoming POWs or working with the farmers and that's how the partisans started.</span> <span id="s1284">At that particular time, the partisans, I want to tell how the rest of it a little bit later, but I want to tell about us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">We had to wait a couple of nights until Zitsof (ph), as I'll use the name, Zitsof, which he was the commander.</span> <span id="s1286">And like I say, he still had the ammunition, leather jacket, and everything that he was wearing at the time when they retreated.</span> <span id="s1287">And he was a very nervous kind of guy, heavy smoker and drinker, just as much.</span> <span id="s1288">But he was a skillful shooter.</span> <span id="s1289">He could go ahead and 1, 2, 3, you know what I mean, and aim target and have it there.</span> <span id="s1290">And I had the pleasure of meeting him at that time and all of us, so he came in and one by one, we went for interviews with Zitsof.</span> <span id="s1291">And I told him that I was sort of the leader of the group.</span> <span id="s1292">I helped them out, told him about myself.</span> <span id="s1293">He says, "Tell me, what you're doing is good.</span> <span id="s1294">But, what do you think we have warehouses here with weapons?</span> <span id="s1295">I know you want to join.</span> <span id="s1296">We'll take you in.</span> <span id="s1297">Where are we going to get weapons for you?"</span> <span id="s1298">I says, "Where do you get weapons for the others?</span> <span id="s1299">Tell me and I'll get them."</span> <span id="s1300">"Well, you've got to go kill a policeman or German."</span> <span id="s1301">I says, "We are already.</span> <span id="s1302">Whenever you go to, that you are going to do these kind of ways, to set up an ambush, we volunteer."</span> <span id="s1303">He says, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1304">He okayed us, all four and we had a good few drinks with him together to prove it, our loyalty and everything like that.</span> <span id="s1305">And the day afterwards, we were taken to a semi-camp.</span> <span id="s1306">What was the camp?</span> <span id="s1307">A wooded area deep over there with big palm trees.</span> <span id="s1308">We used to spread out, you know what I mean, something underneath what they used to cover the horses with and that was your bed.</span> <span id="s1309">You did not have no pillows.</span> <span id="s1310">Your rifle was between your legs and that's how you were, you know, until you were, they used to have an Army, sort of, kitchen set up with a fork of the trees made, and buckets and that used to cook whatever we could get, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1311">Because we would have to go to farmers and wait for and ask, but this time we used to go with weapons and ask for food and we would get it.</span> <span id="s1312">So, we had the first taste that we joined.</span> <span id="s1313">The second news was that we were going to have a ambush in the next few days and all of us would go.</span> <span id="s1314">I was elected to climb up on the tree and be the observer.</span> <span id="s1315">So I was given field glasses.</span> <span id="s1316">All the other ones, there was a group altogether of about ten partisans and they heard the news that Germans and the police and Fritz, which I had mentioned his name before, who was the head of the Gestapo at this time.</span> <span id="s1317">On this particular ambush, we, all right, Fritz remain wounded but he, they took him back, you know what I mean to the Rachen, but this is to the Rachen ghetto at that particular time aware of partisans that was over there, but it didn't do much good.</span> <span id="s1318">There was no organization.</span> <span id="s1319">So we went on that ambush and succeeded.</span> <span id="s1320">And I ran to get, the first thing I got was a pistol and I got a gun from somebody else, I mean a rifle from somebody else.</span> <span id="s1321">And before long, as you know, all of us had weapons.</span> <span id="s1322">So, at least, but my job on the top of that tree was to signal to somebody at the bottom of how far and how many.</span> <span id="s1323">The policemen were riding on bicycles and Fritz was at that time on a carriage driving; that's how he used to drive.</span> <span id="s1324">You know, he had, sitting like a king.</span> <span id="s1325">You know what I mean, driving.</span> <span id="s1326">And there was a contingent of maybe 10 or 12, you know, call it, you know, that they wore over there.</span> <span id="s1327">And what do you think they used to do, come to the forests either to go ahead, take certain things that they wanted, food for themselves, you know, like ham and the other things.</span> <span id="s1328">The farmers always had it.</span> <span id="s1329">Or if not, they went to go to come to the farmers to have a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">That's where they used to come in the junkets like this here.</span> <span id="s1331">We attacked.</span> <span id="s1332">They started to retreat, but one of them got killed right away.</span> <span id="s1333">The other one injured, which we killed him anyways.</span> <span id="s1334">And Fritz escaped.</span> <span id="s1335">So this was my first participation as a partisan and I felt myself right now ten feet tall.</span> <span id="s1336">Here I got a pistol, got a rifle.</span> <span id="s1337">Later the pistol I gave away to Zotsof.</span> <span id="s1338">He didn't want it.</span> <span id="s1339">They didn't let you have a pistol right away.</span> <span id="s1340">So I had a rifle and I was full of joy, full of hope that now I'm doing something worthwhile.</span> <span id="s1341">Now the story of the fights and the partisans is a big story to tell which it would take.</span> <span id="s1342">I wish you would tell me how much further you want me to detail on it, or to go a little bit more.</span> <span id="s1343">So, you tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1345">Let's change the tape.</span> <span id="s1346">End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Had you ever had any experience using weapons, or using a gun before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Until I reached the forest, I never experienced using a weapon in my life.</span> <span id="s1350">And after the ambush, when I got that rifle, I asked later to be instructed of the usage of the rifle, and which I was shown how to clean it and how to use it.</span> <span id="s1351">And I still remember vividly the first time when I fired the first shot, which it was in the air.</span> <span id="s1352">But, holding the rifle the way I was instructed to hold, it gave me a bounce that I fell on the ground.</span> <span id="s1353">And the instructor at that time told me, "That's all right.</span> <span id="s1354">Don't get scared about it."</span> <span id="s1355">But, you will learn that you, I held it too strong to my body instead of a little bit aiming it and having the touch and feel.</span> <span id="s1356">So, that was really my first experience that day, in my life, where I went away to use a weapon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Was there any personal conflict with the concept of using a gun and killing someone?</span> <span id="s1358">A: In what way do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Well, I'm sure you weren't brought up to shoot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1361">The concept at home before the war was that killing was not a Jewish way.</span> <span id="s1362">The Jewish people did not hold guns, you know what I mean, like this here, like, in other words like joining, like a lot of people join the rifle club or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1363">In the Hasidic way of life, you could never encounter that.</span> <span id="s1364">I believed the news breaking about a Hasidic person holding a gun, that change came in Israel and it only came after World War II.</span> <span id="s1365">It only came after the Holocaust when finally, the people who cherished a religion became understanding that you must learn the art of weaponry.</span> <span id="s1366">Because basically, historic the Jews were warriors.</span> <span id="s1367">They had warriors or they could never have Samson, they can never have King David and they can never could have all the era of history.</span> <span id="s1368">But, the Diaspora (ph) was a different element what Jews lived in and weaponry was not the form for them to be.</span> <span id="s1369">They were afraid, they were guests in a country and they felt like it, that therefore they should not antagonize by it because the only kind known to me when Jews were practicing weaponry was in Europe, in Poland before the war, who belonged to Batar (ph).</span> <span id="s1370">But my family had no dealings with Batar.</span> <span id="s1371">My upbringing, I am a Batar person these days but I only switched, I only changed after the war.</span> <span id="s1372">But in those years, I was not.</span> <span id="s1373">So therefore on the Jewish scene, with the exception, not 100 percent, with the exception, weaponry or rifle clubs was not a Jewish life.</span> <span id="s1374">And it was not part of the Jewish way of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: So, it was very clear to you at this time that this was the way you were going to proceed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1377">And this is why the change in my life came later, just because of that perhaps, I say that.</span> <span id="s1378">And that's where the change came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: After this ambush, what happened.</span> <span id="s1380">Why don't you continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Well, after the ambush, now, we were in that camp, trying to join the rest and just to bring to understanding an average day of life in the underground, what did it start?</span> <span id="s1382">The underground was living in at that era of time, in bushy parts of the forest.</span> <span id="s1383">They used to see separately a company; in other words, you couldn't come into an area and you found a thousand partisans.</span> <span id="s1384">Perhaps to find a thousand partisans, which they were in the local, was probably in ten different spaces.</span> <span id="s1385">So we used to be living like in companies.</span> <span id="s1386">A company could consist of a maximum of 100, maybe not so close.</span> <span id="s1387">And then it had so many platoons.</span> <span id="s1388">At times used to have two platoons, at times we used to have three platoons, depending on the way it was.</span> <span id="s1389">And, I must mention here the commander's name; whatever his private name was, was the name of the company; like for instance, Zitsof (ph), which I joined with, the name of that company was Zitsof.</span> <span id="s1390">There was also Blatoz (ph), there was Fadyakomorov (ph), there were Lanskytrak (ph); there were a variety of more.</span> <span id="s1391">And all of that goes, didn't change until about 1943 when we used to be when we started getting para troopers who used to be dropped at a bigger force of Naliboky (ph) and then they used to make day away to our forests.</span> <span id="s1392">When the partisans were organized under the direct command of Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: What was your forest's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Leipachani (ph) forest is where I am dwelling at this time in the area that we were.</span> <span id="s1395">And I geographical area would be between one river named Chara (ph) and another river named Yemen (ph) and Yemen was the big river.</span> <span id="s1396">And literally located, it was between the vicinity of Slomun (ph), between the vicinity of Novogrudate (ph), and Lida (ph) and that was the perimeter in which we were located, which on the map it would be found.</span> <span id="s1397">Now, this is the way we started; as time went on, it diversified, it became bigger.</span> <span id="s1398">When the Germans would attack us, at times when we became too powerful, we again would have to breakup in smaller groups, operating in various areas.</span> <span id="s1399">The brigade used to assign areas of where which way we were.</span> <span id="s1400">Now, the other part, how did they achieve all of that?</span> <span id="s1401">They used to have like a parole or consult.</span> <span id="s1402">Every time, every night, or rather, every day for 24 hours, he used to be a parole name, maybe tonight, today, the next, Moscow.</span> <span id="s1403">So, the partisans would meet with partisans.</span> <span id="s1404">The base at Moscow, we knew that they were also partisans because we operated at night and you couldn't, a lot of times see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Who gave you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: Well, the staff which it was the general staff and the local area staff used to decide on all of these here things.</span> <span id="s1407">At first, when we were groups by itself, like Zitzof (ph) groups and the other, I remember we used to do it by whistles.</span> <span id="s1408">And I would, we used to do three whistles as a response, two whistles as a question, you know.</span> <span id="s1409">So it went on from time to time more modern it came when we were more organized, when the content was.</span> <span id="s1410">When each company used to have a radio man, the whole tune and everything else changed.</span> <span id="s1411">But that didn't take place until about mid 1943 when we were equipped with our radio man and immediately we could have the direct contact with the staff, let's say, from the brigade or the brigade could get immediately in touch with Moscow.</span> <span id="s1412">For instance, at one time through 1943, when the front lines began turning the other way, that the Germans were starting on the retreat.</span> <span id="s1413">Stalin gave an order and he talk about the partisans, but the greatest help to the war was through the partisans because we kept the Germans busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">The more Germans we kept detained in garrisons towards the forest, the more we kept for them towards the cities because they couldn't depend on the local themselves.</span> <span id="s1415">The last man power, they were able to send to the front lines.</span> <span id="s1416">The more mines we used to explode to stop, even if it meant stopping the trains, going in a certain direction to the front lines for one day, one day's supplies means a big deal to the front lines.</span> <span id="s1417">So it came up on order at one time which it was coded "rail".</span> <span id="s1418">That was the code name, "rail".</span> <span id="s1419">On this night there was a direct order from Stalin that under all circumstances, wherever this is a partisan between the Soviet Union to the farthest line of the front or behind.</span> <span id="s1420">On this night, every partisan must contribute to destroy as part of the rail.</span> <span id="s1421">In many areas we were sending in small groups to make the damage bigger and in other areas, it was an order that we had to fight our way because the Germans began already to watch the railroads.</span> <span id="s1422">Which again, and in the meanwhile, we gave them additional people to use for watching the railroads.</span> <span id="s1423">So they started instilling a system which it was like electrical wire but it was not the wire electrically, it was like through bells.</span> <span id="s1424">Then we would come to the railroad, we would stumble on something and that would sound off a sound.</span> <span id="s1425">So at times we would not even know.</span> <span id="s1426">At another times, they would go ahead and put mines alongside for the infantry mines so once we would come to the railroad, therefore we could be killed or that would send off a signal and save a mine from coming.</span> <span id="s1427">They had to include the locomotives to detect.</span> <span id="s1428">So we involved in one way or the other much grief and problems for the Germans through that.</span> <span id="s1429">So Stalin gave therefore that order that the rails on this night and on that night, that's why it was.</span> <span id="s1430">We, through power of attack, which were otherwise, everyone of us was given a piece, it looked like a white piece, they used to call it in Russian, "towel (ph)" , that's the plastic explosives as we call them of today.</span> <span id="s1431">It was an oblong piece like a piece; it had one piece like to put in the capsule and these capsules were various.</span> <span id="s1432">They were capsules where you could go ahead to detonate them, it would draw a line from a distance so much away and as you pulled it, it triggered it off and you would explode it.</span> <span id="s1433">Other times we used more; we used to make this together in bigger amounts and put them out underneath there and wait.</span> <span id="s1434">We used to do it in places where it curves, on a big curve.</span> <span id="s1435">And on a big curve, everybody knows the train slows down.</span> <span id="s1436">So before it goes into the curve, once past the locomotive, we always wanted to hit the locomotive when we used to make an explosion because if the locomotive explodes, no matter how much damage you didn't do to the rest, but this here causes so many trains passing that to de-rail.</span> <span id="s1437">So it was all strategy involved.</span> <span id="s1438">They used to sometimes put in a wire into the ring and that wire we used to put right near the rail so as the locomotive would travel, it would trigger either by weight or it would trigger to touch, this here part of the wire, and the explosion would occur.</span> <span id="s1439">We used to retreat to quite a distance, so, but the distance far enough that we would hear it, sometimes.</span> <span id="s1440">On other occasions, it happened, your mine did not explode because it was a faulty capsule.</span> <span id="s1441">We did not have the equipment all the time.</span> <span id="s1442">So before we had this fancy explosives, because when we were in touch with Moscow, they dropped by air all of this kind of things in the forest and it used to be distributed to the other partisan organizations.</span> <span id="s1443">Before that, what we used to do, so many, as I aforementioned, the soldiers who knew ammunition and every company has at least a few guys who knew ammunition.</span> <span id="s1444">They used to take, for instance, the shells from the artillery shells.</span> <span id="s1445">The artillery shells basically melt them out into a box or square or whatever it is and we would now how much explosives, put in just one of these here capsules to this place, wire it, and you take this here and that served as an explosive.</span> <span id="s1446">At times, while the capsule was there, in the artillery shell, we would mend it to be able to form, to make a capsule.</span> <span id="s1447">There were specialists.</span> <span id="s1448">I, only have seen it, worked with it, I couldn't tell you, I can only tell you of one incident that one time that we were on the rail and we were on a very special mission, as Poles, sort of, going and on the way when we reached our mission and we turned back to go way, as partisans, and we had to demolish a few bridges and lines.</span> <span id="s1449">And at one place near the railroad, I was wearing a long coat and all of us had enough to drink before.</span> <span id="s1450">And I remember seeing that wire almost, if that wire had been a little bit more touching it, we all would have gone to hell.</span> <span id="s1451">But again, drinking was a part of the insecurity that one lived.</span> <span id="s1452">So, in the partisans, it used to be a slogan, vethum (ph) "let's have a drink".</span> <span id="s1453">Swabota (ph).</span> <span id="s1454">Now there is glory, today there is victory, so we got to take a drink.</span> <span id="s1455">Then we had another way that we were sad because we had, we suffered losses, we were ambushed or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1456">So, of course you have to, so one way or the other.</span> <span id="s1457">Moonshine, we did not have regular vodka, moonshine was part of the diet that I would say 99 percent of the partisans used to be involved.</span> <span id="s1458">And you couldn't help it, you lived at a time that the next minute, you could be dead.</span> <span id="s1459">You were not responsible for yourself, so that was part of the irresponsible that it was going on.</span> <span id="s1460">However, I think the Russian Army still is involved in a lot of drinking.</span> <span id="s1461">I don't say that the American Army isn't, but I'm sure it's more visible as the way the Russians were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: You're talking about drinking and getting drunk, or drinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: That's the true answer, both ways.</span> <span id="s1464">One time, you drink for everything, celebrating, and you drink so much that you got drunk.</span> <span id="s1465">On the other hand, you came into a place that you became drunk by not being able to handle that, you know what I'm saying?</span> <span id="s1466">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Did the drinking help seal the comraderie between the Jewish and the Soviet soldiers?</span> <span id="s1468">A: Well, the comraderie or vice versa was no contribution to the drinking.</span> <span id="s1469">It was basically, we must understand that these people had lived in a poisonous area before they came to the forest.</span> <span id="s1470">The poison that Germany or the anyway Nazis did through all kinds of propaganda, somehow or the other penetrated to them.</span> <span id="s1471">And a lot of time, it was a cause why so many joined to become anti-Semites was not directly but it was just, became a part at first like in a joking way.</span> <span id="s1472">For instance, I remember when we got the paratroopers to us and at one time jokes started to penetrate and go around about Jews.</span> <span id="s1473">And the first time I ever heard the expression with the long "r" instead of abram (ph), you know, the different way.</span> <span id="s1474">Because a lot of Jewish people pronounced it that way.</span> <span id="s1475">And like one of the jokes, for instance, we were telling was, if fight, let us fight, but send me on the last wagon.</span> <span id="s1476">This is only to tell you that they existed and though existed in a more way than that.</span> <span id="s1477">And the biggest problem was, when we knew that this were, that the paratroopers came and trained in Moscow.</span> <span id="s1478">This is why it would irritate one to realize that the poison was not planted down here, but the poison was already planted in Moscow or other there.</span> <span id="s1479">We did not know at the time of the atrocities that Stalin did and the killing of Jewish people, that it went on at that time.</span> <span id="s1480">We didn't, this type of communications we didn't.</span> <span id="s1481">But we did know that many in the rank, of high rank, Captain Lavida (ph), for instance, in our area, in our forest, and he had, he's, the man was sent down for one thing, political.</span> <span id="s1482">He started printing a paper and that paper was distributed in the local area and so was it distributed to the partisans at the same time.</span> <span id="s1483">As I mentioned, the politicalization of the Russians began to come back to us in the year of 1943.</span> <span id="s1484">And we had to listen to a little bit more coaching and teaching.</span> <span id="s1485">While we were at war, and we were not there, but we still, they had to bring us in.</span> <span id="s1486">So all these changes, changing of the name, changing in command, different things, while some of them were positive, there was a lot of negative.</span> <span id="s1487">And at that particular time, one could not go ahead sort of, in a way, feel out as we were so mistreated by the outside world and so many anti-Semites were around, that it was sort of small wonder, that somebody else is joining the same.</span> <span id="s1488">As it looked like, the whole world was against us.</span> <span id="s1489">And that's the feeling that we all had.</span> <span id="s1490">So, it used to be at times, when we were done, meaning the partisans in general, the Jews would not be all to themselves because basically, when they came to the forest, a lot of the Jews came in a group.</span> <span id="s1491">For instance, in our area, we had Dr. Atlas.</span> <span id="s1492">In our area we also had the Alonzos (ph) which comes from my wife's area, you know, from Jetel (ph) or Jachoviz (ph), whichever way you want to call it.</span> <span id="s1493">There were groups, 100 percent Jews that they escaped the ghetto and the massacre and they came then.</span> <span id="s1494">So the commander, for instance, like Dr. Atlas was there.</span> <span id="s1495">And he was the one who was practicing doctor, but the man went to battle.</span> <span id="s1496">And he gave his life in battle.</span> <span id="s1497">But his group was called the Dr. Atlas group.</span> <span id="s1498">Later after he passes on, this group changes its name and we get an escapee from the POWs by the name of Sherbin (ph).</span> <span id="s1499">Sherbin was a very beautiful commander, at that time when he took it over.</span> <span id="s1500">But, after he took it over, they did not let it be anymore the whole 100 percent Jewish, they incorporated other partisans.</span> <span id="s1501">So the change went on like integration.</span> <span id="s1502">Yes and no.</span> <span id="s1503">When the times were good, they didn't want to separate Jewish groups.</span> <span id="s1504">When the times were bad, so even the Abramofs (ph).</span> <span id="s1505">You know, it was at one time the commander at that time was Abramof.</span> <span id="s1506">In Abramof's group, there were 80 percent Jews and 20 percent non-Jews, and the mistreatment was clearly.</span> <span id="s1507">In other words, what kind of a word was sent home?</span> <span id="s1508">And, you know, when, in these kind of cases, he was not Jewish, Abramof, you know; or even if he was, he was not telling about it.</span> <span id="s1509">And anti-Semitism was a clear venture to see in the everyday affair.</span> <span id="s1510">And I want, for instance, right now to dwell one day life as a partisan.</span> <span id="s1511">We used to have a wake up time, but now with the Army, somebody was blowing the coronet or whatever it is, but it used to be a wake up time that we had to get up.</span> <span id="s1512">And then we used to have to get up and there was a briefing time.</span> <span id="s1513">That took place already where we were under the direction.</span> <span id="s1514">The company was called to order.</span> <span id="s1515">The commander was coming out and tell the details for the day, whatever we had, each company has to do.</span> <span id="s1516">Maybe this one is going for an ambush, the other one is going for provisions, the other one is going someplace else.</span> <span id="s1517">So, you were called to order and after that, you had breakfast.</span> <span id="s1518">Our breakfast was, in that part of the world, you don't have a breakfast like in the USA.</span> <span id="s1519">The breakfast could have consisted of good meats or something, maybe pasta mixed into it.</span> <span id="s1520">It was a soup and meat combination, one way or the other.</span> <span id="s1521">And it was on a, built like a bonfire and in the middle of it a bucket.</span> <span id="s1522">And, so, if you had at times a Ukrainian being the chef or sort of, the cook, we ate a lot of Ukrainian-style meals.</span> <span id="s1523">And if we had that it wasn't a Ukrainian, so we had another style.</span> <span id="s1524">But the same thing that I'm bringing out, after you had your bite, then you had, there was an order everyday, cleaning the weapons.</span> <span id="s1525">And it was not easy to keep the weapons clean as you would, you know, as if you would be outside of the forest.</span> <span id="s1526">You had to go ahead at times, your platoon commander would have to go ahead and check whether the weapons were cleaned.</span> <span id="s1527">Then, you used to sometimes go ahead, you had recruits or whatever it is that just came in.</span> <span id="s1528">We did not know how to handle mines.</span> <span id="s1529">I remember taking my platoon at one time to a lake.</span> <span id="s1530">When you detonate a hand grenade into a lake, there is no sound.</span> <span id="s1531">So we used to go ahead and teach them how you pull out the button and you hold on with your hands and throw it, because we used to have a German hand grenades; used to be with a handle, the Russians were without a handling.</span> <span id="s1532">They were like an egg with little schrapnels in it.</span> <span id="s1533">And we would go ahead.</span> <span id="s1534">And then we had fish afterwards, because from the explosion of that, the fish come up, surface at the top, you know what I'm saying?</span> <span id="s1535">So, we couldn't go ahead, for instance, to train a machine gunner how to shoot, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1536">Only by explaining it.</span> <span id="s1537">Because it would have been, first of all, a waste of bullets which you could not afford to waste and second, it would be a give-away of the location.</span> <span id="s1538">So, there were a lot of things under consideration.</span> <span id="s1539">But, yes, the guards; every camp that we set up used to have certain guard posts.</span> <span id="s1540">And the platoon commander used to have to assign from his platoon who goes where.</span> <span id="s1541">Then there was choice for the platoon commanders.</span> <span id="s1542">Everyday was the man of the day; in other words, he was the commander of the day.</span> <span id="s1543">So, he could have been only a platoon commander but today you were in command.</span> <span id="s1544">So, actually, if we had to go fighting, you were instructing until the commander, the regular commander, would take over and you would go into battle.</span> <span id="s1545">So, the assignments were a regular routine, almost like Army life and we had to participate.</span> <span id="s1546">So, cleaning of the weapons; now, the attitude.</span> <span id="s1547">A lot of weapons, as we are talking now from between '42 and '43, the retreating armies left a lot weapons behind.</span> <span id="s1548">Some of the farmers took and hide some of the weapons.</span> <span id="s1549">We had trained enough Russian soldiers who were able to rebuilt weapons.</span> <span id="s1550">So, from three rifles, maybe we only rebuilt one because you couldn't, you needed a certain part here and another part there and they would skillfully do it together.</span> <span id="s1551">We would clean the bullets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">We did not have any other means but sand, but we'd sand.</span> <span id="s1553">They would have to clean and polish so we would have bullets.</span> <span id="s1554">A lot of it was retrieved from the rivers because while retreating, they put a lot in the rivers instead of leaving it for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1555">We pulled out of Pancer (ph), Pancer truck, from the river Shar, and my commander at that time, Pechulud (ph) which it was his name.</span> <span id="s1556">And he and other crew refurbished and rebuilt it from another one; from two of this year or maybe more of them, wound up to make the motor work and everything else.</span> <span id="s1557">And we used it at one time, on two occasions into battle, when we had to attack.</span> <span id="s1558">So, the same thing achieved to build up a Howitzer (ph), 122 millimeter, you know, where the sacks of the gun powder comes separately from the shell.</span> <span id="s1559">And again, we had to retrieve these here things from what we found.</span> <span id="s1560">The Germans had the farmers or the local area retrieve all the weapons.</span> <span id="s1561">At that time, they used to purposely clean it and at times, while their trucks would keep up these weapons, we would ambush and maybe take it from them.</span> <span id="s1562">It was a life of dog eat dog everyday, about obtaining.</span> <span id="s1563">In those years I'm talking with polishing the weapons and re-building, did not have command posts.</span> <span id="s1564">We did not have no orders from Moscow and to get ammunition was the only way to get it from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1565">So we used to attack a garrison, for instance, we were able to, we attacked it basically to obtain weapons.</span> <span id="s1566">We knew they were going to come back, but we got so many rifles, so many machine guns, so much of the bullets, and everything like that.</span> <span id="s1567">So, that's what the attack on the garrison served for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Now, another daily routine which it was, where we used to be sent out in various places, to cut telephone.</span> <span id="s1569">Military phones, you know, in those years, you couldn't have the walkie-talkies as we know today.</span> <span id="s1570">So, a telephone had to have telephone wire.</span> <span id="s1571">And the connection between one outpost to the other with wires.</span> <span id="s1572">And we literally would have to have groups of guys because to cut telephones, there would be enough to send a group of two, three guys; one at that stay watch and two to do the work, cutting it down.</span> <span id="s1573">We used to sometimes utilize civilians.</span> <span id="s1574">We would come into a place, take some civilians, make them be the laborers.</span> <span id="s1575">So the three guys, they went away and got three more farmers so each one of us could do certain jobs that much faster.</span> <span id="s1576">Some of the farmers did it out of cooperation with us; some of the farmers did it under the gun; we made them do it.</span> <span id="s1577">But, this was a regular routine of cutting telephones, at times burning bridges.</span> <span id="s1578">The bridges leading to the forested area, we always wanted it not to be around, because we did not want to have it easy on the Germans to come in with their Penser (ph) trucks or to come in with their light tanks, or whatever it is to go to the forest.</span> <span id="s1579">So at times they would go ahead and lay a pentun (ph) or something and come.</span> <span id="s1580">But all of this here were efforts that gave us more time either to organize, either to retreat.</span> <span id="s1581">If we knew that a big Army was coming, it was no use to set up battle against them.</span> <span id="s1582">But, to send up explosive areas, to do damage, to make them believe that who knows is behind or to have a big armies to go, that's what we achieved to do.</span> <span id="s1583">And if I was to say to you and tell you, battle by battle, I have that recorded.</span> <span id="s1584">But, it would take me too much to name you the way it was organized.</span> <span id="s1585">I can tell you one battle in particular points which it was, which is of trying to tell you because we had girls and boys as well in our fighting.</span> <span id="s1586">And I'm talking about, not that I'm trying to change the subject; I'm talking about Jewish girls and boys who were not skilled in being shooters or killers, but they had to turn to the savagery of the times because that was the only way for us to survive.</span> <span id="s1587">One, for instance, that I left behind after I escaped, Rusha Batskin (ph) was her name, and we were, she was in part of what I said to begin with, Dr. Atlas group, and later under Shuben (ph).</span> <span id="s1588">She was Shuben's girlfriend, for instance; even love went on in the forest and babies were born in the forest, or they were killed, and abortions were going on in the forest.</span> <span id="s1589">We had a clinic, sort of for a hospital, in hiding.</span> <span id="s1590">It was very well sealed.</span> <span id="s1591">The Germans in our area never got to the hospital; now, that's how it was sealed through little walk-ways to go in, in a place were they couldn't come, they couldn't come over it with heavy trucks or anything like this here.</span> <span id="s1592">So, we were organized at that time knowing that the Germans are trying to come to the area to collect wheat.</span> <span id="s1593">All the farmers -- do we have enough time to go on?</span> <span id="s1594">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: We have another minute or so left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1597">The Germans used to give to the farmers like tax, that they need from them so much wheat, so much butter, so much chickens, so much livestock and so on.</span> <span id="s1598">Each time, the news would be spread around to the farmers, we would get hold of the news and set up ambushes.</span> <span id="s1599">So, to give you an example, if we were to set up an ambush on them, and we wouldn't touch them while going to collect it, but after they made their collection, the farmers were to distribute it in this and that place and this place.</span> <span id="s1600">Then they would re-load it and start taking it to the cities.</span> <span id="s1601">So beforehand, the farmers used to bring it to the cities.</span> <span id="s1602">When the partisans became organized, no longer would we permit them to take it to the cities.</span> <span id="s1603">So, either we would get it from the farmer and give him a receipt, or we would make an ambush and when the halting is organized, kill all the Germans or the police, and then turn around, with all of these horses and buggies and wagons with whatever it is; livestock, if not livestock, it was wheat or oats, turn them around, bring them in the forested areas to the poor farmers because the forested areas, farmers were not well-to-do farmers.</span> <span id="s1604">But they allowed us to be there and give it to them.</span> <span id="s1605">It was taken from the rich to give it to the poor, as it said.</span> <span id="s1606">But in our case it was taking it from the Germans and giving it to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">End of Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: Also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Well, this is why I made my business to go ahead and write that manuscript some 35 years ago.</span> <span id="s1611">Believe me, it was the wrong time that I did it, because when I did it with my English of today, it would have been published probably ten times over and would have a movie done because all these fights and going on, you know, you've seen probably partisan movies, maybe like it went on in Yugoslavia with Marshall Tito.</span> <span id="s1612">He was the chief.</span> <span id="s1613">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1615">Hold on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: Due to the fact that the Germans were supposed to collect that contribution from the farmers of wheat, when it came to our command's knowledge, we set up an ambush.</span> <span id="s1617">We were trying to ambush the Germans at that particular time before.</span> <span id="s1618">While other ambushes were done after they would have already the collection made, this time we wanted to set them up that they should come and we wanted to really show them that we are a power in this forest.</span> <span id="s1619">On that road leading to the forest, between the city of the Rachen and another little town in the forest called Rudayaverska (ph), since it was, that area was Lipichani (ph) forest, were three, before you came to that river Shara (ph), there were three little bridges on our perimeter.</span> <span id="s1620">The little bridges were served from the farmers as drains from the fields of the water to go into the canals.</span> <span id="s1621">So they were of use to the farmers and that's why they were built, was drainage of the canal.</span> <span id="s1622">We decided that we were going to use explosives on it and burn them up.</span> <span id="s1623">So, the first bridge we decided which it was closer to the Rachen, that that bridge we will explode the first.</span> <span id="s1624">So, since our forest by way of espionage, found out and they had onlookers from the distance seeing what is coming in, so they were no Penser (ph) tanks, there were no Pensers or tanks or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1625">It was just that they were on horses and wagons and a truck, which it was carrying the police and the Germans.</span> <span id="s1626">So, we decided at that particular time to let a certain amount, since the police used to always be in the front; the Germans used to not be in the front, but the back.</span> <span id="s1627">So, the police we let through first to come in there and then we decided to blow the bridge.</span> <span id="s1628">When the explosion of the bridge was, was one truck got caught in the delay and it blew up because of the gasoline and so on.</span> <span id="s1629">Immediately they descended into both sides of the road, starting to shoot on each side and we saw their positions.</span> <span id="s1630">So once they started to shoot clear and they got up, we immediately started to shoot against them.</span> <span id="s1631">So, then they were in total confusion, because on this side of the road was shooting to them and on this side.</span> <span id="s1632">But the way we were placed in such a position that we should not, our fire shouldn't be shot against each other on the other side of the road.</span> <span id="s1633">But in this particular time, the way the Germans laid themselves out, it was almost sort of the way it was meant to be, that our fire would go against them and not against our own across.</span> <span id="s1634">So when we started shooting, when we started firing, all of a sudden, hands went up to the top.</span> <span id="s1635">Those big heroes, the Germans, as well as the police, no longer were tough guys and they started to plead and beg.</span> <span id="s1636">Ammunition on the side was collected and we started lining up.</span> <span id="s1637">Among the Germans over there, there were the Desunden Freur (ph).</span> <span id="s1638">On our side of the perimeter, I was at that time a machine gunner and I had a Russian type of machine gun with a round disc on the top and I was placed from place to place were to attack and where to shoot.</span> <span id="s1639">And before long I found out that we had a casualty of someone that I knew close, which was a girl, tall girl and a brave girl.</span> <span id="s1640">She always used to go to battle whenever her brothers.</span> <span id="s1641">She was with three brothers together and one of them used to be a machine gunner, used to, Anamoxinkas (ph), we used to call him.</span> <span id="s1642">Anamoxinkas is a water-cooled machine gun.</span> <span id="s1643">And her other brother, which it was the oldest one, became at that particular time the commander of the platoon, of the former Dr. Atlas's group.</span> <span id="s1644">And she was the casualty of the day.</span> <span id="s1645">She was shot from this, when I said the Germans started to shoot on this side, so she was a casualty and we just found it out.</span> <span id="s1646">As I go on the other side to clear, to look for Germans or police who were either wounded or whatever it is, I come and near me I see another girl from the Rachen, which she was also with us all the time, Rasha Baskin (ph) is her name.</span> <span id="s1647">I don't know her whereabouts today, because when I escaped the Soviet Union, she was, she remained behind and I have no contact with her.</span> <span id="s1648">But, she spotted, she says, "Look, Harold.</span> <span id="s1649">Look, Harold.</span> <span id="s1650">Here's the Zundenfuer (ph)."</span> <span id="s1651">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">The Zundenfuer means that he was the head of the region from the Gestapo, and he was there.</span> <span id="s1653">And as we approached him, I approached him now with the machine gun, she had at that time a rifle only in her hand, and he says to her, "Don't."</span> <span id="s1654">And he starts pleading we shouldn't kill him, whereupon he pulls out a pocket from his pocket, photographs of the Rachen girls.</span> <span id="s1655">Whatever this man, either he was in love with them or had love affairs with them or what, we at that time did not know.</span> <span id="s1656">And neither did I want to listen, so I wanted to shoot.</span> <span id="s1657">She starts pleading with me, "Harold he is mine.</span> <span id="s1658">You're not going to kill him.</span> <span id="s1659">I am."</span> <span id="s1660">And she basically, with the rifle went and smashed his head to pieces, because after seeing the pictures of these girls, we know any SS guy or Gestapo who has pictures from girls which they used to do at practice, have sex with them, then taking pictures with them yet, understand.</span> <span id="s1661">All of them, you know what I mean, to put into sort of their collections.</span> <span id="s1662">Now, at one time, I must say, that I had to give a good reason and a good thanks to Rasha Baskin for killing a person.</span> <span id="s1663">And it was beyond my personal belief, in a way, but in battle you see the enemy and you don't see anything else.</span> <span id="s1664">And that's what it was.</span> <span id="s1665">And we moved on.</span> <span id="s1666">Of course, she says she's going to take his gun.</span> <span id="s1667">I let her take his gun because trophies; there was plenty of ammunition for everyone to pick up.</span> <span id="s1668">By that time, I had a German luger at that time that I took and I wanted to carry it, but at that time I turned it in to the command because what would I do for getting bullets for a German luger?</span> <span id="s1669">It was easy for us to get bullets from Russian-type guns than to get for Germans.</span> <span id="s1670">We used to get enough ammunition of theirs, but that was hard.</span> <span id="s1671">Now, after the first battle line was over, our command ordered us to go back to position, only changing position because we expected that this will not be the last battle.</span> <span id="s1672">So all of these killed, including the Zundenfeur (ph), the officer, our command ordered to go ahead, to strip their uniforms off of them and just naked and covering with a blanket, put them back on a horse and wagon and we took one of the farmers, send them to the city to turn in their corpses and give them a note, "Don't fight us, because that's the way you're going to see the rest of you come back."</span> <span id="s1673">It's true enough that we were there and the following day the commander decided that we should be on guard again because they probably will send in a second force.</span> <span id="s1674">And they did.</span> <span id="s1675">On the second force what they sent, that's why I could understand why they went to burn up the last bridge to us, but the first bridge to them.</span> <span id="s1676">And the other two, we mined at this time, one at a time.</span> <span id="s1677">They came with a light tank at this time and they came, again, Germans and they had the police which they were a makeup of Ukrainians and the other Russians and they started to do the same thing and we again let them cross that second bridge before the explosion was made.</span> <span id="s1678">The explosion got at this time, caught that small task that they had.</span> <span id="s1679">And it was done, you know, they couldn't have maneuvered; they would have to have heavy equipment to pull it out, which they came days afterwards to try to pull it out because of fear that the partisans may go ahead right now and re-build it.</span> <span id="s1680">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1681">They got espionage the same way as we did, to know what we were up to.</span> <span id="s1682">And again that was battle line number two.</span> <span id="s1683">We were still waiting and a couple of days later they sent a bigger force again and again at this time, we ensued battle and realizing the roar of the trucks that it came a big force.</span> <span id="s1684">Our command decided to retreat and we retreated to the forest.</span> <span id="s1685">Then they came in with a bigger force to the farmers at that time for the contingent what they had to get from them of the wheat, but at this time we could not control it.</span> <span id="s1686">But the mere fact was that in order for them to collect the taxed wheat or provisions from the farmers, no longer could be gotten from these areas without a fight.</span> <span id="s1687">So we achieved our purpose that we made this fight.</span> <span id="s1688">Before long a change in all of that had happened.</span> <span id="s1689">The Germans decided to build, as they called, a self-defense team.</span> <span id="s1690">And in each settlement, they were ordered to join on doing that.</span> <span id="s1691">They used to hang up a piece of rail or a bell and as soon as partisans would show in that vicinity, the bell or the rail piece would start making noise on the ring.</span> <span id="s1692">It would carry from one settlement to the other, until it would come to the garrison.</span> <span id="s1693">Then the police would have to come out, put some on ambush or come searching to catch the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Who did this?</span> <span id="s1695">The local people did it for the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1697">They did it for the Germans to alert them that partisans are out.</span> <span id="s1698">And in the meanwhile, they would send a force against us.</span> <span id="s1699">On three occasions, luck was with me, that I was struck on this type of ambushes.</span> <span id="s1700">And either my number wasn't up or my alertness was good, that I was able to get off the wagon, because we used to use wagons to come there.</span> <span id="s1701">And I shoved myself up, turned over on my belly, into the forest and three days later I showed up in camp, on each of these occasions.</span> <span id="s1702">I don't mean on that particular day; on each of these occasions, when I came, I was looked upon like I returned from death because they already had given up on me, because a number of us used to be killed.</span> <span id="s1703">And the command decided that no longer could that be tolerated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Otherwise, we would have to leave the area.</span> <span id="s1705">And leaving the area was not saying we'll move on elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1706">The elsewhere, if it works, it will work elsewhere the same way.</span> <span id="s1707">Our command decided on teaching a lesson and we had to do it the German way.</span> <span id="s1708">We took a farm area, the settlement was called Lansovicha (ph) and we surrounded it one morning with our troops.</span> <span id="s1709">There were a few hundred people in participation.</span> <span id="s1710">And the first thing, we waited for somebody to come and hitting the bell.</span> <span id="s1711">Somebody did come and as soon as he hit the bell, machine gun was fired and that man was dead and more people who started to run out of their houses, were dead.</span> <span id="s1712">They realized the casualties and all of them began all of a sudden to be alert.</span> <span id="s1713">We started a fire because their roofs were made out of straw and we had the special bullets, fire bullets, to start fire, on purposely to make a little panic.</span> <span id="s1714">While a certain group of ours were taking charge of the livestock, everybody tried to drive their livestock out because they were afraid it will burn up, you know.</span> <span id="s1715">So, while they were, the farmers were driving out, our people were taking over, lining them up and they were driven to the forest while our command decided to share this cattle among the poor farmers in the forest.</span> <span id="s1716">That was left to be a lesson that any settlement that will cooperate with the Germans and will alert our moves, whatever partisans in the area, can expect the same treatment as Lansovich (ph).</span> <span id="s1717">And that, after that, they didn't remove it, from there on, after that time that it happened, the farmers in the area understood that either, if you listen and do for the Germans, you'll get killed from the partisans.</span> <span id="s1718">And if you listen the other way, you'll get killed from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1719">So, therefore, they tried to play a little bit of a different game.</span> <span id="s1720">And it no longer was the success as the Germans anticipated it would.</span> <span id="s1721">The reason that Peklansavichy (ph) was because from that settlement, there were a number of guys serving in the police force in the Rachen.</span> <span id="s1722">And we had our contact man who our command could get all information needed, because we also had local people who were working on our side and they were actually against the Germans and what they were doing.</span> <span id="s1723">But, it had to be done in a hiding kind of way.</span> <span id="s1724">The story, after that what had happened with that battle, changed.</span> <span id="s1725">And really, here, at one time, we made almost like calling a massacre because quite a number of casualties.</span> <span id="s1726">The farmers would go out and start pleading, "Don't burn, don't burn up my farm," and this and that and the other.</span> <span id="s1727">And we knew the families that were there; the families of those policemen serving in the Rachen were all killed.</span> <span id="s1728">So, be that you want to call it savagery for the sake of liberation, but we had to bring it down, that's what the command said in order to go on and act.</span> <span id="s1729">However, we were more cautious.</span> <span id="s1730">We started to drive-in other areas away, even to do our ammunition work, we did not go in the same format.</span> <span id="s1731">We changed; we had to go further away from base in order to keep on doing.</span> <span id="s1732">For instance, to give you an example, Zelva (ph) was the main station and we started operating, going bad things around Zelva.</span> <span id="s1733">We would start crossing the Yemen on the other side, which it was the bigger forest.</span> <span id="s1734">And certain changes in our operation was.</span> <span id="s1735">However, all of that within a few months brought a big German Army who wanted to get even now with the partisans, realizing that.</span> <span id="s1736">And at that particular time, the fighting ensued for almost a week.</span> <span id="s1737">And we were surrounded for quite a big perimeter all the way around and afterwards our fight was not so much killing Germans as it was to work our way through a retreat, where we could go to a retreat in smaller groups through the bigger forest.</span> <span id="s1738">Which we did.</span> <span id="s1739">And in weeks later, in slow motion, with fewer people, we came back to the area but in other parts of the forest.</span> <span id="s1740">So, not to leave, we suffered a tremendous amount of casualties at that particular time.</span> <span id="s1741">And our reorganization was, I mean, the reorganization, speaking in the part of the Jewish partisans.</span> <span id="s1742">On that particular march, I was near Captain Bulat (ph) and he was the staff leader.</span> <span id="s1743">And he started the anti-Semitism, talking continually to me, and no matter how much defending I tried to do of the Jewish, it still was calling the Jewish all at once, he started to call them cowards.</span> <span id="s1744">I said, "How can you call them cowards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Look at Balat.</span> <span id="s1746">He kept all his guys, the Rachen boys, up in the front line.</span> <span id="s1747">A few of them died, got killed, and look how they held the Germans for a whole day in position, and the Germans could not come forward.</span> <span id="s1748">Do you call that cowardness?"</span> <span id="s1749">I says, "You and I, I was in front with a machine gun and you were a few hundred yards in back of me when you asked me to go into the settlement over there, to find out, to see if the German's are still there.</span> <span id="s1750">Did I back off?"</span> <span id="s1751">"No," he says.</span> <span id="s1752">"You were good; you were a brave guy.</span> <span id="s1753">I'm not talking about you."</span> <span id="s1754">I said, "Then, why are you pluralizing it?"</span> <span id="s1755">And after the talk all the time, the group of Atlas as we were to call them, as I have mentioned, the Dr. Atlas group, Lipsovich (ph) was the name of the commanding officer at the time, he come over to me, he says, "Harold, we were retreating.</span> <span id="s1756">We cannot go on with this here whole group because look at the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1757">Two Jewish girls were shot because they dropped their discs.</span> <span id="s1758">They were having the discs for the automatic weapons and while running and retreating, they dropped the discs, they shot the Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s1759">There was no way out others could do."</span> <span id="s1760">So, they pleaded with me; they said, "Harold, please come with us."</span> <span id="s1761">I says, "No.</span> <span id="s1762">I will not join you for one reason.</span> <span id="s1763">I do not want to make Captain Balot right.</span> <span id="s1764">I don't want for him to be able to pluralize it.</span> <span id="s1765">So, while all of you are going, I wish you luck and I hope to meet you when it's all over.</span> <span id="s1766">The next day after the Altas group left, Captain Balot got me again.</span> <span id="s1767">"Harold, you remember our conversation?</span> <span id="s1768">Look what happened to your cowards."</span> <span id="s1769">I says, "Why do you confront me with them?</span> <span id="s1770">I had nothing to do with them."</span> <span id="s1771">I says, "What happened to them?"</span> <span id="s1772">He says, "They all retreated."</span> <span id="s1773">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: Why don't you stop this. . . ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: The conversation ensued with all anti-Semitic flavor and he said, "They will be pushed once we go back to base."</span> <span id="s1776">Within a couple of days later, we decided to return.</span> <span id="s1777">So instead of going towards the forest, now we decided to return back to our bases.</span> <span id="s1778">On our way back, we realized of how many settlements were burned by the Germans through the local area, and we realized was a big thing it will be right now for us to operate in these areas.</span> <span id="s1779">And they decided to come back firstly, to where the Dr. Atlas group was usually taking place, although they were right nearby and we ran up on them.</span> <span id="s1780">No sooner we came there, the order was everybody stays in place.</span> <span id="s1781">I saw a friend of mine, Moses Agonik (ph), and he used to be a patrol guy who on the horse would always run forward for patrolling and finding out front line news.</span> <span id="s1782">And I was a smoker at that time, and a heavy smoker.</span> <span id="s1783">So badly, we used to take leaves and crush the tobacco and roll it in newspaper to smoke.</span> <span id="s1784">It's hard to relate to everybody whoever smokes what a horrendous feeling that gives you to substitute, but that's what we did.</span> <span id="s1785">I see Moses over there; I says, "Moe, can I get a cigarette from you?"</span> <span id="s1786">I stepped out of line.</span> <span id="s1787">No sooner that I stepped out of line, Buresbulat (ph) is there and Buresbulat starts acting up, now he wants to shoot me.</span> <span id="s1788">He wants to shoot me right on the place.</span> <span id="s1789">Now, being I'm among my good friends of commanders which I had Zeitsof (ph) who took me to the forest, Beshuti (ph), which it was another one; Misha Dubokof (ph), and third one, and a few more came over.</span> <span id="s1790">No, you're not going to shoot him; you're not going to kill him.</span> <span id="s1791">As they were my messiahs, in a way of speech.</span> <span id="s1792">And he didn't do it.</span> <span id="s1793">"Why did you step out of line?"</span> <span id="s1794">I says, "I didn't step out; just one foot, to get a cigarette from him."</span> <span id="s1795">"I said and I ordered, no one steps out of line, and you did."</span> <span id="s1796">Basically, I realized that it was no more, no less, but the anti-Semitism in here, that he continued talking with me about; that's what it was.</span> <span id="s1797">But I was on the watch at that time.</span> <span id="s1798">Before long, they started to order, they wanted to shoot two more of the Rachen girls, who they understand, dropped their discs and we had one guy who was a Rachen guy, Benjamin Denbrovsky (ph); he used to be like the hang man.</span> <span id="s1799">Any time somebody had to be executed, Benjamin used to be the one to be called.</span> <span id="s1800">So, now Bulot has given him the assignment to take these two girls and he should go after them and shoot them.</span> <span id="s1801">Well, an order is an order, so he went and the girls called and instead of him shooting them, he told them, "We are running.</span> <span id="s1802">I will not kill you.</span> <span id="s1803">Stay with me."</span> <span id="s1804">They all, at that particular time, ran.</span> <span id="s1805">When they did not hear any shots, they followed.</span> <span id="s1806">They killed the girls, but Ben, they couldn't get hold of.</span> <span id="s1807">He survived the war at , which it was a trap for Jews mainly, and that's where he survived.</span> <span id="s1808">Because for him, disobeying an order for not shooting, he would have been killed.</span> <span id="s1809">He survived the war about Bensky (ph) and I met with him after the war.</span> <span id="s1810">So, --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: Was there a lot of this justice system going on in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: Well, at that particular time, as I am about to tell you, the system still did not work officially under the Soviet bases, but it was just beginning to be.</span> <span id="s1813">But since that was the big fight and the big onslaught by the Germans going on over there and the casualties that we suffered and when it was going on.</span> <span id="s1814">Above all, what it got them worse is, they came and they found that what did the Atlas guys do, they were cooking a whole kitchen where they had the chickens.</span> <span id="s1815">And it was fine; you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1816">That was another part that Jews liked chicken.</span> <span id="s1817">That was another fallacy, you know, what I mean, for anti- Semitism.</span> <span id="s1818">Why did I have chickens?</span> <span id="s1819">Since I aforementioned that so many places were burned out, there were a lot of chickens flying around on the loose, with no one now to take care of.</span> <span id="s1820">So, they went away, cut the chickens, killed them and cooked them.</span> <span id="s1821">So, he did not even try.</span> <span id="s1822">Before long, Heir Libshovens (ph), the commander gave an order to his men.</span> <span id="s1823">He saw what was going on and he saw the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1824">They surrendered to our group.</span> <span id="s1825">His platoon was bigger at that time than the group we were, with machine guns and he went out talking to Bolot (ph).</span> <span id="s1826">"Are you going to call to order now and go back to staff and re-hash all the things, or are you going to out right now?</span> <span id="s1827">Remember one more move and we are going to use our machine guns."</span> <span id="s1828">And that's what attended for the day, the stuff returned.</span> <span id="s1829">And Dr. Atlas group no longer was commanded by Leibshovitz, but Shuben became its commander and the group received a few more non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1830">So, to make a tone out of it, it looked like this: when things were bad, like they used to say in Polish, .</span> <span id="s1831">When it's bad, go ahead to start getting on the Jews.</span> <span id="s1832">We were the blame, the scapegoats for everything, even at a time like this, in the forest.</span> <span id="s1833">So maybe this is again one reason why not more Jews came to the forest.</span> <span id="s1834">It was not because of anything else, because they had no ways of how to make contacts with the forest.</span> <span id="s1835">The guys in the forest were not interested at that time to save Jews.</span> <span id="s1836">They were interested just to fight a war against the Germans.</span> <span id="s1837">But we did not have any helping hand to help Jews to survive.</span> <span id="s1838">We survived because we were there fighting but not because somebody tried to help us survive.</span> <span id="s1839">And, unfortunately, that's the case; that's the way it was.</span> <span id="s1840">This was a bad to swallow at that particular time because all of a sudden, the reorganization, I myself was sending from one, and I asked at that time, Zatsov and Buchlet.</span> <span id="s1841">They say, "Harold, I cannot keep you under my wing.</span> <span id="s1842">You might as well go to join .</span> <span id="s1843">That's the order that you got."</span> <span id="s1844">So I was re- settled to another place.</span> <span id="s1845">The Abromov (ph) becomes my new home, sort of to be with them.</span> <span id="s1846">And that went on until a few months later, when the paratroopers joined us under the auspices of the General Costenko (ph) or we used to call him, Capusten (ph).</span> <span id="s1847">And I joined, I joined him, not because of my, I was assigned to join him.</span> <span id="s1848">And maybe that was another way of Abromov to get me out of, you know what I mean; not to be over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">And I and Polachek (ph), the other one who were assigned there, and at that time, I became platoon commander beforehand, but still and though, even my being the platoon commander, he singled out me and Polachek, the two, to go to be with the paratroopers.</span> <span id="s1850">And a new leaf in the history of the partisans had started at that particular time in our area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: This is, the date approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: I beg your pardon.</span> <span id="s1853">That was already 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Now, why don't we change here because he's just got a minute left.</span> <span id="s1855">End of Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: Because that was leading up to that attack that we had another attack by the Germans, to get even with us.</span> <span id="s1858">That was, now we are talking of 1943, in the Spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1860">The other thing that, I know you've talked about this in different ways, but it's a little confusing is, there are all these different bands, and I'm wondering how coordinated your activities were.</span> <span id="s1861">I mean, there are all these different groups out there.</span> <span id="s1862">I understand there was a battle to destroy a garrison in the town that you had come from, Rachen (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about that?</span> <span id="s1865">Were you involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Yes, I was very much involved.</span> <span id="s1867">As coming near Zotzof and Pescholey (ph) at the time, and Misha Dubokov knew of me, and I was the one selected to take the commerce from the big massacre in the Rachen to which company, and we were pleading with the command, I and the same thing, Somek Burnstein (ph) that please, let us go and attack the Rachen, less us go and attack the Rachen.</span> <span id="s1868">But the command still did not want to listen to us before the massacre happened.</span> <span id="s1869">However after the massacre in the Rachen happened, and from that massacre to the forest, I would .</span> <span id="s1870">The people who were in the family camps to those who were assigned in the various command posts, in companies, I would say that may be 100 to 120 people were saved of a population in the ghetto, for at least seven or eight hundred.</span> <span id="s1871">That's how victorious the Germans were of killing the Jews.</span> <span id="s1872">They did not take them anymore to the big dig that they had in the forest, but rather in the holes that were left from the bombs in the middle, the center of town, that's where they killed them out.</span> <span id="s1873">And some of them they even killed in the ghetto and burned afterwards the whole ghetto with them.</span> <span id="s1874">So those of them who weren't hiding, had little chance to survive.</span> <span id="s1875">And that is, perhaps, was why the number of us are living.</span> <span id="s1876">Now, . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: Can we just ask you for an approximate date, here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: Let's see.</span> <span id="s1879">That would have to probably be, when was it in your time, 1943, the last massacre, or '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: That's what I thought it was, '42.</span> <span id="s1882">We are talking about now, when we attacked the Rachen was at the tail end of summer.</span> <span id="s1883">Or mid-summer of 1942.</span> <span id="s1884">So, at that particular time with having so many more people, survivors of the Rachen, everybody sort of was looking for a little vengeance on the police, a little vengeance on the Germans for the massacre that they carried out.</span> <span id="s1885">And command was knowing that we can get a lot of trophies in ammunition and everything like that, because they will not fight, no more than they didn't fight as before in other ambushes.</span> <span id="s1886">And they mustered up the force in all the areas and all the partisans were divide in about four groups to make it so that we gave them only one area from where to escape and all the other areas that they tried to escape, they had to fall into our fire.</span> <span id="s1887">I was assigned at that time to a group with Zitsof (ph) which I was with him together.</span> <span id="s1888">We both were having, he was having a machine gun and I was having a machine gun and while he had the machine gun, he was commanding also his flock.</span> <span id="s1889">In other words, of his line, whatever he had to do.</span> <span id="s1890">We decided to attack about dawn, while it was still dark, about maybe at the hours between 5 and 6 in the morning.</span> <span id="s1891">Our forces began to move in the area at night, so really our forces did not have time to rest, but in small groups.</span> <span id="s1892">You could not move about five, six hundred partisans all to come in at one time.</span> <span id="s1893">So everybody was using a different direction and it took them the night hours to come to be in place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">Q: On foot, mostly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: On foot.</span> <span id="s1896">Some of them were on horses.</span> <span id="s1897">The ones who were searching areas and contact man with him, but all the troops were on foot.</span> <span id="s1898">No other way.</span> <span id="s1899">And the contact men only were on horses so that they could be able to speed up to tell from the command, you know, we did not have no radios or anything like that at that time.</span> <span id="s1900">So, we started mustering the forces at night because by night, the movement could be not so visible as to alert the garrison that something is going on.</span> <span id="s1901">We decided there has to be attack early in the morning.</span> <span id="s1902">The signal was a rocket that I would shoot in the air from my horse.</span> <span id="s1903">And once the rocket was shoot, fire starts and with the words of "Hurrah," the Russian way, our men begin.</span> <span id="s1904">The machine guns that were meant near the police first, we shot them out immediately because we made the forest, by the time they realized it was an attack, and to muster the police who were asleep, and the Germans, we already were near the buildings, surrendered and hand grenades began flopping from everywhere.</span> <span id="s1905">So the Germans and the police did not ensue in a fight for more than about an hour in all, put together.</span> <span id="s1906">And all they were doing is looking for places where to run.</span> <span id="s1907">We collected quite a number of them prisoners of war and the prisoners were tied, their hands in the back and were immediately sent to the forest, and which, later on, they would stand trial and they were convicted, in other words to die.</span> <span id="s1908">And they were one by one shot in the presence of the partisans.</span> <span id="s1909">And, at that particular time, we were very overwhelmed of how little an effort it was to knock the garrison out, because really there looks like did not have chance enough to build a position.</span> <span id="s1910">However, I must make a point here; after it was all over and the garrison retreated back, that's when around this here garrison where the police force was staying, they built a wall with bunkers that if we were to have this here kind of building before, we would never be able to succeed to attack.</span> <span id="s1911">We made use of the time, since the Rachen was a slaughter house, that the slaughter house became busy, slaughtering meat, and it was salted down into wooden barrels and sent to the forest by a contingency of partisans that we had who were capable of making salami and so on, and they were salted down as to food and scattered around the various parts of the forest, which only a few people knew.</span> <span id="s1912">So, in the event we should have been surrounded and not be able to go out, that we should be able to have supplies for where to survive.</span> <span id="s1913">My good friend, Barnovsky, (ph) was leading on, we told of this year, doing, he was a butcher by trade and he knew the art of making the salami and all of that do.</span> <span id="s1914">So, he was leading and it became a very busy place, that slaughter house.</span> <span id="s1915">To tell you, we kept it for almost three months and until the Germans decided to make an onslaught and come back to return to their bases.</span> <span id="s1916">With Zidsov (ph) as I went into a house, I came into a Gentile person who knew even my grandparents.</span> <span id="s1917">And he touched me badly, the way he said it in Russian, " ," which translated into English, means, "Are you still alive?"</span> <span id="s1918">And it rubbed me the wrong way.</span> <span id="s1919">Had I not had Commander Zitsov with me, I would have ended him right there.</span> <span id="s1920">But being with my Commander Zitsov with me, I pretended that I didn't take it, instead of him showing the joy that I am alive, he asked me, "Are you still alive?"</span> <span id="s1921">So, and that rubbed me in the wrong way and he ordered us, he ordered for him and his wife to make breakfast for us and a few more from the command came into the same house.</span> <span id="s1922">And even though we had to drink and to eat, but these few words never left me.</span> <span id="s1923">And I had a hard time, sort of, forgetting about it, that even after I left all of my family and lost them over here, that that man would have the audacity to ask me, one person who remained alive, in these words, with his cruel words: "Are you still alive?"</span> <span id="s1924">And he thought that that was a way of greeting me.</span> <span id="s1925">In other words, that he sort of jokingly thought.</span> <span id="s1926">I did not make any mention in front of my commander, but my anger was burning in me, coming back in the places where I did not even know which of the holes my family is buried, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Because they threw lime afterwards on it and it was brought to burial, the area, after the war when the partisans returned to the Rachen.</span> <span id="s1928">It was a big piece of news for the whole area, because the respect date.</span> <span id="s1929">And what we invited upon ourselves, after that forest, after that Rachen occupation and what we do.</span> <span id="s1930">That the Germans had to bring a tremendous force in surrendering all the forest, extending maybe in diameter, maybe 30 to 40 miles.</span> <span id="s1931">Which, again, for the Soviet Union, it served a good purpose.</span> <span id="s1932">When they have to take in one area to use so much military to do a big job like that, the front line is .</span> <span id="s1933">That's when the Soviets were winning.</span> <span id="s1934">But, it was a lot of casualties on our part and that Fall, when they made, because we were so sure of ourselves that we became too cocky.</span> <span id="s1935">We used to travel by day, coming to the Rachen; going here and doing there.</span> <span id="s1936">We thought there is no forest that it can stop us.</span> <span id="s1937">And this is the time that we relaxed a little bit too much and the casualties happened.</span> <span id="s1938">So then we heard the forest coming in, we started on the edge of the forest from all places to put up, at that time, a defense.</span> <span id="s1939">And we didn't wait for them to attack us, we started to attack them, realizing the kind of forest and the kind of fighting that no longer were we dealing with the police, the local alone, but at this time we were dealing with a trained Army.</span> <span id="s1940">So, our command immediately recognized the situation and they broke through an area in a few places to make it, and we were ordered to retreat.</span> <span id="s1941">We retreated until the forest almost around Vilda (ph).</span> <span id="s1942">It was very, a traumatic move at that time for us, that all of a sudden, we had to, I would say in miles, I would say we must have retreated about 150 yards from our base.</span> <span id="s1943">The good part of a base was that we knew the names of the settlements.</span> <span id="s1944">We knew which way it leads.</span> <span id="s1945">And then you come in a strange place altogether, it was hard to go ahead to carry out any of the type of work that they did over there.</span> <span id="s1946">So it was a set back port partisans.</span> <span id="s1947">The good news however was that after that, we saw the paratroopers come in to the area.</span> <span id="s1948">So, 1943, about mid, we decided to organize a new action.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: I want to go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s1950">You have mentioned on and off a Dr. Atlas.</span> <span id="s1951">I believe he was also involved in that battle, so I want you to tell me something about him.</span> <span id="s1952">Who was he?</span> <span id="s1953">What kind of a man he was?</span> <span id="s1954">What he was doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: At the battle of the Rachen, Dr. Atlas was involved.</span> <span id="s1956">And he retreated away from the Rachen quickly.</span> <span id="s1957">Not with his troops, because he had some medical missions that he had to attend to at that particular time.</span> <span id="s1958">While he was the commander, he still used to attend to certain patients, which was farmers.</span> <span id="s1959">His good rule, what he did to the farmers helped us with leads of informers that we could get.</span> <span id="s1960">And because they wanted Dr. Atlas to continue with the work, we prospered with it.</span> <span id="s1961">So, yes; he was in the battle.</span> <span id="s1962">He originally was leading his platoon over there to the Rachen, but he after it was over, the fight was over, he had to retreat.</span> <span id="s1963">His men remained there.</span> <span id="s1964">Now, for instance, we knew a few casualties of the Rachen boys who did lose their life, like I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s1965">Benjamin Dumbrovsky, he lost his brother at that particular time.</span> <span id="s1966">But all the casualties we had were due to bravery; they were really fighting and they really wanted to see and show the police over there that somebody has got to be accountable for the way they did in that massacre against the Jews so well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Did his platoon come from that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: The platoon that he was leading was, I would say, about 80 percent of the Jewish people who came from the Rachen and they came after the massacre of the Rachen.</span> <span id="s1969">That's why they were so eager in the fight of to go back and sort of, vengeance was a good driving force in them, to do what they were doing at the present time.</span> <span id="s1970">So, it was not idealogy in part, all the way, that they were trying to fight for the Soviets, but a lot of times it was vengeance against those who did so cruel to our families there.</span> <span id="s1971">So his platoon remained until afterwards when the General's staff ordered everybody to retreat.</span> <span id="s1972">Because after the first day, or the second day, we used to go back by day to the forests and by night come and still do that.</span> <span id="s1973">We did not want to get caught in the big forest that the Germans should go ahead.</span> <span id="s1974">So we used to have, more or less, platoons, a platoon maybe would stand guard and about on the lookout over there.</span> <span id="s1975">But the whole Army was where we were, about five or six hundred partisans, were sent back to their bases.</span> <span id="s1976">Dr. Atlas was also a DP like I was myself.</span> <span id="s1977">I knew him not like I knew, for instance, the other doctors; no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: But you came in contact with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1980">It's worth mentioning here, about Dr. Atlas's past.</span> <span id="s1981">He was a displaced person, like I.</span> <span id="s1982">He was someplace from Poland.</span> <span id="s1983">And that man practiced medicine all the time and with the German onslaught, the way it happened, he decided to be treating patience on the outside.</span> <span id="s1984">So he, instead of remaining in the ghetto, was away from the ghetto and he used to, sort of, be the doctor of the farmers.</span> <span id="s1985">And they did not disclose him from the Germans, to the Germans, rather.</span> <span id="s1986">With the onslaught and organization of partisans, as soon as he heard about partisans in the area, he came voluntarily and joined but he still maintained a good relationship with the farming area over there and they became very useful to the partisans, right now for the information.</span> <span id="s1987">He was a man about my height, slimmer than me, I mean you know, I wasn't as fat as I am now, but a little slimmer.</span> <span id="s1988">And he had one thing, you could see fire in this man, talking to his guys all the time about vengeance and fight.</span> <span id="s1989">"When you going to fight, fight to the end.</span> <span id="s1990">Fight to win."</span> <span id="s1991">And he was a good leading commander.</span> <span id="s1992">We had a lot more of, in Buloks.</span> <span id="s1993">Bulok was a local commander who had mostly Gentiles, or the other Russians, not so much of the Soviets, true Soviets, who remained in the area that didn't go into the prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1994">But he organized his group mostly from his settlement area and around there.</span> <span id="s1995">So the people, as I say, his group, they all used to ride more, a lot on horses.</span> <span id="s1996">So, they would come because they had their own farms and so on.</span> <span id="s1997">So a lot of them used to have to man the farms, and at night, whatever the partisans needs was today, they would be working on that front line, too.</span> <span id="s1998">But the unfortunate situation happens, Dr. Atlas, in one of the big ambushes, which it was following after the liberation of the Rachen, that's when Dr. Atlas is killed in battle.</span> <span id="s1999">So, I mean, he didn't die just a normal death.</span> <span id="s2000">He was killed while fighting, being a fighter and commanding.</span> <span id="s2001">That's when the takes over.</span> <span id="s2002">That man, I just mentioned, misfortunately meets his death in , in Poland, while on his way escaping the Soviet Union, and while on the way in a kubutz (ph) which it was illegal immigration to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s2003">And being outside on patrol, a Polak shot and killed him.</span> <span id="s2004">As you've heard perhaps or not, that in and in other parts of Poland, after 1945, when the war as over, and the Jews were running from the camps or from hiding, they still were not ready to give away what they robbed from the Jews, so they had one way of doing it: kill them.</span> <span id="s2005">And therefore, we know later on, what went on in Poland.</span> <span id="s2006">So, a lot of these guys like , met their death after liberation.</span> <span id="s2007">And it was a big hurt to feel that a guy was patriotic all the way and that that was the way for him to die.</span> <span id="s2008">So, why almost after three years in the forest, or two and a half years, rather, and being in battle and to come out all right.</span> <span id="s2009">In the forest he only lost his sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">His brothers, the other two brothers that survived, to the best of my knowledge, are in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: Now, we have I guess about ten more minutes and I'm wondering.</span> <span id="s2012">There are two thoughts that I have.</span> <span id="s2013">Either, and maybe you can explain to me about this reorganization that took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: Or possibly tell me about an experience, or running into family camps, whichever you think is appropriate at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: Well, I can tell you first about the family camps, rather than getting into this subject, because that's a more lengthy subject to talk about.</span> <span id="s2017">I did not mention at great length, that in the forests there were also family camps.</span> <span id="s2018">However, let us make clear about it.</span> <span id="s2019">When I use that word, family camps, I only mean others an expression.</span> <span id="s2020">It was not a camp of people with families or elderly, that they were supervised by others.</span> <span id="s2021">It's just that they were, sort of, not elected to be able to be among the fighting force.</span> <span id="s2022">And therefore, when we came to the forests, escaping from the massacres, there was only one thing for them to do, and that was to be in the forest.</span> <span id="s2023">So, a lot of them, a majority of them who were capable, joined one company or the other and they were there.</span> <span id="s2024">And those who couldn't, for instance, had the lot left to them to be there.</span> <span id="s2025">Every time the Germans attacked the forest, the ambush or otherwise, the big forest or small forest, the family camps were the first prey that they attacked.</span> <span id="s2026">And at times, it was, they were going home, sort of, with victory, thinking that they killed partisans while they actually, the one that they killed was the ones in the family camp.</span> <span id="s2027">Because as soon as the shooting was started, not too far where we were in our camps, so we would exactly, at that particular time join and attack them instead of.</span> <span id="s2028">And from the family camps, they had an easy prey.</span> <span id="s2029">All they could throw is a few hand grenades, open up a machine gun and boom, then they found them.</span> <span id="s2030">So, those who were living in hiding survived the massacre, or the onslaught.</span> <span id="s2031">Those who were not living in hide outs, but they just lived in the open, you know.</span> <span id="s2032">They were first prey.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">So, the other part was, while we had so many fighting groups, really, no one cared to provide the family camps with provisions, even food or clothing.</span> <span id="s2034">However, some of them had relatives, brothers or other ones, in the fighting camps, which they would care to bring something.</span> <span id="s2035">But, it was never an organized effort by the partisans, in the area that I was in.</span> <span id="s2036">I don't know what it was in other forests; maybe in other forests it was different.</span> <span id="s2037">But, I believe that we would have heard about it and know about it.</span> <span id="s2038">They were an open prey.</span> <span id="s2039">They escaped.</span> <span id="s2040">At types, they used to have problems with the partisans.</span> <span id="s2041">The partisans, especially the women, and there were younger girls; the partisans, in most cases the Gentiles, would come and rape them, attack them in this way.</span> <span id="s2042">So they were open prey to all kinds of enemies: our local enemies, the partisans which they couldn't protect themselves from, and against the Germans and the police when they would attack and they would normally, you know what I mean, pick their spots as of their probably spies them where they were located and that's what it would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: Did, do you think that Jewish members of the partisans ever took advantage of the family camps in that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: The Jewish guys used to help one way or the other, the family camp.</span> <span id="s2045">But, that was, again, a not official way, it was an unofficial way.</span> <span id="s2046">That we would sometimes drop some food over there.</span> <span id="s2047">But we were starting to stop over there to visit and usually we would come with some food leaving them.</span> <span id="s2048">But it was not a case that a command told us, "Hey, why didn't you deliver some potatoes from wherever you can, or something else, to the family camp?"</span> <span id="s2049">The family camps were strictly left on their own and if we were to have the figures at hand and starting to make justification or comparisons, we would find that the biggest amount of casualties as per amount coming to the forest, was from the family camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: Was there constant enemy presence?</span> <span id="s2051">I mean, were you always afraid of bombing and advances?</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A: That was the life, at that time.</span> <span id="s2053">It was war and we were in that war.</span> <span id="s2054">It did not matter perimeter, where the front line is.</span> <span id="s2055">To us, the front line was everywhere, because we never, we used to catch here and there spies, would come running in the forest that the Germans sent.</span> <span id="s2056">They used to send in ex-POWs, you know what I mean, which they sent in.</span> <span id="s2057">We found them with maps and insignia on them.</span> <span id="s2058">And of course, when we found them, they met death, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s2059">But, it was officially, you know.</span> <span id="s2060">The company would come out and it would be read the order, who and what it was discovered and therefore, they were executed.</span> <span id="s2061">But, it was in a military kind of a way.</span> <span id="s2062">So, to tell you, the forests were full of all kind of problems, while they served of a lot of help, to help Jews survive.</span> <span id="s2063">But, it did not happen as a means for Jewish survival.</span> <span id="s2064">It happened because the way it happened to be that it served as the base for survival.</span> <span id="s2065">But they were not with open arms, let us get Jews in.</span> <span id="s2066">Jews were not taken in so easily, like I told you when I was, before when I was coming in there.</span> <span id="s2067">What do you think?</span> <span id="s2068">We have ammunition for them?</span> <span id="s2069">That was not the case.</span> <span id="s2070">The case is, if you're out to help or to save, that's the salvation.</span> <span id="s2071">But if not, that's the case we don't have, how are we going to take in more?</span> <span id="s2072">And again, when we were talking about attacking the Rachen, before the massacre, that was our main course; that was to come in to tell them that a young people will join us.</span> <span id="s2073">But they did not want to hear but we will take the Rachen after the massacre, where we could have saved so much more lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: During this period of time, did you have one moment or one episode that was the most terrifying to you, or was this just the life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: If there was one episode, I don't know which way to place it.</span> <span id="s2076">I was on a mission at one time to save one Jewish girl from the Rachen, who a policeman at the massacre, he looks like he was in love with her and she was in love with him, save her and took upon himself to take him to his farm, where his parents were, and they kept her there.</span> <span id="s2077">And all of a sudden, we got word in the forest that Sonia no longer can stay.</span> <span id="s2078">She became the wife later of who I have mentioned before, who was a commander.</span> <span id="s2079">But sent me for one reason or another only that I came telling her, there's a young girl, good looking, and if you want me to bring her here, you'll have a girl.</span> <span id="s2080">So, it was sort of like you cannot say that the interest of the commander to permit me to go on that mission to save her was of humane?</span> <span id="s2081">No, it wasn't of humane.</span> <span id="s2082">It was, the was a nice man and he layer winds up being with her after the war was over.</span> <span id="s2083">But he, it was just a matter of exchange, sort of; you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s2084">Who cares?</span> <span id="s2085">And I risked my life, although I wasn't a native from that city.</span> <span id="s2086">But I was there, again, because the Dr. Atlas group probably had the same thing and the question would always be, how come they didn't?</span> <span id="s2087">I did it for one basic reason.</span> <span id="s2088">The news came to us through a contact and I went to and told him.</span> <span id="s2089">And he says, "Would you want to go to bring her?"</span> <span id="s2090">I says, "Yes.</span> <span id="s2091">She's a nice woman."</span> <span id="s2092">And I brought her.</span> <span id="s2093">But it was a big risk for me, a one-man operation, to go to organize it, through our contact man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">Which I did through the prior knowledge of the staff.</span> <span id="s2095">The staff would never have permitted me to do a thing like that.</span> <span id="s2096">You know.</span> <span id="s2097">The staff would have said to me, "Sure, she wants to come?</span> <span id="s2098">Meet her halfway.</span> <span id="s2099">Meet her at the edge of some settlement from the forest and if she comes there, you'll take her.</span> <span id="s2100">But I risked and I had to make them believe that I'm here with a little Army to surrender.</span> <span id="s2101">And she was dressed like a little farm girl and she came out over there and when we meet, I sort of started to pretend that there is the other guys, all came with me.</span> <span id="s2102">And until I was in the forest, she herself thought that what I'm talking is really something.</span> <span id="s2103">And the whole night it took me to walk until in the morning until I brought her.</span> <span id="s2104">So, is that an important case?</span> <span id="s2105">Was the onslaught in the Rachen when I was in full and important case?</span> <span id="s2106">Was when we attacked?</span> <span id="s2107">Again, when I was next to the Howitzer and we were doing.</span> <span id="s2108">And it was a big fight there.</span> <span id="s2109">That's an important part for me to tell about that fight because the Jewish heroes were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">End of Tape #8 Conclusion of interview.</span></p></body></html>
