Stranberg</span></p> <p><span id="s2">By Rhoda Lewin</span></p> <p><span id="s3">January 26,1987 Jewish Community Relations Council, Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: Today is January 26, 1987 and I’m interviewing Glenn Stranberg at his home in Atwater, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s5">Glenn, I know you were with a medic unit and were among the first people into Dachau concentration camp, but first let’s back up and could you tell me where you were born, when, where you grew up and how you got into the U.S. Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: It’s quite easy to say where I was born.</span> <span id="s7">I was born on the farm where we live now, just down the road a half a mile from the house we live in at this time 69 years ago.</span> <span id="s8">I was born on the 10th of October, 1917; was drafted into the United States Army.</span> <span id="s9">Went in with the idea that being a farm boy, a hunter, and a trapper, figured naturally to be an infantry man.</span> <span id="s10">But the Army has the idea that if you know something you better get into something you don’t know anything about, so they put me into the medics.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: You were drafted -- you had graduated from high school</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I did not graduate high school, ma’am.</span> <span id="s13">I went to eighth grade.</span> <span id="s14">At that time, back on the farm, when you got through eighth grade you could quit going to school, and if you were needed on the farm, that’s where you stayed.</span> <span id="s15">The next year, year after that, things changed and the rest of the fellows in our school started going into high school.</span> <span id="s16">But at that time, not too many went to high school in this part of the country.</span> <span id="s17">So I stayed on the farm, worked in the area, and as a part of that not going to school, I was drafted into the service, July of 1942, and I was in until December 21 of 1945.</span> <span id="s18">Just about three and a half years.</span> <span id="s19">I spent the first, after basic training, went to the Aleutian Islands, and spent one winter up there.</span> <span id="s20">There was a woman behind every tree but there wasn’t a tree on the island!</span> <span id="s21">Figure that one out.</span> <span id="s22">(Laughter) But anyway it was an experience.</span> <span id="s23">We lived in tents, came back from there and they said I would not be going overseas any more, so my long-time girlfriend and I got married, and in six months I was on my way to Europe.</span> <span id="s24">I had some extra training, went over with an evacuation hospital.</span> <span id="s25">Had training in Atlanta, Georgia, and came out with a rating of T-4, which is sergeant, and trained as a surgical technician.</span> <span id="s26">It was a wonderful experience being in the medics, if you must have that type of experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: How much training did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Before we went to the Aleutians we had some training in surgical technician.</span> <span id="s29">Then when we came back we had another month or two of training, and that qualified me to work in the operating room as a scrub nurse or assistant, and after being over in Europe a while, working in charge of a ward, I was transferred to the operating room, and worked for six months in the operating room.</span> <span id="s30">This time I worked with a doctor from Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s31">We had a team.</span> <span id="s32">A doctor, a nurse, and a technician worked together twelve hours a day, seven days a week.</span> <span id="s33">If you worked days you worked twelve hours, and then you’d shift around, so you could split a shift and work six, and then back on twelve.</span> <span id="s34">You worked twelve hours a day, seven days a week.</span> <span id="s35">The doctors, the nurses, the enlisted men, all worked the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Where were you stationed?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: We were stationed in Cherbourg, France, during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: You went in on D-Day?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: No, we went in after D-Day.</span> <span id="s40">We went in, through Marseille and caught up to them in France.</span> <span id="s41">Behind the first line, we were the first unit that took care of patients as they came off the line.</span> <span id="s42">What is now called the MASH unit replaced the First Evac hospitals.</span> <span id="s43">The only ones between us and the fighting was the aid stations, so they came back to us with just a bandage over their clothes and everything, and we cleaned them, and got them ready to be transferred back.</span> <span id="s44">A sidelight of that, I think, it’s very interesting, of all the ones I took care of, I have only had association with one in all those years.</span> <span id="s45">A fellow that I met there, took care of him, when I was still working on the war.</span> <span id="s46">They took his foot off; he’d been in a tank.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: And this is somebody you’ve seen since the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Since then, we hunted and fished together about every year since we got out of the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: You mean he lived in this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: He lives in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s51">He is quite well known in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s52">But we’ve enjoyed the family, we’ve been to all their weddings, all of those things.</span> <span id="s53">Herman Ratelle, he’s an attorney, and he’s brother to Alex, the runner.</span> <span id="s54">And we see Herman, we hunt together every year, have all this time.</span> <span id="s55">He is now at the head of a bunch of attorneys, fifty-some.</span> <span id="s56">He’s come a long ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">But other than that I have never had association with any of the people I took care of.</span> <span id="s58">And actually, when you got to the operating room there was no chance of visiting with them, because you just saw them, and they were gone.</span> <span id="s59">But the advantage of being in the operating room, if you ever did get so it was caught up, so there wasn’t a bunch laying in the hall, you could rest, where on the ward you worked twelve hours, and you worked the full twelve hours, ‘cause you always had a ward-full.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: When your unit came to Dachau, had you known ahead of time where you were going, and what it might be like?</span> <span id="s61">Did you read about it, say, in the Stars and Stripes?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: We had no idea, no idea ‘til we walked down along the railroad track, and saw all the cars, the boxcars with the bodies in, and the people laying dead along the track.</span> <span id="s63">By the way, they weren’t all dead along the track.</span> <span id="s64">Some were still alive, but they were unable to move anymore.</span> <span id="s65">You’d see them twitch.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: This was something you were assigned, your medic unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Our medic unit was set up to go in there and set up a hospital.</span> <span id="s68">An evacuation hospital is a 450-bed hospital normally.</span> <span id="s69">That’s what you are to take care of.</span> <span id="s70">We moved in there, and we had 1500 patients.</span> <span id="s71">First thing we did when we got to Dachau, we tore the insides out of all the barracks that these SS troops had lived in, and set up our hospital units in there.</span> <span id="s72">I should go back and say that a unit consisted of 40 doctors and 40 nurses and 216 enlisted men.</span> <span id="s73">And we were a mobile unit, semi-mobile, so that one unit would move and set up, the trucks would go back and get the next unit and bring that back up, go back and get the third unit.</span> <span id="s74">As it moved so fast, we were sometimes spread out for many miles, but being in the surgical init, I was on the first unit each time, the same as when we moved into Dachau.</span> <span id="s75">I was in the first unit.</span> <span id="s76">This friend of mine worked on the ward yet, and he came in a day later, because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: How many hours--I don’t think it was days--was this after the first troops had come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: We were one day behind them, and he was two days behind, his was on the second.</span> <span id="s79">We were there on the first, and the pictures that I took were taken on the first.</span> <span id="s80">At one time, shortly after we got to Dachau, I had an infection in my hand, and was hospitalized myself there.</span> <span id="s81">But after I got out of that I was transferred to the typhus ward, the ward where they had been working with this disease, and worked there for some time, where we were very restricted, naturally, because of the danger of infection coming out.</span> <span id="s82">As we came in to them, they had been eating brown, dark, hard bread, and of course we were going to be good to them, so we fed them, and you can’t imagine the mess that we got out of that.</span> <span id="s83">Because they got diarrhea, all 1500 of them, right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: What were you feeding them?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: We fed them regular rations, the first day.</span> <span id="s86">Potatoes and meat (laughs).</span> <span id="s87">We had a kitchen unit that did our cooking.</span> <span id="s88">And they just absolutely couldn’t tolerate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Potatoes and meat and vegetables and desserts?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s91">They weren’t used to any of that.</span> <span id="s92">Their bodies weren’t set up to use that.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: So then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, the doctors had to find out what they would tolerate, more or less dry foods.</span> <span id="s95">Instead of all the stuff we were giving them.</span> <span id="s96">A normal thing on a ward, in the morning, you’d take out the ones who’d died in the night, you’d maybe have 10, maybe 20 at first.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Out of how many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: In each ward would maybe be about 60.</span> <span id="s99">So you’d have quite a death rate there at first.</span> <span id="s100">They were so weak, as you can see in the pictures.</span> <span id="s101">You can see the bones, their ribs sticking through all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Could you back up a minute and just try to remember, and walk me through the camp?</span> <span id="s103">When you walked through the gate, what did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: When we walked through the gate, there was that sign, “ Work will make you free.”</span> <span id="s105">You’ve maybe heard this before.</span> <span id="s106">And after we got into that camp.</span> <span id="s107">I didn’t get to see a lot, for some time, because our job right away was to get set up.</span> <span id="s108">We had to get the hospital unit set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: This was your equipment and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s111">And clean out the barracks, because they were small rooms in these buildings.</span> <span id="s112">They were big long buildings but they were small rooms and we tore all the insides out of them to make place for the beds.</span> <span id="s113">And after that, when I got time, I visited the crematory, that had four ovens, and then I was there at the time when these people showed how it was done.</span> <span id="s114">They reenacted it for Life.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Could you describe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: These fellows volunteered to come in there and show how they handled the bodies.</span> <span id="s117">They handled them with ice tongs.</span> <span id="s118">One would take hold by their head and one by their feet, put them onto the slab and slide them into the crematory.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Just like a big oven.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s121">They were big ovens.</span> <span id="s122">When we were back in Germany, we stopped, and they had one of the ovens left there.</span> <span id="s123">The rest of the camp, there was hardly any of it left.</span> <span id="s124">It had been all torn down.</span> <span id="s125">Then there was a Jewish and Protestant and Catholic memorials that we visited at that time, flowers on each one of them, fresh flowers at each place, each day.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">The camp itself was quite large.</span> <span id="s127">The administrative buildings were big.</span> <span id="s128">Everybody wore the striped uniforms -- the inmates -- -and then the Jewish people wore the star so they could see them, where the others didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: This was a yellow star on their clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I don’t remember what color it was but it was always on the uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: You mean there were non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s133">Many, many that were non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s134">Polish people, German people.</span> <span id="s135">It has a rundown in there, actually, of the numbers.</span> <span id="s136">There was even six Americans in there, according to the report.</span> <span id="s137">They’d been in Europe, I suppose, and they’d been captured there at that time.</span> <span id="s138">And there were big warehouse type buildings that were just full of loot that had been taken from other countries.</span> <span id="s139">I didn’t know the value of art or any of that kind of stuff, for these statues or stuff, but I imagine some of that was priceless.</span> <span id="s140">But of course you didn’t pay any attention to that at the time.</span> <span id="s141">On the end they had a place there where they manufactured guns, and they had warehouses full of them right there.</span> <span id="s142">The thing you could see there was that the ones that were manufactured before 1940 were fully finished, but as it went on, the ones that were stamped 1943, 1944, were getting more crude, all the way ‘til the end, they were just a weapon that you wouldn’t dare to fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: These were at the factory in the prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Right there, where the prisoners worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So you had to come in with a surgical unit, but once you were in there, you were doing--</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: I was the same as I was before I ever went into the surgical unit, because everybody turned into just plain in charge of a ward, or worked in a ward.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Did you have any kind of medication?</span> <span id="s148">You of course came in with DDT.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: We had all our supplies.</span> <span id="s150">We gave them a bath first.</span> <span id="s151">Everybody went through a shower.</span> <span id="s152">We didn’t have anything to do with that, because we had all we could do to take care of the ones that were down.</span> <span id="s153">So the other units took care of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: What did you do about clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: They issued them clothing and blankets, for the ones that were in the hospital.</span> <span id="s156">The rest of them had just what they had.</span> <span id="s157">They run out of there with what they had.</span> <span id="s158">They were so glad to go that they didn’t care if they had anything on or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: You mean some of the prisoners went right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Some of them started getting out of there pretty quick, yes.</span> <span id="s161">They tried to get them out as fast as they could.</span> <span id="s162">American soldiers tried to.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Where were they going?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: They headed towards home, any way they could go.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: The war was still on.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yes, in parts of it it was.</span> <span id="s167">But it was winding down so fast.</span> <span id="s168">Actually, it ended the 7th of May, wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s169">This was only seven days before that.</span> <span id="s170">But the last three weeks or a month you could look up, and during the day, you’d see planes, steady, always you’d see planes, going both ways.</span> <span id="s171">So you knew it wasn’t going to be any length of time, because there was no way anyone could stand up under the bombardment they were getting at the last.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Then a prisoner at Dachau who was well enough to leave, could simply say thank you for opening the door and--</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Well, not really, but it happened that way, a lot of them just got out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: They had no decent clothing, they had no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: No, but the war was over for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: They just went.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: A lot of them did, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: So you took care of the ones who were too sick.</span> <span id="s179">You weren’t involved, then, in cleaning up the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: No.</span> <span id="s181">We didn’t have anything to do with more than just taking care of the prisoners that were that sick.</span> <span id="s182">We didn’t have anything to do with the burial details, or anything of that.</span> <span id="s183">We did see when the German people came and hauled the bodies out that were laying there, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: That was one of the things I was going to ask you.</span> <span id="s185">You say the German people?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: From Dachau.</span> <span id="s187">They’d come and haul them out.</span> <span id="s188">From the city of Dachau.</span> <span id="s189">They brought out wagons with horses on, loaded them up, and hauled them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: What did they do with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Put them in a mass grave.</span> <span id="s192">There’s a big mound at Dachau that we visited, where most of those were taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Did you speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Did you find some prisoners who spoke some English?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s197">I’ll tell you about what it amounted to, would be to get a bunch of sick sheep, and try to talk to them.</span> <span id="s198">That’s about what it amounted to.</span> <span id="s199">You just tried to communicate by sign language what you could, and then of course to try to get them to know you were trying to help them in the first place, because they had the idea that they would be killed.</span> <span id="s200">It’s hard to believe, but they did.</span> <span id="s201">They didn’t know that we were going to save them.</span> <span id="s202">A lot of them, their minds were already deranged because of what they had been through.</span> <span id="s203">I remember one young fellow -- -he was really messed up, and we got him all cleaned up, got new pajamas on him, got him into bed, and he jumped up and jumped out through the window and killed himself.</span> <span id="s204">Just like that.</span> <span id="s205">You didn’t think there was anything wrong with him and all of a sudden he just -- -zip -- -and out he went, killed himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q; There were also what they have come since then to call “mussulmen,” people who were so starved that their minds were really gone.</span> <span id="s207">Did you see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s209">Every day you saw those.</span> <span id="s210">Nothing you could do for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: You didn’t use IV’s to try to feed them?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Well, in the typhus ward we used them all the time.</span> <span id="s213">There they were treated.</span> <span id="s214">A lot of those were not starved to death, because they had those in there as an experiment.</span> <span id="s215">They were the stronger ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: What kind of an experiment?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: There’s documentation in there (points to book) of things they did, infecting them with one thing or another to see how they would be treated after that.</span> <span id="s218">And that’s the same with this typhus ward.</span> <span id="s219">They’d infect some with mosquitoes and some were other than that, too, where they would actually take blood from one to the other to see how they’d react to this.</span> <span id="s220">This had been done, of course, before we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: So they were deliberately creating typhus, so they could experiment with different treatments.</span> <span id="s222">How long were you in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: About a month.</span> <span id="s224">And then at that time they were getting us ready.</span> <span id="s225">At the time when the war ended with Japan, we were already loaded on box cars with our unit, for deportation to Japan.</span> <span id="s226">So we would have been in on the initial landing in Japan, had they gone that far.</span> <span id="s227">For three or four days we just sat in those cars; they didn’t know what to do with us, where to send us, or anything.</span> <span id="s228">So we just stayed right in those cars.</span> <span id="s229">All our equipment was loaded, everything was already on the train, ready to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: And you would have found concentration camps there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: I imagine we would have found something, maybe not as bad, but you never know, because it seems that wherever there’s war, there’s hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Can you remember what your thoughts were at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Well, yes and no.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: But you’ve thought about it since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: It still bothers me.</span> <span id="s236">I came home and people said they didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s237">They didn’t think there was anything to it.</span> <span id="s238">Then I’d get upset.</span> <span id="s239">Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: You were trying to talk to people about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s242">And they didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s243">But it is hard to believe.</span> <span id="s244">People in the country now have heard of it so much, the Holocaust, they do believe it.</span> <span id="s245">But when you first came home, and they had never heard of it, it’s hard for them to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Who were you trying to tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: We had people that lived right in the area, neighbors, my brother-in-law -- -his dad came from Germany -- -and of course they didn’t believe this, naturally.</span> <span id="s248">But that didn’t bother me as much as with him because I knew what the deal was, but some of these others -- it kind of shakes you up.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: So then did you just stop talking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: No, I’d bring the pictures out.</span> <span id="s251">That’s why they’re worn.</span> <span id="s252">This is a picture of newsmen at Dachau that I took; the same one as this Life one here.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: So did you give up talking about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: No, I haven’t given up.</span> <span id="s255">I suppose that’s how Bill Borth got ahold of me.</span> <span id="s256">I didn’t give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q; You’ve been on your Holocaust education project, then, for forty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yeah, sort of.</span> <span id="s259">He was on the radio one day, and I called him and talked to him and asked him if he wanted some other pictures, and he came out right away.</span> <span id="s260">So you will find him a very interesting fellow, I can assure you of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Did this make you a different person?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: I suppose it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: More compassionate, I suppose, to people.</span> <span id="s265">More a believer that anything can happen.</span> <span id="s266">I suppose I’d say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q; You think it could happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A; Yes, it could happen again, and it will happen again.</span> <span id="s269">Maybe not as bad, but it will happen again.</span> <span id="s270">I think it’s nice that your people are doing this to get things out.</span> <span id="s271">This book has been at school here quite a few times; teachers have had it.</span> <span id="s272">I’ve had trouble keeping track of it, but I’ve got my name all over it.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: This is the book about Dachau that was put out by the US Army, with pictures and descriptions of what they found.</span> <span id="s274">The last question I always ask when I’m doing an interview is, “ What did I forget to ask?”</span> <span id="s275">What would you like to say as you look back?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: After all these years, it’s hard to remember.</span> <span id="s277">But you’ve got to realize that we were pretty callous by the time we got to Dachau.</span> <span id="s278">We had taken care of patients for all those months.</span> <span id="s279">Sometimes you would go to work and twelve hours later you’d go off of work and still some of those same people in the hall hadn’t got in.</span> <span id="s280">We had a unit that had seven operating tables and one leg, one cast, and still at times it would be twelve hours before they would get in.</span> <span id="s281">And then you could figure that when they came in, their arms and legs would be going because it’d been too long, but there was no way you could take care of more than so many.</span> <span id="s282">Even with seven tables going.</span> <span id="s283">If you got a backlog of a lot of people, they just don’t get in that fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: When you came back, did you have any thoughts of perhaps, instead of farming, using your G.I. Bill to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: I should have done that.</span> <span id="s286">I should have gone as a P.A., or something of that kind, but I was a farmer, ad all I wanted to do was get out, all the way out.</span> <span id="s287">But I enjoyed the part of being in the operating room very much.</span> <span id="s288">I liked it.</span> <span id="s289">And I was good at it, if I say so myself.</span> <span id="s290">(Laughs) I did things that I’d have to go to school for a long time to even be allowed to do.</span> <span id="s291">But I can tell you, if you’re going to stand there and hold those retractors for an hour, the shoulder blades stick right out the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: It’s hard work, physical labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: It’s hard work and it’s hard work being a doctor, I can assure you.</span> <span id="s294">And we had 40 doctors, and 39 of them were super.</span> <span id="s295">It’s just that you get that one that just isn’t so good, but I guess you find that in any profession.</span> <span id="s296">(Laughs) I don’t even know where he was from.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: When you talked about the inmates at Dachau, you were always referring to men.</span> <span id="s298">Did you see any women?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Our hospital only took care of men.</span> <span id="s300">There was another evac hospital that was in there, and they took care of the women.</span> <span id="s301">But there were not a lot of women at Dachau.</span> <span id="s302">We only had men in ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Why did you divide them up?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A; I suppose it’s easier taking care of them and the association of back and forth was easier that way.</span> <span id="s305">So we just had men patients.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Let me ask you what ages these people were.</span> <span id="s307">Were they teenagers, older people?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A; Some of them were young.</span> <span id="s309">Some of them had been there for many years, and if they’d been there for any length of time, they looked old, because they aged very quickly.</span> <span id="s310">An example of this was ten years ago when Kevin went to Poland with a singing group -- our youngest son -- and during that time (pauses crying) -- Kevin went with this singing group from the New York area.</span> <span id="s311">The fellow that started it was from the University of Minnesota Morris.</span> <span id="s312">He was the one that recruited these kids to go over there and sing in these churches.</span> <span id="s313">And during the time that they were there, they rode buses in the countries.</span> <span id="s314">In Poland he rode a bus, it happened that the driver spoke some English, and he told Kevin he had been at Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Mrs Stranberg: You remember.</span> <span id="s316">He said, “Thank your dad, and the American people.”</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Oh, he had been a prisoner there, and he went back to Poland, and lived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: He would have been in his twenties at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Was this a Jewish person?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s321">He had been in the hospital, either ours or one of the others.</span> <span id="s322">I’m sure he was Polish and Jewish.</span> <span id="s323">But this is a sidelight of this singing trip.</span> <span id="s324">I didn’t know the difference of Jewish people or anyone else.</span> <span id="s325">We were Lutherans, had been all our lives, never had any association with Jewish people, and I didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s326">That’s hard for you to believe, possibly, but out here in the country, like we live here, in Atwater we have one Jewish man.</span> <span id="s327">He is married now, and has a wife and one child, and they’ve adopted a couple of Koreans.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Mrs. S: The interesting thing about that is when Glenn was in the service, I lived in a big house, and one of my best friends turned out to be a Jewish girl from Boston, and I really learned a lot from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: It’s surprising now that the difference of a person -- what you find out.</span> <span id="s330">I didn’t go to high school, but I got a pretty good education in the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: I can tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Mrs.S: And the Birnbergs that had the Embers, you know?</span> <span id="s333">Our daughter worked for them when she was in high school.</span> <span id="s334">She’d go down there in the summer and take care of their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: And of course she found out that the people from the city didn’t know everything, either.</span> <span id="s336">They’d never seen anything grow!</span> <span id="s337">They’d never had a garden, had never seen even as much as a radish grow.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Mrs. S: We invited them to dinner one Sunday and they had never driven --</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: --this side of Minneapolis in a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Mrs.S: They’d always flown every place they’d been.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: So then you’re saying we’re all very provincial people.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Right.</span> <span id="s343">That’s what I mean.</span> <span id="s344">You could come out here and you wouldn’t be able to plow that field.</span> <span id="s345">I’d get down there and I wouldn’t be able to do anything you folks do.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Mrs. S: That little Birnberg boy got on the tractor, and we just almost couldn’t get him off there.</span> <span id="s347">He’d never seen anything like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: One of the funniest things was we drove out here and Mr. Birnberg said, “ What’s those square things out there?”</span> <span id="s349">They’re hay bales.</span> <span id="s350">“ But what can you do with them and how did they get there?”</span> <span id="s351">That’s how naïve other people can be too.</span> <span id="s352">Not just hick farmers.</span> <span id="s353">That’s what I was getting at.</span> <span id="s354">We both got an education.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: And you’d never seen anybody Jewish before?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: No, I never had.</span> <span id="s357">People are people, that’s all I figure, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s359">PAGE 10</span></p> <p><span id="s360">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s361">PAGE 10</span></p></body></html>
