id="s363">[_______You can’t replace anything}.</span> <span id="s364">Cannot replace it.</span> <span id="s365">So the only thing I was awaiting is jail for negligence.</span> <span id="s366">The war

id="s369">A few weeks before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s370">So almost the war saved me from going to jail.</span> <span id="s371">The war broke out; the night when the war broke out, I was on a date with a beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s372">At twelve o’clock, after midnight, I heard the artillery and the war started.</span> <span id="s373">I immediately after the date, I came home and even here, the shooting, the shelling was getting much heavier and I immediately packed my little knapsack and I start walking home with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Walking home?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Walking.</span> <span id="s376">Only by foot, I could not go any other way.</span> <span id="s377">On the way a lot of things happened.</span></p> <p><span

immediately I start going to the direction to see my family.</span> <span id="s386">I go back to Slonim.</span> <span id="s387">On the way already, the Germans were bombing the roads; the Russians were flying in trucks.</span> <span id="s388">The ones that were going were bombed.</span> <span id="s389">The villages were burning and the roads were clogged up.</span> <span id="s390">What more incident is that the Germans came with planes and start bombing the place where I was walking.</span> <span id="s391">It was a dogfight, the Russian planes came right to the place where the pilot parachuted.</span> <span id="s392">I was there when the Russians the ones that were walking too, were on foot.</span> <span id="s393">Four Russian soldiers were on foot running back to Russia, the border.</span> <span id="s394">I was there when they shoot the pilot.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: The German pilot?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: The German pilot.</span> <span id="s397">It happened that they walk away and I went after and got his gun.</span> <span id="s398">I took his gun, hid his gun and I walked to my house, back to Slonim.</span> <span id="s399">On the way, all the villages were burning and it was safe to come home.</span> <span id="s400">In fact, it happened on the road.</span> <span id="s401">Until I came to Slonim.</span> <span id="s402">Slonim was already occupied by the Germans so immediately right before I came to the city, I threw away my gun, was a pistol.</span> <span id="s403">They arrested me and they ---.</span> <span id="s404">Every male in Slonim they arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Jewish male?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: No, every male.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Every male, period?</span></p> <p><span

hair, now I’m bald headed but at that time I had hair.</span> <span id="s412">{A lot of it}.</span> <span id="s413">A lot of it and hair was very important.</span> <span id="s414">Because anybody who was a soldier, who was in the army, had a crew cut.</span> <span id="s415">So they knew that I’m not a soldier.</span> <span id="s416">Immediately they arrested me and they put me in a big yard, with the rest of Russian prisoners, a schoolyard.</span> <span id="s417">Then after the next day, they announced that anybody who is younger than a certain age, 15, 16 years old and I looked young, could go home.</span> <span id="s418">So I went.</span> <span id="s419">I was one of them to be a youngster and to run home.</span> <span id="s420">So they set up a place where you can run out and they were beating up each one as he was passed by so they can have any place where they can hit.</span> <span id="s421">But being a kid, they jumped over the gun what they had, the rifles and I got back to my house.</span> <span id="s422">When I came to the house, it’s another story but an important story.</span> <span id="s423">I came to the house.</span> <span id="s424">I didn’t see my family for maybe a couple of months.</span> <span id="s425">It was, if I’m not mistaken a Friday night.</span> <span id="s426">It was Friday.</span> <span id="s427">I came in the house.</span> <span id="s428">It was not Friday.</span> <span id="s429">They made a real nice dinner for me, the ben yorkin.</span> <span id="s430">If you notice, I have three sisters, I was the ben yorkin.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: The only son, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Only son.</span> <span id="s433">I assume that you understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Right but I’ll jut translate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: I was the ben yorkin.</span> <span id="s436">The ben yorkin came home so they made a nice dish, a nice dinner.</span> <span id="s437">Then I told them a little bit of my story, what I

raining.</span> <span id="s447">It wasn’t raining, it was striking on the shingles before we had a chance to put out the fire.</span> <span id="s448">We ran out the house, not to be burned -- we took the chance to run out in the middle of the fight.</span> <span id="s449">After we -- immediately some were arrested by the Germans right there in the yard.</span> <span id="s450">After the fight was

id="s602">So the ghetto was in September, 1941?</span> <span id="s603">{’41, yes, but it was no barbed wires at first.</span> <span id="s604">It was an open ghetto they called it.</span> <span id="s605">All of us had to wear yellow patches, not Stars of David, but a round patch, a yellow one in front of the garment and in the back.</span> <span id="s606">We were restricted to walk around in

arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: {If you were found, you would be punished.</span> <span id="s609">Then before the first action in Slonim, before the big massacre, they again shrank the ghetto, the perimeter of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s610">Again they made it smaller but it still was not very sealed off.</span> <span id="s611">Already they had barbed wire but loose}.</span> <span id="s612">But then we had the ghetto, we have four ghettos, divided by the river.</span> <span id="s613">{The river flowed through the town}.</span> <span id="s614">The river flowed through the town so the one with the larger ghetto and three small ones; all divided by a bridge and the river.</span> <span id="s615">So it was all four sides.</span> <span id="s616">One side {from the other}.</span> <span id="s617">Small ghettos but they were all connected with a bridge.</span> <span id="s618">The same bridge, the Poles used the same bridge.</span> <span id="s619">They had to pass by because it’s part of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Could you go freely among the different parts of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s622">{Yes, until it was sealed.</span> <span id="s623">At that time, that Aron is talking about, yes you could walk freely}.</span> <span id="s624">You could still walk freely.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: This was still in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: {Forty-one}.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Then at the end of the year was this big massacre?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yes, the big massacre came in November 14, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: It was hot that day, you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Yeah, it was hot.</span> <span id="s631">It was --.</span> <span

in terms of seasons or was it winter already.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yeah, it was already November 14th.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: So it was much hotter than usual?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Oh, November was already cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: You said you went to get water because you were hot.</span> <span id="s639">So you were just thirsty?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s641">That was a different time, that wasn’t this time.</span> <span id="s642">That time they only took 1,500 men.</span> <span id="s643">That was --.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Oh, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s645">I was confused then.</span> <span id="s646">Okay.</span> <span id="s647">This happened maybe only a month after the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: The first one happened only a month after the occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Okay, now it’s clear in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: The 1,500 happened a month after the occupation.</span> <span id="s651">Then the other one happened on November 14 and they killed -- that time they took out 10,000Jews and they killed them from 8 o’clock till 5.</span> <span id="s652">By chance I found out something is going to happen the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: How did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Next to our house a photographer lived.</span> <span id="s655">The Germans used to come to take pictures for their wives.</span> <span id="s656">So they made friends with the photographer.</span> <span id="s657">That was not Nazis, was the regular Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s658">This was Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s659">So he told him a secret that something is going to happen tomorrow.</span> <span id="s660">The photographer told us something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s661">Plus another sign was that they gave special scheins to special tradesmen.</span> <span id="s662">They gave special permits.</span> <span id="s663">So that was a bad sign.</span> <span id="s664">All of a sudden they gave out special permits to tradesmen but we didn’t know it, was no experience.</span> <span id="s665">We had no experience, we didn’t know anything that this kind of thing is going to happen.</span> <span id="s666">But we were ready and worried why are they giving the _________ the different Jews, craftsmen, the scheins?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: The skilled?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: {The skilled, exactly}.</span> <span id="s669">I immediately took my family, I was the head of the household, my father was killed.</span> <span id="s670">I took my family, my mother and three sisters and we went out of the ghetto and we stayed overnight in an empty house.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: How did you get out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: At that time, wasn’t hard.</span> <span id="s673">It was -- the wires -- it was patrolled but it was {loosely} Loosely.</span> <span id="s674">It wasn’t so heavily guarded.</span> <span id="s675">{Wasn’t sealed}.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: So you escaped into an abandoned house?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: In an abandoned house and we stayed there a night and a whole day.</span> <span id="s678">The next day we come back, half of the ghetto was taken out and killed.</span> <span id="s679">The rest of the other half was back to normal.</span> <span id="s680">They told them -- {10,000 Jews were killed}.</span> <span id="s681">You can fill in Lisa, you can fill me in every ---.</span> <span id="s682">{I was at the graves.</span> <span id="s683">I was one of the people that came back from the massacre}.</span> <span id="s684">Lisa came back from the massacre but Lisa knows everything what I know.</span> <span id="s685">{They were shot and I was there in the ditch}.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: You were taken with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: No, I was hiding by a Christian woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Oh, I remember now your story, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: {She would keep us and --}</span></p>

{C-i-e-p-e-l-o-w-o}.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: That was a forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: {Yes, a forest.</span> <span id="s700">I imagine that the village probably was called Ciepelowo although this was the forest of Ciepelowo}.</span> <span id="s701">But they didn’t kill them in the forest, they killed them next to the forest.</span> <span id="s702">{They killed them in the ditches near the forest}.</span> <span id="s703">Right next to the forest.</span> <span id="s704">In the forest you couldn’t dig any holes.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q; Did the Jews in the ghetto know what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yes, after.</span> <span id="s707">{Yes, we knew because people returned from the ditches.</span> <span id="s708">After}.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: People who hadn’t been killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: {Who hadn’t been killed.</span> <span id="s711">But do you know what happened?</span> <span id="s712">They went in the hospital and the Nazis got to know that people survived and that they’re there in the hospital.</span> <span id="s713">They came at night and took them out to kill them}.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: The wounded?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: {The wounded}.</span> <span id="s716">How much more time do we have?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: I just, you know.</span> <span id="s718">We’ll just get through the story, that’s fine.</span> <span id="s719">It’s not a matter of time.</span> <span id="s720">If you want to --.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Because we’ll have

id="s725">Q: Let’s just go until you want to stop and then if we’re not done, I’ll call back.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: If that’s okay.</span> <span id="s728">After the massacre, your family went back into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Were you working in the ghetto at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s732">I got a job in the ghetto and I belonged to the -- immediately joined -- we had the underground.</span> <span id="s733">Jewish underground.</span> <span id="s734">Part of them were my friends from the Hashomer Hatzair.</span> <span id="s735">We organized and our purpose was -- we didn’t have a final purpose, resistance in the ghetto or ___________the forest.</span> <span id="s736">I was part of them and another incident what happened --.</span> <span id="s737">{Carmit, after the 10,000, they shrank the ghetto again to make it smaller}.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: I worked in the b_________lager.</span> <span id="s740">It was a place where they’re accumulating --.</span> <span id="s741">The b__________lager was a big building and they took Jews from the ghetto to assort arms where they found in the fields the Russians left.</span> <span id="s742">They were repairing the arms and assorting the arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: So you learned how to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: I worked there and the head, the foreman was my friend’s father.</span> <span id="s745">He was the foreman.</span> <span id="s746">We smuggled in, we sold the arms inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s747">It was the biggest job to bring in arms to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s748">It was almost impossible because we were searched every time we came in back to the ghetto, you were searched.</span> <span id="s749">No question about it, if they find not only arms, they find food, they could get.</span> <span id="s750">Everything was in order, if anything was caught, everything was punishable by death.</span> <span id="s751">We took the chance to bring in arms.</span> <span id="s752">How did we do it is our foreman got acquainted with the two Germans, the ones that were the heads of our department.</span> <span id="s753">The two Germans, one his name Wutz, one was named Brown.</span> <span id="s754">Brown and Wutz.</span> <span id="s755">They promised to start doing business with him.</span> <span id="s756">What was the business?</span> <span id="s757">Bringing in some valuables from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s758">In return, he would give him soaps.</span> <span id="s759">Soap, I don’t know where the Germans got so much soap but they had boxes of soap.</span> <span id="s760">It was wooden boxes packed with soap.</span> <span id="s761">What we did is, we took out underneath, we took out part of the soap and we put in ammunition and grenades, part of arms, pistols, whatever we could find.</span> <span id="s762">We couldn’t find too many pistols available, but just parts and we assembled them inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s763">What we did is the foreman, you could not bring in the soap in the ghetto, how would you bring in the soap to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s764">So the Germans with the trucks when they took us home, he knew already the guards, the German guards at the entrance, they used to drive in with the truck in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s765">{and unload}.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: And he thought he was just giving you soap?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s768">He thought that somebody was using the soap for his business.</span> <span id="s769">That’s the way we got arms.</span> <span id="s770">We were being organized until there came an order that we should go to the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: What date?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: That was the summer -- November 14 was the ghetto -- that was probably February of ’42, the beginning of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Who gave this order?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: I don’t know, the underground, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s775">The underground worked very secret.</span> <span id="s776">You don’t know who belongs to it.</span> <span id="s777">You only know a few people around.</span> <span id="s778">You don’t know the _______, you don’t know how it works.</span> <span id="s779">The only thing --.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: You just get your order?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: I got only the order that I should come to – his name was Archibond.</span> <span id="s782">{Yes, he still lives in Israel, Aron’s leader}.</span> <span id="s783">That I should come to Archibond’s house at 7 o’clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s784">I came home from work and I got the order so I went there to the house.</span> <span id="s785">Something with me, I don’t remember, a sweatshirt or shirt or sweater and a piece of bread because I had _________.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Microphone fell off.</span> <span

what-do-you-call members of Hashomer Hatzair.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s792">So you went to his house?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s794">I

girlfriend.</span> <span id="s815">We were all the time together.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Lisa, were you working in the warehouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">L: {No}</span></p> <p><span

next door to her.</span> <span id="s822">I went to visit to my friend and that’s where I met Lisa.</span> <span id="s823">She was that time sixteen.</span> <span id="s824">{Fifteen.</span> <span

right}.</span> <span id="s836">I’m going to tell you an incident how we survived.</span> <span id="s837">I’m talking now in ’42.</span> <span id="s838">Ten thousand Jews in the ghetto in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Ten thousand Jews were left?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Left.</span> <span id="s841">It was June.</span> <span id="s842">{June 29th}.</span> <span

what?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: In the warehouse.</span> <span id="s848">I was working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s849">We had two officers, German captains and two or three regular Germans.</span> <span id="s850">{Wehrmacht, all Wehrmacht}.</span> <span id="s851">Was no Gestapo, that was Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s852">This was a very good job, very good pay in food, mainly food.</span> <span id="s853">I had plenty of food for me, had plenty of food for my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s854">Goodies like fried food, we could have everything when we were working there.</span> <span id="s855">You know, the Germans had plenty of food.</span> <span id="s856">On the job, we had all the food but on June 29, they surrounded the ghetto.</span> <span id="s857">They blocked up the ghetto; a special kommando came into the city and they announced nobody could go out to work.</span> <span id="s858">Nobody could go in or out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s859">{By this time, the ghetto was already sealed.</span> <span id="s860">It was surrounded by barbed wires, tightly, with guards.</span> <span id="s861">It wasn’t an open ghetto anymore}.</span> <span id="s862">It’s no way you can get out.</span> <span id="s863">{No way you can get out}.</span> <span id="s864">No way you can get out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s865">In the same evening, this was on a Sunday, the special kommando where they came into town, they needed schnapps.</span> <span id="s866">They needed liquor and rations, food.</span> <span id="s867">So they came to my boss, the officer, his name was Mr. Miller.</span> <span id="s868">They came to Miller and they asked him that he should give them, should go and give them ration of food.</span> <span id="s869">He told them I cannot give you any food unless you give me the eight Jews.</span> <span id="s870">{You release the eight Jews from the ghetto that work in my p_________, I’ll give you the food.</span> <span id="s871">Because the Germans were only supervisors; they did the labor}.</span> <span id="s872">We did the labor; They didn’t even now how to fill an order.</span> <span id="s873">{They had to unload also; it all came in huge quantities}.</span> <span id="s874">We had to unload so he told them he is going to take care of this.</span> <span id="s875">The next morning about six o’clock in the morning, the head of the kommando came into Miller, the captain of the German and they brought him a special permit to take out the eight Jews.</span> <span id="s876">He came to the gate and he told the German and the Jewish police to ask for Aron Dereczyaski and the rest of them.</span> <span id="s877">Come out to the gate.</span> <span id="s878">The Jewish policeman came to my house; he knocked in the middle of the morning.</span> <span id="s879">By that time I want you to know that everybody was hiding in hiding places.</span> <span id="s880">Already we made hiding places in getting ready when the action comes so we build a hiding place.</span> <span id="s881">But I was still on the lookout and they came to my house and asked for me, Aron Dereczyaski.</span> <span id="s882">They told him, he was smart enough, they told him that Mr. Miller was waiting at the gate.</span> <span id="s883">I knew when he mentioned the word Miller I knew that it’s legit, that I can come out and see Mr. Miller.</span> <span id="s884">The captain was telling me to get all the people together and in half an hour he’ll be back and we’ll go out to work.</span> <span id="s885">All right, he gave us a________; he says don’t worry --.</span> <span id="s886">{Nothing will happen to the Jews}.</span> <span id="s887">Nothing will happen to the Jews They found the underground organization on the Polish side.</span> <span id="s888">The Poles are organizing; they have an underground organization so we are going, the Germans, he said “we” the Germans are coming to go into the ghetto to check if the Poles are not hiding in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s889">That was the excuse.</span> <span id="s890">That’s what they told me.</span> <span id="s891">But surely enough, we didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s892">{Nobody believed it}.</span> <span id="s893">I got all the people.</span> <span id="s894">{that worked in different places} in the p_________.</span> <span id="s895">We got out five minutes to seven.</span> <span id="s896">Seven o’clock, the action started; we were only half a block away.</span> <span id="s897">We could see on the outside how all the German tanks and trucks and army and ammunition and machine guns are all pointing to the ghettos.</span> <span id="s898">Everything was at the end but we still walked to the p________, to the place where I was working.</span> <span id="s899">A block or two blocks away, we could hear already the shooting coming into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s900">We were just outside before.</span> <span id="s901">I think we’re going to cut off here and I’ll finish the story --.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: That time --.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: And Lisa was not with you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: No.</span> <span id="s906">{No, I was hiding}.</span> <span id="s907">I came out and I changed her into men’s clothes and I took her out.</span> <span id="s908">{That was later, that was Wednesday, Thursday}.</span> <span id="s909">Yeah, on the third day.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Okay, do you want to start from there when we speak again?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Yes, we’ll start right there from the p_______.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Okay, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: When is the best time for --?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Let me stop the tape.</span> <span id="s915">-------------No, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: No.</span> <span id="s917">Unless you think something over there.</span> <span id="s918">You want to clarify something.</span> <span id="s919">Miller took us out, took out eight of us and the minute maybe we start walking out of the ghetto, I want you to know that we are the only one 8 people what they took out from the ghetto before the action started.</span> <span id="s920">The action started exactly at seven o’clock but this story happened when they took us out, that happened before.</span> <span id="s921">The minute we walked out of the ghetto we could see all the special groups are all surround the ghetto with machine guns pointing at the ghetto like a real armed camp.</span> <span id="s922">You could see that like, for me, it was clear that the ghetto is being liquidated and it looks like nobody is going to be able to survive.</span> <span id="s923">Sure enough, they will not be able (?)</span> <span id="s924">to get out with life.</span> <span id="s925">We start walking and on the way we were stopped and checked our documents again.</span> <span id="s926">The high officer stopped us and checked us -- our permit.</span> <span id="s927">He let us go and it happened that Miller knew all the big shots because they all used to come to him for different kind of parties that they made.</span> <span id="s928">Meanwhile all the big important Gestapo and Wehrmacht people was invited to his house.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Who is Mr. Miller?</span> <span id="s930">Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s932">Miller was the --.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Was he just a local German?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: A German, the head of the p________.</span> <span id="s935">{He wasn’t a local, he was a Wehrmacht}.</span> <span id="s936">He was a Wehrmacht, a captain.</span> <span id="s937">He was a Wehrmacht captain.</span> <span id="s938">We went to the same place where I was working because there it was p________, that’s the name of it in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: That was the warehouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: The warehouse where they used to give out the food.</span> <span id="s941">We stayed over there during the day.</span> <span id="s942">You could hear and the shooting, you could hear all day and they are taking out people.</span> <span id="s943">I mean they’re shooting in the place and we heard -- the other Germans were telling us that they’re taking out Jews whom they can find.</span> <span id="s944">They’re putting on trucks and they’re taking them out; outside the city, outside of town in the direction of Ciepelowo how-do-you-spell-it?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: We spelled it yesterday.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: No, yesterday we had --.</span> <span id="s947">No, Ciepelowo {C-i-e} We had a different place.</span> <span id="s948">{C_______ but you had Ciepelowo where they killed the 1,200 men}.</span> <span id="s949">Oh, Ciepelowo we had Thursday.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s951">So Ciepelowo was first when they took out the men and it was also here when they were liquidating the ghetto, is that the same place?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Well, the first time they take out near Ciepelowo, the 1,200 men.</span> <span id="s953">Then the 10,000 to Pietralowicze.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: {P-i-e-t-r-a-l-o-w-i-c-z-e, Pietralowicze}.</span> <span id="s956">Now Pietralowicze that was on the --.</span> <span id="s957">{That was on the ____________} That was on November 14th.</span> <span id="s958">This time they took to Ciepelowo, in the direction of Ciepelowo.</span> <span id="s959">Now, in the place where I was working, you could see a small window in the warehouse, you could see a small little lake and past the lake you could see the hills of Ciepelowo where they were killing the Jews.</span> <span id="s960">During the day, later in the day, you could already see that people were getting killed right there.</span> <span id="s961">We could see it through the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: While this was happening, they were making you unload food?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Yes, while this was happening, we were working regular on our job like every other day.</span> <span id="s964">Now when it came at night, he did not send us back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s965">He let us stay in the p_______ in this place, to stay overnight.</span> <span id="s966">We did not return after the first day to the ghetto, we stayed there overnight.</span> <span id="s967">The action was going on for three or four days in Slonim.</span> <span id="s968">At that time, they killed 10,000 people or 9,000, 9,000.</span> <span id="s969">In the beginning they could not find anybody inside the ghetto because everybody was hiding so by the middle of the first day, they put the ghetto on fire.</span> <span id="s970">They burned two or three ghettos; it was four ghettos so two or three parts they put on fire.</span> <span id="s971">It was a resistance in one ghetto, a small resistance when one Jewish fellow came out.</span> <span id="s972">He was a friend of mine and he came out with the hand grenades.</span> <span id="s973">He threw a hand grenade on the German truck and he killed some Germans.</span> <span id="s974">The Germans got real mad so they put the ghetto on fire.</span> <span id="s975">This particular ghetto, that was the name of the ghetto was Japinka that was part of the Slonim ghettos, part of the four ghettos.</span> <span id="s976">We were still sitting in the place and working.</span> <span id="s977">I mean in the same place the p______.</span> <span id="s978">On the third day, on a Wednesday, on Wednesday, on the third day, I asked that captain Miller to --.</span> <span id="s979">I offered him --.</span> <span id="s980">On Tuesday the next day I went to a bakery shop to get some bread what we used to do it every day.</span> <span id="s981">Going to the bakery shop, we had to cross the ghetto because the one street the one we had to pass belonged to --.</span> <span id="s982">That was the street that the Poles traveled on it and the Jews walked on it when we could; when they took us for slave labor.</span> <span id="s983">I went with the covered-up truck with a German, his name was Hans and I passed by the ghetto.</span> <span id="s984">I could see the ghetto on fire; I could see people burning on fire, to the water because the little lake, the river was passing by.</span> <span id="s985">People were burning their clothes so they were jumping in the water of the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Were they found by the Germans and then shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: The Germans were shooting at them.</span> <span id="s988">They were killed anyway.</span> <span id="s989">The Germans were standing on the bridge and they saw anybody running in the water, they were shooting at them.</span> <span id="s990">They were killed anyway.</span> <span id="s991">Then we returned back to the p_______, the place of work.</span> <span id="s992">This was the first day, the second day.</span> <span id="s993">On the third day, I got an idea and I came up to the captain and I tell him, Mr. Miller, if you --.</span> <span id="s994">By that time, it quiet down already.</span> <span id="s995">The first day or the second day, they didn’t leave anybody to live.</span> <span id="s996">Anybody they found, they killed them on the place, they put them on the truck and they took him to Ciepelowo, to kill.</span> <span id="s997">But they realized that maybe they should leave some people arrest and take them someplace so the other ones will start coming out from the hiding places.</span> <span id="s998">So the rumor came out that anybody who comes out -- they announce on the loudspeakers that anybody going to come out, they’re going to live.</span> <span id="s999">The action is over and this kind of stories.</span> <span id="s1000">It was getting a little bit more quiet in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1001">Some Jews came out and they took them, arrested them and they took them over to the jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: The ghetto jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: No, not a ghetto jail.</span> <span id="s1004">Before the war was a regular jail.</span> <span id="s1005">.</span> <span id="s1006">So they took them back to the jail, to the yard by the jail.</span> <span id="s1007">They accumulated people over there and then they put them to the right and to the left.</span> <span id="s1008">{They made a selection, who’s going to live and who to die}.</span> <span id="s1009">They put them on trucks and sent them to be slaughtered.</span> <span id="s1010">A few of them, the ones that would get special permits, they let them out.</span> <span id="s1011">I could see -- by that time, Captain Miller came and he gave me the special schein, a small little ticket about the size of -- maybe 4 inches by 4 inches.</span> <span id="s1012">Maybe smaller 3 inches, 3 or 4 inches with a stamp of the _______ commissar.</span> <span id="s1013">My number was, I don’t remember but I think it was 4 or 5.</span> <span id="s1014">He gave us all eight and we had the first numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: These were the special permits which allowed you --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Which allowed us for now to live.</span> <span id="s1017">That was only one document that we had, that we could show that we have a schein.</span> <span id="s1018">Then anybody what they had let out from the jail, was somebody the Germans recognized.</span> <span id="s1019">The German came and took him out like a special carpenter, a special shoemaker.</span> <span id="s1020">One of the Gestapos somebody recognized him, he took him out and he gave him special schein.</span> <span id="s1021">By that time, they took us out and they gave us 100________.</span> <span id="s1022">By that time they gave us a new building where I had worked before the B_______ lager the place where they were accumulating the arms, to sort the arms, the place where I have my job.</span> <span id="s1023">They gave us over there two buildings and anybody they gave the scheins, they sent him over there where they could sleep.</span> <span id="s1024">At the same time they told the Germans told us that we are not going to sleep any more in the p_______ but we’ll be able to sleep in the new place.</span> <span id="s1025">At the same time, I came to Miller and I told him, I say, if you can get me a special permit to go into the ghetto, I will get you anything what you want.</span> <span id="s1026">He was very much interested in gold and chandeliers and {silver,_______ whatever he can}.</span> <span id="s1027">Whatever I can to benefit him and then he could send it home.</span> <span id="s1028">He wasn’t doing it from a good heart in the first place, he was doing it for what he would get paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Do you think he had a good heart in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1031">He did only to us, only to take his eight Jews.</span> <span id="s1032">Otherwise he was a killer to somebody else.</span> <span id="s1033">{In fact, I was told he was a killer in _________ in a different city}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: How was your relationship with him?</span> <span id="s1035">Were you afraid of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Yes, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1037">Yeah, but we had a relationship.</span> <span id="s1038">Him, by himself, I wasn’t afraid that he’s going to take the gun and kill me even if he feels like I did something wrong with my job.</span> <span id="s1039">He wouldn’t kill me, he would reprimand me but he wouldn’t kill me.</span> <span id="s1040">We had after working together, we had a relationship because we were good workers and he could depend on us.</span> <span id="s1041">At that time, he went to the _______commissar and got the special permits to get into the ghetto and he gave me, four of us, permits for four people.</span> <span id="s1042">My intention was if we’re going inside the ghetto and see if I can get in touch and can find my family and see if I can find Lisa.</span> <span id="s1043">I knew approximately where they were hiding.</span> <span id="s1044">In my house, I helped build the hiding places.</span> <span id="s1045">I knew in my house, 31 people were hiding under the floor that we dug out.</span> <span id="s1046">These 31 were hiding under the floor _______ so I knew because I was part of the people helping to build.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Lisa, were you also hiding in that house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: {No}.</span> <span id="s1049">Lisa was hiding in --.</span> <span id="s1050">{I was hiding in a shed in the yard where the house that we lived}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">She was hiding in the shack.</span> <span id="s1052">When I got the permit for four of us I’m included, we went inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1053">I went to the place where I lived.</span> <span id="s1054">I found the people in hiding.</span> <span id="s1055">I could not take them out because I could not help them.</span> <span id="s1056">The only thing I helped them was to give them food, water.</span> <span id="s1057">I told them what the situation is and I could not take out my mother or sisters because the other ones wouldn’t let me.</span> <span id="s1058">Because that’s the only way they could have the contact is if my family is there.</span> <span id="s1059">Because they know if I can help, I will take them out.</span> <span id="s1060">I will help them.</span> <span id="s1061">everybody was looking for how they can save their own life so they would not let anybody take my family.</span> <span id="s1062">I wanted to take one of my sisters.</span> <span id="s1063">I couldn’t take any more.</span> <span id="s1064">I left them there and I went on the way back to the gate.</span> <span id="s1065">I had to pass by Lisa’s house.</span> <span id="s1066">Lisa’s home was only about four or five homes away from mine.</span> <span id="s1067">{Was kitty-cornered}.</span> <span id="s1068">On one side to the other side --.</span> <span id="s1069">I came to Lisa’s place, I looked in the place where they’re supposed to hide and the malina was opened.</span> <span id="s1070">The Germans discovered the malina, they shot the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">(END OF SIDE B. TAPE 1)</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: {Yes, S-c-h-e-i-n}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: And then Malina?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: {But you make sure that it is spelled right, the German}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Okay, I’ll check it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Malina is the hiding place.</span> <span id="s1077">M-a-l-i-n-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: That’s in German or Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Well, uh --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: They called it that in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: A ghetto term?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: A ghetto, __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: I’ll start a little bit before in case --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: So you were looking at Lisa’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Malina where we were supposed to hide.</span> <span id="s1088">The place in Malina, the hiding place, was discovered where they took out the people.</span> <span id="s1089">I didn’t give up and I looked for Lisa a little bit longer.</span> <span id="s1090">I went to the back, in the back was a small little yard, was a little shack.</span> <span id="s1091">I went to that shack and I start calling in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1092">I say is anybody hiding?</span> <span id="s1093">{That’s Aron, that’s Aron, Lisa, are you hiding?}</span> <span id="s1094">After a short while, I was calling their name, Lisa heard my voice and she was there hiding with her father and little brother.</span> <span id="s1095">Before long, Lisa came down from the hiding place and I made an immediate decision that I’m going to take her out.</span> <span id="s1096">Now she’s a young girl, she was just 16.</span> <span id="s1097">She was sixteen years old, ’42 – fifteen years old.</span> <span id="s1098">{I was 15, 15 ½}.</span> <span id="s1099">Fifteen years old, very pretty, a good-looking girl.</span> <span id="s1100">I decided that I’m going to take her out.</span> <span id="s1101">So she parted with her father and brother.</span> <span id="s1102">I took her next door to a place, not where she lived but a cousin lived from where she lived, right next door to each other.</span> <span id="s1103">I took her with a little attic, I mean a little -- like a second floor.</span> <span id="s1104">I went down in the house and I found a pair of pants and a jacket and a scissor.</span> <span id="s1105">I looked all the way around.</span> <span id="s1106">I cut her hair, I put her boy’s clothes, men’s clothes and a cap and I made her look like a boy.</span> <span id="s1107">I took some PX wires, electric wires and I covered all the way around her neck.</span> <span id="s1108">I did the same thing to another fellow and we had a couple of chandeliers so she carried a chandelier on top of her shoulder and the other fellow.</span> <span id="s1109">We were four, the other fellows helped me do it by cooperating; I mean getting the chandeliers, both of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Why did you take the wire?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: I found it, I pulled out some wires from the home because the home had a lot of wires.</span> <span id="s1112">They’re like extension wires; was running all over the apartments because we didn’t have any electricity so they made their own.</span> <span id="s1113">I mean we had electricity but wasn’t like here, was plenty wires.</span> <span id="s1114">{The electrical wires were always on the outside in Europe in the old homes.</span> <span id="s1115">You didn’t have to go in the wall to pull them out, they were hanging}.</span> <span id="s1116">Hanging, so I pulled them out wires from the things and put them all the way around her neck.</span> <span id="s1117">The main thing is she carried the chandeliers so she put the chandeliers --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Why did you put the wires around her neck?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Around the neck, you know like a loop.</span> <span id="s1120">You know like a big loop of wires, covered up from the neck, going down to the waist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1122">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: {Around my neck sort of, I wound them around my neck and then they were hanging}.</span> <span id="s1124">They were hanging loose and the main thing is I found a couple chandeliers where they kept them _________ so I took the chandeliers.</span> <span id="s1125">She was carrying the chandeliers; then I gave her my schein, my permit to leave.</span> <span id="s1126">I gave it to her hoping and thinking in case if I’m caught without it that some way Miller will take my up.</span> <span id="s1127">He will get me out in case if I am arrested.</span> <span id="s1128">All five of us were walking through the gate.</span> <span id="s1129">I took that white piece of paper what he gave me with the special permit for four.</span> <span id="s1130">I came to the gate and the police were German guards were staying right by the exit of the gate and I’m already walking out.</span> <span id="s1131">{You waved it}.</span> <span id="s1132">I waved that piece of paper; I says here’s my permit and here’s my four men.</span> <span id="s1133">He didn’t check, he didn’t look.</span> <span id="s1134">{He didn’t look at the permit}.</span> <span id="s1135">He didn’t look at the permit and he said for four men and he let us through.</span> <span id="s1136">From there I went all the way to the prefanza, to my place of work.</span> <span id="s1137">By the way, coming through the ghetto, the German dropped us off, the same guy that told us we would -- Fritz, it was Fritz, not Hans, it was Fritz.</span> <span id="s1138">Fritz dropped us off the first time to come in, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1139">Then what we supposed to do is; Miller and the rest of the Germans, they live across the street from the gate, right across.</span> <span id="s1140">Almost a little kiddie car.</span> <span id="s1141">{They lived in a beautiful Jewish home, they requisitioned}.</span> <span id="s1142">So they lived over there so my -- someone else, can you hold on a second?</span> <span id="s1143">Then we took the goods, whatever we were taking with us, we took it there.</span> <span id="s1144">{For Miller, all the things we had some silver pieces and chandeliers.</span> <span id="s1145">We found a watch here and there}.</span> <span id="s1146">Whatever, all the valuables what we took, I took across the street and left in Miller’s house.</span> <span id="s1147">Now we came in Miller’s house, another problem.</span> <span id="s1148">How do I get Lisa to the work place, where I live.</span> <span id="s1149">I came to Miller, Miller was still home at that particular time, for lunch or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1150">I came to Miller; I asked him, I told him that I found my sister; how can we save her?</span> <span id="s1151">So his answer was this place is not for hiding Jews.</span> <span id="s1152">{My place is not for hiding Jews, get her out of here immediately}.</span> <span id="s1153">Immediately.</span> <span id="s1154">I took her out and she went into the basement.</span> <span id="s1155">He didn’t follow or look for anything.</span> <span id="s1156">It was a basement and she was hiding in the basement, in Miller’s basement.</span> <span id="s1157">Over there, after a while, Miller left.</span> <span id="s1158">Another German was there.</span> <span id="s1159">{Also there was a young Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s1160">I really wanted to insert this.</span> <span id="s1161">There was a young Jewish boy that was working for them like a mascot, polishing their boots and shoes and helping the cleaning woman with chop the wood and everything.</span> <span id="s1162">He came down and he was sort of my protector.</span> <span id="s1163">He kept on telling me not to worry, not to worry, that he’ll protect me, that he’ll do everything that is possible.</span> <span id="s1164">He’ll never let the maids go down.</span> <span id="s1165">He will always run to the basement to bring whatever is necessary}.</span> <span id="s1166">Now that’s a --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: How long were you in the basement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: In the basement, maybe a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s1169">{Couple of hours}.</span> <span id="s1170">Now comes the main story too.</span> <span id="s1171">I mean not the main story but it’s an important story.</span> <span id="s1172">When Miller left, was another captain with him, by the name Bauer.</span> <span id="s1173">Bauer is the name.</span> <span id="s1174">{I think Bauer is spelled B-a-u-e-r}.</span> <span id="s1175">Here was the only one German was here since the time of the war what I knew that he was righteous.</span> <span id="s1176">People always don’t want to hear this; we don’t like to tell the story.</span> <span id="s1177">I mean we don’t like to follow through but that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1178">{When we give testimony, we have to give it exactly the way it was}.</span> <span id="s1179">That’s right when we give testimony, we want to give it the way it was.</span> <span id="s1180">Bauer, after he left --.</span> <span id="s1181">{After Miller left, Aron approached Bauer}.</span> <span id="s1182">No, the night before.</span> <span id="s1183">When I was sleeping in the _______, I noticed that Bauer was talking to himself not far from me.</span> <span id="s1184">He was holding his hand on his head and he was saying, ‘I cannot believe it, how my people can do this kind of atrocities’.</span> <span id="s1185">He was almost crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: To himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Yeah, not that he made any comment to anybody.</span> <span id="s1188">But I noticed it.</span> <span id="s1189">{Aron overheard it, talking to himself}.</span> <span id="s1190">I overheard it so when Miller left, Bauer was in the house.</span> <span id="s1191">I walked up to Bauer and I told him, Captain, I say, I have my sister here.</span> <span id="s1192">Can you help me?</span> <span id="s1193">He said where is she?</span> <span id="s1194">I say in the basement.</span> <span id="s1195">He came down with me in the basement and the first thing he says, don’t worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">L: {Well, when he came down to the basement, I thought he came down to kill me}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: He walked down with me to the basement and he took a look at her.</span> <span id="s1198">She was sitting like a little, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1199">All curled up in a corner, hidden.</span> <span id="s1200">He takes a look at her and he says, she looks like a boy.</span> <span id="s1201">Are you a girl?</span> <span id="s1202">She says yes.</span> <span id="s1203">Do you have your clothes, your girl’s clothes?</span> <span id="s1204">She says yes.</span> <span id="s1205">He says, take off the men’s clothes and get dressed like you’re being yourself.</span> <span id="s1206">Get back in your girl’s clothes and I’ll take you to the work place.</span> <span id="s1207">He said, you’ll walk with me on the sidewalk because Jews were not allowed to walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s1208">If there is any black crow, he called it.</span> <span id="s1209">{The Ukrainians that were policing -- he called them the black crows}.</span> <span id="s1210">Anybody that stops him, I’ll kill him on the place.</span> <span id="s1211">Lisa left with him and --.</span> <span id="s1212">{I came with him to the ______.</span> <span id="s1213">Nobody stopped us, Nobody dared to stop him.</span> <span id="s1214">He was a high-ranking Wehrmacht man, a German and nobody stopped us}.</span> <span id="s1215">We made it through the _________back to the _________, to the workplace.</span> <span id="s1216">I was waiting over there already and I saw when Lisa came so Miller, what’s-his-name, Bauer told us to go because Miller was in the work place.</span> <span id="s1217">So Bauer told them to hide in – well it was like an open basement under the warehouse.</span> <span id="s1218">He says you hide over there.</span> <span id="s1219">He walked in and I saw Lisa coming.</span> <span id="s1220">After a little while, when Miller was busy in his office, and I found the right opportunity, I took her in, in the p_______, in the warehouse.</span> <span id="s1221">In the warehouse had thousands of sacks lined up.</span> <span id="s1222">It was sugar sacks, it was flour sacks, {flour, wheat, corn} all different kinds of sacks piled up in four or five high.</span> <span id="s1223">Straightened it out like by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1224">I immediately made a hiding place, I took out two sacks and made a hiding place for Lisa wit the sacks.</span> <span id="s1225">She stayed there for the next night --.</span> <span id="s1226">{They marked the sacks with a sign where to find me} where to find her {it was several blocks long this warehouse with all this flour in the sacks}.</span> <span id="s1227">Tell her what happened through the night.</span> <span id="s1228">{During the night I was practically devoured by rats}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: So she went out from the hiding place and she sit on top of the sacks.</span> <span id="s1231">{I hit them with all my strength.</span> <span id="s1232">I had to raise the sack}.</span> <span id="s1233">Alright I’ll talk.</span> <span id="s1234">{See that time I was afraid that I was going to be devoured by the rats.</span> <span id="s1235">I sat on top of the rats.</span> <span id="s1236">I sat and I would run away as soon as the rats would come.</span> <span id="s1237">Then when it start -- day came, I was afraid to sit there for somebody to find me.</span> <span id="s1238">So I went back into the hole}.</span> <span id="s1239">The next day I got a permit for her, a special schein from Miller.</span> <span id="s1240">I told her --what-you-call --- and I took over to the place where everybody else.</span> <span id="s1241">I, in return, took another permit.</span> <span id="s1242">With the same permit I went in next day; I took out two of my sisters and I brought them to the _______lager.</span> <span id="s1243">I got to the new place where they living but I got special permit, two scheins for my sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: From whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: So the next day I took out two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Who did you get the permits from?</span> <span id="s1247">Bauer or Miller?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Miller.</span> <span id="s1249">{By this time, why don’t you say by this time --} by this time already anybody who {any Jew} any Jew who could already get a --they let already {they decided to stop the massacre and let everybody come out --}</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Let people work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: {from the hiding places to shrink the ghetto and take them all at once}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: So then all the Jews that were left were put to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: No.</span> <span id="s1254">{No, it was sort of like a stalemate}.</span> <span id="s1255">A stalemate.</span> <span id="s1256">Bu they gave in two ghettos.</span> <span id="s1257">One was in the building where I stayed and then they gave them in another little ghetto.</span> <span id="s1258">They made everybody who survived, they made them you can leave and this because the psychology of the Germans always to shrink the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1259">Instead looking for ten or twenty blocks now they have only one building left over.</span> <span id="s1260">But they made other ghettos with another couple buildings.</span> <span id="s1261">The next time if they wanted to liquidate the ghettos they have only two small buildings or three buildings to go in there and arrest them and take them out and kill them.</span> <span id="s1262">That was their way of -- {Carmit, for reference really.</span> <span id="s1263">Evidently we left that summer but the ghetto was still left on for a while.</span> <span id="s1264">Some people did go out to work.</span> <span id="s1265">You know that they had their special shoemakers and the special tailors and whoever for a very short while}.</span> <span id="s1266">But we didn’t {we weren’t there already}.</span> <span id="s1267">We weren’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: I’m wondering how you got the passes for your sisters and for Lisa exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: I gave Miller a couple of gold coins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1271">And the same for Lisa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: The same for Lisa too.</span> <span id="s1273">For money he would do it.</span> <span id="s1274">At that time it was no problem already.</span> <span id="s1275">He wouldn’t give it out, I mean he wouldn’t help but for money he would give me the schein because at that time it was easy already to get a schein.</span> <span id="s1276">But I didn’t know and I was taking a chance.</span> <span id="s1277">By the way we’re writing a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Yeah, it should be ready probably maybe by the end of this year.</span> <span id="s1280">We’ve been writing it for six years.</span> <span id="s1281">If you know, it’s quite a bit stories what we’re telling you but a lot of them I skipped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: You’ll have to send a copy to our library.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: {Yes, we will} Oh, yes. }</span> <span id="s1284">We should only live long enough to have it done}.</span> <span id="s1285">Well, this year should be done, we’re working six years on it.</span> <span id="s1286">Mainly we want to have it like a teaching book too.</span> <span id="s1287">People read, they should know the killing, what’s his name heard a lot of our stories.</span> <span id="s1288">L______.</span> <span id="s1289">You heard about L_______?</span> <span id="s1290">{He’s the head of the Righteous at Yad Vashem} He’s the head of the Righteous.</span> <span id="s1291">He says, Aron, Lisa you are the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1292">Different aspects of -- it’s tremendous what the people lived through in camp.</span> <span id="s1293">Most of it is the story of suffering but it’s terrible.</span> <span id="s1294">I mean it’s no -- we cannot make it less but ours is like much more variety of different kind of stories.</span> <span id="s1295">What happened in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1296">All right and we survived there.</span> <span id="s1297">From there we left --.</span> <span id="s1298">{Aron also did not tell you that he was able to take out his mother and sister, baby sister}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: So you took out the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: I took out the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s1301">But my mother and sister, I took out from jail.</span> <span id="s1302">They were arrested and I took them out from jail.</span> <span id="s1303">I took out, I saved all my family by that time.</span> <span id="s1304">Then I made a contact through a friend, a White Russian woman.</span> <span id="s1305">{A farmer woman} A farmer woman what she took us with a horse and buggy from Slonim to Wishnoy R-o {There’s a _______on the o} z-a-n-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: This is the woman’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1308">This is the place, the name of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: That she took you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: {Yes, and Rozana was already in the Third Reich}.</span> <span id="s1311">And Rozana was approximately 20, 25 kilometers, maybe not putting any mileage, I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s1312">This woman took us from Slonim, at night -- I met her outside of town -- and she took us to Rozana.</span> <span id="s1313">In Rozana, I was, again I’ll make it fast -- I was arrested there and the Polish police what she knew, the local police, which probably was a made-up deal.</span> <span id="s1314">They came in in the morning and they took away everything from us but they didn’t arrest us.</span> <span id="s1315">The reason why probably they didn’t arrest us because if they would arrest us, we would tell them that somebody took away all the valuables.</span> <span id="s1316">So this way they took away.</span> <span id="s1317">Away from there, in Rozana, I got in touch with the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1318">The Judenrat gave us transportation to go to V------.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: The Judenrat where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: {In Rozana}</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: In Rozana?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: The Judenrat in Rozana helped us to get transportation t Zolkowyski.</span> <span id="s1323">{Z-o-l-k-o-w-y-s-k-i}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: I went to _______to pick up transportation to Zolkowyski.</span> <span id="s1326">We came to Zolkowyski, we got in touch with immediately, the same thing, with the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1327">The Judentrat found a place for us to stay.</span> <span id="s1328">It was a place a lot of survivors that came from different cities.</span> <span id="s1329">Because this was already -- [towns, towns} towns, because this was already the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s1330">But that time they were not killing anybody yet.</span> <span id="s1331">{It was summer of ‘42} Yeah, late summer of ’42.</span> <span id="s1332">This was already August, August of 1942.</span> <span id="s1333">Now that was my terrible decision that I can never forgive myself but I couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s1334">I had to make up my mind which direction do I go.</span> <span id="s1335">I had a choice, to go from Zolkowyski or to Grodno or to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s1336">In Grodno I knew that Lisa went.</span> <span id="s1337">Lisa left by herself with her father and brother.</span> <span id="s1338">They left the place in Slonim a couple of days, maybe a week before I left.</span> <span id="s1339">I split up with Lisa because her father and brother survived too.</span> <span id="s1340">So she went -- she stayed with me part of the time but to leave Slonim, she left with her father and her brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: To Biaystok?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: {No, to Grodno} to Grodno.</span> <span id="s1343">I was left with my mother and the three sisters.</span> <span id="s1344">I took a different route with a different contact too.</span> <span id="s1345">I found that woman, the one who took us to Wishnoy and to Zolkowyski.</span> <span id="s1346">When I came Zolkowyski, they told us you can go two ways where a big Jewish ghetto is.</span> <span id="s1347">One is in Grodno, one is Zolkowyski, {Bialystok} one is Bialystok.</span> <span id="s1348">So I had to make up my decision.</span> <span id="s1349">So I made up that time my decision that for me to survive, I can only survive {he realized at that time that he could not survive with a family}, as a family unit.</span> <span id="s1350">The only way if I can survive for me being involved with the underground, I left the underground because on account of the family.</span> <span id="s1351">Being a young man, I had to make the decision that if I have to go away to live, I am going to go.</span> <span id="s1352">I could only go to the underground if I can go by myself.</span> <span id="s1353">I probably couldn’t help them anyway.</span> <span id="s1354">There was no way for me to help them.</span> <span id="s1355">{Can you imagine having to make that kind of decision?}</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: So I had to make that decision and that was my worst decision in life -- because I never see them anymore.</span> <span id="s1358">They went to Bialystok and I went to Grodno.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Now, did you, did they want to go to Bialystok?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Did they want to go to Bialystok?</span> <span id="s1361">It wouldn’t make any difference for them.</span> <span id="s1362">Yes, they had some friend, some family were there in Bialystok, Grodno was real strange for them.</span> <span id="s1363">The only reason why I went to Grodno probably is maybe I’ll see Lisa there.</span> <span id="s1364">Otherwise I would go to Bialystok too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: So they all decided to go to Bialystok and then you said no, I’m going to Grodno?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1367">I had to make the decision that I’m going to get out and I’m going to go my way.</span> <span id="s1368">Otherwise, I would go to Bialystok too.</span> <span id="s1369">On a beer truck, they took us to the Judenrat from Zolkowyski helped us to _____ to transportation to Grodno and I went to Grodno.</span> <span id="s1370">Being in Grodno I came to _______.</span> <span id="s1371">I’ll tell you the story in Grodno.</span> <span id="s1372">I arrived in Grodno, I found Lisa, I moved in in the same place that they lived.</span> <span id="s1373">They had a little space in their room with three or four other families.</span> <span id="s1374">They made room for me; they put a mattress on the floor for me to sleep too.</span> <span id="s1375">I stayed in Grodno and my only one purpose was, now when I’m in Grodno is how I can get in touch with the underground.</span> <span id="s1376">There was no other way for me to survive.</span> <span id="s1377">Already my decision was made; the only way you can survive.</span> <span id="s1378">I had no doubt that liquidation is going to come to Gr_____too.</span> <span id="s1379">So the only way I was looking around is how I can find a contact with the underground.</span> <span id="s1380">I lived through all the time in the Grodno ghetto.</span> <span id="s1381">I did not make any contact with the underground.</span> <span id="s1382">You can imagine how hard it was for a young man having experience, belonging to the underground, looked around, being a stranger in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s1383">Because some people were asking questions, why didn’t other people go to the underground.</span> <span id="s1384">It’s very hard for me to explain them that here is a young man, has no attachments, no family, trying to find a way how to go to the woods or to the underground.</span> <span id="s1385">I did not find during my time, I arrived in August of 1942.</span> <span id="s1386">{Till March ‘43}.</span> <span id="s1387">‘till March ’43, I could not find any contact to go to the underground.</span> <span id="s1388">{Shortly after we arrived, they sealed the ghetto and they started the transports to Auschwitz from Grodno}.</span> <span id="s1389">On November 1, the ghetto was sealed in Grodno, the ghetto was much tighter.</span> <span id="s1390">You had to have special permits to go outside from the ghetto even to work.</span> <span id="s1391">I went through all the time in _______ I went through all the liquidations of Grodno till the last liquidation.</span> <span id="s1392">{Tell them that you are under --} We were always under leave (?)</span> <span id="s1393">.</span> <span id="s1394">{Besides, I think Aron should tell you that he was on his way to Auschwitz and he jumped out of a train}.</span> <span id="s1395">That’s what I’m coming, that’s what I’m coming.</span> <span id="s1396">So we left -- till the liquidation of the last, what do you call it the last liquidation?</span> <span id="s1397">{Ten thousand people they took out that time}.</span> <span id="s1398">The last liquidation of Grodno, that was in February, February of 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Forty-three, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Forty-three, 1943.</span> <span id="s1401">By that time I got acquainted with a Polish fellow.</span> <span id="s1402">His name is Tadek {(P-a-v-e-u-s-z S-o-r-o-k-a}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: And Tadek was his nickname?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: {Nickname, Tadek} Tadek was his nickname.</span> <span id="s1405">{T-a-d-e-k} I got acquainted with Tadek working outside the ghetto in remodeling a house for a Gestapo man.</span> <span id="s1406">So I was working over there with five other people.</span> <span id="s1407">I went out to work as a carpenter and being over there, who took me in?</span> <span id="s1408">a good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1409">He was working there so he said Aron you could be a carpenter, why don’t you come out to work in this place.</span> <span id="s1410">He worked -- I worked with him and over there we got acquainted with the name of this fellow Tadek.</span> <span id="s1411">Tadek {bartered with him}.</span> <span id="s1412">Tadek bartered with us.</span> <span id="s1413">We brought in some different kind of watches from the ghetto and pants and some other clothing what we could put on us and then take it off and barter with him.</span> <span id="s1414">{He would bring food}.</span> <span id="s1415">He give us food and we took it back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1416">One time he came in and he told us, he told to my friends, two of my other friends, he says, he don’t look Jewish, I can get you, I can take you to Vilna.</span> <span id="s1417">{And give you Aryan papers so you can live on and try to survive as Christians} Try to survive as Christians.</span> <span id="s1418">My two friends accepted it and after a few days, they went to him, to Tadek.</span> <span id="s1419">Tadek supposed to send a note back.</span> <span id="s1420">{No, Hershel, one of the people was supposed to send a note with Tadek that they arrived safely}.</span> <span id="s1421">So one of my friends was supposed to send it, they give us a note that they send with Tadek that they arrived safely and they are safe.</span> <span id="s1422">Because at that time, you couldn’t trust anybody, you could tell the same Polish fellow.</span> <span id="s1423">Any Pole could come and take away the money from you and give it to the Germans and get paid for it.</span> <span id="s1424">The Germans would pay him for it.</span> <span id="s1425">We didn’t know, we weren’t sure what it is.</span> <span id="s1426">But he came a couple of days later to the place where I was working and he says that Hershel and Ludnik (?)</span> <span id="s1427">that was their names, they’re safe, they’re in Vilna and _______in the Vilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s1428">But he does not have a note.</span> <span id="s1429">The reason why he doesn’t have a note -- he says it start raining and he had to walk away, go away because the Germans are there and he didn’t bring a note.</span> <span id="s1430">{When the police was around the ghetto and he was worried, frightened}.</span> <span id="s1431">Worried, frightened and he didn’t bring us a note.</span> <span id="s1432">This way, he used to come every other day back to our work and we did the same thing.</span> <span id="s1433">Bothering with him and one morning I didn’t know if I can believe him or not but one morning he came to us on the job where we were working.</span> <span id="s1434">He said I’m going to take you, I mean the ghetto is surrounded, the ghetto is being liquidated.</span> <span id="s1435">I’m going to take you, if you want it, don’t go back to the ghetto, I’ll take you to Vilna.</span> <span id="s1436">By that time I had to make the decision, should I take the chance and go with him to Vilna or I mean, I wasn’t sure anyway but it still probably safer than to go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1437">The ghetto is being liquidated.</span> <span id="s1438">Anyway I had to make the decision.</span> <span id="s1439">I made the decision, I’m going back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1440">I did some thinking after that.</span> <span id="s1441">I went back to the ghetto and Tadek gave me his address.</span> <span id="s1442">He marked down on my body, spread out in different place on my body.</span> <span id="s1443">I gave him my -- he gave me his address and any time I have a chance, if I survive or come back to him, he’ll take me to Vilna.</span> <span id="s1444">That’s the way we parted and I went back to the ghetto, coming back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1445">I was immediately arrested.</span> <span id="s1446">Everybody who came in back to the ghetto and they pushed us in a big synagogue.</span> <span id="s1447">In the synagogue during the day accumulated approximately maybe three or four thousand people.</span> <span id="s1448">I don’t know how much the synagogue could take in.</span> <span id="s1449">We stayed there all day and all night, all evening.</span> <span id="s1450">It was probably about six, seven o’clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s1451">It was six o’clock in the evening; all night more people were already in.</span> <span id="s1452">The shul, the synagogue was already almost full from people coming from work arresting everybody.</span> <span id="s1453">They kept us there all day, all night.</span> <span id="s1454">I was looking for any place to hide.</span> <span id="s1455">I couldn’t find a hiding place.</span> <span id="s1456">The next morning, about five o’clock in the morning, the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s1457">They ordered us to get out from the synagogue and walk to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1458">That’s what we did.</span> <span id="s1459">We followed up, we walked in fours, we walked to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1460">I was looking for a place to run away, to hide.</span> <span id="s1461">I could not find, the guards were too close.</span> <span id="s1462">Here I am, already at the railroad station, put in a boxcar, locked after a short while, half an hour, an hour, two hours, who knows what the time was.</span> <span id="s1463">Here I am in the boxcar, all locked up, ready to go to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Did you know you were going to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: I had a feeling because talk was already that they’re taking to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1466">Already it was almost known that they’re taking the people to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1467">{Carmit, they already had a camp, a detention camp from which they took the people from all the little small towns around Grodno.</span> <span id="s1468">You know, Grodno had a tremendous amount of Jewish little, tiny towns around Grodno.</span> <span id="s1469">When you refer now, people tell you, old people, the older generation, the __________ it means from the state, that the state of Grodno.</span> <span id="s1470">There were a lot of, a lot of small Jewish towns, all predominately Jewish.</span> <span id="s1471">They took them all to a camp called Kelbyshik.</span> <span id="s1472">From there they packed them in the cars, in the boxcars to go to Auschwitz}.</span> <span id="s1473">That was before they liquidated Grodno ghetto.</span> <span id="s1474">{Before the ghetto, they sent ---}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: So you knew already what was happening in town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1477">It was little by little.</span> <span id="s1478">It was known that we’re going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1479">Anyway here I am in the packed boxcar with all different kind of people, with all different kind of ages and I decided -- I saw a small little window on the end of the boxcar.</span> <span id="s1480">I decide with some of my friends, the one I was working with.</span> <span id="s1481">We tried the hard way.</span> <span id="s1482">I told him; I say I’m going to jump.</span> <span id="s1483">Here we have to break through that window.</span> <span id="s1484">So some way we got pushed through, we came close to the window.</span> <span id="s1485">We stood one shoulder, one on the other’s shoulders, two of us.</span> <span id="s1486">We know our power, I don’t know where we got it but we pulled out the bars.</span> <span id="s1487">We broke the bars, we pulled out the bars and I don’t know where we got the power and we jumped out.</span> <span id="s1488">{They started to jump out, one after the other}.</span> <span id="s1489">One after the other.</span> <span id="s1490">I was one that jumped out, the third one.</span> <span id="s1491">I remember I wasn’t the first one but I jumped out.</span> <span id="s1492">The train, on a curve.</span> <span id="s1493">It was slowing down on a curve.</span> <span id="s1494">I jumped out and I fell down.</span> <span id="s1495">I was unconscious and before long I was arrested, put back on the truck.</span> <span id="s1496">I was arrested by the German guard, the one that was watching the railroad, the railroad lines, the tracks.</span> <span id="s1497">Before not long, they arrested me and it was already about eight o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1498">They brought me back to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1499">During all day, that was right in the morning, the synagogue was empty.</span> <span id="s1500">There was only a few.</span> <span id="s1501">By that time already they start finding people hiding in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1502">Nobody was already out to work.</span> <span id="s1503">They discovered all different kind of hiding places and they brought them into the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1504">Before long -- anyway, the first day, I looked around, I did not find Lisa.</span> <span id="s1505">The second day I had a better chance to look because I was the only from the first ones.</span> <span id="s1506">I did not find Lisa.</span> <span id="s1507">Till late in the evening, I looked around where can I hide inside the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1508">I found a place in the synagogue, had a small little room where there was a kitchen before.</span> <span id="s1509">Over there was a pile of coal.</span> <span id="s1510">I saw a young fellow by the name Ruby Lawrence.</span> <span id="s1511">{Ruvke Lubich}.</span> <span id="s1512">Well Lubich was _______.</span> <span id="s1513">{R-u-v-k-e L-u-b-i-c-h}.</span> <span id="s1514">He was a boy from Grodno and he is making a place to hide under the coal.</span> <span id="s1515">After a lot of begging, he let me in.</span> <span id="s1516">There’s a whole story to that too but I’ll make it short.</span> <span id="s1517">He let me make a place right next to him.</span> <span id="s1518">By luck, under the coal, we found a big piece of plywood what we made a roof.</span> <span id="s1519">On top of the roof, we found some dead bodies.</span> <span id="s1520">We put a dead body on top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1521">At the entrance we found a cooking sheet, where we covered up with coal and then covered people that maybe covered the entrance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: To the hiding place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: That was the hiding place.</span> <span id="s1524">We survived there.</span> <span id="s1525">The next day we heard the same thing had happened in the shul.</span> <span id="s1526">They took out everybody and we survived there.</span> <span id="s1527">.</span> <span id="s1528">After they emptied it out, the Germans gave an order the same thing like this, they didn’t have the time, that the rest of the people who survived {to come out of the hiding} come out of the hiding -- {they’re not sending the transports any more} they’re not sending the transports any more.</span> <span id="s1529">{Again they shrank the ghetto} Shrank the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1530">{They left four buildings}.</span> <span id="s1531">They left four buildings and I went back to the place where I lived.</span> <span id="s1532">I knew where Lisa is hiding.</span> <span id="s1533">I found Lisa with her father and brother survived the same way.</span> <span id="s1534">We stayed for a while in the Grodno ghetto.</span> <span id="s1535">By that time a thousand or 1,200 Jews they left -- {survived} survived.</span> <span id="s1536">{Survived the transports.</span> <span id="s1537">Now by this time, people already knew what Auschwitz was}.</span> <span id="s1538">Yeah and we stayed there a short while.</span> <span id="s1539">Finally we made contact with Tadek.</span> <span id="s1540">Lisa went out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1541">I’ll skip all different kinds of things what we had but she made a contact.</span> <span id="s1542">She knew where Tadek, I gave her the address on Tadek.</span> <span id="s1543">{Before yet, my father and my little brother went with Tadek to Vilna}.</span> <span id="s1544">Before that they made the contact and they left.</span> <span id="s1545">After we made the contact with Tadek, Lisa went off on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s1546">She met him in church and then he told her to come out on Tuesday, come out on the public washroom.</span> <span id="s1547">I’ll meet you on Tuesday in the public washroom; you come out and I’ll take you to Vilna.</span> <span id="s1548">We took his word; it was very hard to get out through the public washroom because the ghetto was all surrounded.</span> <span id="s1549">You couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s1550">{We somehow made it}.</span> <span id="s1551">Someway we got out, it was dusk, it was dark, we got out and we came to the public washroom.</span> <span id="s1552">Sure enough Tadek, he told her he is going to give her a signal.</span> <span id="s1553">He’s going to come with a pair of overalls like an engineer working on the railroad and he’s going to have a flashlight.</span> <span id="s1554">He’s going to blink a few times with the flashlight; you’ll know from farther that that’s me.</span> <span id="s1555">Sure enough we met him over there.</span> <span id="s1556">“Everything went the way he said”.</span> <span id="s1557">Everything went that, five of us went out.</span> <span id="s1558">He took only, he said he can only take two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: When Lisa left, you left too at the same time, Aron?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Yeah, we went -- Lisa’s father and her brother went before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: And then you and --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Then I went with Lisa and Ruvke, my friend, the one that survived – {the one that he survived in the shul with him}.</span> <span id="s1563">The one that survived, the one that let him make a place to hide.</span> <span id="s1564">So we all moved in in one place and we all made the contacts with Tadek.</span> <span id="s1565">I promised, I told that guy Ruvke, I told him that I have a Polish fellow, Tadek, and we’ll go to Vilna.</span> <span id="s1566">He was part of us going out to the public washroom.</span> <span id="s1567">But at the same time he had another cousin and a friend so he took them too.</span> <span id="s1568">When we came in the public washroom we were five, instead of two.</span> <span id="s1569">Tadek said he can only take two.</span> <span id="s1570">After a long conversation with Tadek, he decided he’ll take three.</span> <span id="s1571">I took Ruvke; he didn’t want to go with me but I talked him in.</span> <span id="s1572">We survived together so why don’t you come with us.</span> <span id="s1573">Don’t delay it for another time.</span> <span id="s1574">so all this here went and Tadek took us to the -- Tadek says for me, Lisa and Ruvke, follow us and we are going to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1575">We followed Tadek to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1576">Before we came right by the railroad station was a small, an empty lot.</span> <span id="s1577">{A ditch like, along with the tracks}.</span> <span id="s1578">Along the tracks.</span> <span id="s1579">He told us you hide over there and I’ll go around and take a look which train is going to Vilna.</span> <span id="s1580">{Freight train, we’re talking about freight trains.</span> <span id="s1581">In between the freight are a couple cars, passenger cars that the Wehrmacht traveled}.</span> <span id="s1582">After he came back, he told us, he pointed this is the train what is going to Vilna but it’s very dangerous with the army going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">END OF SIDE A, TAPE II He took out what-you-call-it.</span> <span id="s1584">He told us that’s the train that’s going to move.</span> <span id="s1585">He warned us when this train starts moving, you jump between the boxcars, the couplings.</span> <span id="s1586">Jump on the couplings and then you’ll find a little lever, you’ll climb up on top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1587">{The roof of the car and you should lie on your stomach so you won’t be seen from the ground}.</span> <span id="s1588">I’ll find you there later, on top of the train.</span> <span id="s1589">The train starts moving.</span> <span id="s1590">We jump out from the place, from the hiding place.</span> <span id="s1591">I was the first one.</span> <span id="s1592">I jumped out, I jumped on the moving train between the boxcars and I climbed up on top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1593">Ruvke did the same thing on a different car, he did the same thing and went up on top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1594">Lisa was left over the last one, she panicked and she ran out.</span> <span id="s1595">{I panicked as I looked back.</span> <span id="s1596">There were very few cars that I saw and I became terribly frightened that I will not have a chance to climb up to the top to take the ride.</span> <span id="s1597">So I went out and the first car that passed by, I grabbed on and I stood on a little ledge with the boxcar.</span> <span id="s1598">I held on to the handle of the door}.</span> <span id="s1599">She held on the handle of the door instead of going between the boxcars, she grabbed on the door in the middle of the boxcar.</span> <span id="s1600">Here the train start moving faster and she’s hanging, she’s holding on.</span> <span id="s1601">{I was on the outside, you know on the outside of the boxcar}.</span> <span id="s1602">The train is moving and we are already on top and we’re out of town already.</span> <span id="s1603">Here I see where I’m lying, Tadek came to me and he said Where’s the girl?</span> <span id="s1604">{As the train was moving and moving fast, he was running all the way to the end of the train looking for me, looking if he could spot the girl}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: Who was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: {Tadek}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Tadek was on top of the train or in the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: On top.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: He also went on top.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1611">{Maybe he was at first in the locomotive but he climbed up to the top because we were on top of the train}.</span> <span id="s1612">So he came and he found us on top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1613">He jumped from one roof to the other on the running train, in the cold weather in March, freezing weather, until he found --.</span> <span id="s1614">{He found me on the outside of a boxcar almost hanging}.</span> <span id="s1615">He found her hanging on a boxcar.</span> <span id="s1616">So he came back to us and he told us I found the girl.</span> <span id="s1617">We have to go and come back to the boxcar where Lisa was hanging.</span> <span id="s1618">I, too, and Ruvke too, we jumped with him till we came to the boxcar where Lisa is hanging.</span> <span id="s1619">We made a human chain, Tadek lies down on the boxcar on top of the roof, we were holding his -- he shouldn’t slip down -- we were holding his legs.</span> <span id="s1620">He bent down much further and he grabbed one hand and then he grabbed the other hand.</span> <span id="s1621">Then Ruvke was holding his feet and I came to help Ruvke to help to pull up Lisa.</span> <span id="s1622">We pulled up Lisa on top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1623">There we survived from Grodno to Vilna was 180 kilometers, sub-zero weather.</span> <span id="s1624">{I wore mittens and I had a vision that that I would give him the hand and the mitten would slip.</span> <span id="s1625">He would not hold on to my hand but to the mitten but he was very skilful and I held on with all the strength that I possessed to lift myself -- and youth}.</span> <span id="s1626">Youth was on our side.</span> <span id="s1627">This way we went all the way for 180 kilometers till the next morning, it was still dark; we came to Vilna.</span> <span id="s1628">From Vilna we jumped down, Tadek was first, we followed Tadek.</span> <span id="s1629">He came and hollered and he says I’m going to find a big group, one that’s going back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1630">{A group of Jews returning from a night shift to the ghetto}.</span> <span id="s1631">You’ll join the Jews when they’re coming.</span> <span id="s1632">{You’ll jump in as you see them; you’ll just run in, in the middle.</span> <span id="s1633">That’s the way it was}.</span> <span id="s1634">That’s the way it happened.</span> <span id="s1635">We saw a big group of Jews running from the night shift going back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1636">We joined the other ones and we went in together.</span> <span id="s1637">I will make it fast.</span> <span id="s1638">In the ghetto, it was still a lively ghetto, Vilna.</span> <span id="s1639">I don’t know how many Jews were there at that time but maybe somebody will study, we’ll find exactly.</span> <span id="s1640">We came there in March, 1943.</span> <span id="s1641">I looked the hardest ways to find the underground.</span> <span id="s1642">I was successful, I found members of a Hashomer Hatzair; I joined the F.P.O., FPO --.</span> <span id="s1643">{From Yiddish, F_____, P_____, O_____, I joined and after a few months later till in August they decided -- we went through the whole situation in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1644">We decided we’re going to the underground.</span> <span id="s1645">{The leadership decided to send out after the episode with Edenberg which I am sure we _______ the history over and over again.</span> <span id="s1646">We’re on the barricades.</span> <span id="s1647">We went through the whole episode of Edenberg in Vilna}.</span> <span id="s1648">I joined the underground and then Ruvke joined and then a group of 30.</span> <span id="s1649">We went out from Vilna, we went to the underground.</span> <span id="s1650">We went to the forest of Narocz.</span> <span id="s1651">{N-a-r-o-c-z}.</span> <span id="s1652">It’s approximately the same thing, 150 kilometers; it took us seven nights to go there.</span> <span id="s1653">The only reason why we found the place because two young Jewish fellows {that were in the underground already) in their teens, what they left the underground, they came to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1654">{Risking their lives to be guides}.</span> <span id="s1655">To be guides to take out Jews to the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: Now you walked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: {We walked}.</span> <span id="s1658">Seven nights, only nights.</span> <span id="s1659">{In the day we were hiding}.</span> <span id="s1660">During the day we were hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Did you have any food with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: We got food from farmers.</span> <span id="s1663">{Because the fellows that came, they had guns, the two fellows, the Jews that came for us}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: So you forced the farmers to give you food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: {Yes, we forced the farmers}.</span> <span id="s1666">Because they already behaved like partisans.</span> <span id="s1667">This is the way we arrived to the partisans.</span> <span id="s1668">We joined to a group the partisans.</span> <span id="s1669">{The first group of partisans unit that we joined was a totally Jewish unit called Nakamah}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Revenge.</span> <span id="s1672">{But there was a lot of anti-Semites from the Russians and we were dispersed.</span> <span id="s1673">We could not stay, they would not keep us as a Jewish unit.</span> <span id="s1674">Some of the members from this Nakamah were put in different units of the Russian underground.</span> <span id="s1675">When we were liberated, we were part of a Russian unit, the Kalinski _________.</span> <span id="s1676">Kalinski was the president of Russia, K-a-l-i-n-s-k-i}.</span> <span id="s1677">What were we doing there, in the underground, in the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Kalinski or Kalininski?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: {Kalininski, there’s another “n”.}</span> <span id="s1680">.</span> <span id="s1681">What did we do in the underground?</span> <span id="s1682">We did all different kinds of sabotage work.</span> <span id="s1683">We blew up bridges, we blocked roads.</span> <span id="s1684">{Ambushes on _____}.</span> <span id="s1685">Ambushes on Germans, on German troops and I blew up trains.</span> <span id="s1686">{We also helped Jews -- they were hiding women and children that managed to escape from the small towns around the woods.</span> <span id="s1687">We sort of helped them too}.</span> <span id="s1688">That’s the way it was going around.</span> <span id="s1689">We lost 30% of our men we lost and from our group, what we went out from the thirty, about ten of them got killed in the underground in fights and in different ways, till the liberation.</span> <span id="s1690">{We were liberated the summer of ‘44}.</span> <span id="s1691">We were liberated the summer of ’44 by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1692">By chance, being a movie operator, I didn’t have to go to the army.</span> <span id="s1693">Otherwise they send, they pick up everybody immediately, they gave them uniforms and send them to the front lines.</span> <span id="s1694">But me having my special trade, this was the propaganda, to show movies.</span> <span id="s1695">They gave me a special place where I wouldn’t have to go join immediately in the army.</span> <span id="s1696">I went from there --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Did Lisa go with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1699">{By the way, my father survived too.</span> <span id="s1700">My father was in the underground.</span> <span id="s1701">Not in the unit but he was in a hut}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: So your father --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: {My little brother was caught in the street and sent to camp.</span> <span id="s1704">He was in, first in a labor camp, then he went to Studhoff (?)</span> <span id="s1705">but I don’t know if you want it}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: That was when they were in Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: {Yes}.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: Your father, he was with the underground in Vilna, not with these 30 people that went out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: {No, no.</span> <span id="s1710">He wasn’t a member of the active underground}.</span> <span id="s1711">Only in the underground they got me and Lisa.</span> <span id="s1712">{But Daddy was in the woods and he lived through the German occupation there}.</span> <span id="s1713">He knew where we are so he walked by himself.</span> <span id="s1714">Her brother was caught on the street and they send him to Studhoff.</span> <span id="s1715">{First he was in a labor camp in Estonia.</span> <span id="s1716">Then from there he was in Studhoff __.}</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: Aron, do you know what happened to your mother and your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: No.</span> <span id="s1719">The only thing is I found out after the war that nobody survived.</span> <span id="s1720">{They were in Bialystok, probably went to Treblinka}.</span> <span id="s1721">I tried one time to go from Grodno to Bialystok but it was not successful.</span> <span id="s1722">I had to go out to the Polish organizer (?)</span> <span id="s1723">and he never showed up so I never made it back.</span> <span id="s1724">But all the news what I could get, the people from Slonim that were there -- I don’t have any news of anybody surviving.</span> <span id="s1725">I’m the only one surviving.</span> <span id="s1726">To finish the story, we were liquidated, I mean we were liberated by the Russians and I went to see my hometown Slonim.</span> <span id="s1727">Nobody was left and from there, from Slonim I went to Beronovich and from Beronovich, I went to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s1728">{Because you know, as Polish citizens we’re allowed to go back to Poland after Poland was liberated by the Russians, parts of Poland that were liberated by the Russians}.</span> <span id="s1729">I went to Bialystok and Lisa followed me.</span> <span id="s1730">She came a couple of months later; she came to Bialystok because she was still left in Beronovich with her father, only with her father.</span> <span id="s1731">Her brother they didn’t know if he survived or not.</span> <span id="s1732">Lisa stayed with her father and then she followed me to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s1733">In Bialystok, passport (?)</span> <span

were}.</span> <span id="s1743">_______ was still controlled by the Russians and we had to cross the Russian zone to go over to the English zone.</span> <span id="s1744">We had to cross the Alps; we crossed the Alps and we came to Terevisa in Italy.</span> <span id="s1745">Over there we met, for the first time, we met members from the Jewish Brigade.</span> <span id="s1746">Haolim from the Palestine Jewish Brigades.</span> <span id="s1747">They were part of the English army.</span> <span id="s1748">They, with trucks, they took us under their protection and they took us from Terevisa to
