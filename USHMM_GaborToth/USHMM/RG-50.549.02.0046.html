Could you just start by saying your name and where we are today?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: Yeah, yes, okay.</span> <span id="s18">It’s -- My name is Adam Starkopf.</span> <span id="s19">I was born, raised, and educated in Warsaw, Poland, also the capital of Poland.</span> <span id="s20">And my parents -- I had one brother, four years older.</span> <span id="s21">I was born in 1914, he was born in 1910.</span> <span id="s22">My parent were -- not because I am their s -- their son, but th-the most wonderful people, but my mother was not very well in the last years before the war, didn’t feel good in general, had high blood pressure, you know.</span> <span id="s23">We used to think that she’s a very old women, in those days she was only 54, or 53, you know, at the -- in the war.</span> <span id="s24">Anyway, I was married after graduating Warsaw University.</span> <span id="s25">I was 22 years old when I was married, in 1936.</span> <span id="s26">My wife was [indecipherable] Warsaw University [indecipherable] she wa -- she was my age.</span> <span id="s27">And so, you can imagine we were married in 1936.</span> <span id="s28">Actually now, May 31st would be 63 years.</span> <span id="s29">My wife died March eight.</span> <span id="s30">Now, when the war broke out, September first, 1939, and the Germans, you know, Nazi Germany attacked Poland, they were bombing Poland day and night.</span> <span id="s31">I was that time 25 years old already, and my wife, because we were married three years before the war, in 1936.</span> <span id="s32">And actually, it was such a sudden war, you know, they called it a blitzkrieg, you know, that’s [indecipherable] nobody expected it.</span> <span id="s33">And there I was expected, you know, I was expecting to be recruited into the army.</span> <span id="s34">Now, unfortunately, the Polish government, the army, they didn’t have not only enough uniforms to -- for recruiting young people with military age, but they also didn’t have even -- they didn’t have any arms, and few days after the war started, in the beginning of September, the Polish government, including the president, escaped to Romania, was neighboring -- neighboring with Polan-Poland.</span> <span id="s35">But, on September -- September the fourth, over the radios, there were announcements that all military age men should leave Warsaw, and recruit in a certain city near the Russian border, in the eastern par -- eastern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s36">And it was about 120 miles away from Warsaw, and we should walk, you know, and report there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s37">Now, we were day and na -- na -- two nights were discussing this with, you know, my -- my in-laws, and my parents, and my -- now wa -- a-and we decided, you know, with my nayb -- our neighbors Warsaw, and we decided that I -- I said, “I have to fight them.</span> <span id="s38">Wi -- I have to leave.”</span> <span id="s39">And I -- September the sixth, 1939, six day after the war started, I left at five o’clock in the morning, my wife, my mother prepared me few things to take with me only, you know, to carry.</span> <span id="s40">And I left ate -- they walk with me to the -- to the end of, you know, the near -- actually walk over with me, you know, all the way up to the -- we have a river [indecipherable] divided at -- suburb of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s41">So they walk with me up to that suburb, you see?</span> <span id="s42">And then -- And then I just embraced them, and sa -- my wife was crying, my -- my wife was crying, my mother tried to feel -- make her feel better, tried to smile, you know, he will be okay.</span> <span id="s43">And they walk away.</span> <span id="s44">And when I looked back after them, I saw how my wife, you know, gently taking [indecipherable] bracing my wife, and walking away.</span> <span id="s45">Now, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s46">The walking was undescribable, the marching to the highways.</span> <span id="s47">They were bombing -- the planes were over our heads, almost.</span> <span id="s48">And so far the not -- even from machine guns, they were, you know, sh-shooting to the -- there was a lot of people, you know, thou -- hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people, and -- and some vans with ho-horses.</span> <span id="s49">Anyway, we were running away from the highways into the field houses, you know, trying to escape from it.</span> <span id="s50">It took us over nine days to walk this 115 - 117 miles, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s51">Now I, not far already from theles city, I was wounded.</span> <span id="s52">A piece of shrapnel from one of the bombs hit my f -- right foot.</span> <span id="s53">And in the field, you know, there was some, you know pe -- pe -- not ambulances, but there was some still f -- y-you know, army pl -- da -- vents, and so on.</span> <span id="s54">Anyway, they cut off in the -- without anesthetic, my toe had to be chopped off in my right foot, and I had only four toes, and that hole, like, you know, in my foot -- in the right foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Wh-Which toe did they cut off?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: The -- The se -- The second toe, like this.</span> <span id="s57">The second from the -- the right toe from the -- from the large toe, the second toe.</span> <span id="s58">But it didn’t mean a thing to me, you know, and I just -- I was pretty strong to -- to take it, and we walked farther, and we came to a city of Kleck, K-l-e-c-k-, and this city was very close to the Russian border.</span> <span id="s59">And the first night, we were sleeping in a very clean barn.</span> <span id="s60">It was the -- really the first night that we peacefully could sleep, of course, in our clothes, you know, torn clothes, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s61">Well, you know they -- when they cut off my toe, you know, they took a piece of my shirt, you know, cut off for band -- to bandage it.</span> <span id="s62">And then we -- So -- But when we sleep in there, we woke up at five o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s63">We heard some noises outside, you know, tanks coming, trucks, and so on.</span> <span id="s64">We ran out, the Russian army was coming in.</span> <span id="s65">Now, I want you also to mention that some of the boys that left from our building, my age, some were much younger even, together with me, some of them went back.</span> <span id="s66">They couldn’t -- you know, they just said -- decided no, we will not make it.</span> <span id="s67">And because a lot of the -- were killed people too, you know, on the highways.</span> <span id="s68">So they said we -- they -- we’ll go back, and they left us.</span> <span id="s69">And the -- I went with just few that I knew.</span> <span id="s70">Anyway -- And this was the Russian army.</span> <span id="s71">You -- You know about the problems that in -- in that time actually.</span> <span id="s72">I thought it [indecipherable] when I saw the Russian, you know, th-the -- the Russian trucks and tanks, I was happy, first I thought they come as our allies.</span> <span id="s73">But then I found out that they are allies of Germany, and they divided to this -- to this -- to -- they decided with -- you know Stalin and Hitler signed a non-aggression pact, you see.</span> <span id="s74">And what they did, they divided Poland into two zones.</span> <span id="s75">The western part of Poland occupied by Germany, and the eastern part of Poland was occupied by -- by Russia, Soviet Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: But you didn’t know about the pact between Hitler and Stalin before this, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Before I didn’t know nothing, but I found out there.</span> <span id="s78">Yeah -- No, before I nothing -- it’s never [indecipherable] to the country, I thought that it will be now close to the Russian border, even if we’ll not be recruited, at least we’ll be safer there.</span> <span id="s79">Anyway, I, as a young boy I remember it even that once you are under Russian occupation, or something, it’s not easy to get away from this country.</span> <span id="s80">So, I was scared that I will not be able to see my family again, so I decided to escape from there.</span> <span id="s81">And I perf -- I met a Polish peasant, you know, who had the rowboat, because the divided -- now, the division between -- th-the border between the eastern and -- and the -- and the western part of Poland, was the river Bug, B-u-g.</span> <span id="s82">Bouk, we pronounce it in Polish, and -- you see.</span> <span id="s83">So anyway, I decided to escape, I -- I didn’t have money enough, I gave him my watch -- to the peasant, and for this he took me in a rowboat over the river, and we somehow were able to omit, you know, the border patrols, the Russian and German border patrol, and I took a train back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s84">And when I arrive in Warsaw, I can tell you one thing, I was just amazed, because I -- I hardly could -- could recognize it, you know, some building, they’re so completely you know already, you know [indecipherable] and in German, cars and trucks and Germans, all over, all over everywhere.</span> <span id="s85">I was running towards our building and it -- it’s a miracle how our building was not destroyed, in one piece, and I met the janitor of our building.</span> <span id="s86">It was a four story building.</span> <span id="s87">In those days, you know, in Poland, not like here, you know sky -- you know sky rise buildings, this -- the -- the tall rise building was seven story building.</span> <span id="s88">And anyway, I met the janitor, ask him how -- in the -- right at the gate, “Tell me, how -- how is my family, how”-- “Oh, everybody ex-except your mother, your mother is dead.”</span> <span id="s89">I was shocked, and I run upstairs, you know, we had no elevator, you know run upstairs to the third floor, open the door, you could see my wife, my parents, and my in-laws, were very happy to -- to see me, and crying, told me what happened.</span> <span id="s90">You see, during the bombing of Warsaw, everyone was instructed to run into -- you know, the buildings had cellars, you see?</span> <span id="s91">So everybody was running down into the cellars to avoid the bombs, you see?</span> <span id="s92">, and she was there, my mother, one night when they were bombing Warsaw.</span> <span id="s93">And some of the boys that left with us, and came back, they were say -- telling people that oh, we’re so glad that we came back because none of the others, probably, is alive.</span> <span id="s94">And my mother turned in to my wife, and my father, and said, “Oh my God, if Adam is not alive, I will not live.”</span> <span id="s95">And she got a stroke, right there.</span> <span id="s96">She got high -- very high blood pressure, you know, yungbe -- even before the war.</span> <span id="s97">And she got right there, in the -- and that’s how I found out that she died.</span> <span id="s98">Now, I also didn’t mention my -- to you -- my wife had parents, father and mother, and a brother.</span> <span id="s99">The brother was only 19 years old, graduated Warsaw.</span> <span id="s100">He graduated Hebrew high school, you know, and just was going the first year to the university.</span> <span id="s101">Very bright, very nice, handsome boy.</span> <span id="s102">Now, what my wife did, you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Let me just -- Let me just stop for a second, ask you a couple of questions, if that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Because we’re interested in getting a little more of your family backgrounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: So, we’ll pick up the story, but let’s go back to before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s110">Could you tell me -- you mentioned your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Could you tell me his name?</span> <span id="s113">Was he --</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: W -- Did you have any other brothers or sisters, or that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Never, just one brother.</span> <span id="s117">Now, you see, my family was -- let me put it this way, my wife’s family was very religious.</span> <span id="s118">Not Orthodox, but they were religious, observing, you know, and so far that my mother-in-law wouldn’t ride a streetcar on Saturdays even, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s119">They were religious.</span> <span id="s120">They were not fanatics, but you know, they were very relig -- my family was on the Conservative side, but they were very Zionistic, always thinking about Palestine, you know, and so on, and my brother, too.</span> <span id="s121">Now, my brother wanted very badly to go to Palestine, and in 1933, the British -- you know, when the British occupied Palestine, they wouldn’t [indecipherable] and that was [indecipherable] to get the entry visa.</span> <span id="s122">He organized, in 1933, a -- in Warsaw was a Zion -- Jewish support organization, they call it Maccabi, M-a-c-c-a-b-i, Maccabi.</span> <span id="s123">And this organization -- you know, he organized a motorcycle trip in 1933, Warsaw, Tel-Aviv, Warsaw, that they will go there, you know, for sporting goods -- events, and they got visas.</span> <span id="s124">There was 12 men on motorcycles, you see?</span> <span id="s125">Some of them in double, you know?</span> <span id="s126">And they left in 1933 from Warsaw, took them almost three months to travel, and they were there -- arrived there -- I have pictures that I can later give you, and to show you, you know, of th -- then -- [indecipherable] from a newspaper that I got, that I took it over.</span> <span id="s127">Now, anyway, he remained in -- of course he was in Palestine, he was -- all the time, and then he joined the underground for -- you know, organization they call the Hagannah, and all -- was fighting there.</span> <span id="s128">And they why he -- until -- he was there all the time, and when Israel was established in 1948, of course, he was there already, you know, and he got married there, he got children, and so on.</span> <span id="s129">He had two -- two daughters, and had grandchildren, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: His name was Henry Starkopf.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: The same name.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: When he went on this trip -- on this motorcycle trip --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: -- did he know in advance that the whole point of this was for him not to come back?</span> <span id="s137">Was this his gimmick?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Onl-Only for this reason, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: That’s why he organized it.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Did all the other people on the trip stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Yeah, everyone, yeah.</span> <span id="s143">This was a group of all the people, -- you know, all his friends that were all Zionists, you see, and they -- they -- that’s -- they decided this way they would remain there.</span> <span id="s144">And of course, he was hoping that in the future, maybe there will be the thing -- you know changing like [indecipherable] Zionist, and then maybe the family will come there, and so on, you know?</span> <span id="s145">But he didn’t na -- come over -- he didn’t -- that was only the purpose, to go -- but they -- be -- you know, for the British, you know, because of the visas to receive, they mark it down that this is only Warsaw, Tel-Aviv, Warsaw, go back.</span> <span id="s146">But none of -- they went underground.</span> <span id="s147">None of them -- all -- not officially, you know, they couldn’t remain there.</span> <span id="s148">They were underground, all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: What -- Before he went on the trip --</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: -- so he has this planned, to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Did he ask you parents permission?</span> <span id="s154">Did you talk about it in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: N-No.</span> <span id="s156">We discuss it, of course, but you know, my parent didn’t oppose it.</span> <span id="s157">You know, he was that time, in 1933, he was -- he bor -- he was born in 1910, I in 1914.</span> <span id="s158">He was 23 years old, you know, and also very educated boy, and -- but that’s was his dream, you know, he was a very Zion -- you know, Zionistic, you know, and so on.</span> <span id="s159">So that’s who I -- he decided, you know, to -- to do it.</span> <span id="s160">Now, my -- my wife’s br-brother, who was 19 years old already, you know, was Zio-Zionist -- always was dreaming also about Palestine.</span> <span id="s161">So what my wife did, you see, when I left that -- that night, the sixth of September, she went -- next day she went to her parents, and she said, “Look, A-Adam went in because he want to be recruited and fight, you know, th-the Germans.</span> <span id="s162">I think you,” -- his na -- my bro -- her ga -- her brother’s name was Ben -- Benjamin, you -- Ben.</span> <span id="s163">She said, “I think Ben, maybe you should do the same thing.</span> <span id="s164">Go with Adam, maybe you’ll be recruited.”</span> <span id="s165">And he left with another man -- with another young friend, whose family was also living in our building, happened to be, and they relatives in that particular town, in eastern part of Poland, also.</span> <span id="s166">The town Rowne, R-o-w-n-e, but the o was the -- like a comma above it, tas -- in Polish, you know, they call it u, like u, Rowne.</span> <span id="s167">Now, anyway, now I will tell you , because it was [indecipherable] very unusual thing, you see.</span> <span id="s168">So anyway, we -- when I came back, and her parent -- my -- I found out about my mother, and her parents were, you know, sh-shocked, and what happened to Ben, you know, where is Ben?</span> <span id="s169">How -- Maybe you can --.</span> <span id="s170">So I told them, “Look, I know the people, the family of this boy that went with them together.</span> <span id="s171">So don’t worry.</span> <span id="s172">We will go there, we will tr -- go through the -- you know [indecipherable] and we’ll see what we can -- you know, to -- to the border we’d smuggle through, and see we can find him.”</span> <span id="s173">And my wife with me together, we left Warsaw, and we found some peasants, you know, that also took us, you know, through the -- all kinds of places where, you know, wasn’t so easy to get through.</span> <span id="s174">It’s a very long story, you know, I -- I wrote about it in the book.</span> <span id="s175">Anyway, and -- but I -- yeah, I have to mention to you that together with us, also, my wife has a girlfriend that was in school with her together, and she married a young man who was with us in school, too, but he studied medicine, he was a young doctor.</span> <span id="s176">And we escaped together -- I mean, not escape, went together, you know, and they decided to go all together, to -- not to be, you know, they wanted to escape from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s177">So they joined us, and we left together, pola -- Warsaw.</span> <span id="s178">And when we went -- were going to that particular city that I told you that the relatives of this boyfriend that went together with my brother-in-law, I found out that -- you know, I had the address, and in order to go to Rowne, I had to go through certain town, you know, where with -- it has there -- my friend said, “I would like to s -- as long as we’re passing by this town, I want to take,” -- you know, it wasn’t a taxi they took, you know, how you call it, you know, with a horse, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Like a carriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: A carriage.</span> <span id="s181">[indecipherable] A carriage with a -- you know?</span> <span id="s182">And we went to the hospital to find out how -- you know, how he can get a, let’s say, position in the hospital.</span> <span id="s183">He wanted to get some information.</span> <span id="s184">So after he got the information, I said, “Now let’s go take the train, and we’ll go to the -- to the boyfriend’s family, find out where they are.”</span> <span id="s185">And we took the train from there, and went to the city where they supposed to, you know, meet the fa -- the family’s supposed to be there, of this boyfriend.</span> <span id="s186">And over there, when he saw the boyfriend was there, oh, he’s -- good to see you, now what happened?</span> <span id="s187">I said, “Where is Ben?”</span> <span id="s188">He said, “I tell you where is Ben.”</span> <span id="s189">Ben, on the way, he got -- he got sick, and he -- and he got sick and he develop typhus fever, and he’s in the hospital in Koval, in -- in the town that we were in the hospital.</span> <span id="s190">We were there, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s191">I said, “Oh my God, what -- what a coincidence.</span> <span id="s192">And I was there with my friend, and he was in that hospital.”</span> <span id="s193">I said, “We going there -- back right now.”</span> <span id="s194">So I left my wife, you know, we were in the other town there, and I and he took a train and went back to the hospital.</span> <span id="s195">And we -- when we came to the hospital, went right away to the office, and I ask, I am so and so -- you know, my name, “I am looking for Ben Miller.”</span> <span id="s196">The whole -- maiden name was Miller, Ben Miller.</span> <span id="s197">And said, “Oh, my God, how fortunate.</span> <span id="s198">He died half an hour ago.”</span> <span id="s199">They told me.</span> <span id="s200">His heart failed, and he couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s201">You can imagine how I -- but, I said, “Let’s make it sure.</span> <span id="s202">I want to see the body.”</span> <span id="s203">So they took me to the morgue downstairs.</span> <span id="s204">I look at him like a -- like a skeleton [indecipherable] recognize him, and they brought me his little belongings, I mean nothing, what -- he had there nothing [indecipherable], but they ha -- he had a ring that my mother-in-law gave him, her wedding ring.</span> <span id="s205">She said, “Look, this is a gold wedding ring, in case if you need to exchange it for bread, you know, give it.”</span> <span id="s206">This of -- That’s the reason she gave him the ring, for -- you know, if you need it, it’s to pay for bread or something, give it this.</span> <span id="s207">Anyway, and they gave me this thing, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s208">Now, what I did, because he was a Zionist, I told his fr -- the friend that -- that was alive, I said, “Listen, you write a letter to us.”</span> <span id="s209">I told him where it would be there, in that part of let -- another town with my wife.</span> <span id="s210">Write a letter and tell that all -- that he is so sorry that he -- we missed Ben, but Ben smuggled himself through the border to Romania, from there he intends to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s211">And he wrote the letter to us, you know?</span> <span id="s212">I set up the letter, you know, not to tell my wife about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Now, but, in Polish language, when you wrote the letter -- when you wrote about someone that he died, you write always capit -- let’s say if you write he -- he died, you write capital he, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s216">Both letters --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Just --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: -- capital, or just the first letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: No, just the first letter, you know, just the first l --</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s221">So if someone is dead --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: -- yeah, l -- in other words, a -- it’s a -- you have to wri -- you know, if a -- it’s a -- after the whole -- the whole -- not the sentence, but the word d -- d -- in capitals, you know.</span> <span id="s223">And he -- he did it, he didn’t realize it, probably.</span> <span id="s224">And my wife --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: He -- He did what, he --</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: He write -- He wrote the letter --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: And so he made it with the capital on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: -- and -- and -- and well something about he wa-was in -- in capital letters.</span> <span id="s229">And in the beginning my wife didn’t pay attention, but later on, she said, “Oh, you know what?</span> <span id="s230">Tell me the truth.”</span> <span id="s231">And that’s how I had to tell her.</span> <span id="s232">So we decided to bring back -- to come -- to go back.</span> <span id="s233">We went back again to -- to -- again through the borders, you know?</span> <span id="s234">And I was describing in my book how the weather was in January, 1940.</span> <span id="s235">It was -- I’m sorry, it was December, and you know -- 1939, and th-the snow was up to our knees.</span> <span id="s236">But anyway, we walked all the time through, and we came back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s237">And then, of course, we told my in-laws and my father, that he is probably on the way to Palestine.</span> <span id="s238">And even -- They never, until the day that they went to the concentration camp, they never knew that he is -- you know, that he is dead.</span> <span id="s239">Now -- And then, we’re supposed to settle, you know, whatever it was, you know, to settle down, you know, under the conditions there were in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s240">But, in 1940 -- this was -- I -- s -- I told you there was [indecipherable] 1939.</span> <span id="s241">In 1940, Hitler decided in order to lift -- li -- see, they used to have the conferences in Germany, I understood -- I found out, and they decided to annihilate all the Jews from the wer -- western Europe.</span> <span id="s242">Now, you know that to have a very easy access to those people, he had to concentrate it, you see, in certain spots.</span> <span id="s243">So, he established ghettos, and in s -- in Warsaw, which was the capital of Poland, was the largest ghetto.</span> <span id="s244">Now, what he did, you see, he took wat section of Warsaw, and any person -- and ki -- family that was not Jewish, they were forced to move out from there, but they were allowed to take all their belongings, everything.</span> <span id="s245">Now, Jewish people that lived out of that section, were forced to get into that ghetto section, but they were not allowed to carry nothing with them, just the way they were standing.</span> <span id="s246">And we were forced, those people that happened to live in that ar-area, like -- like we, and my in-laws, everyone was forced to take several people into the apartments.</span> <span id="s247">Like, let’s say i -- on the average apartment was two bedroom apartment, one bedroom apartment, they had to have at least six more people, seven people, to take everybody.</span> <span id="s248">There were rations, one and a kilogra -- one and a half kilogram of bread every [indecipherable] day, and so on, for a family, and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s249">Now, what happened, they built a wall between 10 - 11 feet high w -- brick walls around the ghetto, and on top of the wall there were barb wires, you know, cemented into the top of the wall, of the brick wall, so people couldn’t jump over it, you know.</span> <span id="s250">And there were ghettos, there were several ghettos -- several gates in the ghetto, and they were guarded by the Gestapo, which is the -- the Nazi military police.</span> <span id="s251">Now, we -- what I was doing, try just to help my father, my in-laws, and my wife, I looked like a typical Polish guy when I was young.</span> <span id="s252">I was blonde, you know, blue eye.</span> <span id="s253">I looked like a very good Polish boy.</span> <span id="s254">Yeah, there was an ordinance that time, in -- in Warsaw, that every Jewish person has to wear a white arm band, on his right arm, with a Jewish star of David, from material, you know, piece of material.</span> <span id="s255">Anyone that caught without it, would be shot right away, or imprisoned.</span> <span id="s256">Now, what I was doing, I had some connections with the i -- with some Polish friends on the other side of Warsaw ghetto, so I was -- I got a spot in one of the -- spot far away from the -- from the gates.</span> <span id="s257">You see, I was pulling out -- I broke some few bricks, taking off my arm band, I smuggled out myself into the other side, where I could bring a little bit some better nourishment for my family.</span> <span id="s258">Then, in 1940, in May, my wife walk over to me, crying.</span> <span id="s259">“Adam, you will not believe me, I am pregnant.”</span> <span id="s260">Now, I have to mention to you -- you -- you know -- you know, I’m told you before, we’re married three years before the war, and like more parents, you know, her parents, my parents were dreaming about a grandchild, but we were told that my wife can never have children.</span> <span id="s261">Some -- You know, some woman that -- she can never have children.</span> <span id="s262">The doctors were -- to-told us, many doctors.</span> <span id="s263">Because for three year -- three years before the war -- it was already almost three and a half years, you know, and there I would never bring a child, with my wife, into a world like this.</span> <span id="s264">But, knowing that she never can have children, you know, that is different story.</span> <span id="s265">So, anyway, we decided we wanted to have abortion.</span> <span id="s266">We want to do something not to bring the child, but in those days you listened to your parents, you know, even if you were married.</span> <span id="s267">And my in-laws, and my father said oh no, you have to have a child, and you -- every child has -- anyway, in 1941 in January, my -- the child was born on a table like this table, a wooden table, you know?</span> <span id="s268">And without a doctor’s help, just a neighbor helped to deliver her.</span> <span id="s269">And my wife was very sick also that time, had all kind of other sicknesses, you know.</span> <span id="s270">But anyway, she delivered a little baby girl.</span> <span id="s271">And I somehow -- what I saw what they were doing to chil -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Adam Starkopf.</span> <span id="s273">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: -- you listened to your parents, you know, even if you were married.</span> <span id="s275">And my in-laws, and my father said oh no, you have to have a child, and you -- every child has -- anyway, in 1941 in January, my -- the child was born on a table like this table, a wooden table, you know?</span> <span id="s276">And without a doctor’s help, just a neighbor helped to deliver her.</span> <span id="s277">And my wife was very sick also that time, had all kind of other sicknesses, you know.</span> <span id="s278">But anyway, she delivered a little baby girl.</span> <span id="s279">And I somehow -- what I saw what they were doing to children in ghetto, I p-p-pledged that I would see to it that they wouldn’t put a finger on this child.</span> <span id="s280">You know, just I -- I’ll do everything.</span> <span id="s281">And then, what started, you know, I was going back and out, you know, for the child also bring a little milk, or something, to feed her, you know, and -- and in -- I was caught by [indecipherable] on the way back, I was caught by the Gestapo, and I was imprisoned, and you know, the conditions in those prisons that time were terrible, of course.</span> <span id="s282">You had to -- Now, not a single criminal in Warsaw ghetto was in prison.</span> <span id="s283">Doctors, lawyers, accountants, you know, business people, but all Jewish people were in prison.</span> <span id="s284">Now, my father met a Polish policeman, of German descent.</span> <span id="s285">You see, there were just like in United States, somebody may be American citizen that has grandfather or great-grandfather was German.</span> <span id="s286">So, they call it [indecipherable] of German descent.</span> <span id="s287">We had this man of German descent, and he found out that he had some connection.</span> <span id="s288">He all -- called up to him, he said, “Look, I don’t have any cash, but we have a beautiful bedroom set in hiding by Polish friends, that we gave the set to our children when they were married.</span> <span id="s289">We will give you the bedroom set if you to -- see to it to release me from prison.</span> <span id="s290">And he did.</span> <span id="s291">But he work out, you know.</span> <span id="s292">It was a deal that he -- he -- he -- he knew probably somebody there.</span> <span id="s293">Anyway, they release me from the prison, and we -- when I came back, of course how happy they were, but later again, at night, they came and they took me back.</span> <span id="s294">Now, what he did, undoubted -- that’s -- that’s the way we -- we assumed they -- I’m sure, he probably told them, “Look, I can get my bedroom set if you let him out.</span> <span id="s295">Later, you ca -- any time you want to, you can get him back.”</span> <span id="s296">They came at night, at -- at -- at our apartment, knock at the door, and took me back to prison.</span> <span id="s297">I was in prison that time, let me tell you this way, 26 men in one cell.</span> <span id="s298">You can’t imagine the conditions.</span> <span id="s299">In the morning, at five o’clock, the door would open, the two German Gestapo men, with the German Shepherd.</span> <span id="s300">When they were pointing a finger at one of the prisoners, s -- and say Juda, which means in German language Jew, the German Shepherd was trained to jump at this Juda, you know, and to tear him apart.</span> <span id="s301">Every second cell they were like this, every second, they open, you know, and they were killing, like murdering three or four ki -- men, and then later replacing them, so always 26.</span> <span id="s302">But then, this was already 1942, and I found a -- i-i -- in -- in -- in June, I found out that they liquidate -- liquidating the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s303">Liquidating it means they are going to take the people into concentration camp.</span> <span id="s304">Now, in order to have again access to all those people, they surrounded first old age homes, nursing homes, hospitals, some orphanages, or whatever, you know, they got children in, and also prisoners.</span> <span id="s305">Anyone in relatively good health was taken -- loaded into trucks, taken to the cattle cars, -- you know, trains, and taken to the concentration camp, Treblinka concentration camp was -- I call the destruction camp, was about 80 or 90 miles away from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s306">1,000,000 Jews were ki -- destroyed there.</span> <span id="s307">Now, anyone that was -- let’s say children, or teenagers, or people older that were not, you know, in -- in the best health, they were taking to Jewish cemetery, which was outside of the Warsaw ghetto, was too big to be in ghetto, and they were executed there, and thrown into mass graves.</span> <span id="s308">The mass graves that time, had approximately 300 - 350 bodies, each grave.</span> <span id="s309">And the -- Some of the children were half -- not yet dead after they shoot, you know, or a little breathing, or so, they still were thrown into the graves.</span> <span id="s310">Now, when they surrounded the prison, we’re all -- open the doors, wi -- every one of us had to go down to the courtyard, you know, out and loaded -- tol -- they would load us into the trucks.</span> <span id="s311">And there was tremendous chaos als-also that time, there was just hundreds and hundreds, you know, of the -- anyway, I was able to escape from the prison, together with few other men.</span> <span id="s312">We had no prison uniforms, just to -- you know, just old clothes to -- I ran home, you can imagine how my wife, and my parents, and in-laws, how they saw me.</span> <span id="s313">My father, [indecipherable] my in-laws, how they saw me, how happy they were.</span> <span id="s314">And I told them, look, what they were doing to children, what I saw, and so on, I -- you are not go -- I -- I am going to do -- work out something.</span> <span id="s315">I had connections with some people from the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s316">I work out forged documents that were Polish people.</span> <span id="s317">My wife, the baby and I are Roman Catholics.</span> <span id="s318">She also was blonde, looks like Polish.</span> <span id="s319">And the -- the -- the ka -- you know, the documents that we had, the forged documents, the stamp, swastika, I took a potato, a regular potato, cut out the potato, made a stamp out of it, you know?</span> <span id="s320">To make the first -- the swastika pi -- stamp.</span> <span id="s321">And that’s was our document.</span> <span id="s322">If they would look closely, that -- at it, they probably would realize, but you know, ju-just to have it.</span> <span id="s323">Anyway, and I arrange an escape, how I arrange the escape.</span> <span id="s324">Our child was that time -- this was -- we planned everything, after everything was organized, I planned, you know, the place, far -- to far -- about seven -- 80 miles away from Warsaws, everything.</span> <span id="s325">It took us, you know, close, you know, all t-the June and July.</span> <span id="s326">And I plan, on July 31st, 1942, I plan the escape.</span> <span id="s327">Now, a friend of mine, a young doctor that was there also wun, he injected her, put her to sleep, the baby.</span> <span id="s328">She was about one and a half years old at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Do you know what he gave her?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Injection, to put to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: But you don’t know what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: No, I wouldn’t know, and I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s333">He said, “I will put her to sleep.”</span> <span id="s334">So he injected her, put her to sleep.</span> <span id="s335">We put her in a casket.</span> <span id="s336">My wife -- Men couldn’t do it, men couldn’t be -- wouldn’t be allowed to follow.</span> <span id="s337">My wife followed the funeral -- I mean, funeral, it was just a van with the horse, you know, and the horseman, and the -- and -- and the casket on top.</span> <span id="s338">She put on a piece of black material, she put on [indecipherable] on her head, and she walk aw -- and she went through.</span> <span id="s339">When she went -- came to the gate, the Gestapo gate, they wanted she -- they sh -- that they -- the horseman should open the ga -- the casket, to see, maybe some smuggling going on, or something.</span> <span id="s340">But my wife said to -- to the man, that she died from typhus fever.</span> <span id="s341">You see, in -- in ghetto, because of the conditions, very bad con -- the -- thousands and thousands of people died from typhus fever.</span> <span id="s342">So my wife said -- and so here -- wu -- th-those -- those be -- they were like, you know, th-they were very brave with harmless people, with children, with it, but they were scared of -- to death of contagious diseases, so he moved away from it, from the casket, and she went through to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s343">The gravediggers wanted to pick up the baby, throw in the mass grave.</span> <span id="s344">My wife screamed out, “She’s alive, don’t touch her.”</span> <span id="s345">They can’t believe their eyes, they couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s346">But you see, here again, I thought everything in advance.</span> <span id="s347">On Jewish cemeteries, in Poland, on Jewi -- only Jewish gravediggers were working.</span> <span id="s348">Not others, like here, let’s say or so, you see?</span> <span id="s349">So, like here, when my wife was buried, in Shalom Memorial Park, here in Chicago, you know, in the suburb of Chicago, three months ago, you know, there were not -- not Jewish gravediggers.</span> <span id="s350">Now, we got [indecipherable] they -- I wasn’t afraid of any betrayal.</span> <span id="s351">So they -- anyway, they took out the baby, with my wife, and they too -- put them in a room, where before the war they used to wash the bodies, prepare for regular, you know, burials, you know, normal funerals, and they were waiting for me over there.</span> <span id="s352">In the evening, I again, like always, slipped out to the other side, and I went to the cemetery, met her at close to 10 o’clock in the evening, with the baby.</span> <span id="s353">Now, with -- you see, the Jewish cemetery had -- they were -- adjoining Polish cemetery, and Tartar cemetery, there were brick walls in between.</span> <span id="s354">I made -- work out with the Tartar cemetery -- Tartar cemeter -- cemetery, the caretaker that I will knock at the wall with a stone, and he will drop a stepladder, and we will go on the other side, and we gave him something for it, you know.</span> <span id="s355">And would go out, and we’ll be on the other -- and then we’ll escape.</span> <span id="s356">And I knock at the wall with a stone, he let out the stepladder, went on the other side, and took a streetcar to a place where we slept the first night -- nobody would suspect that we are such, you know, idiots.</span> <span id="s357">We slept in a building where -- si -- there was -- the building was, I think, six or seven story, I don’t remember, but up to the third floor, there was Gestapo po -- railroad police, above the regular apartments.</span> <span id="s358">And we slept there one night.</span> <span id="s359">The man that wa -- he was a member of Polish underground, but he didn’t know that we are Jewish, and we slept the first night there.</span> <span id="s360">In the morning we took a train, at seven o’clock, six o’clock in the morning, a train, and this was -- I prepared a place, about 75 - 80 miles away from Warsaw, where I would -- there was a lumber yard.</span> <span id="s361">I would work in the lumber yard as a laborer there, and then, my wife with the baby would be there, I would took a room, and --from a peasant -- p -- the pe -- the Polish peasants, the tiny little room, you know, with the w -- iron stove -- stove with the pipe, and it -- one bed.</span> <span id="s362">Three of us would sleep in the one bed.</span> <span id="s363">Now, it’s a -- it’s a -- a wooden -- you know, s-story -- it’s a one story house, small.</span> <span id="s364">Now, I prepared there a very ground -- very deep cellar for my father and my in-laws, they could not be in the open, you know, as Gentile people.</span> <span id="s365">So I prepared a -- a spot, a very low do -- very deep cellar.</span> <span id="s366">They would be, during the day, in the cellar there, in hiding.</span> <span id="s367">At night, we’d take them out, feed them, and they would go back to the cellar.</span> <span id="s368">And after three days, I went to get my father and my in-laws.</span> <span id="s369">After three days, when I came there, unfortunately, was fire, and most of the buildings were on the fire, I couldn’t get even to our building.</span> <span id="s370">And my father and my in-laws were taken away into a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s371">So actually, none from our families, both families, nobody alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Let me -- Let me just stop you here for a second --</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: -- to go back and, actually I want to check one thing.</span> <span id="s375">If I can ask, I just wanted to go back and make sure we got --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yes, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: -- on the record, the names of your parents, and what type of work did they do, and their background --</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Before?</span> <span id="s379">Before the war you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: -- that all be -- all before the war, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: My father was a businessman.</span> <span id="s382">My wife [indecipherable] in those days, wives didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: My father was a businessman.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Max Starkopf.</span> <span id="s387">And my wife -- my mother was Mary, but you know, in Polish Mary parts -- you know, that’s -- in Jewish Miriam, but you know, it’s still Mary Starkopf.</span> <span id="s388">And my in-laws, mil -- their last name was Miller, and my father-in-law was Aaron, A-a-r-o-n.</span> <span id="s389">And my wi -- my -- his wife was the same as my wife -- as my mother, the same names, the first name.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s391">And what -- what kind of business did your father have?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: My father?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Yeah, what kind of business?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: He was in business, he was, you know, have leather -- leather goods place, and he was representing some companies, also, you know.</span> <span id="s395">He was traveling a lot, this kind of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s396">We were not -- let’s put it this way, we were not poor people, not very rich people, average families, but nice families, we got nice comfortable life and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Did you have much when you were young?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: You know, way before the war?</span> <span id="s400">Did you have much contact with Polish people who were not Jews, or did the Jews pretty much stay with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: I had contact, I had, because when I was s -- in high school, there were Polish boys together with me too, we got a lot of friends, and you know, so -- and we were, you know, there was always a little anti-Semitism there too, you probably heard about it, but we -- we were never, you know, affected by it, you know, in general.</span> <span id="s402">But I would -- if you want to know, there were look tha -- like all over the world, there all kind of people, you see of the same na -- the same nationality even, you know.</span> <span id="s403">And [indecipherable] religion, [indecipherable] look, there were some Polish people, there’s -- you see, there was an ordinance, that anyone that is hiding a Jew, if the Ge-Germans will find it, they would be executed together with the Jews, the whole family.</span> <span id="s404">There were some, they were risking their lives.</span> <span id="s405">There was a pro -- a Dr. Chizevitch in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s406">He, in his apartment, broke a wall to other room, and put an artificial wall, they build special artificial wall that wouldn’t recognize it’s another room, you know?</span> <span id="s407">And had a special way he made it.</span> <span id="s408">And he was hiding the dean of the medical school, Jewish Dr. Beck, B-e-c-k, and his wife and two children.</span> <span id="s409">And he saved their lives.</span> <span id="s410">Now, you can imagine he was in that room in his apartment.</span> <span id="s411">If they would -- he risking -- he was risking his life, and he was risking you know, th-the -- the whole family’s life.</span> <span id="s412">And yet, he did it.</span> <span id="s413">And there were many like this.</span> <span id="s414">There was one Polish -- a younger man with a wife, they got no children, he was hiding, there was a somew -- not far from Warsaw, in a little town, they was hiding in the attic six people, family, grandmother and so on, six people.</span> <span id="s415">But there wa -- th-there was -- it came to a point that already, you know, they run out of money, also, p-pay them to, the wife of this man said, “Look, no use to risk any more our life, let’s give them up.”</span> <span id="s416">He took out a gun, he said, “If you give them up, I kill you, then myself, but I will never give them up.”</span> <span id="s417">And he saved them.</span> <span id="s418">Later I -- after the war, I saw to it that he got a big job in the government.</span> <span id="s419">But, you see, there was some like this, many, many like this.</span> <span id="s420">But yet, there were -- yo -- I told you about this doctor, the Jewish doctor, my friend that we escaped together with th -- when -- that he went to the hospital to get the job?</span> <span id="s421">You remember I told you that he was in the -- what my brother-in-law died.</span> <span id="s422">Now they settled here with his wife in a town in -- in eastern part of Poland, and there was a Polish boy, 17 or 16 years old, the son of a Polish peasant, who was very sick and needed an operation.</span> <span id="s423">He operated on, and he saved his life.</span> <span id="s424">And the father of this boy called the Gestapo, here is a Jewish doctor, pretends to be Polish.</span> <span id="s425">You -- You -- But this -- those are not human beings, you can’t b -- you can’t blame all the Polish people for it, because there are all kind of people in this world, you see what I mean?</span> <span id="s426">But th -- so I am not this kind of a person that I would sc -- you know, blame a fr -- it was just individua -- individual thing, there were all kind.</span> <span id="s427">I would say the intelligent people, and not only I mean educated, but th -- illiterate intelligent people, Polish people, they couldn’t help maybe, but they would never do a thing like this.</span> <span id="s428">But those who were illiterate peasants, you know, illiterate people, th-they were -- they were dangerous.</span> <span id="s429">But otherwise, not.</span> <span id="s430">But anyway, now you had more question, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Well, yeah, I -- I’m also wondering, you -- you talked earlier about -- also I should just say here in passing, that a lot of what we’re talking about, and the stories, and you saving your daughter, and all that --</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: If people want more detail on all that --</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: -- those are in your --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: I come to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: -- they’re in your video interview --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: -- which is on file at the Holocaust museum --</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: -- so there’s more information there, for people who want to look.</span> <span id="s442">And also in your book.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: But I -- I did want to ask you this, because I was wondering one thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: When the war started, and then when you made that walk, you were going to go enlist to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah, y-yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: I’m wondering, did you think much, what were you fighting as?</span> <span id="s449">Were you -- Did you go because you considered yourself a Pole, and you wanted to defend Poland?</span> <span id="s450">Or you wanted to fight the Germans beca -- did you know what the Germans were doing with the Jews?</span> <span id="s451">How did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s453">I heard about it, already, but I was -- no, I was going there -- there to -- to defend Poland, yeah.</span> <span id="s454">That was my normal idea, to defend Poland, of course.</span> <span id="s455">This was the idea.</span> <span id="s456">But, you know -- any other question, and then I’ll tell you -- shall I go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Well, so you con -- you considered yourself a Pole, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yeah, actually, I -- yeah, I was, but you know, even -- we -- as I told you, we were Zionists, we were [indecipherable] but we’re not fanatics, you know, and -- normal people.</span> <span id="s459">And, later on, when we were on Polish papers, you see, and we live -- I work in a lumber yard.</span> <span id="s460">I work in a lumber yard -- you want me to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: So, you know, anyway, when I came t -- first of all, when I came back, I found out that my in-laws, and my father, you know, were taken to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s463">I told you I went there to get them, I came back, told my -- I had to tell my wife about it.</span> <span id="s464">You can fi -- riz -- realize how she felt about it, but we decided one thing, we’re going to live for no other reason, to save the child.</span> <span id="s465">Do everything in our power to save the child, both of us.</span> <span id="s466">And we did it, we worked.</span> <span id="s467">My wife was going every week to church on Sundays.</span> <span id="s468">At night, in the evening, before we’re going to sleep you know, she used to, very loud at the wall, pray for the night, so the neighbor, you know, the one that we ri -- renting the room from, she would hear it, you see?</span> <span id="s469">And that’s -- nobody would suspect us, you see, that we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s470">And, of course, we were raising the child, and we were very, very poor that -- I mean, I was working, I was getting rations in the lumber yard, as a laborer, nothing.</span> <span id="s471">But that was -- we were going through all kind of different times, and I also had to watch, you see, very carefully, you know, that shouldn’t sometime recognize, or something like this.</span> <span id="s472">There was one -- one boy that was a clerk there, not a laborer like I, was v -- 18 years old.</span> <span id="s473">Very delicate, very gentle, good looking, and a blonde boy, and he always [indecipherable] he saw me to -- picking up a big piece of lumber, let’s say, you know, to put away, he said, “Mr. Podalski,” -- I was already in comparison old man, I was in my -- you know, 20’s, he said, “Let me help you.”</span> <span id="s474">And I said to my wife many times when I was coming to the -- where I -- walking distance from the lumber yard, I said, “You know, there is working one boy, I am very suspicious about him, he is too delicate, he is too gentle.</span> <span id="s475">He’s ats -- I don’t know, he’s not an average,” you know.</span> <span id="s476">And I want -- I said, “I’m going to find out.”</span> <span id="s477">And I walk over one day to him, I said, “Look, Wally, how about to go with me Sunday to the church?”</span> <span id="s478">I didn’t go like my wife was going, I didn’t, but you know, I said Sunday to the church.</span> <span id="s479">He says, “Okay, why not?”</span> <span id="s480">And the church was about three kilometers away from the lumberyard, you have to walk on the highways, and on bo -- on the highway, on both sides of the highway were forests -- woods were.</span> <span id="s481">I walked with him, I said to him, “You know, Wally,” -- in Polish, of course, “what would -- wis t -- what should we do if some Jewish people were hiding in the woods, would run out and attack us?”</span> <span id="s482">He said, “Mr. Podalski, I don’t think there are any, but if they are, they are happy they will li -- that they are left alone.</span> <span id="s483">They’re trying to be in hiding.</span> <span id="s484">They wouldn’t torture, they wouldn’t hurt us.”</span> <span id="s485">I said, “Wally, I am Jewish, how about are you?”</span> <span id="s486">And he embraced me, he started to cry, the boy.</span> <span id="s487">He was Jewish, too.</span> <span id="s488">He was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s489">I wri -- I wrote about him, and that whole story, in my book, you know.</span> <span id="s490">So, you know, he was Jewish, too, he was killed later.</span> <span id="s491">Anyway, we -- so we had all kind our tol -- our dow -- our daughter while we were there.</span> <span id="s492">One day, she devel -- she got sick, she got very high fever, and my wife went with her by train to Warsaw, to the children’s hospital, to check with the doctors.</span> <span id="s493">They check her, they said, “Oh my God, she has tuberculosis.”</span> <span id="s494">And the only way we could save her would have -- she has a hole in her lung, the left lung.</span> <span id="s495">The only way we could help, if you could have gold injections, so we could, you know, cover the -- with the gold injections, the -- the hole in the lung, and she would be saved -- you know, got rid of the bi -- tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s496">We didn’t -- We couldn’t -- We wouldn’t have a penny, we couldn’t dream about gold injections.</span> <span id="s497">But then we had an idea.</span> <span id="s498">We had a very close friend, a Greek, Stamatos Kokinikis.</span> <span id="s499">He used to have in Warsaw, a factory of Halivah, you know, making.</span> <span id="s500">It was business, very good.</span> <span id="s501">And I used to -- I was an accountant.</span> <span id="s502">My wife graduated law school.</span> <span id="s503">I -- You know, and I, like a -- you know, like here, you know, accountant si -- let’s say, you know, public, or a peer -- a regular accountant.</span> <span id="s504">Anyway, and I was taking care of his books, so my wife went to him.</span> <span id="s505">And I -- Later I found out that he was arrested few times even, because he was helping Jewish people.</span> <span id="s506">But he had connections with the Italian embassy in Warsaw, because Italy -- Hitler and Mussolini were allies.</span> <span id="s507">So he said -- My wife told him about the gold injections.</span> <span id="s508">He said, “Don’t worry, I get it for you.”</span> <span id="s509">And he got it through the Italian consulate.</span> <span id="s510">He got injections and he gave it, he save our child.</span> <span id="s511">And when she was in the hospital, his -- he had a maid, a Polish woman, who knew about it.</span> <span id="s512">She used to come to the hospital to bring her goo -- you know, some good food and things, you know, to -- to give the child, you know, the -- well, you know, she a Polish woman, you see, she was doing it for her.</span> <span id="s513">So, anyway, and then sh -- when she was later okay, our daughter, and there were times when we -- you know, were s -- were scared all the time, because we still had to watch ourselves and so on, but somehow, you know, we’re through -- the whole t-time, or like this, and nobody could recognize us, you know.</span> <span id="s514">But one day, when the -- the Jewish boy was killed, you see, i -- had -- I write a -- i-i-in the book about his family, and how they were -- why they were killed, and so on, but you know, we were scared that they may [indecipherable] because they knew that I was close already, you know, always with the boy -- go nice with the boy, and that I was -- his parents were there, living not far.</span> <span id="s515">So anyway, I put our daughter in a sanitorium, because you know, to -- altogether that she should be, you know, well taken care of, and so on.</span> <span id="s516">And we were watching, and so on, and one day -- and I f -- the -- the Germans trucks surrounded the -- the lumber yard, looking -- I di -- that time I found out, looking for his fa -- the boy’s parents.</span> <span id="s517">Now, what I found out -- not for his, but they looking for the more Jews there.</span> <span id="s518">What I found out anyway, that his father -- you see, they were from a different city, not from Warsaw, and he -- they were very well-to-do people, very well off, he had a big factory, and so on.</span> <span id="s519">But his father in the -- they all pretend, three of them also, that they are, you know, Polish.</span> <span id="s520">But his father, in order to operate with the peasants, that they -- together he was making -- they were making whiskey, you know, in many -- the some -- in the villages some, you know, home made whiskey, and he was with them.</span> <span id="s521">And -- And I understood that -- that something came out that he probably was in there drunk, or something, that they suspe -- you know, that they called the Gestapo, that we think that they are Jewish people.</span> <span id="s522">And they came one night there, and they killed him, and th -- th -- the -- the parents.</span> <span id="s523">But after this, you know, we were already shaken, we were very scared.</span> <span id="s524">So one day, there was a man working in the -- a laborer, but he was working in the room where they had all kind of things there, you know, in the lumberyard, but anyway, a Polish man, and he came over there to our little room that we lived there, and he said, “You know, I had to get drunk to tell you, because I didn’t have never spoke to you.</span> <span id="s525">Somebody here asked whether you are also Jewish.</span> <span id="s526">And I wouldn’t like this should happen to you, what happened to the [indecipherable] -- to the other one.”</span> <span id="s527">Listen to this.</span> <span id="s528">And he said, “But my wife said to me, ‘You see, it’s all your fault, especially that there was that.</span> <span id="s529">’” She says, “Y-You trying to, as a Polish officer, you’re trying to do everything, you know, for the [indecipherable] and th-th-then they call you here, they think that you are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s530">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s531">She just made it so that -- and he said, “Oh my God, I am so -- I love you,” he said, “I,” -- you know, changed completely.</span> <span id="s532">And [indecipherable] but we already scared.</span> <span id="s533">And then there was occasion I wrote about in the book, I left the [indecipherable] and got the job in another place on the railroad, you know, and somehow we survived like this, that in 1944, in August, were liberated by the Russian army.</span> <span id="s534">And you know that i-i-in ’41, they started -- they became enemies, you know, Russia and Germany, in 1941.</span> <span id="s535">So, for two years they were allies, and later they were enemies.</span> <span id="s536">So that’s what it was, and they were liberated that time.</span> <span id="s537">And so you go on farther, what you want more?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: O-O-Okay.</span> <span id="s539">Let me just, again, we’ll pick up the story again, but I actually had another question from before the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: -- which is, you went to the university?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Which university did you go to, what did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: W-Warsaw.</span> <span id="s545">Accounting and Business Administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s547">You know, one thing I’ve noticed throughout your entire story is you and your wife both, but it seems like often you were the -- the planner.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: You had a lot of plans, and schemes, and you were very clever in how you would come up with these various scenarios and plans, and -- and it seems like there was a lot of meticulous planning on, you had to know people’s schedules.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: You had to know all kinds of things that -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: -- continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Adam Starkopf.</span> <span id="s553">This is tape number two, side A. -- noticed throughout your entire story is you and your wife both, but it seems like often you were the -- the planner.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: You had a lot of plans, and schemes, and you were very clever in how you would come up with these various scenarios and plans, and -- and it seems like there was a lot of meticulous planning on, you had to know people’s schedules.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: You had to know all kinds of things that --</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: That’s -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: -- customs, the way they operated.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s561">Wel --</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Are you just a very clever person, or why -- why did that --</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: I don’t know how [indecipherable] that’s -- I -- I couldn’t tell you about it, fi -- because I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s564">I am not bragging about it, you know.</span> <span id="s565">But one thing was certain, that the child meant so much to us -- everything, not so much, that we decided, and you know, sometime -- was time we were hungry, but she was first.</span> <span id="s566">If we got a big apple, I peeled the apple, I cut it up, I gave the pieces of apple to the baby, and my wife and I were just eating the -- the skin, or so, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s567">And also, I very, very -- we’re very -- th-that’s -- we lived only -- we said we are going to live for one reason, to save the child.</span> <span id="s568">And that’s how we did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: And her name was -- her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: I-I-In Polish, it was Jasia, the Polish name.</span> <span id="s571">Jaisa, it means J-a-s-i-a.</span> <span id="s572">You know, that’s Polish name, but here it’s Joanne.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Joanne.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: She is a grandmother already now.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s576">Oh.</span> <span id="s577">So the -- the -- the Russians come, and y -- and you’re liberated, and then what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: When they were liberated, you see, I -- there was -- they -- they f -- you know, they organized a Polish -- establish a Polish government.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: You know?</span> <span id="s581">Polish Communistic government.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: And there was an occasion I joined the government.</span> <span id="s584">I joined the government, and I was wor -- y-you know, and after a certain time, I really rose to a very high position there.</span> <span id="s585">But being that this was Communistic government, and so on, and I wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s586">First of all, the only man survived from the whole family -- from both families, was my brother in Palestine.</span> <span id="s587">So, I was dreaming to go to him, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: You were -- I’m -- I’m sorry, I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: I was dreaming to go to my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: In Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Of course, it was -- it was 1945.</span> <span id="s592">1944 we liberated, in 1945, they organized the new Polish government.</span> <span id="s593">But, you know, it was impossible, so anyway, one day we decided to leave the -- Poland.</span> <span id="s594">You know, I didn’t want to be the Communistic government.</span> <span id="s595">And I decided with my wife and the baby that we escape.</span> <span id="s596">And we escape from Warsaw to another city.</span> <span id="s597">You know, left Warsaw to ano -- not to escape to, you know, like -- like we -- before, but you know, we just decided to leave it.</span> <span id="s598">I didn’t tell anybody wi -- the -- the government about it, you know.</span> <span id="s599">We went to another city, where we had friends there, and -- that survived, and we stayed there for awhile, fi -- not too long, and from there, we went to -- we escaped to Czechoslovakia, and to Germany, to the American zone.</span> <span id="s600">And there we -- in those days they established DP camps, Displaced Person camps, for refugees, you know, that -- [indecipherable] had any hopes any more.</span> <span id="s601">So we went to a DP camp, not far from Munich in Germany.</span> <span id="s602">And in the DP camp we had a little -- little place -- room in the basement, up a -- like, you know?</span> <span id="s603">And we were there, and I was hoping that I will be able to go to Palestine with my wife and baby, to my brother.</span> <span id="s604">But, it -- it was Palestine, you know, that there were no way -- we couldn’t -- and to s -- so they -- they used to take -- there was, you know, there was i -- they call it, I think the illegal, you know, brigade, and they would set on taking people, you know, coming, taking some Zionists, and so on, to Palestine.</span> <span id="s605">And in those days, some people were -- they were taking some people.</span> <span id="s606">They wanted once to take my wife and the baby, but not a man.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Was this the Bricha?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Bricha.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: So, you know about it.</span> <span id="s611">It was Bricha, you see.</span> <span id="s612">So I -- They wanted to take my wife and the baby.</span> <span id="s613">You see, I tell you the story.</span> <span id="s614">Actually, I never wanted, because it was nothing.</span> <span id="s615">I was, when I was in the government, I was smuggling out [indecipherable] you mentioned the one Bricha, so I say I can tell you.</span> <span id="s616">You see, I was smuggling out the most prominent Zionist in sucha -- in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s617">I was smuggling out -- they were in Russian ambulances, they were -- tho -- they’re going to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s618">From there, the boys on Bricha were picking them up.</span> <span id="s619">My superior officer was a Jewish man, Kratko his name was.</span> <span id="s620">A za -- Communist.</span> <span id="s621">He found out about it, and he called the military police to arrest me.</span> <span id="s622">A Jewish m -- you see what I mean?</span> <span id="s623">He called the military and they -- they -- but they tipped me off, and the man -- I had a car to my disposition, that I -- to my disposal, and the car [indecipherable] and that how we escape, we throw away the keys, and we escape from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s624">I ha -- I fa -- later I found out from some fa -- prince they wanted later move to the U-United States that they heard that there -- there were -- you see, when there was a -- the -- the Communistic government, I could never get it back to Poland, you know?</span> <span id="s625">They were looking for me for awhile.</span> <span id="s626">Anyway, and that’s how we esc -- that’s why we escape to the DP camp.</span> <span id="s627">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: So th -- So that’s why you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: That’s why we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: If -- If that hadn’t have happened, if your superior had not tried to have you arrested --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Then, I would remain there.</span> <span id="s632">I would remain there, because probably later, I was hoping it would change from a Communistic to a regular government, the Russian army will move, and then I was hoping legally to -- I’ll be able someday to get to -- to my brother.</span> <span id="s633">But I wanted to remain there, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s634">But -- Bu -- Because of this, you know, I had to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Let me -- Let me ask you one thing, though.</span> <span id="s636">There have been many accounts, and some of the people, survivors that I’ve interviewed, who were from Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: -- ha-have all talked about how after the war, the Germans were gone, but many of the Poles were still attacking and killing Jews, there were pogroms.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: I n -- I never --</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Did you hear about any of this, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I never heard about it even.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Not only that I -- It was, I think once I heard the one town [indecipherable] was there, but nothing, n-nothing pa -- Warsaw, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s644">I only escaped for this reason.</span> <span id="s645">And this Jewish man, Zigmund Kratko, you see, and he was the one.</span> <span id="s646">So I -- And we were in the DP camp, and they wanted to take my wife and the baby, but I saved them from the war, I didn’t want to let them go away from me, you know, because during the -- you know, when we were -- you know, on the Polish paper it’s on, I didn’t -- once it -- it -- there was someth -- sometime in -- there were times when you [indecipherable] a little bit were scared, you know?</span> <span id="s647">So one of my Polish friends that knew about it, one that helped me even with the documents, he said to me, “You know what, I can take Pella,” which is my wife, he says, “It’s all,” -- he says, “Sofia.”</span> <span id="s648">You know, she was -- Polish name is Sofia that time, “and I can -- she can be as a maid with some Polish, you know, family, and she could survive there, and don’t worry about it, and then you can take,” -- I said, “I would not let her off my eyes for one moment.”</span> <span id="s649">You see, and I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s650">Now, when -- So from there, later on, I was thinking that someday we’ll be able to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s651">But one day, the woman that was in charge, you know, was -- you know, was all -- you know, there in -- in the DP camp, walk over to us.</span> <span id="s652">She was an American woman, you know, a volunteer there.</span> <span id="s653">And she said, “Pe -- Adam and Pella,” they were th -- our names, “would you like to go to United States?”</span> <span id="s654">I said, “No, I don’t like, I -- my brother’s in Palestine.”</span> <span id="s655">She said, “Look, you can always go there if you la -- later from there.”</span> <span id="s656">He said, “I can get an affidavit for you, I will make an affidavit for you, you can leave just right away.”</span> <span id="s657">And that’s how -- that’s why we here in the United States.</span> <span id="s658">And then, of course, I was in touch with my brother, but my brother, when Israel was established, you know, 1948, we came -- arrive in United States in 1946.</span> <span id="s659">In 1946 we arrived here, in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Let me ask you the -- the DP camp you’re in --</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: What was the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Feldifing, that’s the name.</span> <span id="s664">Fel -- The ca -- The DP camp in Feldifing.</span> <span id="s665">Feldifing was the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: How did you get out of Communist Poland, into the American sector of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Oh, I told you that I ran awa -- I went to the -- I -- I went to the other city, cit -- Lodz -- L-o-d-z.</span> <span id="s668">You see, the dis -- with some -- there were friends living all there, and then when we decided to escape, you go right away, I was, you know, planned to escape.</span> <span id="s669">You know, I escape fr-from there in a Russian ambulance from there.</span> <span id="s670">I had connections, you know, through the -- in a Russian ambulance, to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s671">From Czechoslovakia, we went to the American zone, Warsaw.</span> <span id="s672">It’s -- It’s -- It’s a -- It’s again long story, but it’s nothing that it’s you know -- we didn’t risk anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s674">So the camp was named --</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Feldifing, that’s was ca -- the ca -- the DP camp.</span> <span id="s676">Displaced Person camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s678">How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: We arrived there in 1945, in November -- I th -- in October, and we left in 1946, you know, in May.</span> <span id="s680">Over a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: But until the person in the camp offered you a chance to come to United States, you’d never had any notion to come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Not here, no, no.</span> <span id="s683">Not here.</span> <span id="s684">Alth -- I -- I knew -- you see, I -- I had family here.</span> <span id="s685">I mean, the fa -- I didn’t know them.</span> <span id="s686">My father’s brother, in 19 fi -- 05 -- in 1905 immigrated to United States, and he was in New York, and settled in Chicago, and my father used to correspond with him all as I was growing up.</span> <span id="s687">As I -- All the time, and sending pictures of him, all the pictures, you know, including later our wedding.</span> <span id="s688">In fact, when we escaped from the ghetto, we didn’t have with us one picture, purposely, I didn’t want any.</span> <span id="s689">But all my pictures for the book and all this, from my uncle here.</span> <span id="s690">You see?</span> <span id="s691">So we came to sh -- so we were -- when we decided to -- we did what the woman advised us that made the affidavit for us, and we came to -- into -- when we were in New York, you know, going through the customs, our child -- this was 19 -- this was 1946, so she was already -- she was almost five years old, you know, four and a half years old.</span> <span id="s692">So she started, “Mommy, Daddy, are they shooting people here?</span> <span id="s693">Are there people’s,” -- You know, because she already, you know, knew a little bit.</span> <span id="s694">And my wife said, “Darling no, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s695">This a free country, nobody will torture us,” and so on.</span> <span id="s696">And then she tells to me, my wife, crying, she says, “I can’t believe it, that we are here together, three of us.</span> <span id="s697">I -- I pinch myself, but it’s true.”</span> <span id="s698">I said, “You see, I told you that never give up, there is always time to die.</span> <span id="s699">Never,” -- because there were times she wanted to give up, you know.</span> <span id="s700">I said, “Never give up, there’s always time to die.”</span> <span id="s701">And that’s why my first book that I wrote was, “There is Always Time To Die,” the title of the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s703">How did you come over to United States, on a -- on a ship, I imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: We came on a -- a -- a navy transport ship.</span> <span id="s705">Navy transport ship, and there were quite a few refugees on this ship.</span> <span id="s706">We arrive in shi -- and then you see and they had telephones there, and I approach somebody there g -- to ti -- they have telephones from all over the United States, you know, books, and they -- Jacob Starkopf in Chicago.</span> <span id="s707">The only difference they Starkopf f-f instead w -- I spelled -- in Poland we’re p-f at the end, Starkopf.</span> <span id="s708">Here, they have Starkoff, f-f at the end, and he was -- so that’s why we came to Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s710">But your ship landed in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: We landed in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Do you remember coming into the harbor the -- the day you actually -- the ship actually came into the harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Oh, th -- May -- May 23rd, 1946, yeah.</span> <span id="s714">We were penniless, we were penniless [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: What did you -- As you were coming into the harbor, what did you see?</span> <span id="s716">Did you see the Statue of Liberty, and all that?</span> <span id="s717">Where -- Was it dark, or light out, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: No, it -- daytime, yeah.</span> <span id="s719">We saw Statue of Liberty, you know, yes, but we didn’t know much about those things, it’s, you know, just -- so that’s how we started, and you know, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: S-So did you come very quickly from New York to Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: After a few days, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: And what did you do once you got here?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Of course, you know, I met the family, but what did I do here?</span> <span id="s724">I just tried to get a job, and I -- I knew very little English, very little.</span> <span id="s725">I -- I knew a lit -- I thought that I know, but actually, you know, over there I thought I know English, but when ca-came, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s726">But I learned pretty quickly, and I started to work.</span> <span id="s727">I started to work in -- in the -- in -- in different places, from one to the other, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: What -- What type of jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: In the office, but nothing special, you know, nothing --</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: As an accountant, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: No, no, not a -- as an accountant, in the beginning, no.</span> <span id="s732">But, we met, you see, it’s a long story again, you see, how I started my business.</span> <span id="s733">It’s a -- you know, in the DP camp, we were with the -- we met a man, became very friendly with a man that lost his wife and three children -- from a different city, not from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s734">He lost his wife, and he survived from Auschwitz concentration camp.</span> <span id="s735">He was alone.</span> <span id="s736">So we told him that when we come, you know, later, when we were leaving, I said, “We’ll be in touch with you.”</span> <span id="s737">When I came here, we met there, through my -- through my uncle back here, because he had a little store -- this was a man who doesn’t know -- Jewish man, who hardly knew how to sign his name, very plain guy.</span> <span id="s738">But he was pretty well off.</span> <span id="s739">He was in some kind of construction business, and so on.</span> <span id="s740">Very nice person.</span> <span id="s741">He was hel -- He was always gi-giving to -- try to help us through a little bit.</span> <span id="s742">And I ask him, “Could you make an affidavit for a man that I befriended?”</span> <span id="s743">And told him about the man there, and he made an affidavit for him.</span> <span id="s744">He’s the one, Martin Fox, F-o-x.</span> <span id="s745">He made it -- He arrived here, and he stayed with us, and my wife with me.</span> <span id="s746">And we got one r -- little room, you know, but anyway, we were together, manage with him.</span> <span id="s747">And then we had -- we’re here, we met Warsaw friend who was at the university with us, very fine guy.</span> <span id="s748">He was here with his wife.</span> <span id="s749">Both were from ou -- survived Auschwitz concentration camp.</span> <span id="s750">And here, she became pregnant, his wife, when they were already here.</span> <span id="s751">And while she was delivering the baby, she died.</span> <span id="s752">Can you imagine, going through an -- everything, then she died?</span> <span id="s753">So, I was working that time, in the stockyard here, in the office.</span> <span id="s754">I couldn’t go to the funeral, but my wife, with this -- our friend, went to the chapel, to the funeral, of our friend’s wife.</span> <span id="s755">And as they were sitting in the chapel, and then passing by and this Martin is our friend, jumps out, “Ralph, I didn’t know that you alive.”</span> <span id="s756">They were both in -- in -- in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s757">This one was alive, and this one was alive.</span> <span id="s758">And this one was single -- single -- one man.</span> <span id="s759">And so you know -- so my wife talked to him, too, of course, and she -- I ask him to come to us, and we became friendly.</span> <span id="s760">He was from a different city.</span> <span id="s761">Ralph Bell, his name was, b -- here it was Bell, over there it was a different name, Bello, he change.</span> <span id="s762">Anyway, he was in con -- he was in concentration camp, he lost a wife and a child.</span> <span id="s763">And he was survive in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s764">And then -- so we became very fr -- you know, we’re friends.</span> <span id="s765">But then one day, I saved 15 dollars to buy a tricycle for my wi -- for my daughter, a tricycle.</span> <span id="s766">So my wife went with my friend, he didn’t work yet, and I was working, and she went with him, on Roosevelt Road, here in Chicago to buy a tr -- the tricycle, there was a store, you know, had sporting goods, toys and bicycles, and he went there to buy the bicycle for the 15 dollars.</span> <span id="s767">And in the windows -- in the window, there were footballs and basketballs, leather balls.</span> <span id="s768">So this friend of ours said to the man, to the owner of the store, who was Jewish -- so he said to the man, “You know, I was in the leather goods, I know how to sew on the special machine, pur -- Puritan machine, leather.</span> <span id="s769">Maybe you can get me a job.”</span> <span id="s770">So here was a company in Chicago, Dubow, D -- D-u-b-o-w, sporting goods company.</span> <span id="s771">He gave him the j -- He called them, and he gave him a job.</span> <span id="s772">And he worked there, and after a few months he came to us, to the -- and I became friendly also with this man that we met that you know, lost his wife and baby.</span> <span id="s773">And he was alone.</span> <span id="s774">And he came, and he said, “Listen, I work for the leather company, how about to start business, to make leather footballs, and basketballs?”</span> <span id="s775">And that’s how we started the business.</span> <span id="s776">We didn’t have a penny, we didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s777">I went to the American National Bank with my friend, with this one that we met here, and ask for a loan for 3,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s778">So he said, “What do you have for a collateral?”</span> <span id="s779">We didn’t know what it means, collateral, even -- anyway, he said to -- “I’ll let you know.”</span> <span id="s780">And he let us know, and he ga -- they gave us, and we started a business.</span> <span id="s781">And we started business, the three of us, and we’re doing, you know, manufacturing, footballs, and basketballs.</span> <span id="s782">But then later, we switched to import.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s784">What was the name of -- of your --</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Trio Sporting, Trio Sporting was manufacturing company.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Trio?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Tr -- T-r-i-o, because three of us, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: But la -- But after f-f-few years, we parted with the other -- with the guy that I brought here, because he married here, he married here, and he remar -- this one, too -- they both remarry -- married, but this one married a terrible woman, you know, and he got sick, anyway, and she was mixing him up, and he died, anyway.</span> <span id="s790">And I -- I made with this one, I was 35 years in business with him, when we decided to retire.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: When --</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: [indecipherable] were in import business, I was traveling to the Orient.</span> <span id="s793">I even speak a little Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: And -- And so that remained your business, always, this --</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Here?</span> <span id="s796">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span

community, you see, and I was in Israel many times, you know, my brother died in 1965, he got a heart attack, he died there.</span> <span id="s801">But his -- he has two daughters, and got the grandchil -- we very close with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s803">Did your wife work once she got over here, or did she stay at home?</span></p> <p><span

id="s808">She’s terrific.”</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Did you -- So did you, your family, live in the city in Chicago?</span> <span id="s812">Did you have an apartment, a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: We had -- w -- first we had an apartment, you know, though they were changing very often.</span> <span id="s814">Later we moved to Skokie, we were living in Skokie for quite a few years, and then we moved to -- on Lakeshore Drive, in the city, downtown, we lived.</span> <span id="s815">We had a place -- a condominium apartment for many years, 29 years there, I think.</span> <span id="s816">But then we decided -- my daughter -- our daughter, of course, got married, and had two children, a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s817">And they -- they both married, too, already, you know, the grandson and granddaughter, and they have children, we’re great-grandparents, because we have -- you know, they have both a little boy and a girl, a little boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s818">And they live in Highland Park, and Buffalo Grove, which are two suburbs right through, 10 minutes away from us.</span> <span id="s819">So we decided to move, and we moved here.</span> <span id="s820">But one day our granddaughter walk over to us, and she said, “Grandpa, Grandma, I remembered what you were telling us about your grandparents, and how you were for them, and they were later in -- your grandfather was with us -- with your parents, and so on, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s821">We are going to move,” she said, “to [indecipherable] to -- there is a new area here, they call it Forsheridan, 10 minutes away from here, you know?</span> <span id="s822">So anyway,” she says, “we want to be together,” she said, and we should move with them.</span> <span id="s823">It was when my wife yet was alive, even.</span> <span id="s824">So anyway, to make the story short, I’m going too, at the end of July.</span> <span id="s825">This place is almost sold, and we will s-sell it very soon, be -- it will go through, the sale, and then I with her together are buying a building, a very big house in the Forsheridan, and I will -- my granddaughter, and her husband and the children there.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: So you’re all going to live together in the

id="s830">Q: Now, when your daughter was very young, you had sort of a strange situation.</span> <span id="s831">She didn’t know that she was Jewish, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: [indecipherable] not, and we had very hard time to persuade her that she is Jewish later.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: And she actually would -- I believe in your videotape, you said that -- or maybe your wife told the story about how occasionally your own daughter would say anti-Semitic things.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s835">I give you an example.</span> <span id="s836">Then, maybe, I don’t remember when I said it, you see, for example, sometime, you know, she was a baby, three and a half years old yet, in the lumberyard [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s837">She was walking, she came with a piece of branch on her shoulder, piece of branch, you know, just from a --</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: From a tree?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: -- from a tree.</span> <span id="s840">I said, “Jasia, [indecipherable] what -- what you doing?”</span> <span id="s841">In Polish, you know, “Why do you have that?”</span> <span id="s842">“I’m going to hunt for Jews.”</span> <span id="s843">She heard those things, you see?</span> <span id="s844">Hunt for Jews.</span> <span id="s845">That’s why I told this boy -- when I told you that -- I tol -- I said, what we do, the Jewish people are somewhere in the woods, you see?</span> <span id="s846">So she said, “I’m going hunting for the Jews.”</span> <span id="s847">So she didn’t know, and she had hard time later, too.</span> <span id="s848">And there were certain things that she was growing up, you know, affected her, li -- she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: So she -- But she was

incredible turmoil to guard her, to save her.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Yeah, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: And now here’s your own daughter coming and saying these sort of things.</span> <span id="s857">I mean, the minute that she said that --</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: What -- What must have you -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: I di --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: -- what -- what must you have felt in your heart?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: You -- Y -- I -- It’s hard to display -- to explain.</span> <span id="s863">You can realize what we had in our heart, especially my wife, as a woman.</span> <span id="s864">Of course, we were very sad about it, but we had to pretend to -- you know, it’s -- there were times that I was writing post cards f -- you know, mailing from Warsaw to us, that people should think that we have families, you know?</span> <span id="s865">So we had to pretend many things, and she didn’t.</span> <span id="s866">But she -- she couldn’t get used to -- but she had certain things -- she was here already, when she was -- sh -- because she was in the -- she was in a sanitorium where were run by nuns.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Yeah, Warsaw for awhile.</span> <span id="s869">At that time, they were -- she -- she said to -- she told us that sometime they [indecipherable], “If you don’t behave yourself at night, you’ll be -- if you -- if you don’t behave yourself,” there were all kinds of people, “the Jewish pe -- will pick you up.”</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: The nuns would say this?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: If you don’t [indecipherable], if you don’t behave yourself at night, a Jew will pick you up.</span> <span id="s872">She was very -- She couldn’t -- If she saw a -- a woman with, you know, a -- in a gown, you know, like the nuns, she was scared to -- even here, she was affected.</span> <span id="s873">She was in the hospital, she was very sick, she was in Rochester, in Minnesota, you know, where the Mayo Clinic?</span> <span id="s874">And she was there in the hospital.</span> <span id="s875">And they put a sign on her door in the room, that nurses in th -- in nun’s uniforms cannot go in there, because she was affected.</span> <span id="s876">But then she changed.</span> <span id="s877">She cha -- After we -- you know, later on, to a point that she -- she said i -- over there, that she’s very sorry, because when we -- w -- I don’t remember what it was, I think was a lot of flowers and other thing that we -- I was in business, you know, that she received in the hospital there.</span> <span id="s878">I think it was Saint Mary Hospital, something like this.</span> <span id="s879">And so, when she was released, she took all this to the chapel, to the cat -- to the -- to the cattle of -- ch-chapel that was there, on the same floor, or something, in the hospital.</span> <span id="s880">And she gave everything there, and she [indecipherable] -- she’s different now, you know, but this was when she was very young, before she was married.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: How old was she when you told her that she was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Oh, when tell her?</span> <span id="s883">When we were liberated.</span> <span id="s884">So we were liberated in 19 for -- 1944 in August, she was born in 1941.</span> <span id="s885">She was three years old.</span> <span id="s886">She couldn’t understand, a three years old child.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s888">And -- But was that very difficult, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Oh, it was very difficult, of course, but we had to

died in April.</span> <span id="s934">He was about my age.</span> <span id="s935">He never talk about it.</span> <span id="s936">Of course, he remarried, had children here, you know.</span> <span id="s937">But, he lost a wife and a baby.</span> <span id="s938">But, he nev -- he couldn’t talk about those things.</span> <span id="s939">I t -- My wife wouldn’t like to talk about it either.</span> <span id="s940">I mean, she could mention, but not like -- our daughter couldn’t completely, you see, couldn’t hear about it.</span> <span id="s941">She co -- right away started to cry, you see?</span> <span id="s942">But I can talk, and I am here to help the Holocaust Memorial Foundation of Illinois and Chicago.</span> <span id="s943">They have like a mini-museum over there in Skokie.</span> <span id="s944">And they have sko -- like tomorrow, tomorrow morning at 9:45, I ca -- two school buses there in the morning.</span> <span id="s945">I speak at ni -- at 9:45 in the morning.</span> <span id="s946">I speak to the -- I speak to them about, you know, the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s947">I speak to them w-why I am doing it, because I don’t -- they should never go through the same thing.</span> <span id="s948">And I am telling them I have the information what's going on in United States, with the Ku Klux Klan, with the Aryan Nation, you know, and -- and the neo-Nazis and Skinheads, and so on.</span> <span id="s949">And I am telling them that should not happen to anyone, because [indecipherable] the Aryan Nation in Portland, Oregon, Richard Butler, who is the chairman of the organization, at one of their meetings, he said, “I will not take off my robe, until the day when the last nigger and Jew with be executed in United States.”</span> <span id="s950">And they -- somebody from that organization killed a Jewish radio talk man in Denver, Colorado.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: You me -- Alan Berg?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Alan Berg.</span> <span id="s953">You see, you know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Alan Berg was killed by them.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: So you see, those things are, and I s -- so we co -- my daughter never could talk about it, when sometimes she went with me, and I spoke in schools.</span> <span id="s958">That’s not in the [indecipherable] foundation, but in schools, she would wa-walk out from the cla -- from the room.</span> <span id="s959">She wouldn’t listen.</span> <span id="s960">But one day -- You know, for the Holocaust Museum in Washington, you know, they -- we had here, like parlor meetings, fundraising things, in Chicago.</span> <span id="s961">You know, the Chicago chapter, in Highland Park here, they have their office.</span> <span id="s962">And one day, she had a meeting -- parlor meeting, and General Levine, who was a Jewish doc -- man, who was a general during the war, and he was with the army, American army, and he was with one of the units that liberated one of the -- I don’t remember, Auschwitz, or Buchenwald, one of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s963">And he was the speaker there.</span> <span id="s964">My daughter called next day -- it was quite few years ago.</span> <span id="s965">She said, “Mom and Dad, that General Levine spoke, and he had tears in his eyes when he talk about when he liberated the -- liberate the camps.</span> <span id="s966">From now on, I am not any more hiding.</span> <span id="s967">I can talk about it, too.”</span> <span id="s968">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: When did you start speaking in schools?</span> <span id="s970">Was that a long time ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: When they were establish here, they were establish about 10 - 11 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: No, you see, the governor of

<span id="s974">In 1990 or 1991, you know, nine or eight years ago.</span> <span id="s975">Signed a bill which became a -- you know, that all the -- that they -- all the high sch -- all schools, elementary schools, and high schools, have to have courses on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s976">And this became like a law, you know?</span> <span id="s977">So, the Holocaust Foundation here has two educational chairmen.</span> <span id="s978">One is professor -- Jewish -- professor of that Roosevelt University, he’s still a professor, the other [indecipherable] University, he’s still a professor.</span> <span id="s979">And they are, you know, the -- the -- they have leavin meetings with the board of -- bo-board of education in Chicago, and they -- they teaching these teachers,

speaks [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Why do you think you were -- you know, your daughter didn’t want to talk about it at all, your wife didn’t like talking about it, but you, you were writing notes down so that you wouldn’t forget anything, and you would --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: That time I wrote notes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s984">Why -- Why do you think that you were that way?</span> <span id="s985">Why -- Why were you different, any idea?</span> <span id="s986">A: I -- I tell you the truth, I never thought of

know, very active for [indecipherable] organizations here.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Did you ever go back to Europe, to Poland, or any of these places?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: To Poland, no.</span> <span id="s992">When there was Communistic government, I couldn’t, and later on we couldn’t, because you know, first of all my wife was sick for quite a few years.</span> <span id="s993">She was very weak, and she was sick, it’s affected her more -- much more than me, you know, everything.</span> <span id="s994">Anyway, but she was already sick, so we didn’t go.</span> <span

notion was to get 6,000,000 pennies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Yeah, we -- we [indecipherable] we sent it.</span> <span id="s1097">I think we sent almost everything, probably everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: So you collected 6,000,000 pennies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Yeah, we were doing it, you see, we were getting pennies from people, you know, all over.</span> <span id="s1100">There was one woman, not Jewish, she was -- I -- when we lite -- lake -- we live downtown, and the doorbell called me, and there was a big, big, you know, box of pennies, and a ba -- and a cake for us, left in the [indecipherable], and the name of the woman, you know?</span> <span id="s1101">And we -- we -- I am sending her always Christmas cards, she is sending us

will do it, I didn’t sa -- I was not shipping the pennies, I was going to the bank, and they were, you know, changing the -- they were count -- you know, they had machines to count them, and they would give me checks, and the checks I was sending to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: And where would you send the checks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: To you, to Washington, to the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1108">What about -- Do you -- I know you -- your family was very Zionist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: And you were -- you were -- you were , too.</span> <span id="s1111">Di -- Were you religious at all?</span> <span id="s1112">I mean, the question I have is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: -- having lived through the Holocaust, and -- and seen some of what you saw --</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: -- did it change your notion about God, or did you wonder -- start to wonder if there was a God, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: No, no, no, it didn’t change.</span> <span id="s1118">You see, in ghetto, my father’s neighbor was an Orthodox Jewish family, next door neighbors.</span> <span id="s1119">So my father sometimes said to him, “Mr.,” I -- I don’t I even remember the name, I think [indecipherable] “tell me, where is God?</span> <span id="s1120">How can we -- How can this?”</span> <span id="s1121">So he said, “Look, we sinned, so we’re paying for it.”</span> <span id="s1122">So my father used to say, “Yes, let’s say we si -- you say we sinned, but the babies, the children didn’t have a chance to sin.”</span> <span id="s1123">You know, there was no answer, that’s some, but no, I didn’t pay attention to those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Did you ever think much, or try to figure out, you know, what meaning there could be to this, why it could have happened, or you just didn’t reflect on it that way, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: No, this -- you know, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s1126">The fact that we s -- I saved my daughter, and my wife, that we saved -- I saved both of them, and this absolutely did -- that was the main thing for me, nothing else counted.</span> <span id="s1127">And right now, too, I am for her, only she -- I believe that -- I -- I live for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Because she’s very, very -- she loved my wife, and me, she cries, she terrible, she’s -- she doesn’t sleep nights, even now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Do you ever have dreams about the war?</span></p> <p><span
