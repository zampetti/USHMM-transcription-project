family in this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Baranowicze was – was actually a new city.</span> <span id="s40">Baranowicze was born maybe a hundred, 150 years ago, 120 years ago, they don’t know exactly why.</span> <span id="s41">It used to be a little farm – a farm place, but because the Russian – the Russian tsar decide that time that he wants to build in Baranowicze two airports and two railroad stations, and since then, the town become very famous.</span> <span id="s42">My grandpa was in the Russian army for seven years and he was a reli – a religious man, so when the war was

they left the partisans, with the same clothes they went to the Russian army.</span> <span id="s64">And most – all most of them killed, why – h-how do I know that?</span> <span id="s65">Because from the 300 Jewish partisans, was left maybe 10 or 15 who arrived to Israel in the – in the 40’s and they told me what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: At home we spoke Yiddish, Hebrew and Russian more than Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: So you really knew four languages when you were a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: And what kind of school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: I, even I was a youngster from – when I was three years old they send me to a cheder, and I remember I came to the cheder, so was between one cheder and the second one was a mechitzah, and boys and girls used to be a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: This is the separation between boys and girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Right.</span> <span id="s74">And then, they – they throw candies on the floor, and I was probably very shameful, I didn't want

id="s78">So they – some to pick it up and put me some candies in my pocket and I was happy.</span> <span id="s79">And I went in [indecipherable] in the cheder for probably about two, three years.</span> <span id="s80">Then from [indecipherable] I – they send me to [indecipherable] that he have to be – become a good shorish(ph), a good yesud(ph).</span> <span id="s81">I been there for

there for another two years and from there I went to a high school, like [indecipherable] Majewski(ph).</span> <span id="s85">Was a big school in the city and I was learning there almost until the war.</span> <span id="s86">But one year before the war, my parents decide – I didn’t know why, they – they send me to Slonim, to yeshiva for a year.</span> <span id="s87">Probably – or I was a good student or a bad student, I don’t know what was happening.</span> <span id="s88">And they send me away from house, and it was very hard on me.</span> <span id="s89">I couldn’t stay in the yeshiva and learn like I used to, because I couldn’t – I couldn’t get used to it, not to see my mummy, my sisters, my – a-all the family.</span> <span id="s90">And I – I run away from the yeshiva and I came home, it was a Friday.</span> <span id="s91">And when I went home, one of my uncles, my youngster – the youngs – the youngster brother of my father, they all went to yeshiva in Slonim because that time

<span id="s97">I’ll give you the two zlotys and go back to Slonim.</span> <span id="s98">I said, Uncle, I’m not going back to yeshiva.</span> <span id="s99">I’m going to learn here.</span> <span id="s100">And I left.</span> <span id="s101">I came home.</span> <span id="s102">My mummy was happy.</span> <span id="s103">My mother ca – my father came home and I was sit [indecipherable] was sitting, I ind – I was sitting at the kitchen and eat latkes, Friday.</span> <span id="s104">And he looked at me and I felt that I did something wrong, with not the right thing, with not saying anything.</span> <span id="s105">But he came, and I explained – I explain it to him.</span> <span id="s106">So he says to me, you promise me you’re going to learn good?</span> <span id="s107">I said, of course.</span> <span id="s108">And I was learning at home.</span> <span id="s109">And I was in – in the school [indecipherable] Majewski(ph) and I finish up with the eighth grade and had to go to the ninth, and then broke out the war in 1939 and I had to go into ninth, and the Russian are here.</span> <span id="s110">So I went to the school and the Russian came.</span> <span id="s111">I was

id="s113">Q: We’ll get to that in a minute.</span> <span id="s114">While you were growing up as a small child, did you have any friends that were not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: How did you get to meet them, because you didn’t live among them.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Be-Because, we had some neighbors here and there, you know,

–</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: W-We’ll talk about that in a minute.</span> <span id="s165">You were 10 years old when Hitler came into power in – in Germany, 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A:

<p><span id="s169">Q: Did your parents know about that, did they talk about it?</span> <span id="s170">Did you – did the name Hitler mean anything to you when you were 10 - 11 - 12 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: We have to have three papers a day.</span> <span id="s172">The Moment(ph), the Radio(ph) and Hinde(ph).</span> <span id="s173">So we read and we knew everything what was happening.</span> <span id="s174">We knew everything, but i-i-in our places where I came from – I – I believe – I believe in mostly European, the Jewish people were poor.</span> <span id="s175">A Jewish man couldn’t work like – like a ga – a – a – a not Jew.</span> <span id="s176">He go – he wants to work in the railroad, he got a job.</span> <span id="s177">Said, I’m gonna take a Jew?</span> <span id="s178">A Jew wouldn’t have the chutzpah to go – to ask for a job like this.</span> <span id="s179">The Jews had to be milkman, shoemaker, leathers, roofers.</span> <span id="s180">Even some, maybe one or two or three, maybe families were cement workers, like bricklayers, right?</span> <span id="s181">If – if he was a carpenter he was to p-put you a door, but not build a house.</span> <span id="s182">So the Jews were very, very poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: What was your awareness in, before the war started, what was your awareness of what was happening to the Jews, let’s say, in Germany under Hitler?</span> <span id="s184">Were you aware, did your parents talk about it with you and your siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s186">All the time they used to curs – talk about it, how to get thr – how to get out of here, how to do it.</span> <span id="s187">So that’s why my father se – sold the store and become a milkman.</span> <span id="s188">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Wha-What year was that, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: It was like four or five years before the war, it like 1932 - 1933, become a milkman, it was a better business.</span> <span id="s191">And then, this way we had to go out with my father many times vacation in the fields, and we start being more aggressive, more mensch ma – stronger and – and better people, and we hoped that in – in a – in a few time, in a few years we gonna make what we have to make in order to have th – enough money to go out.</span> <span id="s192">You couldn’t go without the certificate there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s193">So you have to be [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s194">But a man who is married with three – with si – with five children, how can you go with that certificate?</span> <span id="s195">My father would never leave his wife and children and go to Israel, never.</span> <span id="s196">Because mine uncle left and his – my – my father’s brother left Argentina, and in seven years he couldn’t bring his wife with his child from Baranowicze, so everybody used to say, uh-huh, you see?</span> <span id="s197">Aaron left his wife and his child, but he took his time until he could save a penny.</span> <span id="s198">I mean, I came to America, the first thing I save thousand dollar, I went to Argentina to – to see my uncle.</span> <span id="s199">And he told me the story, everybody said Aaron is Aaron, look what he did.</span> <span id="s200">He left the – a wife with the child and he’s not taking her.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: So you were in school, and then September 1939 the –</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: The war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: – the war broke out, but previous to that, the – in the – the previous year was Kristallnacht and it – did you know about that?</span> <span id="s204">Di-Did you read about it, did you hear about it?</span> <span id="s205">A: We knew – we knew everything, and you couldn’t do anything except to help with money, but they wouldn’t accept it, th – the Jews couldn’t do anything for – for the Jews in Germany.</span> <span id="s206">Secondly, people who came from Poland, or from Lithow(ph), or from th – other places in Germany 50 years ago, they send them all back – back to Poland and – and to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s208">Do you remember being particularly frightened?</span> <span id="s209">You were 15 - 16 years old at the time of Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s210">Were – were you particularly frightened when you heard about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s212">A-All my Christian friends used to come and tell me, Noah, prepare yourself.</span> <span id="s213">And making the hands like this, like I’m going to get killed.</span> <span id="s214">So I said to them, if I’m gonna get killed, you gonna get killed too.</span> <span id="s215">First will be the Jews, and then the Polacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Did you yourself experience – again, before the war started – experience any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s218">Not – not so much from the White Russian, but from the Polacks it was terrible.</span> <span id="s219">They used to come [indecipherable] and used to scream, don’t buy from Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s220">Poles – Polacks to Polacks, not to Jews.</span> <span id="s221">And they used to make noises, it was anti-Jewish terrible things.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Wer-Were you ever in any fights?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Many times.</span> <span id="s224">We fight with stones, cause they used to start st – every – with stones, so we had to give them back.</span> <span id="s225">That was life.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Would you describe yourself as physically strong?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Yeah, I was very strong.</span> <span id="s228">I nev – i-if somebody gets me, I give – give him the doubles.</span> <span id="s229">And first of all, I wasn’t – I was the type that I was – never let people hi-hit me, because I knew he is bigger, he is stronger, I got to start first.</span> <span id="s230">And that was happen always, even the Russian army had [indecipherable] I have to fight.</span> <span id="s231">When I was in the partisans, I used to go and train people, so they used to tell me, who needs Jews?</span> <span id="s232">We need arms.</span> <span id="s233">So they put me in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Okay, we-well again, we’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s235">As conditions got worse with Hitler, di – is this something that your family was open and talked about with you and you talked about with your brothers and sisters –</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Many times –</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: – and friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Many times we used to talk, but sometime – we couldn’t talk openly so much, because we knew that our father would like to do it, run away, but he hasn’t got enough money yet.</span> <span id="s239">[indecipherable] make him [indecipherable] when he wants to go so much.</span> <span id="s240">So many times we spoke – I used to speak with my older brother, with the other cousins, that maybe we should run away and we’ll go to Russia for [indecipherable] go to Israel.</span> <span id="s241">And we were afraid, in case we the oldest too, we’ll go away and Papa stays with Mom, with the smaller children, who knows if something happen, who is gonna help them?</span> <span id="s242">And that’s was the reason we didn’t go.</span> <span id="s243">Actually, in – when – before Hitler came, we wanted to run away from the Russia, and my mama used to told me, okay, if you want to go, go.</span> <span id="s244">But you’ll never see your mommy again.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: So now Germany invades Poland in September 1939, what are your memories of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: They – I remember th-they f – they – they bomb our city, and our house was bombed and wit – and it was destroyed.</span> <span id="s247">So we already 1939, before – before – a couple of days before the Russian came, we didn't have a house, we didn’t have nothing, everything was destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Where were you when the house was bombed?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: We were in Mush(ph) in the little city what my ma – where – what my mommy was born.</span> <span id="s250">We went to our uncle over there.</span> <span id="s251">And we stayed there for a couple of days, because we knew Baranowicze is a bigger city and they gonna bomb.</span> <span id="s252">So we did smart, went, took off – adif – our horses with the wagons and everything what’s in the house, it was our little models that we had and [indecipherable] and we came back.</span> <span id="s253">Otherwise would have nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: And so then you came back and saw your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Yeah, the whole street.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: And what – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: So we had to ra – so we had to rent up another place to stay there.</span> <span id="s258">We had –</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: What’s it like for a 16 and a half year old boy to look at his house that’s destroyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: I-It – it didn’t bother me the house destroyed, it just bothered me that we have a situation that – the thought that Hitler is coming and everything will be destroyed.</span> <span id="s261">How – how we running away, how can we save it, s-something?</span> <span id="s262">How we can do most of it?</span> <span id="s263">What – what should we do?</span> <span id="s264">It – I think that the situation was so tense, the rabbis, the big rabbis run away to li – to – to Vilna.</span> <span id="s265">From there they want to go to America, to Israel, to China, wherever they can go.</span> <span id="s266">And the people were left like – I d – I don’t want to say that, but it – it was something wrong.</span> <span id="s267">The mazel was that we youngsters, we dint – we didn’t know about it exactly, but the parents knew.</span> <span id="s268">And this was like a [indecipherable], you know what a [indecipherable] finster(ph), schwartz(ph).</span> <span id="s269">This cou – l-look at it as ar – it’s something is very wrong, it’s no [indecipherable] the whole thing.</span> <span id="s270">And this was very, very bad, because people – you know how you say when you leave – when you lose money it’s nothing, but when you lose hope, you lost everything.</span> <span id="s271">And this was a station of losing hope.</span> <span id="s272">It was very dangerous situation.</span> <span id="s273">Then the Russian come in.</span> <span id="s274">When the Russian come in, first of all, they took away the rich and the – and – and this what – and what they didn’t like the ca – ca – zi-zi – Zionist, and took them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s275">The rove(ph) was in shul, Shabbat, they took him, and many other people who came from Poland who wasn’t register.</span> <span id="s276">And they took him to the wagons – the wagons to Kamchatka, I don’t know where they took him to – to – to Russia, deep i-in Siberia.</span> <span id="s277">Many die from verra – from hunger, from anything.</span> <span id="s278">But our – our [indecipherable] was alive, he lived [indecipherable] with us, al-all his grandchildren, his children and the rest of them die in the ghetto barrage.</span> <span id="s279">So it was [indecipherable], it – it was a mishmash, that you cannot control it and you cannot say anything.</span> <span id="s280">But we were so religious in heart, but Israel [indecipherable] that we – we didn’t blame the rabbis.</span> <span id="s281">We – we didn’t want to say nothing about the rabbis, but in – in heart you have to say, my good – my father wouldn’t leave because he wants his wife and his children.</span> <span id="s282">The rabbi the same thing, got to be in the city, because he got [indecipherable] city.</span> <span id="s283">So is na – I can’t give you the [indecipherable] but it wasn’t – it wasn’t so [indecipherable], you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: What was it like for you to see a Russian soldier in a Russian uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Well, I, as a Zionist I didn’t like it, because they were wear – anti – anti-Zionist and – excuse me – and they – the propaganda that I should become a Komsomold(ph).</span> <span id="s286">A Komsomold(ph) means a communist.</span> <span id="s287">And because I didn’t want to become a communist, a Komsomold(ph), they wouldn’t take me in – into the better schools.</span> <span id="s288">And I had to go to school where they send me to.</span> <span id="s289">And then I – I want to become a –</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: What kind of school was it that they sent you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: This a old, like old school.</span> <span id="s292">You know, physically, t-to learn a –</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Trade?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: – a trade, and mathematics.</span> <span id="s295">And I decided I want to be a pilot.</span> <span id="s296">So they send me to Lida, not far from there was a airport, and th-they want to – they want to see if I am – if I am fit, if I – if I can take all the examines, it just wasn’t some examines, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s297">The-They bring you to a place, they put you on a chair, the chair is flying, and you look over, yeah, what’s – what’s – what’s [indecipherable] too.</span> <span id="s298">So m-most of the people fall down, and then they have t – you have to go out and – on [indecipherable] they call it, to – to pick up [indecipherable] and the things, and your head down and the feet on top, to stay for five minutes like this, a-and – and not – and not to move.</span> <span id="s299">So who was the best, they accepted.</span> <span id="s300">And they – I-I was accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: The Russians sent you to this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Yes, true, th-the Russian with the bal – with the [indecipherable] th-th-they decide – decide what to do.</span> <span id="s303">Even I didn’t want to be a communist, they – th-they took me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: An-And what city did they send you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Lida.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: And – and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Then, when I – I was in the school over there, I – I – it was no kosher food.</span> <span id="s308">It was no Shabbas religion there.</span> <span id="s309">I felt that my world is going under me.</span> <span id="s310">I wanted to run away, but I c – I couldn’t, because if I would run away, they would take my family and send to Siberia.</span> <span id="s311">So I had to wait, to wait, to wait until a chance, and all of a sudden the school was burning in a fire.</span> <span id="s312">Something – probably Polish guys did it.</span> <span id="s313">So we had to go home, everybody goes home for awhile, and then the Hitler – Hitler came.</span> <span id="s314">When Hitler came –</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: What happened to your f-father during the time of the Russian rule?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: He – he – my father didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s317">Didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s318">He used to go to – down [indecipherable] send people to get us [indecipherable] in a private house and nobody should know about it.</span> <span id="s319">That’s the way they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Was he able to keep his business when the Russians were really –</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Way – the business was out i-i-in – in one week they took everything away.</span> <span id="s322">They clean up the stoves and the milk with the cheeses, it – it didn’t – they didn’t left even a smell of it.</span> <span id="s323">In one week the city was clean up from everything.</span> <span id="s324">Was no fish, no bread, no butter, no cheese, no nothing.</span> <span id="s325">They sent from Russia.</span> <span id="s326">You know what they send?</span> <span id="s327">They send bread with roszingas(ph), I call it – all kind – this stuff filled up in – in white bread, what was nice, but you have to stay in line a whole night to get a – one – one – one bread.</span> <span id="s328">Oh, they send vodka for – for Russia, right?</span> <span id="s329">[indecipherable] Jews need wh-white bread with vodka?</span> <span id="s330">They need feed, they need bread, they need a job, they – the shoe.</span> <span id="s331">So it – it wasn – it wasn’t good, no.</span> <span id="s332">But we played the game, you know, for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: And then, during those two years, did you yourself notice any more anti-Se-Semitic incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s335">It was much better.</span> <span id="s336">The Russian was watching that they sh-shouldn’t happen.</span> <span id="s337">Secondly, we had the majority of Jews in the city, who came from Poland.</span> <span id="s338">We were almost – most of the city were Jews.</span> <span id="s339">So the Polacks were afraid, so they were quiet, and the White Russian didn’t say anything because they wanted to become higher and higher.</span> <span id="s340">And the Russian [indecipherable] to them, so it was quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Did you say that you moved back to your house?</span> <span id="s342">Or you said it was bombed – bombed badly, but did you mix –</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: A half house – a half house was burned, and a half house was standing, but you couldn’t live there.</span> <span id="s344">So whatever you could take, we took the vi – until we came already was everything empty, wa – th-they – they cleaned up everything.</span> <span id="s345">I came – I – I – I – I remember I came with the bi – we – I had a bike, so I came the first with the bike to the city and I came near my house and [indecipherable] so I jump with [indecipherable] with nothing, I went on the [indecipherable] in the second story, and I – and I looked, ev-everything in the boydim(ph), you know, the boydim’s(ph) the second floor, to look with what’s left over there.</span> <span id="s346">Was nothing left.</span> <span id="s347">Only thing that was left, my father [indecipherable] when he – when a ch – when a child was born, he used to take a big bottle, la – so – so high, so big, and put up it vodka and all kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Fruit?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: – fruit, and every – every year he used to put mos – more spirit.</span> <span id="s350">And when this – when the child was older, he used to bring it to the house wi – if you just touch it so much, you – you were [indecipherable] already.</span> <span id="s351">So I went up there and I opened one bottle like this, and I – and I – and I was enjoying this, so sweet, [indecipherable] I fell asleep over there.</span> <span id="s352">And everybody came home, they looked for me and they couldn't find me for two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Noah Roitman.</span> <span id="s355">This is tape number one, side B, and we had just gotten to the point where the Germans had come in and this would be June 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: What is your first recollection in – of that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: This – when the Germans arrived, the first thing when they came, we thought they were liberators too.</span> <span id="s359">Quiet, nice, no – not – not – not hardships, no – no hard times.</span> <span id="s360">But after being two, three days they show what [indecipherable] they start beating and taking people just in the street to work an-and to ro – clear th – everything what in th – done is not in order, you know, and everything the Jews has to do.</span> <span id="s361">Pri – the same time –</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Up to this point, did you know what was happening in other countries in Europe?</span> <span id="s363">What the Germans had been doing in other countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: We knew but we didn’t – we knew everything and we didn't believe it [indecipherable] possible so much.</span> <span id="s365">We knew that – we knew that everything what they say today is more or less – but maybe not so much, maybe it’s – it’s people – people say about it more than it is.</span> <span id="s366">So we – but we do believe, of course we knew.</span> <span id="s367">And secondly, many Germans used to come to our house and said, run away, because the Jews were – will be killed in – in a very short time.</span> <span id="s368">So I don’t know all the Germans for Jews, or the Germans for Socialists or something like that, but they were all Nazis in the army.</span> <span id="s369">Used to come and tell us, please run away because you will be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Th-These were German soldiers who told you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yeah, and we used to say, where we gonna run?</span> <span id="s372">How?</span> <span id="s373">We have no arms.</span> <span id="s374">The Russians left everything behind them.</span> <span id="s375">Vlasov(ph) give up three million best soldiers from Vlasov(ph) in the Russian army gave up, because they didn’t like the communism, right.</span> <span id="s376">But after, what Hitler did to the – I call it to the prisoners, and not many prisoners run away to deep Russia, and they told them, look, th-the Germans burn them [indecipherable] they put a – a – a little h – you know, hole, and you put naft(ph) and oil and they burn them.</span> <span id="s377">I saw it with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s378">So that was – this person decide, hey, you got to fight for yourself, otherwise they’re gonna kill us.</span> <span id="s379">And that why they stop by Leningrad, ba – by Moscow, by a-all the places.</span> <span id="s380">Otherwise, the – the Germans would take it away no time [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s381">And say – the winter brought, c-came over altogether was a hell for the Russians.</span> <span id="s382">But people – the Russians didn’t come for communism, be fighting for our Russian mama, but not for s – not for Stalin.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s384">It is now summertime of ’41.</span> <span id="s385">What did you do that first summer when the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: The first – the first few months we didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s387">We just was sitting in a place where we used to say eat and think what should be done.</span> <span id="s388">Ho-How to manipulate.</span> <span id="s389">Nobody was [indecipherable] what to do.</span> <span id="s390">Some people went from big cities to small farm, from small to bigger, you know.</span> <span id="s391">For the time being everybody has a little money, the clothes.</span> <span id="s392">I-It was the same f – the family, you know.</span> <span id="s393">But when it – after three months, four months, they say that you gonna sit in a ghetto very soon.</span> <span id="s394">You have to prepare yourself that you gonna lose all – all your – whatever you had [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Belongings?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: All – all your belonging.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: How did you hear about that?</span> <span id="s398">How did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: They – they – it was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s400">Th-Th-They – th-they – it was written on the walls that – that all the Jews got to go into the ghetto from this and this and this and this street, eight streets like this, five streets like this, six streets like this, and that’s the – the place the Jews should be living.</span> <span id="s401">And it came a time they say they had to go [indecipherable], so we go.</span> <span id="s402">We – but we couldn’t take horses and wagons with us.</span> <span id="s403">You could take only what you can carry.</span> <span id="s404">Because the White Russians and the Polacks were waiting for this moment and they were – they used to stay and right – ro-rob everything.</span> <span id="s405">They took it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Whatever you couldn’t take.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Right.</span> <span id="s408">And better things, the Germans saw after a few days what the Polacks and the [indecipherable] doing, so they say stop.</span> <span id="s409">Now, y-you have [indecipherable] in here.</span> <span id="s410">We gonna take first, then what we got leftover, you gonna take.</span> <span id="s411">They become smart.</span> <span id="s412">And that’s the way we – we – we arrive in a house in Baranowicze at Poniatowska street.</span> <span id="s413">And over there my uncle – my mommy’s sister had two houses and a husband and three children.</span> <span id="s414">So when all the family from my mommy’s side to – went the other side and the [indecipherable] side all together came into the houses, maybe 200 people I’m telling you, in the two houses, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Stayed in the family relative’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yeah [indecipherable] in a room like this, maybe 20 people, we build – we [indecipherable] from wood.</span> <span id="s417">This is just a bed, this is for the older people.</span> <span id="s418">The middle was for the young people, and at the top, the third floor was for people like me, 15 - 16 - 17, they – you know, they sleep on the third floor.</span> <span id="s419">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Ha – had you heard of ghettos before?</span> <span id="s421">Did you know what they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: We – yeah, we knew what they ha – what – Jews lived in ghettos, but between listen and – or – or read the paper, a – a – a book, a-and being yourself is two different things.</span> <span id="s423">You couldn’t feel, all of a sudden 10 Jews smashed in – so many people in one room.</span> <span id="s424">Then, the water wasn’t inside the house at – you have to go outside, bring the water.</span> <span id="s425">So the water was [indecipherable] but it was not toilets enough.</span> <span id="s426">We have to – to – to build toilets because so many people come in such a sh – place.</span> <span id="s427">The toilets was always packed, an-and to get water was a problem, but you had it.</span> <span id="s428">Then the Germans took young people to work.</span> <span id="s429">Every morning w – you had to come in the front of the ghetto, and from the ghetto they took the people to work.</span> <span id="s430">So, you had groups, people who worked for Russian, for them, with the clothes.</span> <span id="s431">Some people had, like me, I work in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s432">This is a group who took all the arms the Russian left and we have to send it to Germany.</span> <span id="s433">So we had t-to work physically so hard, no food, no nothing.</span> <span id="s434">So we had to be strong people.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: What – wha-what did you take – what did you, as a 16 - 17 year old take with you from your house to go to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Did you take anything special?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah, we – we – all of us took three, four dresses, you know, and many –</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Shirts?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Shirts, and underwear and shoes, whatever we can.</span> <span id="s441">And you schlepped whatever you could, you could schlep 50 kilos, 60 kilos on yourself, you schlepped.</span> <span id="s442">That’s all you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Did you take any special books with you, or anything of interest?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Very, very few, because it was more important to take a lila(ph) or – or a – a kishala(ph) under your head.</span> <span id="s445">A pillow or something like that.</span> <span id="s446">Because who wo-would – would care for the [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s447">Who would care if I’m a – grand-grandma was na – 103 years old?</span> <span id="s448">We – all the people who were young like me, we had to do it, everything.</span> <span id="s449">So it was not time to think [indecipherable] books.</span> <span id="s450">The older people carry books.</span> <span id="s451">[indecipherable], but we didn’t took anything.</span> <span id="s452">Father probably took.</span> <span id="s453">But we used to schlep the – th-the [indecipherable] the – many things what is really hard.</span> <span id="s454">And it was probably about two, three kilometer to – to carry, it wasn’t so easy.</span> <span id="s455">So the only thing we could do is stop – and again, stop again until we came to the house of our – our uncle, and then we had to put it – it’s no room to sleep, it’s no room.</span> <span id="s456">We didn’t have even tools with what to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Did the ghetto have a wall around it, or wire?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Wires.</span> <span id="s459">Double wires.</span> <span id="s460">It was double wires all around, and in one place it was a opening.</span> <span id="s461">Th-The Jewish police they called it inside, and the German police outside, and in case somebody died, to go out from here, right, to the – to the [indecipherable] you know, to bury it.</span> <span id="s462">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Did the Jewish police wear any special uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: No, just had a – a blue – a blue Magen David in his arm [indecipherable] Magen David in the front and th – in the – your back, a yellow Magen David.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Y-You had to wear one?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Right from the beginning of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Right from beginning.</span> <span id="s471">From the beginning was a yellow – like this, half round, a l – a little piece, and then this side got to be a Magen David.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: How did you feel about wearing those stars?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Well, i-i-in one case I was proud that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s474">But we cou – when – when we had to go to work, or go out – out to the ghetto, we weren’t allowed to go out [indecipherable] we have to go like the horses, on the street.</span> <span id="s475">On the street [indecipherable] to walk [indecipherable] back and forth.</span> <span id="s476">And some people wa – used to bee – beat up or killed on the job because the German like his nose o-or maybe he didn’t work so fast or whatever.</span> <span id="s477">They never thought that you hungry.</span> <span id="s478">Some Germans were very, very [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s479">They used to say – take it, I have enough, I ca – I can’t eat any more, because he – he likes you, he wants to give you his food, you know, h-half of it.</span> <span id="s480">So you – you – he was – this was very nice of him.</span> <span id="s481">But from the Polacks we didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s482">They used to come around the ghetto, they – well, you got – what are you waiting, they’re gonna kill you anyway.</span> <span id="s483">Give us your clothes, give us your – what are you waiting for?</span> <span id="s484">Give it to us.</span> <span id="s485">So different between one another.</span> <span id="s486">The SS, of course, it wasn’t good, the SS and the – the other G-Germans, but a lot of Germans were – were [indecipherable] work.</span> <span id="s487">He used to say to me – they – they like me so he give me a name, Otto.</span> <span id="s488">Come [indecipherable], instead [indecipherable] he says Otto.</span> <span id="s489">I said, why are you calling me Otto?</span> <span id="s490">He said, it’s a German nice name and I like you, because you’re working with, you’re always happy.</span> <span id="s491">And way – what could you do?</span> <span id="s492">Th-The cho – [indecipherable] in life is not to give up and to try with all your care how to hold it, you know, because if you’re holding, a lot of people lu – do like – if you can, I’ll do tr – I’ll try.</span> <span id="s493">And I – I did many things that I organize things that people was very happy, helpful.</span> <span id="s494">And that was my father’s [indecipherable] he used to tell me always, don’t give up until it’s on the last second, you still have a chance.</span> <span id="s495">So that was going on like this until one day they took me and another older man and they took us to the railroad.</span> <span id="s496">They had to clean up the railroad, the toilets.</span> <span id="s497">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s498">So they took me with him and they ta – and the Hauptman, a German Hauptman came and say, you two, you got to clean up this area.</span> <span id="s499">The older man wa – somehow went to look – find a pail and smutters and nak – somehow with his hand, poor guy did it.</span> <span id="s500">I didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s501">So I – and we – before we had to go to the ghetto back, he came and he says, I want my two man.</span> <span id="s502">So we went out from the colony.</span> <span id="s503">They called us and we went back to this place.</span> <span id="s504">Went back to the place, he said, who is the [indecipherable] who didn’t clean it up?</span> <span id="s505">I said, me.</span> <span id="s506">And he took his gun like this in his hand and made a smear on my face, like this, you know, my nose, my – my ear was in a minute like this.</span> <span id="s507">And then with his hand on the second side.</span> <span id="s508">And I didn’t wait.</span> <span id="s509">After I – when he had th-the hand in the – still out like this, I start running.</span> <span id="s510">I thought they were gonna kill me [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s511">I ran zig-zagem(ph), zig-zagem(ph) and I came home.</span> <span id="s512">And I said to my parents, I am going away to Russia or to the partisans, I am not here any more.</span> <span id="s513">And my mom start begging me and begging me and begging me.</span> <span id="s514">I was lucky that my name wasn’t on the list that I run away, otherwise they would come to the ghet – to find me, you know.</span> <span id="s515">And since then I change, and I went to the [indecipherable] where I work with the arms all the time.</span> <span id="s516">And from there, I pe – heard group who was in the Polish army and the Russian army, we came out from there in – at – in – in – into the ghetto back from the arms – from the armies, and we decide to fight.</span> <span id="s517">We have to organize ourselves, we organize ourself.</span> <span id="s518">We had a group –</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Okay, ju – let me ask you a few more questions first.</span> <span id="s520">Bef – an-and we’ll come to that point.</span> <span id="s521">What were your parents doing in the early part of the ghetto times?</span> <span id="s522">Was your father working?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: My – my father was a broken man.</span> <span id="s524">It was – it was – you cou – I cou – ee – I just look at his face, I – I wanted to cry.</span> <span id="s525">He was in such a miserable situation he probably felt, what should I do with my wife and my children?</span> <span id="s526">What can I do, what should I do?</span> <span id="s527">He was – he never cried, but I saw his face, he was – was like skin, like very skinny, you know.</span> <span id="s528">H-He – he [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s529">You understood what I mean?</span> <span id="s530">He die in his life.</span> <span id="s531">He couldn’t – he couldn’t take this.</span> <span id="s532">And when I came home and I told him the story, he says, you got to take it.</span> <span id="s533">You’re young, you’ll be alive and you’ll do it.</span> <span id="s534">But remember, he says, if you gonna get killed and you’ll be alive, you should be like a lion.</span> <span id="s535">A lion.</span> <span id="s536">And I used to think to myself, yeah, how can you be lion?</span> <span id="s537">No arms, no help.</span> <span id="s538">Hitler was [indecipherable] into Russia.</span> <span id="s539">The Russians are dying from hunger over there, what gonna happen here?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: What were your – did your mother have to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: There was no work.</span> <span id="s542">Y-Y-You were happy –</span></p>

give food, how to get food?</span> <span id="s545">When I got to work, I used to [indecipherable] a Polack or White Russian, my shirt or pants and – or shoes, when he get some, to make something for soup.</span> <span id="s546">O-Or a piece – a – a – or some bread or – or something to bring in.</span> <span id="s547">And it was m-mazel if you bring it in and he didn’t caught you.</span> <span id="s548">If they caught you, they gonna beat up.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Wh-What about your sisters and your brother, did any of them work?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: They were too young.</span> <span id="s551">My brother was with me the same thing, he – he was the – with the same thing what I did, to supply food for the family.</span> <span id="s552">And we – we used to bring arms the same time and in our house we built a – under the floor we built a place that from our house we could go out to the water supply, to the sept – system – system.</span> <span id="s553">Not septic, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Cistern?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Sure, si – sure.</span> <span id="s556">And we made a – a opening to this – to the sewer.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: But the sewer was still inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s559">And the [indecipherable] house was very close to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: So we prepare everything so we can go out at night only as a group and nobody gonna know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s562">So we prepare ourselves and we were a group who called it – Moma Kopelowicz.</span> <span id="s563">Moma Kopelowicz was our commandant – commandeer</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: This is while you’re still in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: The ghetto.</span> <span id="s566">And we had few places where they had already about 17 rifles, two machine guns and we had like 500 hand grenades, and bullets ready to go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: How did people get the information?</span> <span id="s568">How did you get to know – ho-how did they transmit the information to you about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: What, the front?</span> <span id="s570">What’s going on in what?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: About the – these arms and – and how to – by word of mouth?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Pe – we – we had – we had – we read the G-German papers, we knew everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: No, no, no, no, my question is, how did you hear about Kopelowicz and – and the –</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Learned it from a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s575">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Right, so, which is by word of mouth in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Yeah, because we decided he is – he is the right man to organize this.</span> <span id="s578">We decide that he is the man who can run us.</span> <span id="s579">And he was a younger, maybe two years older than us, but he was a – a mensch.</span> <span id="s580">So we decide that he can be the man who – to hold us together.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: His first name is what?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Moma.</span> <span id="s583">Moma Kopelowicz, because we were for all parties, I was [indecipherable] all my friends were from Betar, some Hatshomer Hatzair, some from Gordonia(ph).</span> <span id="s584">So, i-it – we wasn’t like in – from same school.</span> <span id="s585">We were from the same city, friends, but – but every [indecipherable] idea – idea.</span> <span id="s586">He had to be the [indecipherable] to the idea to bring altogether for the one – for this one thing what we have to do.</span> <span id="s587">And he did.</span> <span id="s588">He very smart.</span> <span id="s589">And he was the first that was killed in – in – in the – in the putsch.</span> <span id="s590">Later.</span> <span id="s591">So he was our master of the group, and we decided one day to get out.</span> <span id="s592">When we wanted to get out from the night –</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: How many were in the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: We were like 40 – 47 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: These are young men?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: All ya – all young, from – between 15 - 16 to maybe 27 - 28.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Any wa – any woman, was it all men?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: It was like 10 women between them too.</span> <span id="s599">So all people who used to work by the Germans, who ha-had to smuggle into the ghetto arms, bullets, grenades, everything.</span> <span id="s600">So when time came, we organize ourselves, this was approximately, I would say by the te – November the – the 10th of 1941, we decide to be going.</span> <span id="s601">And all the people came to my – to my house, and from my house we had to go out from the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s602">All of a sudden came, from my city, his name was Eliezer Lidovsky.</span> <span id="s603">He was a big [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s604">He decide that we cannot go out, because if we gonna go out, what will happen to him and the other groups?</span> <span id="s605">It wa – we had – it was many groups in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s606">And he wants to be the top, that he can say to all the groups when to go, when not to go.</span> <span id="s607">And we decide we want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Many resistance groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s610">So he came and said, if you gonna go out, the Germans will wait for you outside and you all will be killed.</span> <span id="s611">So Moma Kopelowicz and another friend, Eli Zaryckevicz, he was from Russia, a Russian officer, was a young man maybe 25 years old.</span> <span id="s612">He went with him to the ghetto to explain them that we are going out, our little group from 47 people, and after we gonna settled, you know, make it, everything [indecipherable] shoot, we’ll come, we’ll take hundreds of people out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s613">Nice?</span> <span id="s614">He says no, you cannot go out.</span> <span id="s615">He was afraid that you’ll go out, something happened, he gonna be stuck in ghetto.</span> <span id="s616">And that what’s happen.</span> <span id="s617">So one of my friend, Moishe Taub(ph), he was in the Russian army too, and he was in another group, from nervous keit, he took and he shot – he gave a shot in the house with – with the rifle.</span> <span id="s618">Moishe Taub(ph) did it, and everybody thought the Germans will come right now and they’ll destroy everything here.</span> <span id="s619">First of all –</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: He shot into the air?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s622">So everything – everybody went home back again, and I had to repair at night, the cement which we did, in case the Germans come to check everything.</span> <span id="s623">And I worked the whole night in the cement, in the water, un-until my knee – until I – I re – I repair somehow –</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: This is closing off that entrance?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s626">And got – got – got [indecipherable] like if nothing happened.</span> <span id="s627">They didn’t find it out.</span> <span id="s628">Now, in a – the Germans had a feeling, because they had – they had e – e – espionage probably from the outside people, Polacks, Russians, who used to tell them that the Jews running around to buy arms.</span> <span id="s629">And they – they told to the Germans all these things, that the Jews ca – buying guns, the Jews trying to bring guns from the Germans of – you know, and this and this.</span> <span id="s630">And it – it was – it was like this for a f – for a few months, and then in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: 1942, March ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Fo – yes, came the [indecipherable] the first [indecipherable] in Baranowicze.</span> <span id="s633">And we were prepared.</span> <span id="s634">We were probably five groups, wi-with 500 organized boti – rebels to – to fight the Germans, in case they come in.</span> <span id="s635">One of my friend, he just die in Israel.</span> <span id="s636">Ilya(ph) Schneidel(ph).</span> <span id="s637">Ilyong(ph) Schneidel(ph) there had to throw a hand grenade, because he was in the police.</span> <span id="s638">And he, when he saw the Germans coming, he’s supposed to throw out a hand grenade and we all will go out in the streets, fight the Germans outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s639">We had a – we had a lot of ammunition.</span> <span id="s640">We had maybe a hundred, a hundred fifty rifles, pistols and machine guns.</span> <span id="s641">We would kill in the thousands, maybe.</span> <span id="s642">So when the – the Germans arrive, they arrive few and he thought – he asked over there, what – what are you doing over here, and they – they said they came for inspection just.</span> <span id="s643">And this was the biggest mistake.</span> <span id="s644">The way – where he didn’t throw the hand grenade, after 10 - 15 minutes they came in the hundreds.</span> <span id="s645">Lithuanians, White Russians, all kind, and Germans you know, and pouring into the ghetto, fire in the houses, in the people, in – all over the places.</span> <span id="s646">And this was a – such a tragedy.</span> <span id="s647">We lost half of our best people was die – died.</span> <span id="s648">The other, after the [indecipherable] – after the three or four days of [indecipherable] they killed over 5,000 people and they took a lot of people into the concentration camps, not in Germany, but near our place, like Moldachewa(ph), kola -- Koldachewa(ph), Moladecznai(ph) and a lot of my family went into this category, they took them away to work over there, and they made them so miserable, you wouldn't believe what they did, the Germans did to the Jewish people over there.</span> <span id="s649">The White Russian used to tell them things that I am ashamed to – t-to say it, what – what – what they did to them.</span> <span id="s650">And then a lot of them run away to the partisans and the rest were killed by the White Russian police.</span> <span id="s651">We are [indecipherable] who would like to run away to the partisans, but we cannot go.</span> <span id="s652">After the [indecipherable], after they killed they Jews, they made the ghetto smaller.</span> <span id="s653">And all the arms we had was on the second – on the s – on the second half.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: What – what were you doing during this – these days?</span> <span id="s655">Were you in hiding?</span> <span id="s656">How is that you – you weren't called up?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: I – I – I was, together with my parents, when they took out everybody from – from my house, when the Germans came in, and they used to came out to say Juden raus, Juden raus.</span> <span id="s658">Was quiet, me and my cousin were sitting near the opening, in case a German will find the place, we’ll tell him – we’ll push him – we’ll shove him inside and cut his head off.</span> <span id="s659">Two or three, until my a – my aunt – mine uncle, Yikael(ph), who wanted to me – to send me back to the yeshiva, his wife Gittl(ph) had two little children, Moishele(ph) and Jankele(ph).</span> <span id="s660">So when the children were feeling the – the pressure from [indecipherable] Juden raus, they start screaming.</span> <span id="s661">And she says, we’re coming raus, we’re coming raus, we’re coming raus.</span> <span id="s662">And she was coming out, and everybody like sheef – I mean, I mean shefson(ph), you know, like animals, the little animals that go, went – the whole family went after her and they went out.</span> <span id="s663">Just a few of my cousin were left in – in – inside.</span> <span id="s664">After a couple of hours we went into the – look around what – what’s going on, we find out nobody’s – you know, just the both of us.</span> <span id="s665">We went outside to look, maybe we can do something [indecipherable] something.</span> <span id="s666">All of a sudden the police run after us, start shooting.</span> <span id="s667">And we run, somehow, we’re – we’re young, you know, we made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Is this y-you and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: No, my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: My – my brother was already – tooken away.</span> <span id="s672">I forgot to tell you this.</span> <span id="s673">My older brother was – was-was – was tooken away far – before the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s674">They took 72 young guys, and they took him to the barracks where the army was.</span> <span id="s675">And they killed them with s – with – with – with metal – with metal – with – with isen(ph), with steel.</span> <span id="s676">And this was the first 72 [indecipherable] before the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s677">And now we decide –</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Wa-Was there a Jewish council in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Yeah, sure it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: The Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yeah, the Judenrat –</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Can you tell me a li – to tell me a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: The Judenrat was very nice, very nice people.</span> <span id="s684">These – hm, many people went themselves to give up.</span> <span id="s685">They had good places t-to – to – to save theirselves – themselves, but they say no, they don’t want it.</span> <span id="s686">They di – di – the top man for the police, and they keep asking for people, Altman(ph).</span> <span id="s687">So he said, I have no people.</span> <span id="s688">What do you mean you don’t have?</span> <span id="s689">He said, you can take me, but I haven’t got people.</span> <span id="s690">The people belong to God.</span> <span id="s691">They took him and the best 40 police [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s692">The best, and th – and – what can – a city can have.</span> <span id="s693">All students from – from – from college, from this, and they – and they shot them because he didn’t want to give Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Wa-Was one of the heads Isaacson, Joshua I – Yehosha(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Izaakson(ph), Izaakson(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: I-Izaakson(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Did you know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: And what can you say about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: I – I can say he’s – he’s – he’s – he was a – actually the rabbi.</span> <span id="s702">He was a ruler, he was something.</span> <span id="s703">He [indecipherable] another one in Kalevich(ph), they went to give a life f-for – for the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s704">Many people.</span> <span id="s705">And one was Goldberg.</span> <span id="s706">Daf – not – not from Baranowicze, he came from Lódz.</span> <span id="s707">And he was the last – from the last Judenrat, he was the – the top man.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Did you know about these cards that were marked with the letter O?</span> <span id="s709">Does that have any meaning for you?</span> <span id="s710">To show the people had jobs, these were like identity cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Oh?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Yeah, I had read that that – in the – in the ghettos and people had cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yeah [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s714">We – we had cards at – from the place I bele – where we worked, that I [indecipherable] I have to come out, because otherwise they wouldn't let you out from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: We had so many hundred people who came to the – to work for [indecipherable] because they had to load the arms back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s718">All right, so now it’s you and your cousin and your parents in March?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Are they re – they – they already not home, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s720">Aft – after a couple of days I find out that they were there and they were killed.</span> <span id="s721">So I – we used to organizize – organize and say kaddish after them.</span> <span id="s722">And my Feder(ph) Phil, my Uncle Phil was alive.</span> <span id="s723">His wife and children weren’t alive, but he was alive.</span> <span id="s724">He was probably somewhere else.</span> <span id="s725">And I used to tell him, we have to run away.</span> <span id="s726">He says to me, you can run.</span> <span id="s727">If I lost Gitl with my children, I lost everything, I have nothing to learn – I – I don’t want to run.</span> <span id="s728">And he didn’t want to – he didn’t want to run.</span> <span id="s729">And he was killed near the Idolar(ph) Street.</span> <span id="s730">And I went to the partisans with a group of 17 people, or – or 15 people maybe.</span> <span id="s731">How did we went – how could we go out from the ghetto?</span> <span id="s732">We went to a policeman, a White Russian policeman and we told him that the second house from here – because on the other side was the ghetto before.</span> <span id="s733">And now already the Germans [indecipherable] ghetto.</span> <span id="s734">And we wanted to take out the rifles.</span> <span id="s735">How could we go to the partisans without – with no arms?</span> <span id="s736">And he says – I said to him, look, we have a lot of gold hidden in the house, and I had to go take it out.</span> <span id="s737">I’ll give you 90 percent, just give me 10 percent and I’ll – I – I have enough for me.</span> <span id="s738">He said, are – are you talking it serious?</span> <span id="s739">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s740">The White Russian said okay.</span> <span id="s741">Come tonight and[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s742">We came the whole group, we were waiting, and I went the first to – to see that he is not taking away the rifles from his shoulder, you know.</span> <span id="s743">He let me in.</span> <span id="s744">When I – he let me in, I had – before I had to come out, the guys came out, couple of guys [indecipherable] and they cut him, you know [indecipherable] and they cut – and they did not kill him.</span> <span id="s745">They did leave him he couldn’t talk already.</span> <span id="s746">Took away his rifle and threw him in a – in a place over there, and we took out the rifles from where we have to go, and went to the partisans.</span> <span id="s747">Took us two weeks to – to arrive the partisans.</span> <span id="s748">Actually shouldn’t take more than two, three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: How did you know where to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: We knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: We had a – a guy before, Mishka(ph) Salmonovicz(ph).</span> <span id="s753">He went out the first, him and Labolitz(ph) Aitman(ph), the two s – two guys went before to the partisans.</span> <span id="s754">And when we came to the partisans and they saw they have to – rifles and grenades and pistols.</span> <span id="s755">So the partisans thought that the Jewish people have so much arms, we need you, we need you, come on.</span> <span id="s756">And then, when we come and not everybody has a rifle, and not everybody was young – we were young, but then come more groups, plus the – they’re like – half of them were already people 40 - 50 – 45, the partisan didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s757">They only wanted just young.</span> <span id="s758">And is – in particular the group what we came to were Zhorkinsis(ph), their name was Zhorkin(ph), the commandeer was Zhorkin(ph), very anti-Semitic and very bandit – bandit.</span> <span id="s759">A very bandit.</span> <span id="s760">He killed Jews for – for shoes, for – for a watch, he killed them.</span> <span id="s761">So, wh-what – what – we – when you come a whole group he couldn’t do it, but if he caught one or two people who run away from ghetto, he – that what he did.</span> <span id="s762">And he did many like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Noah Roitman.</span> <span id="s765">This is tape number two, side A. And before we continue, I just wanted to ask if you had seen any Russian POWs before you went off in to fight – to fight with the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yes, yeah, I saw many – I saw many of them, hungry, with bad clothes, they couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s767">They was skelets(ph), you know what skelets(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Skeletons?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Skeletons.</span> <span id="s770">And they were mamesh(ph), never you hear somebody cry or something, just – just die from day by day, hour by hour, in thousands, and nobody could help them, because if you do something for them, you were killed from the Germans.</span> <span id="s771">And another thing, maybe 10 Germans had 5,000 Russians, and they stoo – th-they didn’t stoo-stood up.</span> <span id="s772">Just [indecipherable] about it.</span> <span id="s773">Why didn’t it – they kill them?</span> <span id="s774">They’d killed thousands, the rest was run already to the woods.</span> <span id="s775">But when we came to the woods, the partisans they say, you gave away the – to the Germans your gold, your parents and your money and now you come here to us, we should – we should – we should keep you, we should watch you?</span> <span id="s776">We need partisans.</span> <span id="s777">We need women, we need old – older men, we need arms.</span> <span id="s778">That was their – the we di – they – they – but we became right the – the – the – the – the – the most of the people they were maybe 10 people, we were already a hundred in – in – in a few weeks.</span> <span id="s779">So we had [indecipherable] and we were a Jewish group.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: So – so you didn’t stay with the Russian group, you formed your own Jewish group?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: No, when we – when – when we came they want to take us the rifles and give us ju – junk what they had find somewhere.</span> <span id="s782">So we said no, that’s enough.</span> <span id="s783">They did it already once to somebody, but no – not any more.</span> <span id="s784">So we didn’t want to be with them.</span> <span id="s785">So they were separate, and we were separate.</span> <span id="s786">And we become bigger, we had 300 in the – in no time we were – we were [indecipherable] we were good [indecipherable] and all the Christians used to say, you Russians, you just drink and you [indecipherable] you – you – you – you – you [indecipherable] what you doing, look the Jewish guys, they go, they destroyed the railroad, they did, they bring people that they all over.</span> <span id="s787">What are you doing over here, sleeping?</span> <span id="s788">Who needs you over here?</span> <span id="s789">The goyim used to say this.</span> <span id="s790">So they were afraid that something will happen, so they – and – and the Russian, a lot of Russian prisoners run away.</span> <span id="s791">Five, 10, 10, you more, more, more, more, and the ghettos was empty already.</span> <span id="s792">So they become m-more than us, how you call it, you know.</span> <span id="s793">How you sa – say it in English?</span> <span id="s794">Mine English is not so good.</span> <span id="s795">In the beginning they were – they fight, 10 – 10 partisans [indecipherable] three, four Jews, and then they come more Jews.</span> <span id="s796">The [indecipherable], how you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Well, your group became larger than theirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Yeah, so – so th-they want us to – to be together, and we didn't want it, but by the time we were 300, they were already 3,000 all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s799">And the [indecipherable], the Germans used to burn the – the – the – the [indecipherable] I call it, the farms, [indecipherable] partisans.</span> <span id="s800">And everything toge – altogether they become a lot.</span> <span id="s801">So we had to become one group, because otherwise they would fight with us.</span> <span id="s802">So we didn’t want to fight, so we decide okay, we’ll work with you, we’ll be [indecipherable] I’ll be the sergeant.</span> <span id="s803">I – I just – there should be quiet, you know.</span> <span id="s804">But all the jobs we had to do, they were sitting and drinking, an-and ta – and tell you what to do.</span> <span id="s805">But we accepted it, we had no choice, until –</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: So this was March or April of ’42 that you went to an – to – to be with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s808">And-And the – when – I was there three months and we were big group, so I went and I brought my wife, and [indecipherable] a-another group, and – like a group from 17 people, and we came back to the partisans with them –</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: How – te-tell me about how you went and go them.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: I couldn’t go legally to – to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: You – you went back to – to the ghetto to get them?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yeah, but I couldn’t do it le – legally, so I had to wait for a chance and we going for [indecipherable] you have a – a mission to do.</span> <span id="s813">They send you to – to destroy the railroad and they give you two weeks.</span> <span id="s814">You have to come back from – from the woods to – to go to Leshen(ph).</span> <span id="s815">Leshen(ph) was a – a b – this – the – the road is come at here this way and this way and – and it was the last time that we going like this.</span> <span id="s816">We calling it – like the railroad comes like this, you see here –</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Inter-Intersects?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Yeah, in – something like this.</span> <span id="s819">So we had to go over there and destroy it.</span> <span id="s820">And – by the same way, we used to have to count at night how many transports come from Germany, with wounded and with the – s-some of us shoot – shoot down airplanes and tanks and this we sent to Russia all what’s going on, that means they – they destroying the Germans.</span> <span id="s821">And by the time they finish up I worked a week – a week – I said to myself, I am going to the ghetto – I’ll – I’ll do something.</span> <span id="s822">What I did, I ca – I – I had anof – another friend what he had suffered in ghetto and he – I told him the story, he said oh, I’m coming with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: His name?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Seric(ph).</span> <span id="s825">Seric(ph) [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s826">So I bi – and I told him this, he said, but you know what, seven people over here, five will come back and we will not return, will be a – a – don’t worry, what can happen?</span> <span id="s827">Come.</span> <span id="s828">And then he says, do you know how to get there?</span> <span id="s829">You’re sure, do you know the – the – the right way?</span> <span id="s830">Of course, I used to ride with my father for years, bring the milk from the – from the – from the [indecipherable] you know, from the farms.</span> <span id="s831">I know.</span> <span id="s832">When it was dark we two quietly moved away, moved away with the – from the others, and pffft, we ran – we went into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: How far was the ghetto from where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: [indecipherable] like probably maybe 20 kilometers, something.</span> <span id="s835">And we came into the ghetto, he –</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: What was left in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: You – you ha you have li – you have another probably 10,000 people left, maybe more.</span> <span id="s838">So he went to his friend – his friend and I went to see my uncle, I still had a uncle from my mommy’s side.</span> <span id="s839">But we went to the ghetto in these houses, my aunt came over there, I – I knock on the door and my uncle wake up, he says, who is this?</span> <span id="s840">I said me.</span> <span id="s841">He says to me, I thought you were already dead.</span> <span id="s842">Everybody said you were di – you dead, they killed you.</span> <span id="s843">How come you alive?</span> <span id="s844">And he fall then on me for – from his place, and he start crying.</span> <span id="s845">I said, Uncle, don’t cry, prepare yourself.</span> <span id="s846">I couldn’t talk because if I talked to him, every – the whole – the whole house would – would run – like to run to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s847">Can I take from the hundreds of people into – to the partisans?</span> <span id="s848">What shall I do?</span> <span id="s849">I’m asking you.</span> <span id="s850">And [indecipherable] question, you told me before not to ask questions.</span> <span id="s851">What can you do?</span> <span id="s852">I ca – I – I – I left – right away I saw I am – I have problems, you know.</span> <span id="s853">If I’ll stay here they – they gonna eat me up.</span> <span id="s854">And what – everybody wants to life – they want to live.</span> <span id="s855">I’ll – I left this place and I went to other place and hide – in hiding.</span> <span id="s856">And I came to my friend I told him the story.</span> <span id="s857">He says no, it’s no good, we gotta take everybody.</span> <span id="s858">Be – over here, hundreds of people are waiting already.</span> <span id="s859">I don’t know how we’re gonna get out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s860">They’re watching every step of us [indecipherable] like that.</span> <span id="s861">We had to leave.</span> <span id="s862">We had to leave the ghetto at night and tell the people how to get out from – from the job that they working.</span> <span id="s863">They should come on the – to – on the Polish cemetery behind the city, and we’ll be there, and we’ll come over there when they – by like 10 o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s864">In the meantime, we had one Polack, his name was Hatcha(ph).</span> <span id="s865">He was one Polack in the city who helped Jews.</span> <span id="s866">And says, whenever you go out or you come, you can go to my place where my car is there, and you can sit and wait over or whatever you need to do, stay there, with no problems.</span> <span id="s867">It was very nice of him.</span> <span id="s868">So we went there and we waited over, and then we went to the – by 10 o’clock we went to the Polish –</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: – cemetery, and we say three [indecipherable] [whistles].</span> <span id="s871">They understood, they came out and we took them and we went to the partisans.</span> <span id="s872">We came to the partisans –</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Okay, how many people were in the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: And who were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: I – I think you got here the names, I said, my wife is the first, and then two sister, Luba(ph) and S-Simma(ph) Mandel.</span> <span id="s877">And then sh – a couple –</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Were these all young people?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: All young.</span> <span id="s880">All young between 17 to 25 maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: So you knew your – your future wife at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: I knew, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: How did you know her?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: I know her because she run away from Poland 1939 and she came to her aunt – to her uncle.</span> <span id="s885">Her uncle married my – my cousin in 1938 and he came to America.</span> <span id="s886">So when they broke – when the war broke out, she saw with the Germans beating up shi – Jewish children in her little place, so she decide to run away, came to us.</span> <span id="s887">So she was in a different place, but I know her, I – so I said, if I can t-take her, why shouldn’t I?</span> <span id="s888">And – because she was actually working with the whole group on one place.</span> <span id="s889">They used to wash for the Germans officers the – the clothes.</span> <span id="s890">So they said to go back to the group and come to the ghetto, they went – couple – couple of us before that, in hiding and then di – they went to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s891">So I had to take the whole group, but I don’t know the people, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s892">I know maybe five, six, seven people, maybe.</span> <span id="s893">I didn't know even.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: So you and – were the – the two leaders brought these people back to the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Excuse us?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: You said you – you – you – you led these people back to the partisans at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, at night.</span> <span id="s898">It took us more, took us two days to come.</span> <span id="s899">It was 70 kilometer.</span> <span id="s900">And then from 10 o’clock at night until four o’clock in the morning [indecipherable] young people hungry a little bit, and a little tired, you cannot make 70 kilometer, it’s hard.</span> <span id="s901">And the snow was like this.</span> <span id="s902">So we had to come to a place and we had a man in a – in a place we called Ouchosse(ph).</span> <span id="s903">And in this place they had a man, a Russian guy who came, the first World War II, he married a White Russian, and his name was Matt Rosov(ph).</span> <span id="s904">And he was the guy who told us all this.</span> <span id="s905">I sent my son to the police, so nobody will think that I will let Jewish partisans in here.</span> <span id="s906">And this way we used to come and with the cows, used to stay.</span> <span id="s907">We open – we knew how to open and get in, take hay, lay down sleep over and next day in the evening, we used to go.</span> <span id="s908">Come in the – that day we came to the partisans and we arrived at the partisans, the group looked, five to six ladies, no arms, just two – two pistols or some, and they said, who needs ladies, who needs Jews?</span> <span id="s909">It was – was a – a – it was a – you know, we need, arms we need, we don’t need these things.</span> <span id="s910">And they wanted to kill me because th-the – you was organize this, you.</span> <span id="s911">Because they knew all the time I used to say, let me go to the ghetto, to bring people out, bring arms, bring this.</span> <span id="s912">So they knew that I – I am the [indecipherable] I was a [indecipherable] to me – talk to – to go, I – before I – they knew tha – I went already.</span> <span id="s913">So, they knew that I – I was the one, but they didn’t kill me, but they had a eye on me and that next time what – what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Were you wearing any kind of uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Just a – a b – a blue jacket and still, I call it boots.</span> <span id="s916">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: What did you do with that Jewish star you had to wear?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: We had – we – we – we were – we were clean, we were washing.</span> <span id="s919">We washed every day in cold water.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: No, no, the Jewish star that you were – you had to wear before in the ghetto, what did you do with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Oh [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s922">Well, maybe not, maybe I had it, because we had to go in – in the ghetto back again, back and forth.</span> <span id="s923">I – I – I k – I keeped it, I think, a long time.</span> <span id="s924">And then it was a little quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Wha-What was the name of the – of the commandeer of this partisan group?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: This time –</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: The Russian commandeer.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Bogachev(ph).</span> <span id="s929">This time [indecipherable] commandeer was Bogachev(ph) the commandeer.</span> <span id="s930">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: And the Jewish leader was?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: It wasn’t already this – this – the Jewish leader jus – Jewish leader already was killed.</span> <span id="s933">What was happen, the group who took us in the beginning, the Zhorkins(ph), what I said, they murderers, they were o – that time already like 30 people.</span> <span id="s934">And they didn’t accept no Russian, no Polack, no nobody, they were just their group, all Russians, anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s935">And they wer – group was separate.</span> <span id="s936">We were already few hundred people.</span> <span id="s937">So they decide one day that the Germans supposed to come to check the roads and the railroads, so we want to go with the crossfire there from [indecipherable] from the other side, and they were gonna kill them.</span> <span id="s938">But that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s939">Moma Kopelowicz was our commandeer.</span> <span id="s940">We went like maybe 20 - 30 people, we were sitting in one end of the [indecipherable] and they sit on the other side, the – the – the Russian, the Zhorkinses(ph).</span> <span id="s941">By the time the Germans arrive, they quietly left us alone.</span> <span id="s942">So when we asked – asked fire from this side, right, they ca – they turn around and came from the other side where the Russians supposed to be.</span> <span id="s943">And was a lot of – l-lot [indecipherable] between them.</span> <span id="s944">They jump in – into the woods, arms they have so much, they shot on us for an hour, millions of – of bullets.</span> <span id="s945">And we were watching every bullet we had, we – we watch to be perfect, you know.</span> <span id="s946">[clears throat] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s947">And all of a sudden, my friend Kopelowicz shot a [indecipherable] in his head and he fall down.</span> <span id="s948">And a – and a second one he was wounded, and then the third one shot him.</span> <span id="s949">So our friend Moma took out his – his [indecipherable] and he want to cover his – his – so he was with his hand [indecipherable] like this on his head and that’s the way they fall.</span> <span id="s950">We made it until the evening, in the evening we came.</span> <span id="s951">We took off all the blood all around him, we made a kevir(ph), we say Kaddish, and we let him, the first ca – the first kalban(ph), the first casualty we had.</span> <span id="s952">And then, from then we n – we knew that’s a war, we have to – we’ll have casualties, we got to get used to it.</span> <span id="s953">It was very hard for us, because in so many hundred and thousands of people were killed in the ghetto, it wasn’t so shocked like here in the woods.</span> <span id="s954">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Wha-What’s the difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Because over here we – we were like partisans, we – we fighting the Germans.</span> <span id="s957">They cannot kill us, we got to kill them.</span> <span id="s958">So it was – and he was the – the – the – the [indecipherable], he was [indecipherable] it was a shock.</span> <span id="s959">But then we get used to it, people get killed, it’s a war.</span> <span id="s960">They killed, they – we kill and that’s – that’s the way it goes.</span> <span id="s961">And then from then –</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: What – what were the daily living conditions like?</span> <span id="s963">Where did you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: The living condition, the first time we sleep under the sky, under the trees.</span> <span id="s965">We used to take the ha – the dry wood, branches and make a fire and – and – and cook like soup.</span> <span id="s966">Some meat or some fish or some fish or some this, we – we took away from the Christian population.</span> <span id="s967">But after being a half a year already, we went deep into the German zones and we took horses and cows and pigs, and whatever you want to have.</span> <span id="s968">And we had like a farm in – in – in – in – in the woods.</span> <span id="s969">And Jews, you know, they made already milk, cheeses and – and [indecipherable] an-and meat, and it was – people, maybe 10 working and preparing everything.</span> <span id="s970">Sh – new shoes, new hairs, new clothes, and some people the arms, and th-th – a factory become i-in – in – in – in less than a year.</span> <span id="s971">You wouldn’t believe what there – a hospital we built under – under the earth, deep and from the trees we had air.</span> <span id="s972">The trees were so big, but very old, so you could see the sky.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: So you had one location, you were not always moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: No, no, we – wa – one – one location.</span> <span id="s975">This is what one location, was a very good place.</span> <span id="s976">We call it Ostrow(ph).</span> <span id="s977">Why we call it Ostrow(ph)?</span> <span id="s978">In Russian is a place where all around the swamps.</span> <span id="s979">And one place in the center, or more or less in the center, is higher.</span> <span id="s980">This place is dry.</span> <span id="s981">So we used to live in these places.</span> <span id="s982">And over there be you – for winter, we – we prepare houses 50 percent inside the earth, and 50 percent covered with wood, right, and we used to take away from the Germans benzene(ph) or – or things like this.</span> <span id="s983">So we had a [indecipherable] in side, one side open with many holes, put wood and we were burning all of 24 hours.</span> <span id="s984">Was warm, beautiful.</span> <span id="s985">And a lot of posts, posts every hundred meter, every thousand meter, every 1500 meter, every 2,000 meter.</span> <span id="s986">And then, th-the – when we became already strong, we had the radios an-and wit – big radios and what – music and dancing like – like a normal family.</span> <span id="s987">Yeah, because the Russians send us paratroopers and they came with radios and – and many things.</span> <span id="s988">And since then –</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: So Russian soldiers kept joining you?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Yes, we had the Russians – I told you, we have the Russians and Jews together, it’s no – no more are Jews separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: No, no, no, no, but Russians soldiers would join you, continue to join – come into the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Yeah, a lot.</span> <span id="s993">Jews wasn’t there already any more, because almost the Jews – some, a gr – little – maybe after the second [indecipherable] already was nothing left, one group 200, one group 500, who was to work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s994">They were – most just were killed already.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: But we – we – we wanted to take care of the Jews too, take them out.</span> <span id="s997">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: What were your thoughts when you heard about the second and third selections in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: We went, let’s say, to – to – to – to the ghetto few times, and we knew that this – this will happen.</span> <span id="s1000">So I went tha – over there, and instead to take a whole group, I took out two – two people.</span> <span id="s1001">Bayla(ph) Trebovicz(ph) and Tuvia(ph) Narnek(ph).</span> <span id="s1002">I took them v – all the people went already to the [indecipherable] they took them to kill, and I took the two girls and went out from the ghetto, and I don’t know what the mazla(ph) had, they didn’t caught us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Wh-Why did you pick them?</span> <span id="s1004">How did you decide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: There was one had a – a – a husband in the – in the partisans and the second had a brother.</span> <span id="s1006">And they were prepared we should take them, so I – I – they send me to take them.</span> <span id="s1007">I want to take them more, but I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1008">See, it was a situation that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: How did you handle your fear when you were doing something like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: I [indecipherable] no fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: How is it you had no fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Well, it – it didn’t bother me, I – I – the only thing was – I was – wanted it to do, is to kill Germans, and my role was to destroy them.</span> <span id="s1013">They destroy me.</span> <span id="s1014">I remember my father used to say, if somebody will be alive, remember what they did to us.</span> <span id="s1015">And after they killed my father, I was [indecipherable] the yeshiva from school.</span> <span id="s1016">I became a lion, I wasn’t afraid for nothing.</span> <span id="s1017">Always I used to be the first, jump into the fire like a hell.</span> <span id="s1018">How many times I had bullets in my – in my head, i-in my arms over here [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1019">I – I never was wounded, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Did you ever kill anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1022">I had to.</span> <span id="s1023">I had no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: This is while you were a partisan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: I – I never kill a – a ra – a White Russian.</span> <span id="s1026">If I kill somebody it’s because he wants to kill me.</span> <span id="s1027">I – I kill a partisan too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Because he wanted to kill me.</span> <span id="s1030">The jealousy on me was so big, that even Jewish people were jealous.</span> <span id="s1031">Where we go [indecipherable] successful.</span> <span id="s1032">We were – they -- like I told you before, they went to – to the ghetto too.</span> <span id="s1033">We come to the ghetto f-five [indecipherable] he came back.</span> <span id="s1034">He used to come to the partisans [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1035">So I – an-and in their look they’re like Christians, the people who went to the ghetto, people who most – I wouldn’t, my nose, you can see, like a Jew.</span> <span id="s1036">I said, I am not afraid with my no – my Jewish nose, I – I’ll go an-and I’ll be – I’ll do it.</span> <span id="s1037">And I – I – I did.</span> <span id="s1038">I had mazel, I had mazel.</span> <span id="s1039">Let’s say I – I had mazel.</span> <span id="s1040">I save a lot of people, I save maybe, I would say 70 to 80 people I – I saved out – fr-from ghetto to take it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: S-S – 70 to 80?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Yeah [indecipherable] time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: I went maybe five, six times into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: And all the time – all the time I came out perfectly.</span> <span id="s1047">Whenever they send me to destroy the jer – the Germans railroad or bridges, never one man – I was always the responsible man for the group, and never somebody hit – was hit from my – my – mine – mine people, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: And you were given orders to do these different sabotage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Oh, yeah, I – I – when – when the Russians came from Moscow, they teach us how to put mines, how to use arms.</span> <span id="s1050">So a lot of people doing it, but you see, is not what is – is afraid, he is shaky, he is shameful.</span> <span id="s1051">And – but a lot of people were like come on, it’s my life, that’s – I have to d – I have a chance now to take [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1052">I have a chance, do it.</span> <span id="s1053">But not too many.</span> <span id="s1054">Not too many, because this was de – you know, when you leave your woods, you’re in danger for death.</span> <span id="s1055">And people were afraid.</span> <span id="s1056">Probably I di – I had – I wasn’t smart enough, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Was there any particular experience that was extremely – more dangerous than others?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Oh yeah, it was a time that people have tsinga(ph).</span> <span id="s1059">The teeth fa – start bending and the – because we didn’t have salt.</span> <span id="s1060">Now, I have to get salt, we have to get into the German zone, and the Germans, let’s say two, three kilometer from the – from the farms, they used to give them sugar and – and salt and – and salt, everything.</span> <span id="s1061">10 - 15 kilometer deeper they didn’t give nothing, because they want them to die to [indecipherable] partisans.</span> <span id="s1062">So I took a group.</span> <span id="s1063">Myself, my cousin Arnold(ph) Sheefis(ph) and Sam Averkovicz(ph) and Davidal(ph) Winarnik(ph) and we went, four guys, young people.</span> <span id="s1064">We went and we start taking from the ri – to a gor – we came to a place with – very near, maybe two, three kilometer from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1065">We knock on the door, don’t open the light, give us all the salt you have in the house.</span> <span id="s1066">Ahh!</span> <span id="s1067">One more word you killed and the house is going on fire.</span> <span id="s1068">The lady brings 10 kilograms salt.</span> <span id="s1069">And from house to house and house to house, I’m think we went to – the last house that would have to go back we see, so further from the police.</span> <span id="s1070">We came over there with a hundred kilogram.</span> <span id="s1071">This is shre – hi -- heavy for four people, is 25 kilo for each.</span> <span id="s1072">We came with that, it’s almost morning, we took off the shoes, we start cleaning out the rifles, and we asked the owner should give us our coffee or tea, something to eat.</span> <span id="s1073">And we were eating, and no shoes on us.</span> <span id="s1074">And she said, children, Germans.</span> <span id="s1075">[indecipherable] a big window, Germans.</span> <span id="s1076">I said, [indecipherable] fire.</span> <span id="s1077">We let them come close and [indecipherable] fire to the windows, like this.</span> <span id="s1078">[makes gunfire sound].</span> <span id="s1079">And we jump up and go back house and they open a fire.</span> <span id="s1080">You know, they’re – it – it what to shoot.</span> <span id="s1081">And we took the salt and we [indecipherable] the shoes, and it was winter.</span> <span id="s1082">So we run away in a – in a place where the – it was a – a wat – water, and on top on the water it was like a wooden bridge, and under this was lower places on a lot of branches.</span> <span id="s1083">Our mazel they didn’t have docks.</span> <span id="s1084">We went under the branches, and they come too look for us and they went further and we were sitting freezing all winter day with the salt.</span> <span id="s1085">In the evening we were so hungry and – and – and thirsty and from – I call it the – I – I cannot [indecipherable] in English, from [indecipherable] is all, we went out.</span> <span id="s1086">We stood up, look around, not [indecipherable] we went to the first Christian house, tell them to give us hot soup and give us shoes.</span> <span id="s1087">He say he hasn’t got no shoes.</span> <span id="s1088">Give us food, and wa – you haven’t got shoes?</span> <span id="s1089">I remember I was so mad on him, he said he had no shoes.</span> <span id="s1090">I caught him like this and I gave him a knock.</span> <span id="s1091">He – I pushed him to the lext – next wall.</span> <span id="s1092">He was running b-b-b-b-b-back.</span> <span id="s1093">Fall down and I put – took off his shoes, put them in my sh – my feet.</span> <span id="s1094">So he said to me, don’t kill me please.</span> <span id="s1095">And he give us so much things for everybody, shoes and – and clothes and he become soft and good.</span> <span id="s1096">Then we said to him, now we taking your horse.</span> <span id="s1097">By a Christian [indecipherable] horse.</span> <span id="s1098">He had two, otherwise we wouldn’t take.</span> <span id="s1099">We took away the horse and we took a – a – a cow and put everything – salt on this and we went to the woods.</span> <span id="s1100">To – we – we came home, we were heroes.</span> <span id="s1101">We got salt, ay yi yi yi yi.</span> <span id="s1102">When th-the commandeer came he said I – he kiss me and he says to me, Noah from today on your name is not Noah.</span> <span id="s1103">Today ma – you are Nikolai(ph).</span> <span id="s1104">This is a little – little story but this is very – then – then th – the second time I took the same group.</span> <span id="s1105">And one of the group, the Averkovicz(ph), Sam Averkovicz(ph) has parents in – in the woods, a father and a mother from Baranowicze.</span> <span id="s1106">They told me I should take this group because I am so successful I – I should go to find out, because couple partisans were killed – [phone ringing, tape break] – couple days before, couple partisans went to destroy the railroad and the electricity and one of our friends, Yakov Press(ph) were killed.</span> <span id="s1107">When they start cutting the – the – the – the – the column from the electricity to the da – Germans put a mine.</span> <span id="s1108">All of a sudden the mine destroy, and a-a – op – hi – has – his head was off.</span> <span id="s1109">So we took him on the rifles and brought him back to the partisans.</span> <span id="s1110">And then they send me, I should find out who did it.</span> <span id="s1111">So I went with these three guys.</span> <span id="s1112">I didn’t want old, I want young kids, what I say is – is holy, cause I knew, the young kids, they underst – not understand [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1113">Older one thinks, I will not go, I can be afraid, I’ll – I find it out very short – in the very beginning, and I said, that’s it, no – just with these ki – guys I go.</span> <span id="s1114">And I came to Matrosov(ph) [indecipherable] but he was a Russian, he came in the first war took, and he – he married a White Russian shi – goya and we went to – I went over there and I told him, Mr. Matrosov(ph), we got to find out, your neighbors who – some of them told to the Germans about the group who went to destroy the railroad and they caught him and they killed him.</span> <span id="s1115">And the – and the Jewish guy with another gun, who went to – to destroy the electricity was killed, was too much, you know, for us to take.</span> <span id="s1116">And he finded out who – who – who did it, and we went t-to this guy at night, had two – two chil – two daughters, teachers, and a son in the police by – by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1117">And went to the house, the – the dogs start barking and he came out, he was – was sure that’s probably policia, so non – nobody – partisans would come here.</span> <span id="s1118">I told him to take in the dog, she shouldn’t bark and should be quiet.</span> <span id="s1119">He said, wh-who are you, police?</span> <span id="s1120">[indecipherable] we are police from Moscow.</span> <span id="s1121">[indecipherable] he became red.</span> <span id="s1122">[indecipherable] n-nothing.</span> <span id="s1123">And I looks up and he brought his daughters dressed to the table and they give us – want to give us a good time, you know.</span> <span id="s1124">They prepare food.</span> <span id="s1125">They prepared food and we ate, and we drink, even enjoy it.</span> <span id="s1126">And then I said to him, you see, you did this and this and this and you did this and this through your two daughters.</span> <span id="s1127">You all three get killed with one bullet.</span> <span id="s1128">And they put them head to head, three – all three of them on the floor, and one bullet destroyed them all three.</span> <span id="s1129">The older lady, the m – his wife start to screaming, so I didn’t want to do it nothing, but we put the whole house on fire with [indecipherable] she get burned anyway.</span> <span id="s1130">We took away the horse and what we can loaded on the horses, and back again.</span> <span id="s1131">Paid them off.</span> <span id="s1132">But many – man – many things that wasn’t so easy.</span> <span id="s1133">What I am saying is just ah – but this was taking days to do, to figure out everything and be sure that’s you’re doing right, right?</span> <span id="s1134">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Noah Roitman.</span> <span id="s1137">This is tape two, side B, and we’ve been talking about your experiences with the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: I forgot to tell you about when we were a group from Bogachev(ph) and then from Bogachev(ph) went to the east.</span> <span id="s1139">So we were left a group with I would say like maybe a hundred people, 80 people were left.</span> <span id="s1140">What was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Was this Jewish and Russian partisans together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Yes, together.</span> <span id="s1143">That was the time when we were already in Bogachev’s(ph) group.</span> <span id="s1144">Bogachev(ph) was the commandeer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: The Russian commandeer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1147">And he decides to go east, why?</span> <span id="s1148">I told you before that one of the Jewish guys [indecipherable], his name.</span> <span id="s1149">Hm.</span> <span id="s1150">Oh, no, no, no, I have to tell you – tell his name.</span> <span id="s1151">Excuse me a minute, I – [tape break] I told you before about eza – Eliezer(ph) Lidovsky(ph), who didn’t want us to leave the ghetto the first – he was a older person, had a family in the ghetto and he – it was true that he will be the first arriving in the – in the – in the woods.</span> <span id="s1152">When he was like second hand by ku – Bogachev(ph), he used to tell him to do this and get that, tell him stories with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1153">But he didn’t do anything good for anybody.</span> <span id="s1154">So he – you – he used to say that if he went as a – with his face as a goy, and he couldn’t go into the ghetto, how could I go to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s1155">And we had a little – you know, I said to him, I am younger, I am stronger than you, I can do it better than you.</span> <span id="s1156">He didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s1157">And when he was such an important man but a commandeer, so I was nothing, and h-he wanted to get rid of me somehow, it – every – every – I shouldn’t be in between, you know?</span> <span id="s1158">So when the – the commandeers came in – in from Moscow, was a commandeer Muha(ph).</span> <span id="s1159">Muha(ph) is a fly in Russian.</span> <span id="s1160">He was telling us, when you go to do something near the Germans, you should know.</span> <span id="s1161">He gave you a little speech.</span> <span id="s1162">This is our land and you should be like a lion.</span> <span id="s1163">The Germans are nothing.</span> <span id="s1164">Today they are here.</span> <span id="s1165">In a month, a half a year, in two years they will be back in Germany, and we will be in our [indecipherable] here.</span> <span id="s1166">So you – he gave you such a impetus to – to fight, to do something.</span> <span id="s1167">And young people my type were very encouraged, you know.</span> <span id="s1168">So when I used to come and do things and that and that and all the young people used to come to him and say you [indecipherable] you’re doing nothing, look Noah.</span> <span id="s1169">With a Jewish nose, he – he said, he – he does everything.</span> <span id="s1170">So they – they wanted to get rid of me, and they – and they went get rid of me.</span> <span id="s1171">And they send me out to a group who came near Pinsk, and the commandeer was Igor.</span> <span id="s1172">Igor, when I came to them was plain Russian, all from Moscow.</span> <span id="s1173">Moscow, Leningrad –</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Yo-You went – you were the only one to leave to go to Igor?</span> <span id="s1175">A: I was the only one, in Jewish.</span> <span id="s1176">And I came over there, I see all of a sudden, three – my – from my city, three guys, Worlansky(ph) Eller(ph), Worlansky(ph) Simcha(ph), and Worlansky(ph) Abrusha(ph) the youngster, my friend.</span> <span id="s1177">When I saw them, they said, Noah, where you come from?</span> <span id="s1178">I said, my group send me over here.</span> <span id="s1179">I – he – they said, what you gonna do?</span> <span id="s1180">I said, we’re gonna go to destroy the – the railroad here.</span> <span id="s1181">They said, we have so many people, they know everything.</span> <span id="s1182">I said, I know, too.</span> <span id="s1183">They said, how do you know?</span> <span id="s1184">I said, I am already a year and a half in the partisans, it’s time to learn.</span> <span id="s1185">They just came, they were just new-coming from – they were [indecipherable] in a – in a place hid – hide – hiding.</span> <span id="s1186">Okay.</span> <span id="s1187">Over there was groups, 12 - 15 people groups, and the commandeer was a Russian officer and the rest was all Russians.</span> <span id="s1188">And they took us, me and the hi – the younger, Abrusha(ph), my friend to the same group.</span> <span id="s1189">And we went at night.</span> <span id="s1190">They give us clothes forsta – first of all and machine guns, and good, everything perfect, to be dressed like a mensch with grenade, with a pistol, with – like a mensch you dressed, and got arms.</span> <span id="s1191">They give you a little education what you can do, and which bombs you have to put under – under the railroad.</span> <span id="s1192">So we came out, over there was five people sitting behind a water.</span> <span id="s1193">Water was up – water was he – to here.</span> <span id="s1194">So the Germans never thought that we’ll be going seven kilometer into the – into the swamp to here to destroy the railroads.</span> <span id="s1195">So they – they left this – this zone open.</span> <span id="s1196">We came over there vert – [indecipherable] seven kilometer at night to go, you know, and I was short so I had to go with two shtettins I shouldn’t fall in.</span> <span id="s1197">We came on the other side, we were like fi-five people, the communists said, Noah [indecipherable] Baloja(ph), you both go to put the mines.</span> <span id="s1198">Baloja(ph) said to the commandeer, him, he’s Jewish, he doesn’t know ho-how to put mines.</span> <span id="s1199">I’m not going.</span> <span id="s1200">So he says, step away, right away.</span> <span id="s1201">In Russia there’s not such a thing you’re not going.</span> <span id="s1202">So he said, who wants to go?</span> <span id="s1203">And my friend Abrusha(ph), he – he – I’m going with Noah.</span> <span id="s1204">So we went both, we put on the mine, you know, we had to dig out the hole, put the mine deep that they smell th – from the dogs, the dogs shouldn’t be able to smell it.</span> <span id="s1205">Put a metal like a half a meter deep.</span> <span id="s1206">When the railroad come and just a little critch is up in the air.</span> <span id="s1207">We did it, came back and now – in couple hours after they left the – the swamps, boom [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1208">So the – the Russian came to me, he said I’m sorry, I didn’t know you know how t – how to – how to – the – they say Jewish people don’t know how to fight.</span> <span id="s1209">I say, well you’re right, Jewish people don’t know.</span> <span id="s1210">What they don’t know, they know.</span> <span id="s1211">[indecipherable] instead.</span> <span id="s1212">And I was there with them fighting every night, some other place, some other place, some other place.</span> <span id="s1213">Not fighting with guns, with – with pistols, just bombs and bombs and bombs.</span> <span id="s1214">We destroy them like dogs every night a – a – a – a transport, every night a transport.</span> <span id="s1215">You know what it is, night – arms we had, how much we want.</span> <span id="s1216">Food, the best.</span> <span id="s1217">It was sitting a whole week every day, then we went back to the grou – to the [indecipherable] near Pinsk.</span> <span id="s1218">Come there, change clothes, the best shower in the world.</span> <span id="s1219">Food is unbelievable, the cook was from Hungary [indecipherable] in – in order to cook good food for the commandeer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Ho-How big a group

id="s1311">Bilmis(ph)?</span> <span id="s1312">I said to myself, Jewish?</span> <span id="s1313">Now Jewish Bilmis(ph)?</span> <span id="s1314">I came over there [indecipherable] sit down.</span> <span id="s1315">You have no – more Jews over here?</span> <span id="s1316">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s1317">Wolansky’s(ph) a Jew, Hamut(ph) is a Jew.</span> <span id="s1318">Jew – these Jews, bring them all to me.</span> <span id="s1319">I bring all the [indecipherable] my close friends.</span> <span id="s1320">They – he ed – he made us food, we ate, we take a re – took a rest and – and he was such a geshmak(ph), such a nahas(ph).</span> <span id="s1321">I’m telling you, he – he – our morale was to the sky.</span> <span id="s1322">And nothing to worry, he says, from no – now I’ll take care of you.</span> <span id="s1323">And he did.</span> <span id="s1324">One day the Russian army decide that all officers got to know how to dance, but dancing to ge – to Germany, in Germany everybody is kultura(ph).</span> <span id="s1325">They cult – culta – kultura(ph), so people in Russia, they are not, everybody.</span> <span id="s1326">So we went for dancing in Russia, in – in – in the Krasny(ph) Baraki(ph), in the place.</span> <span id="s1327">We all came to see what the – how the officers dancing, just officers.</span> <span id="s1328">And all of a sudden some Ukrainian about something, start with – with this [indecipherable] of mine, my friend, my Bilmis(ph) and he told him – I said, this is this and then he said to him – to the je – to the Bilmis(ph), you are parshiva(ph) Jew.</span> <span id="s1329">You are pig – pig Jew.</span> <span id="s1330">He took the pistol out and he [indecipherable] just shot him on – on the place.</span> <span id="s1331">Everybody was – Bilmis(ph) such a officer, such a quiet, such a intelligent.</span> <span id="s1332">He said, I couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s1333">I can see my friends all die in the part – in the partisans and in the ghettoes and a Ukrainian like this, who worked together with the Germans, he’s [indecipherable] he’ll told me I am a dirty Jew, he cannot live any more on this world [indecipherable] The general – the general came, he said, [indecipherable] Bilmis [speaks Russian] friend, what punishment you want?</span> <span id="s1334">He said, send me on the front.</span> <span id="s1335">He said, you got it.</span> <span id="s1336">Normally, he said, we killing.</span> <span id="s1337">You should be killed.</span> <span id="s1338">And he send him [indecipherable] by Berlin if he – there was – he was killed.</span> <span id="s1339">Was a big tragedy for all of us because he said, when the war will be over, we’ll all meet together and we’ll go [indecipherable] to Israel.</span> <span id="s1340">And that’s aft – in the – I was, and that’s the way we – we went on the front.</span> <span id="s1341">I went to artillery on the front, and they se – they send me on a course, on this place where I was, I was on a course for a couple of weeks to learn artillery.</span> <span id="s1342">It’s a minamyot(ph), you know what minamyot(ph) and artill – artillery too.</span> <span id="s1343">I learn so good, I knew it, I was proud of myself that I learned the way it should be.</span> <span id="s1344">And I became a sergeant and they send me on the front.</span> <span id="s1345">Send me on the front to white rush – to shuko(ph) White Russian – first White Russian front.</span> <span id="s1346">I came into a place, my general was Plachin(ph), my commandeer was 99 Guardia(ph) artilleriskipolk (ph) and I was Sergeant Roitman on the third battery.</span> <span id="s1347">And since then I fought with all of them until we came to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1348">But in between, when we be – didn’t fight, we had to go out, three or four people from each cannon and go and get prisoners of Germans.</span> <span id="s1349">Sometime we did, sometime we didn’t, yeah.</span> <span id="s1350">Sometime they killed us, sometime we killed them.</span> <span id="s1351">And one place – we came to a place, ot -- Ottertoti(ph) Berlin, we saw we – the Germans at – attack here back again.</span> <span id="s1352">They instead – Russian attack – attack all the time, but they some – somehow a group of Germans start attack sho – attack the Russian art – infantry.</span> <span id="s1353">And they caught a group, they put all these, they call it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Belt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Belts to each other and to the hand, to the each other and they killed them out.</span> <span id="s1356">And we came, we – we saw the Germans running and we open fire.</span> <span id="s1357">We killed them all, not one was left.</span> <span id="s1358">So it was a big tragedy.</span> <span id="s1359">Here the – th-the 50 - 60 Germans just killed maybe – maybe a hundred Russians in – in – in a minute.</span> <span id="s1360">And over here we came and we di – killed the – the – the Germans.</span> <span id="s1361">But what – what the Germans where we ki – there were so many Russian were killed.</span> <span id="s1362">So when the army came, the officers tell me everybody was crying like children.</span> <span id="s1363">Why, oh, thought this Berlin ready, the last minute we – we get such a [indecipherable] they – they killed so many people.</span> <span id="s1364">It was unbelievable, they couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s1365">And then, from then on until we came to Berlin, we didn’t left one German alive, not one.</span> <span id="s1366">We had oth-other undefe – und – un – under – un – u-u-under our feet Germans and Russian, are mixed, th – because the – the – the – the – the – the fight was so intense and the artillery of the Russian was giving fire [indecipherable] and bombs that i-it was a – you couldn’t see anything, like rain before you.</span> <span id="s1367">And whatever we saw is – was mixed up, until we came to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1368">We came to Berlin, a commandeer came over, he said Noah, now you see you – you have to go.</span> <span id="s1369">Where I have to go?</span> <span id="s1370">He said.</span> <span id="s1371">You take one cannon with 10 people and we’ll push you on the ropes, because the trucks cannot go in.</span> <span id="s1372">The fire is in – unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Before you – before we get to Berlin, did you see any – did you come across any camps, any labor camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Yeah, it was in Lódz when we were on the Wiesel(ph) – on the Wisla.</span> <span id="s1375">Wisla near Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1376">W-We were standing there for months, and then we pushed and we went back to Lódz to see because we – we knew they still had the Jewish people over there.</span> <span id="s1377">And in Warsaw we saw was everything destroyed.</span> <span id="s1378">And from there wh – by the way w-we went to – to Berlin, we came to a – to the water in the – the other [indecipherable] is like this and the Warta is like this, two waters go [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1379">And we – we – we – and we had to go over on the other side in order to stop the ger – the Germans, they shouldn’t be able to – to go – to go the bridge.</span> <span id="s1380">All night long we build the bridges, you know, pontoon bridges under the water.</span> <span id="s1381">And we took lines, like oil, so the tanks can see the – the lines oil, how to get on – on the bridge, because everything’s under the water.</span> <span id="s1382">And we came with our truck, a GMC, American GMC and our cannon, 105 millimeter Howitz(ph), and we were sitting on – and – and going through and all of a sudden Germans came and started bombing.</span> <span id="s1383">And all the bridge was collapsed and our truck is in the water and me and one another guy ju-jump out from – on top of the water was a piece of ice, you know?</span> <span id="s1384">This was 1945 already, maybe in February, March.</span> <span id="s1385">And we were sitting on the – on the piece – on the – on the ice, and we running with the rifles wet, back to Küstrin where the Germans are.</span> <span id="s1386">I said it – I am not going, I am jumping.</span> <span id="s1387">And I start jumping from one piece of ice to the other – to the other with the big clothes on yourself and somehow the energy made it I should be able to come on the other side, and we came alive, two of us.</span> <span id="s1388">When we came on the other side they didn’t believe we are alive because everybody is under the water already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: As you were on the move, did you see any Jewish refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Yes, I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Did you talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: I talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: And what – what did you talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Oh you – we talk that i-if they can be alive another day or two, and we shouldn’t – they – they – they were afraid to – to eat too much, because the American in some places they didn’t give them nothing, in some places they give them chocolate.</span> <span id="s1395">The Russians were better, I’m telling you, the Russian gave them soup.</span> <span id="s1396">Skinny, not that fat, just to – to – little by little, not too much, so they – they [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Did you know anything about the camps at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Yeah, sure we knew.</span> <span id="s1399">We knew everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: How did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Because the trou – Russian propaganda was – was telling us everything.</span> <span id="s1402">Telling every – we used to hear news three, four times a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: And you heard of a place called Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1405">Auschwitz and Majdanek and Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1406">And we knew that this probably happened to Jews and the Russians, because they will not take American or British over there, that what we knew.</span> <span id="s1407">Because all the time we had a – a [indecipherable] we were afraid that one day [indecipherable] the American and the British will at-attack us.</span> <span id="s1408">It was almost [indecipherable] said, the American going to – to – to attack us, maybe a day or two or three, it was very close to it.</span> <span id="s1409">I don’t know why it did not happen, but it was on the agenda in – in – in Germany, before we took Berlin, because the Russian wanted to press so hard, kill how many Russians and Germans together, just to be the first in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1410">And they did.</span> <span id="s1411">And we have to be the first, we have to be the first and push and push.</span> <span id="s1412">This what I’m telling you is nothing.</span> <span id="s1413">If I would tell you stories how many days and nights we didn’t sleep, we didn’t eat, we had to fight and fight.</span> <span id="s1414">Some places we had hills, where the Germans give us fire hell.</span> <span id="s1415">We couldn’t go up the hill.</span> <span id="s1416">We have to shot for days, you know, in order to get through to these places, because the Germans were so defendable.</span> <span id="s1417">They had [indecipherable] arms, and – and – and good soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: When you were fighting the Germans, were you fighting as a Jew, or were you fighting as a Russian soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Well, in my heart I was a Jew, but with the clothes and everything, he – I was a Russian soldier, of course.</span> <span id="s1420">I couldn’t say – say – when – when I f – when I get the Germans prisoners.</span> <span id="s1421">So I tell them [speaks German].</span> <span id="s1422">He never responded, he never say anything.</span> <span id="s1423">He thought I am going to kill him a lot.</span> <span id="s1424">I didn’t touch him, I didn’t do nothing to him because I had a order not to do anything.</span> <span id="s1425">To kill, somebody else will kill him, but not me.</span> <span id="s1426">And if he – if he a – he was a general, he wouldn’t even speak to a [indecipherable] he wants a general to speak to.</span> <span id="s1427">Such a chutzpah from the Germans y-you wouldn’t believe, yeah.</span> <span id="s1428">Unheardable, the – the – the – the respect for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: So – so now you’re in the outs – on the outskirts of Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Now – now we have to go into Berlin, so he says to me, Noah, you take y – nine people and you will commandeer, and we’ll bring you at night into the city.</span> <span id="s1431">What you have to do, the first floor everywhere is already Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s1432">The second floor, third, Germans.</span> <span id="s1433">How do we get rid of the Germans, how – how can we do it, we cannot send our people with – with rifles?</span> <span id="s1434">What can – what can do our infantry men?</span> <span id="s1435">If we go up, it’ll [indecipherable], it’ll kill them.</span> <span id="s1436">Now, on every cross is snipers.</span> <span id="s1437">The Germans killed every Russian, couldn’t go through.</span> <span id="s1438">So the only thing, at night we’ll bring the [indecipherable] and you’ll start shooting in the houses, and that what we did.</span> <span id="s1439">We did it for a few days.</span> <span id="s1440">We destroyed houses, second and third floor mish-mash.</span> <span id="s1441">So maybe I kill a German [indecipherable] too, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1442">What do you think?</span> <span id="s1443">So after maybe – by a week, we couldn’t move the – the – th-the machines to other place, because if we would move they would kill us, the snipers.</span> <span id="s1444">So we stood over there until I heard a shrapnel is coming.</span> <span id="s1445">A – when I knew when the shrapnel is coming, one behind me and one in the side of me, and one before of me, I knew the [indecipherable] will get into me.</span> <span id="s1446">So I said to the guys, let’s jump in into the – into the places where the bombs fell before.</span> <span id="s1447">And we didn’t have a chance to jump out and an air cannon, boom, and nine people were killed in – in one shot.</span> <span id="s1448">One guy was his head split in half, and I was wounded, but I det – I didn’t feel nothing.</span> <span id="s1449">I took my [indecipherable] and take his head, it – it shouldn’t fall apart [indecipherable] ban-bandaged it, and I call for help should come, we – we had nothing.</span> <span id="s1450">And they used to be in touch with us thr-through telephone.</span> <span id="s1451">All of a sudden the telephone was e – e – not in contact.</span> <span

<span id="s1560">A lady came out, old, you know, you [indecipherable] up everything with [indecipherable] she was afraid that the Russian were coming, do something to her.</span> <span id="s1561">I

id="s1570">I came, I see two horses with a wagon from the Russian army, and the bike and the radio is the same – I think this is like the same [indecipherable] the Jewish people had [indecipherable] my friend [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1571">I start running across the house with all my care, and I was running on the steps.</span> <span id="s1572">One Russian ran between me, somehow bended and he run away, and the second after him.</span> <span id="s1573">I caught the second one and not let him go.</span> <span id="s1574">And I said to him, what are – what you doing over here?</span> <span id="s1575">He says not – it’s not your business.</span> <span id="s1576">And I hold him – and all of a sudden the j – the guy jump out from the room.</span> <span id="s1577">He saw me probably [indecipherable] and he told me the story.</span> <span id="s1578">They came in the middle of the night, they took away the guy – the – the bike and this and – and they wanted his wife.</span> <span id="s1579">So she jump out from the window and he – he doesn’t know where she is, and they made me miserable all – half a night until he – was five o’clock in the morning, from – from 12, they murder him.</span> <span id="s1580">I was so shocked, it was so – but it [indecipherable] you know [indecipherable] I cou – I couldn’t take that a Russian should do to a Jew.</span> <span id="s1581">I said to him in Russian [speaks Russian] do you know he is Jewish and I am Jewish too?</span> <span id="s1582">And you do to a Jew, whatever he left from the concentration camp here, all his family is killed.</span> <span id="s1583">He is quiet, he’s not saying anything.</span> <span id="s1584">He almost cried, too, the Russian.</span> <span id="s1585">But I couldn’t stop myself and I give him a shot and I knock him out, his eye.</span> <span id="s1586">And I knock his out – e-eye out.</span> <span id="s1587">He starts to – I – I am a bad Jew [indecipherable] and I – he didn’t let me go, he just grabbed me and grabbed me like this and he didn’t let me go and he starts screaming and biting me and he bite me and I shot in him.</span> <span id="s1588">And I said to the Jew, you go out, find your wife and run away from here, you see what’s – here’s your bike, here’s everything, go.</span> <span id="s1589">And then he slap him, and I slap him, and we went down like the steps like this.</span> <span id="s1590">And in two minutes a Russian officer come with a re – a red band here, with a tomaht(ph), leave everything alone.</span> <span id="s1591">[indecipherable] the hand.</span> <span id="s1592">And the Russian want to say something.</span> <span id="s1593">He says no, he’s a sergeant, he’s supposed to talk first.</span> <span id="s1594">I think he was Jewish or Armenian, but we – we b – like – like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1595">I tell him [speaks foreign language here] no.</span> <span id="s1596">He took him for the ear and slap him and took the other one too.</span> <span id="s1597">I went to the army, I told the officers in the [indecipherable] what’s happen.</span> <span id="s1598">He said, we’ll make you a passport, in two hours you – you go on back to your place, you – you’re not here any more.</span> <span id="s1599">Cause they’re gonna zoo – look for you.</span> <span id="s1600">And they will find you, cause he said, your – your clothes.</span> <span id="s1601">And I came back to my – with my polk(ph) to my – to my artillery, I call it, my unit.</span> <span id="s1602">Came there – no, I came there, I went to my commandeer that I am feeling well, I have pe – I got [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1603">Very happy to see me.</span> <span id="s1604">He says to me, Noah, you know what?</span> <span id="s1605">I thought about you.</span> <span id="s1606">When you coming back from the hospital, we have to open a cantina.</span> <span id="s1607">You know what a cantina is?</span> <span id="s1608">I said, what – what do you mean?</span> <span id="s1609">I – I – I’m a businessman?</span> <span id="s1610">He says to me, what your father did?</span> <span id="s1611">I said, my father was a – he had a horse and that’s what his living.</span> <span id="s1612">And what did your grandpa?</span> <span id="s1613">I said, a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s1614">And [indecipherable] I said, no, but – no – no, but – because over there you was afraid if somebody is handling or is something business, they take, put you in jail.</span> <span id="s1615">So I made everybody so [indecipherable] nobody’s in business.</span> <span id="s1616">So he says to me, such a smart man – his name was Commandeer Plattin(ph) – if nobody was in business in your family, now you will be the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1617">So I said, my God, he want to get me somehow.</span> <span id="s1618">And I said – I said to him, please, let me go too.</span> <span id="s1619">I like to teach artillery.</span> <span id="s1620">Okay, he said, go.</span> <span id="s1621">And let me teach, in two weeks he called me and show [speaks foreign language] you must, I ha – I have no other way.</span> <span id="s1622">Go and put all – all your clothes and everything away.</span> <span id="s1623">He give me a pistol, give me clothes and give me two chauffeurs with two big trucks, two bags, millions o-of – of marks.</span> <span id="s1624">We’ll fa – we’ll fill up the cantina – make a cantina, the cantina in – in Leipzig was so big.</span> <span id="s1625">One of the biggest towns in Germany.</span> <span id="s1626">And I said, what can I do?</span> <span id="s1627">How – how can you do everything?</span> <span id="s1628">With marks, can I – can I make a cantina?</span> <span id="s1629">And then one of the chauffeurs told me, come on, we-we – we’ll – we’ll – we’ll find a way.</span> <span id="s1630">We went to a farm, and we took pigs and we gave them marks.</span> <span id="s1631">And I took – second place we took topa – potatoes.</span> <span id="s1632">In a – in a – in one place we take clothes, and we start – we start changing.</span> <span id="s1633">We di – we d – in the jo – in Germany, changing.</span> <span id="s1634">And then one day I – I brought clothes, you know, material, li-like this.</span> <span id="s1635">Twen – 20 ton.</span> <span id="s1636">The second, I bought shoes, thousand pairs.</span> <span id="s1637">Then I bought sweaters, a million.</span> <span id="s1638">And I start in – in one month, trucks, 10 trucks I took, 10 trucks I took five times a day, 10 trucks I – thousands of soldiers worked just t-to load th – make everything, you know th – after two, three months, we had four – billions of dollars materials.</span> <span id="s1639">And the commandeer from the brigada(ph) [indecipherable] general came, and he said, every officer gets 10 kilogram packet to Russia.</span> <span id="s1640">S-Soap – regular soap, [indecipherable] and then – you call it pens, clothes, shoes and this,10 kilogram.</span> <span id="s1641">Soldiers, five kilogram.</span> <span id="s1642">And we had people walking and make the – in the packages, and send the Russia [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1643">I became so famous that to come to me to talk to me was like to come to a general.</span> <span id="s1644">I have a private car, and whenever I go with my pistol they go – they have two or three people around me to watch me, nothing should happen to me.</span> <span id="s1645">So I went and I bought a car myself.</span> <span id="s1646">I had so much money I didn't know what to do – what to do with it.</span> <span id="s1647">And all my officers used to come and beg, Noah [indecipherable] a bottle vodka.</span> <span id="s1648">Give him a bottle vodka.</span> <span id="s1649">It’s a – everybody was my friend.</span> <span id="s1650">I organize games, chess, soccer, volleyball, right?</span> <span id="s1651">And everybody with clothes and everything.</span> <span id="s1652">And then we had such a good game, we played i-in Bymar(ph), th-the – the English army, we played, and then I run away.</span> <span id="s1653">When I run away I came to commandeer and I said to him, I had to go – I had a dream that my – somebody of my family is alive.</span> <span id="s1654">So he said, what do you want to do?</span> <span id="s1655">I said I wanted two – ones passport.</span> <span id="s1656">Wi – ma – prepare everything so, in a way that it will work for half a year.</span> <span id="s1657">So I’ll give you two months.</span> <span id="s1658">And he did.</span> <span id="s1659">And then I came, say, I would like my friend Shika(ph) Mykohn(ph), he is Jewish, I want him to come with me.</span> <span id="s1660">Why?</span> <span id="s1661">I said, because the Polacks is sh – har – killing Jews and the Russian.</span> <span id="s1662">Oh, yeah, good idea.</span> <span id="s1663">And he let me go with him.</span> <span id="s1664">Then we come to – to Poland.</span> <span id="s1665">And instead to go to Baranowicze, to see what’s going on there, right, first of all I was in 1943 as a partisan I was there, so I knew what the – our house is th – and the people are killed, is – is nothing special for me to see.</span> <span id="s1666">And whatever I could see is to see her and oth-other friends who – who are alive.</span> <span id="s1667">But to me – to me was more important to take Jewish people from Poland and bring them over to Czechoslovakia, because I had two months passporten(ph).</span> <span id="s1668">I was sitting with loc-locomotive with the Polacks, give them 10,000 zlotys, which was a hundred dollars maybe.</span> <span id="s1669">Man – money I have, bigger than me.</span> <span id="s1670">And I spend the money to bring Jews from Poland to – to – to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1671">After they caught me, the Russian caught me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Ho-How did you find these Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Oh, in every city, in the – was the centers from Jews who came from the concentration camp, from Russia, from – from partisans, th – everybody wants to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1674">So you have to go from je – from – from Poland to Germany, and from Germany to France.</span> <span id="s1675">France, with a ship.</span> <span id="s1676">I – I knew, because we ha – I had the connection already with the Israeli [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: How did you have that connection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: It was very easy.</span> <span id="s1679">They find you all over.</span> <span id="s1680">The Israelis find us all over.</span> <span id="s1681">They had the set-up centers.</span> <span id="s1682">The Israelis were working perfect.</span> <span id="s1683">They were – they were like – like British spies, you know, dressed in British, and the Magen David on – on the [indecipherable] so you know this Israeli.</span> <span id="s1684">But they knew everything, they speak all languages and they knew how to co-communicate, right?</span> <span id="s1685">And they to – worked very, very well, very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: And so your role was to do what?</span> <span id="s1687">What was your role at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: My role is to just take out pe-people from Poland to – to – to – to – to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: And did you go with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: I go in the front with the locomotives so the Russians should see a Russian, they will not stop him, you know.</span> <span id="s1691">Or the Czechs or the Polacks.</span> <span id="s1692">But the m – and then [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: So you went back and forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Back and forth, and then they caught me.</span> <span id="s1695">They caught me and put me in jail, the Russians.</span> <span id="s1696">And I got 15 years severe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Okay, before we get to that, when the war was over, what did you feel like?</span> <span id="s1698">What were your thoughts and what were your feelings when you realized that the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: Ah [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1700">I was feeling that a Jew will be like cream on – on the top of the milk.</span> <span id="s1701">Who is gonna see a Jew is gonna say oh, we got to keep him, we got to watch him, we got to respect him, we got to thank him he is – is alive.</span> <span id="s1702">But it’s not like this.</span> <span id="s1703">You see, the whole pi – the whole politic is against the Jews anyway right – right after the war.</span> <span id="s1704">So, I would never believe this will happen, but that’s what happen.</span> <span id="s1705">And then after we – I c – we came to Israel in 1946 and th-they – they took us back to ca – C-Cyprus, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Yeah, we’ll talk about that.</span> <span id="s1707">Okay, so now you said you were escorting these Jews to Czechoslovakia, but you were

Russian caught me and they thought I am gonna run away.</span> <span id="s1713">So one was Jewish, and the rest was NKVD, NKVD, the Russian.</span> <span id="s1714">So the Jew got tol – ta – talked to me like this.</span> <span id="s1715">[speaks foreign language] and you’ll never be smarter than me.</span> <span id="s1716">I’ll put you in jail.</span> <span id="s1717">And they grabbed my hand like behind my – my back.</span> <span id="s1718">They put me in – in katen(ph), you know, in steel, in metal.</span> <span id="s1719">And they put me in a car, they throw me in, Oranienburger Strasse 10 in Germany, and they put me in jail.</span> <span id="s1720">Three days and three nights I was sitting staring straight – not sitting, standing.</span> <span id="s1721">No air, excuse me, and no toilet, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1722">Three days, 72 hours like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Because they thought you were gonna desert?</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Yeah, they thought they go – I’m gonna go [indecipherable] to the Americas, and th – and – from the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1725">So here it – they – when it comes – after three days they took – they take you out and say Noah Roitman.</span> <span id="s1726">You go out.</span> <span id="s1727">When you get fresh air, yo-you – you – you dropping.</span> <span id="s1728">Y-You almost dying.</span>

id="s1730">And then little by little, you come for yourself, it takes you in, in a big zoll(ph) and sitting over there a general and why – wha-wha-what you – what were you doing against the Russian?</span> <span id="s1731">You take people and take them over to the Americans for money.</span> <span id="s1732">And then I tell – I want to – can I sit?</span> <span id="s1733">He says to me, you dog, you stay because I am gonna smash you with my pistol, you fascist.</span> <span id="s1734">I said to him, I am Jewish, I am wounded May 5th, 1945 from the Germans and you don’t tell me I am fascist.</span> <span id="s1735">Don’t talk to me like that.</span> <span id="s1736">I said, I am not afraid for you stomping your f – your feet like that.</span> <span id="s1737">I fought for myself.</span> <span id="s1738">I am deserving something better than this.</span> <span id="s1739">Not you should talk to me like that.</span> <span id="s1740">Take him out, this dog, take him out.</span> <span id="s1741">Took me out.</span> <span id="s1742">Took me out a little truck, and then come out two, three other people, and between the other three was one Meyer(ph) Boldusov(ph).</span> <span id="s1743">Meyer(ph) Boldusov(ph).</span> <span id="s1744">He wasn’t Jewish, he was Russian.</span> <span id="s1745">And he says, when you were answering this, so I was behind you, and I heard everything.</span> <span id="s1746">You good, he says to me.</span> <span id="s1747">You’re not afraid for them.</span> <span id="s1748">I said, what can they do, more than severe, what can they do more?</span> <span id="s1749">He says to me, I am officer, a major in the army.</span> <span id="s1750">And in Berlin I couldn’t do whatever they – they told me do this and this and this and I couldn’t do it exactly what they wanted from me.</span> <span id="s1751">So after two days in fighting with the Germans, they told me that I didn’t fill out the – the – he didn’t do it hundred percent [indecipherable] and they put him in jail [indecipherable] and he got 10 years severe.</span> <span id="s1752">Now we were sitting in the truck, in th – behind the truck, in the – in the front is a officer and our driver.</span> <span id="s1753">And the driver was a young guy, and the officer was a young si – we saw right that y-young people came from Russia, from Siberia, somewhere.</span> <span id="s1754">It’s a – children.</span> <span id="s1755">So he th – Boldusov(ph) told me, look, I’ll take care on – on this guy, who was sitting wi-with us with a rifle.</span> <span id="s1756">But you, as a Jew, you gonna run first, because you understand German.</span> <span id="s1757">And we got to go away, Poland, Finland, not – just not Russia.</span> <span id="s1758">And all of a sudden he give me a – a – a – a [indecipherable] and this guy’s head was already laying down and the rifle is not here.</span> <span id="s1759">And we jump out the – the truck runs maybe 20 - 30 miles an hour and we jump from the back.</span> <span id="s1760">No belts, no pagrones(ph), no nothing, and like – like prisoners.</span> <span id="s1761">And we run.</span> <span id="s1762">We run maybe two, three kilometer.</span> <span id="s1763">And we came to the city where the – we heard Ein zug, and zug is a railroad.</span> <span id="s1764">Ein zug nacht Posen, ein zug nacht Poland, ein zug nacht Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1765">I heard Poland, Lódz, I said to him, come on, because I know the language.</span> <span id="s1766">And we went into the railroad, to the wagons, yeah.</span> <span id="s1767">And – and – and the railroad is running.</span> <span id="s1768">And we had to go out – some out – to sit between, because if the Russian come in we’ll – they’ll ch – when they check with the [indecipherable] they gonna get you.</span> <span id="s1769">So we waited until the r – the locomotive will stop somewhere.</span> <span id="s1770">And they stop.</span> <span id="s1771">When they stop we jump out and we went in between the two wagons, you know, and we stood, four people, and – and we hold on each other t – tight, sh-shouldn’t – shouldn’t move, we couldn’t – no, here’s the water – the water too, we had to go through [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1772">We stood and we – we – we see what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1773">The – the Russian already they’re coming just looking for us.</span> <span id="s1774">Th-The – every – every wagon.</span> <span id="s1775">And then they stopped, and they went down and we came to – before Lódz in a – in a shtetl.</span> <span id="s1776">Lignitz(ph)?</span> <span id="s1777">And we went down – we went down, we went to the – the – change the – the – the wagons from here they go – go straight, we have to go to Lódz.</span> <span id="s1778">So we went down and we took a [indecipherable] everybody was sitting and quiet.</span> <span id="s1779">All of a sudden two – not two, three girls came in and they were Jewish, I was sure, because they schlepped pack-packages.</span> <span id="s1780">In that time after the war the Jewish girls used to come from Poland to ger-Germany, bring food from in Poland and from Germany take some clothes and they used to make a living somehow.</span> <span id="s1781">And they went in, they were sitting in the corner.</span> <span id="s1782">And we sitting in this corner.</span> <span id="s1783">All of a sudden you see in the front of the door, Polacks from the army, with the rifles on the arms like this.</span> <span id="s1784">Went back and forth, back and forth, and they mimic with the eyes to each other, and one went in – into the café.</span> <span id="s1785">They went to the café and we watched them and we see they are going to the g – where the girls are.</span> <span id="s1786">So my friend Shika(ph), my other friend, the Jew, says to me in Yiddish, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1787">I said [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s1788">He says, look, they’re going to the girls, they s – probably Jewish.</span> <span id="s1789">So Boldusov(ph), th-the – the Russian, th-the – the strong guy who – who – who was really a strong guy, he said to me, you can talk [indecipherable] if you want, just tell me what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1790">You tell him.</span> <span id="s1791">Oh boy.</span> <span id="s1792">When the Polacks take the girls [indecipherable] in Polish [indecipherable] they had to – no – no – no – no choice, crying and go.</span> <span id="s1793">But before the door he stopped them and he said, da – give me your documents.</span> <span id="s1794">He was a major in the – the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1795">The Polacks was right away nah – give me – a Russian, you know, he’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1796">And all of a sudden, full of people, was most Russian.</span> <span id="s1797">So he said to all the people, a Polack wants to kill three Russian girls.</span> <span id="s1798">Come.</span> <span id="s1799">And a – like – like seeing a Russian [indecipherable] you say give them, give it.</span> <span id="s1800">You should see what was happen.</span> <span id="s1801">Everybody on – on te – two Polacks.</span> <span id="s1802">They – they made them shmattas(ph) on there, on the floor.</span> <span id="s1803">And [indecipherable] somebody came in and it was a Jew with a – a nose like this, shorter than me, and he says, you are i-in – over here too?</span> <span id="s1804">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s1805">He says come in to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1806">I came to [indecipherable] said give me a passport.</span> <span id="s1807">He said, fly to Lódz, right away.</span> <span id="s1808">And we took the girls, we came to Lódz and that’s was enough.</span> <span id="s1809">Soon as we there we start flying and – and – and doing things.</span> <span id="s1810">And goodbye [indecipherable] and a couple of weeks later we went – oh, my wife and I and all my friends –</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: How did you – how did you find your – your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: I knew – I knew.</span> <span id="s1813">I – I – she used to write the letters and I used to write her letters.</span> <span id="s1814">And I used to write letters to the – from the Russia – from the Russian army, all t – to all my friends, the girlfriends [indecipherable] if you’d be in contact.</span> <span id="s1815">So I knew who die in the front and who is wounded in Moscow and who is wounded in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1816">I knew everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: So where did you meet up with your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: And then we came to ger – we became from a – from a – from Poland to Germany, and we come to a kibbutz [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1821">And then they married there, and three other couples, four couples.</span> <span id="s1822">The rabbi was Rabbi Stone(ph) from America.</span> <span id="s1823">And the guy who give us the [indecipherable] was a guy from the partisans who wrote the [indecipherable] by hand, not [indecipherable] everything, we had it.</span> <span id="s1824">And we went to [indecipherable]</span></p>

remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: What was it like to be in Lódz after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: No-Nothing special.</span> <span id="s1830">Just co – ju-just came from all over Hungary from Russia.</span> <span id="s1831">No money, no – no clothes, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1832">Just thank the UNRRA and the Jewish group from the brigada, the Israelis help a lot, they send them right away to Austria, to – to Italia, all over, to Israel.</span> <span id="s1833">That’s why so many people came to Israel that time, because they have the choice.</span> <span id="s1834">[indecipherable] people from concentration camp, [indecipherable] people from Russia, some from the partisans and the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1835">[indecipherable] right to a – to

wife?</span> <span id="s1838">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: Yeah, we did.</span> <span id="s1840">But when we take a little [indecipherable] and we went to Israel in 1946 from French –</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: Well, okay, fi-first your – you got married, and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: Yeah, and – and we went fracto – to – to France.</span> <span id="s1843">And we – and we were staying inside –</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: How did you know to go to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: Because the – the is – the Israeli brigada

Israel.</span> <span id="s1848">So when we went to Saint-Jerome, it was no food, no – no place good to sleep, but we were young, and the power to leave and the power to go to Israel was so that nothing stopped you, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: What – what had happened to your wife?</span> <span id="s1850">You had left her in the partisans and then what – what had happened to

shot she want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1863">And was no ships, we had to wait, and the British was shi – sending airplanes to check if – if we – if we are ready to go with the ships, and they couldn’t tro – control us until we arrived to Israel.</span> <span id="s1864">We ca – after Israel they used to caught us and take us back to fr-fr – to [indecipherable] Cyprus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: So when did you – when did you leave Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Europe I left probably in 1945, I came out from the Russian army, came to Germany and sit there

all you had been through during the war, to have that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: Yeah, we – we – we decide that time, it’s not [indecipherable] way just to fight.</span> <span id="s1877">In this moment I became [indecipherable] Zionist.</span> <span id="s1878">I didn’t want to be a [indecipherable], I didn't want to be a – a – a Mizrachi.</span> <span id="s1879">I’m born Mizrachi.</span>

smell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: How did he know that you had gotten to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: The connection was working perfect.</span> <span id="s1966">Everybody knew every-everybody and everybody want to help each other.</span> <span id="s1967">Because I took these people out from ghetto to the partisans, so he – he wants to repay, you know?</span> <span id="s1968">So, we went over there, better than Petah Tikva, Petah Tikva is hot an-and over here we had what was something to eat and [indecipherable] sleep.</span> <span id="s1969">Next day I said to him, I’m going to Giv’atayim.</span> <span id="s1970">He said Giv’atayim is a long way.</span> <span id="s1971">I said, I’ll go.</span> <span id="s1972">Went – took my wife, went to Giv’atayim.</span> <span id="s1973">I went to Giv’atayim until I came to street [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1974">At street [indecipherable] my father had a cousin, and he was a – there’s – there’s

airport – the airports in Israel and the mamalim(ph), the ports.</span> <span id="s1976">So when I – all of a sudden we went through the house, she came out and she says, hello, hello mister.</span> <span id="s1977">Tell me, your name is not Roitman?</span> <span id="s1978">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s1979">She said, you’re my cousin, come in.</span> <span id="s1980">So we went into her house and she telephone her husband that we are alive, that we are the – the only from the family.</span> <span id="s1981">And she started asking me about her cousins, her father, her mother and ah, na,

husband was a builder.</span> <span id="s2002">So I went to him to – to learn the trade of building houses.</span> <span id="s2003">I work over there by a couple of years until I learned the trade,

because her uncle – her uncle, my wife’s was afraid that if I’ll get caught – killed in the army, wh – how can you take this?</span> <span id="s2016">He was in the American Army during the war.</span> <span id="s2017">So after the war he actually came to – to – to Germany to take us, but we left early to friends.</span> <span id="s2018">We – we didn’t wait like other people, sitting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: Did – did you fight in the War of Independence in 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: Oh yeah, I was 1947 already in the army.</span> <span id="s2021">I was three years, and

hang and the way everything is in order.</span> <span id="s2028">Everybody knows my place is perfect.</span> <span id="s2029">Every nail is in place, every screw [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2030">I’m a builder, but I am not a schlumper(ph), you know?</span> <span id="s2031">Everything – I don’t like people come, take the whole box tools, spread all over.</span> <span id="s2032">[indecipherable] Right?</span> <span id="s2033">And I’m very p – if I am telling you, I am a perfectionist.</span> <span id="s2034">So, I made in Israel a nice life.</span> <span id="s2035">In a very short time I build a house for myself and I become a builder and have a car.</span> <span id="s2036">A Land Rover I had in 1954 - 1955, you know what it was?</span> <span id="s2037">[indecipherable] people say, where you got your money from?</span> <span id="s2038">But they didn’t think I wanted to learn, I wanted to become engineer, as I said.</span> <span id="s2039">How can you become engineer when Israel [indecipherable] engineer?</span> <span id="s2040">Everybody’s a doctor, and everybody’s a professor.</span> <span id="s2041">I’ll become a builder, it’s good enough.</span> <span id="s2042">Money I don’t have, protection I don’t have, I have to work hard.</span> <span id="s2043">My luck was I was strong enough.</span> <span id="s2044">I used to work at night in [indecipherable] to took out two or three trucks milk to the – for the ladies who – who sell milk, yeah, in order to make five pounds.</span> <span id="s2045">These five pounds I saved a year and I saved thousand pounds and I bought a piece of property.</span> <span id="s2046">Then I buys – bought sand and blocks and I built a house and I sold it and I made 16,000 pounds.</span> <span id="s2047">I was the richest man i-i-in Giv’atayim, I think.</span> <span id="s2048">[indecipherable] was going everything the way I wanted it.</span> <span id="s2049">My wife just wasn’t feeling too good, the heat was very depressing, she couldn’t – she wouldn’t take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: So then you came to the United States, and where did you settle?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: We settle in Rohrbach, Brooklyn in 1963 in October, November, cold winter.</span> <span id="s2052">No language.</span> <span id="s2053">Dirty.</span> <span id="s2054">We had a house was shmakt(ph) everybody [indecipherable] oy vey, vey, oy vey.</span> <span id="s2055">It was ver – we wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s2056">I didn’t have the money, but I had the money I would go back right away, I wouldn’t stay here a day.</span> <span id="s2057">But, you know, you get used to the sl – slowly, slowly, but we are more Israelis.</span> <span id="s2058">We ha – we – we – we live in Israel a lot.</span> <span id="s2059">We live in Israel two, three times a year sometime.</span> <span id="s2060">All our – our children don’t want from us nothing, just leave what – what you be sure to leave.</span> <span id="s2061">Go ahead and enjoy.</span> <span id="s2062">[indecipherable] We have everything we need.</span> <span id="s2063">I – I ask just God for health, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Do you think that you would be different, a different person today if you hadn’t lived through the war years and experienced what you did experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: I would.</span> <span id="s2066">I would be different.</span> <span id="s2067">I was – from the war I became hot, a beater against a lot of people.</span> <span id="s2068">Oh, I couldn’t take you see – you see somebody’s – even a Jew against a Jew is hounding, not right, I – I cannot take this.</span> <span id="s2069">I got to help – you got to help people, you [indecipherable] help not – not to take.</span> <span id="s2070">A lot people just taking.</span> <span id="s2071">I cannot take this.</span> <span id="s2072">I have many [indecipherable] with people about things like that.</span> <span id="s2073">And if I would be – if not the war, I’m telling you, I would be a teacher and I would be much cooler, much slower.</span> <span id="s2074">Because of the war, I had to change myself, because if I went to school in Russia, I had to be better.</span> <span id="s2075">If I wouldn’t be better, they would mamish(ph) beat me up.</span> <span id="s2076">If a Jew is not better, he – he feels like a shmatta(ph).</span> <span id="s2077">So I – I think I would be different, and secondly, if I would have my parents, my father especially, such a smart man, oh, I would – I would be – oh, hi – hi – high in th – in – in school, in – in – in [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s2078">I would learning a lot.</span> <span id="s2079">But I had from him to learn, because school is nothing.</span> <span id="s2080">School gives you a – the way how to learn, but if you have a father and mother who knows, and they know how to give you a little shtup here, a shtup there, you can reach everything.</span> <span id="s2081">And that’s what I was missing.</span> <span id="s2082">All the years I used to say, uh, I have to go to school.</span> <span id="s2083">School is far.</span> <span id="s2084">A-After a day’s walk, we [indecipherable] went by hand to Israel in the hot day, they have – you have – the – you strong enough to go into school twen – 20 kilometer.</span> <span id="s2085">And you [indecipherable] money for – to – to – to pay for the bus.</span> <span id="s2086">But if my father would be li – alive, I – I would sit with him for an hour I learn something.</span> <span id="s2087">So I was always telling myself, that what I’m missing the most.</span> <span id="s2088">But I know I couldn’t return the whole thing, so I used to learn myself, I used to ta – buy books and sits to [indecipherable] after – after a day’s work, I used to take couple hours of sleep and my – my daughter and my wife was sleepy, sleepy and I used to wake up, get in the kitchen, the kitchen was big, you know, like – like this – this thing, and take a pen and paper and write.</span> <span id="s2089">I used to write poems and I write a book, was 700 pages.</span> <span id="s2090">And because I wasn’t [indecipherable] Israel, so I keep the book because they said everybody who – who had material, you should keep – we should know in the future, and they took it away and never returned me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: This was a book about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2093">I wrote it from the partisans and the Russian army and th – Israel, and they took it away.</span> <span id="s2094">So this I lo – this I lost, cause over there the dates and the – and the things, you cannot return this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: When your children – when your daughters were your age – w-were the age that you were, the 16 year old, 17, when you went through such terrible, terrible times in the ghetto and losing your family, did that remind you, did that bring back those times to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: When – whe – I used – I – I – when – after the war, I – I didn’t want to have nothing to know with the shul, with – with the [indecipherable] because I was from – I – I was – I would – I would either drink with [indecipherable] at night in the morning.</span> <span id="s2097">Not the [indecipherable] no, no, not the [indecipherable], British.</span> <span id="s2098">And I came to Israel, I didn’t want to know about it, but Shabbas and Yontif [indecipherable] my wife put the lights, and I used to get to shul sometime.</span> <span id="s2099">But I didn’t give my children that feeling.</span> <span id="s2100">And my daughter, my older [indecipherable] the older, she says to me, why I don’t have uncles and – and this and this and that?</span> <span id="s2101">Fa – one, two, three times?</span> <span id="s2102">What can you tell her?</span> <span id="s2103">So instead to tell her the stories what we went through, we decide not to tell her.</span> <span id="s2104">After many, many years she didn’t even ask.</span> <span id="s2105">We wi – decide she will grow up, she [indecipherable] and then we’re gonna tell her, and she understand better.</span> <span id="s2106">And that was a mistake, should be – we should tell her, we had to tell her.</span> <span id="s2107">So, we all living on mistakes, with no mistakes you cannot live.</span> <span id="s2108">And – but I have good children, e-even my g – my g – my grandchildren have the – have the wa – two daughters [indecipherable] one become a doctor very soon and one is in business, very famous.</span> <span id="s2109">And the son is almost a professor of mathematics, so I-I have – at least I didn’t do it, so they doing it.</span> <span id="s2110">And I have – and I am – I am successful.</span> <span id="s2111">Look, I [indecipherable] English, I didn’t finish any school.</span> <span id="s2112">In Israel I was a successful builder and the same thing over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: Are you angry that you had to go through the experiences that you did, whereas other people didn’t have to, other people your age in other countries like the United States didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s2114">Are you angry that you had to, and lose your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: No, no, I wish them the best.</span> <span id="s2116">I am glad that they didn’t have to do this.</span> <span id="s2117">Because in order to – to go through that what I went through, I do believe that a lot of people wouldn’t be able to do it.</span> <span id="s2118">If you th-think about physically, emotionally, it wasn’t so [indecipherable], it wasn’t so easy.</span> <span id="s2119">You had to think about it and then say, I don’t want to know about it.</span> <span id="s2120">I have to continue living.</span> <span id="s2121">I have to go and – go and kill or to get killed.</span> <span id="s2122">I-Is – is thi – is – is this a life?</span> <span id="s2123">I-Is this easy to say about it?</span> <span id="s2124">When you’re living in – in the woods and they call you up at night, say now you have to go.</span> <span id="s2125">You know, when you leave this place, finish every – every – every minute you can get killed.</span> <span id="s2126">And you have to go in snow so high, right, no food.</span> <span id="s2127">You don’t know what t – before you and behind you.</span> <span id="s2128">And if you’re making, you’re making it [indecipherable] gonna make, nobody will go crying you.</span> <span id="s2129">It was like hefka(ph), you know he – it’s not – not something – it’s – to do this i – this alone, just to think about it is – is – it – it isn’t so simple.</span> <span id="s2130">And now this, many times I had to take a horse and go and find out where the Germans are.</span> <span id="s2131">So, I used to go with [indecipherable] you know, with such a ambition.</span> <span id="s2132">I – I am the first who gonna see Germans and tell my commandeer that over here they’re here and we’ll come with a group and we’re gonna destroy them.</span> <span id="s2133">This was the day the [indecipherable] that you – what you did, you accomplished something.</span> <span id="s2134">And many times I came, I came to a – to a plo – to a place where I used to run with my horse, like a machine, and d – I call a lalka(ph), lalka(ph) in – in Russian or Polish is a buba(ph), you know what a buba(ph) is?</span> <span id="s2135">A doll.</span> <span id="s2136">So I came to a place and my horse jumped, a little water, maybe 10 feet.</span> <span id="s2137">I went to the road, Germans in the right and in the left.</span> <span id="s2138">They go to get – go to get the partisans.</span> <span id="s2139">I jumped from the horse on his neck, and jumping back into the woods, until the g – the Germans d-decided this not theirs, I was already back on th – on the horse and come and tell my group that here come the Germans and we came out, a group maybe 50 - 70 partisans and we let them – let them – let them go, you know, maybe 50 feet and more, 80 feet, a hundred feet and from all the side we open fire on them.</span> <span id="s2140">And they were so surprised that they – they couldn’t schlep the – the hand grenades and the [indecipherable], they took off the – the pants a – a – they should be able to run.</span> <span id="s2141">And that’s the way they run into the woods, nobody ever get them out [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2142">You know what – what a feeling this is?</span> <span id="s2143">Like the [indecipherable] they explain, if you do something like that, and you have the [indecipherable] with the – you know what the [indecipherable] is?</span> <span id="s2144">Power.</span> <span id="s2145">[indecipherable] Is – this is the sweetest thing in your life, when you see something like that.</span> <span id="s2146">So I – many things I made – what made me really ah –</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: Proud.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: Proud.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: Do you think, as you’ve gotten older, do you think more about your experiences during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: Ah, I – I – I – I – I don’t think too much about that.</span> <span id="s2151">What I wanted to do, I – I wrote and I s-said for a – here and there, something about this, something like today I – I never – I would never th – just a little, short.</span> <span id="s2152">Many, many years I didn’t do anything, I didn’t want it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: Why didn’t you want to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: Because I had a feeling, let’s say I’m gonna do it, what – what – what – what – what I am accomplishing?</span> <span id="s2155">I’m accomplishing maybe for the future generation, they should know what was happening.</span> <span id="s2156">But so many people writing books, and most of them what I know are gormisht(ph).</span> <span id="s2157">They do nothing.</span> <span id="s2158">They were sitting in the partisans, make – was a – a cook – a cook man, a shoemaker, a – a this – but a fighter was from the – you heard from the Russians, not from the Jews.</span> <span id="s2159">How many f – how many fighting?</span> <span id="s2160">Ten fighting and nine – 19 eith – are around it, but ever-everybody write a – a – a poem, or a book or something like this.</span> <span id="s2161">He was a partisan.</span> <span id="s2162">L-Let – think about it.</span> <span id="s2163">I know f-for our hundreds of people, we had 20 - 30 people that really fighters, were these fighters, fire.</span> <span id="s2164">And that’s enough, you didn’t need any more, right, cause you didn’t need any more.</span> <span id="s2165">But most of the people are not fighters.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: What are your feelings about Germany today?</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: I – I – I cannot say nothing good about Poland, nor about Germany.</span> <span id="s2168">About Poland or Germany I had nothing to say, because they – I would say actually, I should, the – the Polacks are worse than the Germans.</span> <span id="s2169">Do we agree?</span> <span id="s2170">Would you agree?</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: It’s your discussion today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: I – I – I would say ma-many Germans I know, who wanted to help, they did – they did help.</span> <span id="s2173">And Polacks if they did something, it’s just for money, right, and again for money and for – for – many for – for good things for themselves, not – not – not f – to be proud men.</span> <span id="s2174">Yeah, yeah, here and there, one or two or three, but very little.</span> <span id="s2175">Look, the Jews [indecipherable] half a million Jews, two million Jews maybe [indecipherable] right?</span> <span id="s2176">You had in Poland, they had two million people sh-shoot the [indecipherable] Jews, right?</span> <span id="s2177">Six million Jews in Poland, 35 million Polacks.</span> <span id="s2178">No, you haven’t – you didn’t have a – even hundred thousand good people, no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: Politically, do you think that in today’s world your views are influenced by what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s2181">I – I don’t think the world is thinking about Jews at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: Do you think the world has learned any lessons from the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: I think the Jews didn’t learn nothing, how can the – the – the others learn?</span> <span id="s2184">By my grandchildren asking me, Saba, do you think in America can happen that’s what happen in Germany?</span> <span id="s2185">I said, of course.</span> <span id="s2186">What?</span> <span id="s2187">I said, of course, there no question about it.</span> <span id="s2188">And this will [indecipherable] shouldn’t happen.</span> <span id="s2189">I think just in America will this happen.</span> <span id="s2190">Never, Saba.</span> <span id="s2191">Here you got so many, we got Jews, we got blacks, we got Ukrainians, you got the Polacks, you got Germans.</span> <span id="s2192">I said, they all the same goy.</span> <span id="s2193">The Jews are different.</span> <span id="s2194">Since [indecipherable] until today, we are different.</span> <span id="s2195">And they see us as difference.</span> <span id="s2196">Secondly, they see the Jews all rich.</span> <span id="s2197">Go to work and see how many hundreds have no – no – no food in the house.</span> <span id="s2198">Th – somebody [indecipherable] over there?</span> <span id="s2199">Tell me Saba.</span> <span id="s2200">Saba, the Jews are not poor.</span> <span id="s2201">My grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2202">So what I have to say, huh?</span> <span id="s2203">What do I have to s – what do I have to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: When you looked at – look at the picture in today’s news about Kosovo and you see refugees, does it bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: [indecipherable] bothers me very much those people had something like that.</span> <span id="s2206">And I don’t think so the president of ours should do something like that.</span> <span id="s2207">First of all, they [indecipherable] have the Americans and the Jews in the World War II.</span> <span id="s2208">And they the same Christian like the Americans.</span> <span id="s2209">Our president is a Arab, excuse me for the expression.</span> <span id="s2210">He does – he does everything what good for Arabs.</span> <span id="s2211">He press Israel because the Arabs.</span> <span id="s2212">His wife is pro-Arabic, everybody knows that.</span> <span id="s2213">He is the same thing.</span> <span id="s2214">He thinks he’s a smart man, he got a brains because God give him a chance that the business is good, e-everything works for him like even if we do something wrong.</span> <span id="s2215">Then secondly, look, we got 67 percent Americans, and even Jews 67 percent who voted for him.</span> <span id="s2216">I vote for him too, because I didn’t like the way Bush – Bush’s way with the handling in the Middle East.</span> <span id="s2217">But I can’t understand after such a wars – after the second war, Vietnam, Korea, all over the world, people should be so left-handed for the President Clinton.</span> <span id="s2218">I see what’s going on, I – I – I’m shocked.</span> <span id="s2219">I’m shocked.</span> <span id="s2220">In Israel the same thing [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: You were making a distinction about what you did in the partisans did and what other people did.</span> <span id="s2222">Why do you think you were the type that had the ability to fight back and the strength and the courage?</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">A: Other people had [indecipherable] but they didn't have the courage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: Why did you have the courage?</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: I don’t know, I wasn’t afraid.</span> <span id="s2226">It’s not just I wasn’t afraid, m-my love to my father, I think, to my family was so great, that I felt when I go to do something, to destroy something, I had a feeling that my father is holding his head – his hand on my head, and he’s telling me how to turn.</span> <span id="s2227">Serious.</span> <span id="s2228">And I used to say, maybe this is the reason.</span> <span id="s2229">In Germany, in Berlin, I had a bullet in – in my casket.</span> <span id="s2230">So I said [indecipherable] all the years I wanted to be tall like my brother, and I am a short man like my savta.</span> <span id="s2231">See, if I will be tall, I would be killed.</span> <span id="s2232">So I should be tall – short and happy.</span> <span id="s2233">So – so there’s the answer, what can you say?</span> <span id="s2234">I’m right, you see.</span> <span id="s2235">So you see, there is no answer to many questions, like m-my – my kinder will – will ask me, Aba, how can you be religious when you saw everything what’s happen?</span> <span id="s2236">I said to her, look, I became religious 20 years ago when I saw you and your children don’t go to shul and don’t eat kosher and you don’t watch Shabbas, and this way my other daughter, look – look – look the different.</span> <span id="s2237">Look – look your sister.</span> <span id="s2238">Friday night to shul, the children sitting with father, Shabbas – Shabbas [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2239">She has nothing to say, but she always say, how could God do something like that to my grandfather?</span> <span id="s2240">You’re telling your father was such a special man.</span> <span id="s2241">I said, well maybe everybody said that his father was a special, but I know my father was a special, because if he had to learn something from mathematics or [indecipherable], everybody come to my house.</span> <span id="s2242">I didn't go to – to – to somebody’s house.</span> <span id="s2243">So it’s a fact that my father was smart, right?</span> <span id="s2244">Hm, Aba, you got – you got s – you got something here.</span> <span id="s2245">Look, look my grandchildren, look, I tell her.</span> <span id="s2246">She said, you’re right.</span> <span id="s2247">My grandchildren learning, i-it’s some – it’s no-nothing in the world is hard for them.</span> <span id="s2248">See what it – what it means?</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q: Is there anything else you wanted to add that we haven’t talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: I – I – I would ask – I would add that you are a great lady.</span> <span id="s2251">If you can come today and do it, otherwise I wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s2252">So I would very proud that we will meet some other time and we’ll enjoy in really good times and say hey, we got better years, better times and we – we should have shalom in Israel, and you shouldn’t have to do something like that, do something, better things.</span> <span id="s2253">Nice to meet you, it’s a pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: That
