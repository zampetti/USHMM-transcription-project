1901, in Frankenau, Hesse, near Kassel.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Did you grow up in Frankenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s6">I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: What type of business was your father in?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: My father was a merchant, had hardware and material for building, building</span></p> <p><span id="s9">material.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Did you go to school in Frankenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Can you tell me a little about your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Well, I went to a regular Jewish school; we had our own school with a Jewish teacher.</span> <span id="s14">It was very small—maybe 20 people so we had a lot to do.</span> <span id="s15">The teacher watched us very closely.</span> <span id="s16">Most people went on to a Gymnasium but my father had eight children—he couldn’t send them all to the Gymnasium so he sent his oldest son to Marburg.</span> <span id="s17">My brother lived here until he passed away a few years ago.</span> <span id="s18">I myself had to stay in that school until I was ready—he sent me away, my father, to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s19">So I went to Hildesheim and learned the textile trade.</span> <span id="s20">I was there for four years and from there I went to different places; always in the textile line and I got nice jobs.</span> <span id="s21">The last one, I was manager of a store in the Rhineland in Westphalen for 12 years and then I married and I moved to Thuringen.</span> <span id="s22">I met my wife through my business, buying, I was buying goods in a big concern and the parents of my wife used to belong to the same concern.</span> <span id="s23">My wife happened to be there with her mother and we met there and then after a time, we married and I became a partner of that store.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Let me just go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s25">You mentioned that you were an apprentice in the textile line.</span> <span id="s26">What made you decide to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I thought I would make a good living in textiles and I liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: While you were in this line, were most of your customers Jewish or non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: While you were in school and during your early years as an apprentice, did you feel well accepted as a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s32">I had no trouble until later.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: You moved to Thuringen after you met your wife.</span> <span id="s34">How did things change for you after Hitler came to power in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Little by little we started to feel it.</span> <span id="s36">Certain customers didn’t come anymore.</span> <span id="s37">The business was in the hand of the family for over 90 years.</span> <span id="s38">They used to live in a little village and they got permission to move to Themar and open a store 90 years before.</span> <span id="s39">It was well known there and had a good reputation.</span> <span id="s40">We did a good business there and even in Hitler’s time, we did a good business, unfortunately because we would have left before that.</span> <span id="s41">Once, as a matter of fact, they put a sign up in front of the business kauf nich bei Juden (don’t buy by Jews) and I went to Weimar, to the Nazi government in Weimar, to complain and they took it off for a few weeks and then they started again.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: I think in 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Between 1933 and 1937, 8, did you notice a marked difference in the customers’ reactions?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s46">Certain type people who worked for the government or worked for the city didn’t come anymore or they sent their maids to buy things from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What types of things did you sell?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: All kinds of textiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Mrs: Ready made things for children, for ladies and men.</span> <span id="s50">Also piece goods and upholstery fabrics, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: We had some trouble with the salesmen.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: The salesmen were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s54">And they were beginning to have trouble selling.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: When the business began to fall off, did you ever speak about emigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s57">We talked about it because some of my brothers and sisters left already.</span> <span id="s58">One of my sisters left in 1934 and we had no connection with America, with any people in America, other than one cousin of my mother whom we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s59">My older sister found the address and wrote to them and in 1934 they gave her an affidavit and then one sister let the others come, one after the other.</span> <span id="s60">And I was the last one.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: During the time 1933 – 1938, did you ever see Nazi parades in Themar?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes, plenty.</span> <span id="s63">Especially in the last year.</span> <span id="s64">There were some young people who marched through the town every day, every morning, in front of our business and were singing wen das Juden blut vum messer sprtizt (when Jewish blood from knives squirts).</span> <span id="s65">That we heard every morning and then we were afraid.</span> <span id="s66">We tried to get rid of our business.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: How did you try to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: From mouth to mouth.</span> <span id="s69">We told people – salesmen.</span> <span id="s70">We told them we want to sell our place—find somebody.</span> <span id="s71">We thought we had found somebody, we sold it and they guy was not too bad.</span> <span id="s72">He was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s73">He promised to pay us and we had an agreement.</span> <span id="s74">He had to have the permission and he put the money in the bank and we never got the money.</span> <span id="s75">In this agreement was a clause that we had to pay 10% to the Nazi government of our selling price.</span> <span id="s76">He deposited the price at a certain bank and when we came there, they said, “I’m sorry we can’t give you any money because it is already confiscated” (beschlagnamed).</span> <span id="s77">So we only got a little money so we could live.</span> <span id="s78">Then the order came that we had to move out of our apartment- it was on top of the store and we had to move to a little apartment in the back and there we waited for our emigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Were you satisfied with the deal?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: We got very little but it didn’t matter because we didn’t get it anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: When you say the money was confiscated, in general, if one had a bank account, was this already a sperrkonto (money was confiscated).</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s83">I haven’t heard that expression in years and years.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Who gave you this money on which you were supposed to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: The bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Until 1938, were you afraid of physical violence?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: The last year, yes.</span> <span id="s88">Not before.</span> <span id="s89">It was a little town-Themar in Thuringen and we knew everybody.</span> <span id="s90">Our family had been there for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Mrs: I grew up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Some children, some rowdies, were not too nice.</span> <span id="s93">Otherwise, we had no trouble until Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s94">They didn’t burn the synagogue because they couldn’t.</span> <span id="s95">Otherwise the whole neighborhood would have burned down.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: You mentioned that it was a small town and you knew most of the people there and had known them for many years.</span> <span id="s97">Did you notice a change in their attitude towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Mrs: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Mrs: They looked away.</span> <span id="s101">We had three stores.</span> <span id="s102">One store we sold years before and then the second store we sold in 1938.</span> <span id="s103">My father died in 1933 and he was wounded in the first World War so they had a little respect.</span> <span id="s104">I mean we were very well known all over.</span> <span id="s105">Our daughter was born in 1935 and my mother was always in business and I was handling the one store in Hindburghaus and I gave it up and I came back to the main store.</span> <span id="s106">Then after we sold the business, my daughter was a few years old and all the employees were crazy about the child, so my mother went one day with my daughter for a walk.</span> <span id="s107">So she saw a former employee who was always very friendly and good and she knitted things for my daughter and her sister had been with us for maybe 15 years.</span> <span id="s108">Anyhow, she passed my mother and didn’t say hello so my daughter said, “Grandma, wasn’t that Friedel?”</span> <span id="s109">My mother said yes.</span> <span id="s110">“But Grandma, she didn’t say hello to us.</span> <span id="s111">Why didn’t she say hello?”</span> <span id="s112">So my mother said because we are Jews.</span> <span id="s113">My daughter said “what were we before?”</span> <span id="s114">Three years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Did you feel that Hitler wouldn’t last long?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Mrs: We thought so.</span> <span id="s117">We thought that in the beginning because it was a very established place and it was so long in the family and the people said, “Oh, we have nothing against you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: You know there were 60 million Germans—everybody said, “we don’t mean you…you are alright.”</span> <span id="s119">But they meant us.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Did you belong to a congregation in Themar?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s122">We had a congregation and we had a Jewish teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Was there ever any conversation either by the Rabbi from the pulpit or amongst your Jewish friends about what should we do or how should we handle this?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Mrs: It was—there were many people who were there and were long established there and we always said let him come to power first, then we’ll see how long it will last.</span> <span id="s125">But then it was too late.</span> <span id="s126">Some people, the young ones got out like us—we were lucky but I lost my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Did you see signs Juden Unerswuenscht (Jews not wanted) or Juden verboten</span></p> <p><span id="s128">(Jews forbidden)?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: How did you manage to go shopping?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Mrs: Until 1938, everything was alright but after everything was sold, we had to move into this apartment in the back.</span> <span id="s132">My husband left in 1939 for England and my mother, my daughter and myself were still in this town so we decided that we couldn’t stay there so we arranged to move to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Before we come to that, how close to Kristallnacht did you sell the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Mrs: It was in the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s135">The Kristallnacht was the 9th of November and there was a big sign in the window of our store geschlossen fur ubernahmen (closed for takeover) and that sign really saved the store.</span> <span id="s136">We didn’t really own it anymore, it was in transfer.</span> <span id="s137">But they took my husband during the night to the concentration</span></p> <p><span id="s138">camp and from that time on, it was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: During that night, when they came to your door, it must have been a very</span></p> <p><span id="s140">frightening experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Mrs: I had my nightgown on and my daughter on my arm.</span> <span id="s142">And my mother was yelling out “Help!</span> <span id="s143">Help!</span> <span id="s144">Help!”</span> <span id="s145">It was on the Marktplatz (market place).</span> <span id="s146">We didn’t know what it was—we thought it was just against us.</span> <span id="s147">We didn’t know it was for all the Jews.</span> <span id="s148">But then we saw—then a few other Jewish women came to us and told us they took all the men.</span> <span id="s149">They took from 13 years to 85 years—they took</span></p> <p><span id="s150">them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: When they picked me up that night, certain things you never forget.</span> <span id="s152">My mother- in-law said to my wife “hald einmal das kind” (hold one time the child) and the next day, when I was gone, our little girl told everybody, “you know my father said wir behalten das kind” (we kept the child) She didn’t understand that.</span> <span id="s153">They took me away and I was in Buchenwald a short time only—thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: On that night, how did you protect your daughter?</span> <span id="s155">What did you say to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Mrs: It was so frightening.</span> <span id="s157">I don’t know exactly what I said.</span> <span id="s158">One thing we used to do—we never had a bed next to a window, never.</span> <span id="s159">We were always afraid somebody would throw a stone.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: When you were in the street, did people insult or say things to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Mrs: They looked away.</span> <span id="s162">Some were ashamed, some felt terrible and some were very friendly.</span> <span id="s163">For instance, we picked up the mail in the post office so some friends would also pick up the mail and they would pretend to be reading a paper and they would tell us something.</span> <span id="s164">We had another store next to us and when she wanted to talk to us, she would call the cat—the name of the cat—and my mother would know that one of us should go and find out what she wanted to tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Did anyone warn you about Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Mrs: There were always the newspapers where there were articles like the Voelkisher Beobachter and the Sturmer—there were local papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: A neighborhood paper.</span> <span id="s169">I was in there once.</span> <span id="s170">They put me in too: Arthur Plaut; fresh importier (imported) von Kastrup –type polizei (police) president Isadore</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Weiss.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Mrs: He was from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I was that type they said.</span> <span id="s174">Before Hitler, there was a Jewish police president in Berlin—Weiss.</span> <span id="s175">So they called me Isadore Weiss.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: What was the intent of calling you Isadore Weiss?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: That people should know that I’m a Jew—what kind of guy I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: On Kristallnacht, when they took you, did they give you any explanation?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: No.</span> <span id="s180">They told me.</span> <span id="s181">They put us in a local prison—all of the men including the boys and they didn’t tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What was the mood of the men in the prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Afraid—for their lives.</span> <span id="s184">One guy, an elderly guy who didn’t know—he was senile—he kept saying, “what are you doing to me?</span> <span id="s185">Get away from me.”</span> <span id="s186">And we sort of kept him down because we were afraid that we would be in trouble.</span> <span id="s187">Otherwise, we kept quiet and the next day they took us out on the market place—all of us and hundreds of people—all of our former friends—were looking at us.</span> <span id="s188">In their hearts, they were anti-Semites anyway.</span> <span id="s189">Employees that we did business with for years, always very friendly, they were the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Mrs: And they owed us a lot of money, some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: They got rid of us and they didn’t have to pay us.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: While all this was going on at the market place, it’s hard to ask what thought were running through your mind 40 years later but it must have felt terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: To be honest, I didn’t think I was coming back.</span> <span id="s194">I felt like if you are on the street and there is a hole and you fall into it and there is no end to it—like a bottomless feeling.</span> <span id="s195">I was nothing anymore—everything was gone.</span> <span id="s196">And then we came to Buchenwald and the reception wasn’t too nice.</span> <span id="s197">They were hitting and I tried to be in the center—nothing happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: From the night they picked you up through the next day on the market place, were they local Nazis who were guarding you?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Was there anybody who you knew personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s202">We knew everybody in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Didn’t anybody say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: No.</span> <span id="s205">We knew they wanted to get rid of us and we were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: How did you get to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Mrs: They put them all in a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: You said that the reception was not so nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s210">They hit many people.</span> <span id="s211">I was lucky, I kept in the center.</span> <span id="s212">The outside people got hit but nothing happened to me.</span> <span id="s213">Then we were eingetrachen (inducted).</span> <span id="s214">They gave me a uniform—striped uniform, and I saw one of my brothers there.</span> <span id="s215">That night, people walked around—is there anybody from Frankfurt, is there anybody from Frankenau?</span> <span id="s216">—that was my hometown and I said yes.</span> <span id="s217">And it was a gentile man—a bible vorscher (Jehovah’s Witness).</span> <span id="s218">He remembered me and he said don’t worry, I’ll see what I can do for you.</span> <span id="s219">He supplied me with underwear, which he stole from somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: What happened to your clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: They took them away and I got it back when I was released.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Where did you sleep that night and from then on?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: On boards, like bunkers without anything.</span> <span id="s224">It was an open barracks and it was very cold and this guy supplied me with stockings and things so I was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: What did they give you to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Soup.</span> <span id="s227">A kind of a soup, which was nothing.</span> <span id="s228">We didn’t get much.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: What was the daily routine like?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: We marched.</span> <span id="s231">One thing—I was thirsty and we collected the rainwater in our caps or hats and were drinking that.</span> <span id="s232">I haven’t talked about it.</span> <span id="s233">I wanted to forget about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: You said you marched.</span> <span id="s235">What else filled up your days there?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: We didn’t work.</span> <span id="s237">Some people—one department—had to work.</span> <span id="s238">They carried stones from one place to another and worked on the streets but fortunately I didn’t have to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Did they have something like a roll call—appell?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s241">Sometimes we had to stand for hours and hours.</span> <span id="s242">One man from our town, from Themar, he was sick, he had some trouble with his legs and couldn’t stand so we kept him, one of my friends and I, we stood on each side of him and we kept him up.</span> <span id="s243">Otherwise, they would have taken him away.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Were there men taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s246">They took people away—some people they just lost their nerves and they took them away and we never saw them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Was there barbed wire surrounding the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s249">And I heard people crying at night, yelling Help!</span> <span id="s250">Help!</span> <span id="s251">And then all of a sudden it stopped.</span> <span id="s252">The whole camp was surrounded by wire and towers with soldiers with guns who watched what was going on.</span> <span id="s253">But I was lucky; I was only there three weeks.</span> <span id="s254">I met a man, a Jewish man who was our accountant, and they let him go.</span> <span id="s255">So I asked him please do me a favor, go to Themar, see my wife and my mother-in-law and try to get me out of here.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: During the time you were in Buchenwald, were you able to contact your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: I sent one letter, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Mrs: I never got a letter.</span> <span id="s259">That’s the first time I know of a letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: When I tried to get out of Buchenwald through this man, through this Jewish accountant.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Mrs: We were in touch with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: He got in touch with my wife.</span> <span id="s263">But the commander of the camp sent a letter to the Burgemeister of our town, should we release Arthur Plaut because he claims he wants to finish his transactions for the takeover of his business.</span> <span id="s264">So the Burgemeister wrote back, lassen sie ihn ruich noch dort, er brauch noch tzimlich viel erholung.</span> <span id="s265">(Leave him there yet, he needs quite a lot of recovery.)</span> <span id="s266">He wanted to get rid of me.</span> <span id="s267">This guy used to be one of our customers and, in fact, owed us a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: This must have been a very shocking experience for all of you.</span> <span id="s269">What was the mood like among the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: We were depressed, most of us.</span> <span id="s271">Some young people, they kind of entertained each other and kept up their spirits but they elderly people were worried and depressed and didn’t know what had happened to them and they were just waiting to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Were there rumors around as to how one could get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s274">There were always rumors—President Roosevelt will help us to get out of here.</span> <span id="s275">President Roosevelt didn’t know a thing about it—maybe he knew.</span> <span id="s276">That helped us a little bit that somebody in foreign countries would know about us and would help us.</span> <span id="s277">One told the other but there was nothing behind it.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: What helped you to keep up your morale?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Just hope.</span> <span id="s280">And our families.</span> <span id="s281">One day we were very sick, most of the people in the camp.</span> <span id="s282">They gave us something to eat, which we couldn’t stomach and most of us were sick for two or three days, diarrheA:</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Speaking of that, what kind of bathroom facilities were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: None at all.</span> <span id="s285">None at all.</span> <span id="s286">If you want to know, there were some holes and some large cans (fassen).</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: What happened when the dysentery spread through the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: We were afraid we all would die because there were no doctors—I never saw a doctor but thank goodness, after two days or so, we got over that.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: That’s also a very humiliating kind…</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s291">You felt like animals, not human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: How did you finally get released?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Through my family.</span> <span id="s294">They told the people… Mrs: That accountant helped us and we told the officials that we wanted to finish with the transaction of the business and we needed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">So one day they called my name, a few times they called what I thought was my name but it wasn’t and I was running.</span> <span id="s296">Two and a half weeks I was there and they let me go but they told me to leave Germany as soon as I had taken care of my business.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: When they called your name or what you thought was your name, did you know that meant your release?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Everyday there were a few names, some names and one day they called the name Arthur Plaut and I ran there and it turned out to be a Plaut with a B, not with a P, another Arthur Plaut and I went home (laughs) if that’s what you call it.</span> <span id="s299">I went to my place and I was so disappointed.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Mrs: But when he was released, there were a few others from our town also.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Did they give you any instructions when they released you?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: They told me as soon as I finished my business matters, I should leave the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Did they tell you anything about not talking about what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s305">They told me not to talk about it and then they let me go and the release from Buchenwald (I still have it) and I had to report to the local police in Themar so that they could keep track of me… Mrs: And they shaved off all your hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s307">When I first came in after a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Did you not talk about Buchenwald when you came home?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Not in Germany.</span> <span id="s310">I kept my mouth shut.</span> <span id="s311">I didn’t want any trouble anymore.</span> <span id="s312">I only spoke about it openly when I came to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: They had intimidated you enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s315">I only told my close family, my wife and my mother-in-law and a few friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: I just want to ask your wife about what happened to her after you were taken away on Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s317">After the SS had come and taken your husband, what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Mrs: Well, we thought it was the end.</span> <span id="s319">We were hysterical because we didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s320">We thought it was only us because we were on the Marktplaz; the other Jewish people did not live close by.</span> <span id="s321">We lived above our store, which was on this Martplatz.</span> <span id="s322">But then, after my mother was yelling Help!</span> <span id="s323">Help!</span> <span id="s324">Help!</span> <span id="s325">Another Jewish woman came and said her husband was taken, too, and then we knew that they were all taken.</span> <span id="s326">We had all kinds of thoughts about how to help them get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Did you know where they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Mrs: Well, we knew they were in prison and the next day they came to the Marktplatz and you should have seen the people around and we saw them behind the curtain and we were all frightened.</span> <span id="s329">So this man who wanted to take over the business, he pressed us to take over and we said we can’t, we have to wait and then later, this Jewish accountant who used to live in Gotha and who was also in Buchenwald and then when he was released he called us right away and I met him—not in Themar but nearby.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: When the men were taken away from the Marktplatz did you know where they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Mrs: We really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s332">We guessed to a concentration camp and we had heard of Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Was that a word you were familiar with?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Mrs: Not familiar really.</span> <span id="s335">We only heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: What kinds of things did you do initially after your husband was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Mrs: Oh, because it was not only my husband, the next day I had a call from my mother-in-law, we should come to Frankenau, her husband was taken, and an uncle and a brother—a lot of people.</span> <span id="s338">We were besides ourselves and we tried to get out of Germany so I had a brother who was that time not home.</span> <span id="s339">He was in Frankfurt to learn a trade, Hachsharra, in order to emigrate and my brother did everything to transfer some money to Israel so that we all could go.</span> <span id="s340">My brother was in Frankfurt and he was fortunate—he kept on traveling all over—by train, by bus, walking and they didn’t get him.</span> <span id="s341">So when everything calmed down, we heard from him and one day, I met him with this accountant, not in Themar.</span> <span id="s342">When my brother came to our house in Themar and my husband was gone, he had to go also to the Burgermeister to say that he was there (angemelted registered).</span> <span id="s343">So my brother never wore a hat and when he came to the mayor’s office, he left his hat on and the Mayor asked him why he didn’t take his hat off.</span> <span id="s344">He said okay and he took his hat off and they all looked—he had hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: When this accountant called you, were you afraid to meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Mrs: No.</span> <span id="s347">I wanted to help my husband and I think we met in Erfurt and he said he would try to help me get Arthur out.</span> <span id="s348">In fact, he had made the contract for the store to sell.</span> <span id="s349">In the meantime, my brother had gone to Berlin to try to do whatever he could to get out of Germany and for us, too.</span> <span id="s350">We wanted to go to Israel, all of us, and we would have transferred whatever money was allowed.</span> <span id="s351">But nothing ever materialized.</span> <span id="s352">We got a number and that was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: When had you applied for a visa to come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Mrs: That was done as soon as the others got here.</span> <span id="s355">My mother-in-law then applied and another sister of my husband and us.</span> <span id="s356">I had no family here (in the US).</span> <span id="s357">My brother meantime couldn’t go to Israel but he got the permit to go to England.</span> <span id="s358">He left in January 1939, for England and then tried to let us come to England, too, and wait in England till we could go to AmericA: We had a number to come to America but it would take time.</span> <span id="s359">My brother left for England, I think it was February, and we said, “First the men, let the men go out first.”</span> <span id="s360">So my husband left in August 1939 for England.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: How was your brother able to get your husband to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Mrs: He got some papers for him and he was not allowed to work but his brother, who was in America, sent some money at the request of my brother—a guarantee of support for England.</span> <span id="s363">Then both men, my brother and my husband, looked to get us out, too—for help in a household—as a domestic and it didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Let me go back for a moment, when your husband first came back to Themar from Buchenwald, what kind of impression did you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Mrs: He lost a lot of weight and he looked without hair, you can imagine—now I am used to it—now I can laugh about it but we were all very excited.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I just wanted to add that you couldn’t live in Themar anymore, in that little town.</span> <span id="s367">You had to move to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Mrs: That was after you left for England.</span> <span id="s369">When my husband came home from Buchenwald, we tried everything—my brother moved also from Themar and we had to move into another apartment in the back of our house.</span> <span id="s370">Everything was settled, and the new owner moved in.</span> <span id="s371">The contract had said that he wouldn’t move into our apartment until we left Germany but he didn’t go by this—he did what he wanted and so we had to move out into this small back apartment.</span> <span id="s372">We couldn’t move anywhere else—who would take us?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: When you were released from Buchenwald, how did you get back to Themar?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: We were three fellows from Themar who came together—we took a train home.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Mrs: But you called from someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yes, I called to let them know that I’m out of the camp and on my way home.</span> <span id="s377">We went in a little, that I never forget, we went into a little gastwirtschaft—a little restaurant in a village and they were prepared for us.</span> <span id="s378">They had hundreds of rolls with sausage and cheese which you could buy if you had a little money and I never in my life had a better piece of bread than that night.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Did you get your clothes and your money back?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s381">I didn’t have much but they gave us back everything—my suit and my coat, and the little bit of money I had on me when I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: How did they receive you at this gastwirtschaft?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Nice.</span> <span id="s384">They had what you call rachmones (compassion) with us—they knew.</span> <span id="s385">And from there, we went home by train.</span> <span id="s386">I called from that place on the way home.</span> <span id="s387">And the first thing I did when I came home was I took a bath.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Mrs: But you know, we used to have cars and we had to sell the cars, too.</span> <span id="s389">There was a deadline by which time you couldn’t own a car anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: We had to see it and someone tried to swindle us out of the car.</span> <span id="s391">We had to go to the court and as a Jew, that time.</span> <span id="s392">We couldn’t get a Jewish lawyer, there was one in Gotha who was a rechtsconsular (someone to advise about rights)—he came to Themar.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: What made you decide to go to court over this?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Mrs: There was a deadline to sell the car—no Jew could have a car anymore so we had a car and there was one man coming from out of town and he said he wants the car for a certain price and he will tell us when he will pick it up—let’s for instance say Tuesday, and he would let us know and pick up the car.</span> <span id="s395">We shouldn’t sell it.</span> <span id="s396">So, it was all right but we didn’t know the guy.</span> <span id="s397">The next day a young man from our town came who was not a Nazi and he said—he knew me since we had gone to school together—he would like the car.</span> <span id="s398">So Arthur and I sold the car but if the man doesn’t come by Wednesday, call us up and you come back.</span> <span id="s399">So the man didn’t come Wednesday and didn’t come Thursday and so we sold this man the car.</span> <span id="s400">Then, he came back that guy, and he sued us.</span> <span id="s401">He said we had no right to sell the car—he bought the car.</span> <span id="s402">We told him that he was supposed to be here on Wednesday and he said you’re a liar.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Were you afraid of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yes, we were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Mrs: So he took us to court.</span> <span id="s406">That was the first time we were in court.</span> <span id="s407">So we had no lawyer.</span> <span id="s408">There was one lawyer in Thurigen from Gotha so we told him the story and he didn’t…</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Let me interrupt a minute.</span> <span id="s410">While we were ordered to go to court, I got an ideA: I told a friend, a gentile friend, to please find something out about this fellow who wants to sue us—they call it in German eine auskunftei—information.</span> <span id="s411">The guy did and after three days he told me the guy was a gangster and if he could he would see the gravestone of his parents.</span> <span id="s412">So we went to court and he said he bought the car, don’t believe that Jew.</span> <span id="s413">Then I took my letter and gave it to the judge who knew us also and he didn’t say a word.</span> <span id="s414">When he read the letter, he said to the other guy, get out of here.</span> <span id="s415">Dismissed.</span> <span id="s416">Case dismissed, as they say in AmericA: So that was the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Mrs: We were lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: The guy said who believes a Jew?</span> <span id="s419">What a Jew says is not true.</span> <span id="s420">But the letter helped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: How did the judge act?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: He didn’t saw a word.</span> <span id="s423">He just said get out of there.</span> <span id="s424">The letter was written by a non-Jew, by a reliable firm.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Mrs: He was very well known like Dunn and Bradstreet: Schimmelphennig.</span> <span id="s426">It was very well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: When you came back from Buchenwald, were you anxious about what would happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yes, we were because we had no hold, we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s429">I didn’t know will we find a place somewhere else—in America or somewhere?</span> <span id="s430">We didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Your number wasn’t ready yet for America?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Mrs: We got in contact with our relatives in Argentina and all over and they sent papers but it didn’t help.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: What do you mean it didn’t help?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Mrs: They sent papers to help to get us out but it wasn’t enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: How did your brother get the guarantee to help your husband get to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Mrs: This was done through his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: My family in AmericA:</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: So your brother was in contact with your husband’s family in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Mrs: Yes.</span> <span id="s441">When my husband left in August 1939, he tried everything to get us out.</span> <span id="s442">We saw that we couldn’t stay in that small place anymore so we went to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: On the day you left Germany, for England, that must have been a very difficult day for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: I can’t describe that.</span> <span id="s445">One thing I know, when I went down the steps where the house was and the family for so many years, I took the mezuzah down.</span> <span id="s446">(cries)</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Did you leave by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A Yes.</span> <span id="s449">I went to France first, to Paris.</span> <span id="s450">My wife had a cousin there and I was there for one week and then I went to England and in England I had the reception from a few relatives over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Someone once told me they couldn’t watch Fiddler on the Roof because when the daughter leaves her family for Siberia, it was too painful for this woman to watch having gone through this herself.</span> <span id="s452">When you left, did you think you would ever see each other again?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: I still had hope.</span> <span id="s454">I was young and I had hope.</span> <span id="s455">I thought I could try to do everything that would get them out as soon as possible and when I went to England, I had my brother-in-law there—my wife’s brother and so we did everything.</span> <span id="s456">We went to the Blumsbery House every second day and I tried to get them out that way.</span> <span id="s457">I tried to write to my wife all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Mrs: The war had broken out and the mail had to come via all other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: The war broke out and then it was out—you couldn’t come anymore.</span> <span id="s460">Now how to get in touch with my family in Germany?</span> <span id="s461">So I wrote to Holland but Holland was taken over.</span> <span id="s462">So I wrote to Switzerland, Bulgaria—my wife had a girlfriend in BulgariA: I wrote to her and she sent the letter to Germany.</span> <span id="s463">That we had some contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: You did get the mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Mrs: Yes.</span> <span id="s466">In Berlin.</span> <span id="s467">We moved to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: On the day that your husband left, how did you protect your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Mrs: What can I say?</span> <span id="s470">She couldn’t leave with him—she was too small.</span> <span id="s471">He couldn’t care for her.</span> <span id="s472">So, the only thing is we moved to Berlin and I learned a trade there.</span> <span id="s473">She could go to the kindergarten.</span> <span id="s474">We could only get furnished rooms and my mother was with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: You left everything in Themar?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Mrs: Our lift was sent already—it was gone.</span> <span id="s477">It was sent to Holland.</span> <span id="s478">And the few things, which we had moved into the back apartment, we left there.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Who gave you the advice to move to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Mrs: Ourselves.</span> <span id="s481">We didn’t want.</span> <span id="s482">Look, you get up in the morning, you live in the back.</span> <span id="s483">Every morning, you know what we did, we were afraid then.</span> <span id="s484">We put some wooden boards at night on the windows where we slept so that in case somebody would throw a stone.</span> <span id="s485">So my mother said we can’t live like this, we can’t live like this.</span> <span id="s486">So I went to Berlin and found some accommodations and then we moved to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: How did you manage with money?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: My mother got some money and we got some money and to help people, we could send them some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: When you say you got some money… Mrs: The bank gave us some money—a set amount.</span> <span id="s490">And then in Berlin we went to the Luftschutzkellar (air raid shelter) and as I said my daughter went to the kindergarten.</span> <span id="s491">At least, there she had some Jewish people.</span> <span id="s492">In Themar, she wouldn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s493">And I learned a trade—I learned making corsets.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Where were you able to learn this?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Mrs: There was a school—a Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: How did you find out about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Mrs: That you find out.</span> <span id="s498">If I wouldn’t have gone to school—that prevented me from having to go to work.</span> <span id="s499">Jewish people had to go to work at a certain age and I was a young woman.</span> <span id="s500">So there came people from Frankfurt and all over and as long as I could manage, I stayed at that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Was it an organization, which ran the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Mrs: (To Arthur) Do you still have those papers, it’s in there?</span> <span id="s503">I’m not sure anymore.</span> <span id="s504">It was private and I paid for it.</span> <span id="s505">Then when my daughter was old enough, she went for three months to school—Jewish public school.</span> <span id="s506">She started in April and we got out in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Did you notice a difference between Nazi strength in Berlin?</span> <span id="s508">Did you feel safer in Berlin than in Themar?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Mrs: I tell you we felt safer because we didn’t know anybody—untergetauft (submerged).</span> <span id="s510">But you had to wear a Jewish star then.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: You didn’t wear it, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Mrs: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: When you came to Berlin did you register?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Mrs: Yes, we registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: When the rule came out that you had to wear a star, how did you get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Mrs: I’m mixed up now.</span> <span id="s517">I didn’t wear a star—it was my mother.</span> <span id="s518">I remember now, my daughter used to wear a Mogen David (star of David)—that’s what mixed me up.</span> <span id="s519">My mother and my daughter didn’t look Jewish at all—I had that big nose.</span> <span id="s520">So, they went shopping after the time.</span> <span id="s521">You could only go certain times.</span> <span id="s522">When we came here, my daughter would say “an dan I put my Mogen David nach innen”.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">(I put my Star of David inside)</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: When you went shopping during those times, were you free to buy anything you wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Mrs: Well, what you could get.</span> <span id="s526">You couldn’t get everything and you had the stamps, too, for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Was the money, which they gave you to live on a reasonable amount—could you make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Mrs: It was—but if you wanted to buy a coat or you needed something else, you had to write and try to get some more money released.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: You mean get permission?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Mrs: Yes, then they gave you a little more.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: What kept you going during that time in Berlin after your husband had left for England?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Mrs: Well, we were young and I had hopes of following him or going to the States.</span> <span id="s533">When the war broke out, I knew that was finished—England, so I got in touch with everybody in the United States and then I went to the Hilfverein (help organization) about the papers and then my family sent some money for the trip and my mother couldn’t make it—she had different papers.</span> <span id="s534">When I finally got the visa, we didn’t have any transportation.</span> <span id="s535">So I went to the Hilfverein again and they got us the transportation—we went over Portugal to the United States—my daughter and myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Did the Nazis make it difficult for you to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Mrs: Well, we had to have a lot of documents.</span> <span id="s538">You had to have your taxes paid, and the Jewish abgabe (what the Jews had to give up to the Germans) and all kinds of things which we did before we left our hometown.</span> <span id="s539">And the silver and everything, we had to give away.</span> <span id="s540">There was nothing left, everything that we had in the way of silver or gold, we had to give away.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Did you have to clear it with Themar that you paid everything before they gave you the papers in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Mrs: Yes, we had to show it.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I still have it—the President of the Jewish congregation had to give me a paper that I paid my Jewish kultus-steuern (taxes) and, of course, the Juden abgaben.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Mrs: They wouldn’t let you go out without paying for everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: During this time, were you still able to keep contact with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Mrs: Still though the same way—Holland, Switzerland, Bulgaria and the United States.</span> <span id="s547">In the meantime, my in-laws came here and his sisters and brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: On the day you left Berlin, you… Mrs: On the day I left Berlin, I left my mother behind.</span> <span id="s549">And that same day, it came out that no one over 45 could leave the country—that same day.</span> <span id="s550">We were all collected in one room and then we were taken to the Luftschutzkellar and…</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Luftschutkellar is for air raid?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Mrs: Yes, but it was a sammelplatz (gathering place) and then we came in a wagon, a train and the train was closed and kein fenster darf auf gemacht sein (no window is allowed to be open) and the shades were all drawn until we came out of Germany.</span> <span id="s553">Then we could open the windows.</span> <span id="s554">Then we came through Spain and they had nothing in Spain—they were so poor.</span> <span id="s555">Then Portugal.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Who arranged this transportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Mrs: That was the Hilfsverein but we paid for it.</span> <span id="s558">This warein zugdas waren die ganzen leute—our visa would have expired maybe three weeks later.</span> <span id="s559">So we were two weeks in Lisbon and then we came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: The arrangement to come from Lisbon to the United States was also done?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Mrs: By the Hilfsverein.</span> <span id="s562">The money was sent and they arranged it.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: What did you do for money along the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Mrs: On the boat we got food but on the train, we got our first meal on the border in Portugal.</span> <span id="s565">We took some food along from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Was it hard for your daughter to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Mrs: My daughter was heartbroken to leave my mother behind.</span> <span id="s568">(cries-we had to stop for a few minutes)</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: When you first came to the United States, who met you at the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Mrs: Cousins, an aunt, a few people.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: You mentioned that the food on the boat was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Mrs: We were in the zwichendeck.</span> <span id="s573">About two hundred people slept in this one place—men and women—all strangers.</span> <span id="s574">And so many people got seasick.</span> <span id="s575">My daughter and myself, we were not one day seasick.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: The war was on—this was an army-type boat.</span> <span id="s577">It doesn’t sound like a luxury liner.</span> <span id="s578">(laughs) Mrs: It was a Portuguese ship and umgoteswillen (Oh my G-d), no luxury (laughs).</span> <span id="s579">There were a few people that I knew who had first class accommodation—I don’t know why they got it.</span> <span id="s580">And some stewardesses, they gave me always something for my daughter—some fruit.</span> <span id="s581">But not those people from first class who I knew—our people.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Just to go back for a moment, when you got the visa, did the Hilfsverein give you any alternatives as far as leaving and how to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Mrs: Well, when you had your visa, you run and you go where you can get the fare.</span> <span id="s584">And I had the money there.</span> <span id="s585">We had to wait and I pestered them every week and I called and so when I had the visa—before I couldn’t do anything—but then I did everything.</span> <span id="s586">If I would have been a week later, I would have been stranded in Portugal.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s588">PAGE 4</span></p></body></html>
