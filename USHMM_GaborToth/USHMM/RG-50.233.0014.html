family, anything that you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">The only thing I remember, I was a happy child, I had a very good life.</span> <span id="s22">My father was not too rich but wealthy and I had everything what I needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">What was your father's occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">He had a store, a textile store.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">And where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">My first elementary school was in Janina.</span> <span id="s27">As I said it was a city with 30,000 people an hour from Preveza and I was in a French school, Alliance Israelite Universelle.</span> <span id="s28">And afterwards when I finished that I came back to Preveza and I continued high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">The elementary school, so then it was an all Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Did you study Jewish subjects there also?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">I studied French, Greek, and Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">And history and all the other subjects as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Was there a Zionist orientation from this school?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">I don't think so, I don't know.</span> <span id="s37">But the only thing is that all the children in this school, they are very good educated in Hebrew language.</span> <span id="s38">We don't speak, but we read-we learn everything about the holidays and we kept we had a good 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Well, was this a large Jewish community?</span> <span id="s40">What do you remember about the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">From my city or Janina?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">From your city.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">My city, it was a very small community, about 300 people.</span> <span id="s44">But Janina has 3000.</span> <span id="s45">And that where I stay my elementary school, and after that I came back to Preveza and I continued in high school but it was not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Well what was your home life like?</span> <span id="s47">Could you tell me about your brothers and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Normal family life.</span> <span id="s49">No excitement.</span> <span id="s50">I said, small city and you can't do crazy things there but it was very... it was very normal, easy life, easy life really.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Did you live in a house or an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">In a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">What was your house like?</span> <span id="s54">Was it large?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Five children, can you imagine if it was large?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Well, either all five children lived in one room .</span> <span id="s57">.</span> <span id="s58">your bedrooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">No, not that.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Is there anything you can describe to me, about what did it look like?</span> <span id="s61">I assume it was very beautiful there.</span> <span id="s62">Greece is a beautiful country.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">It is a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s64">But I said, the Jewish community in my city, it was very small.</span> <span id="s65">But still we kept the holidays.</span> <span id="s66">We don't go every Saturday shul like we do here but we used to go Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashona, Pesach, and Sukkoth.</span> <span id="s67">The most important holidays we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">And the Sabbath, you kept the Sabbath?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">We kept the Sabbath not in shul, though, in the house.</span> <span id="s70">My mother 31 cook supper.</span> <span id="s71">32.</span> <span id="s72">She would prepare everything from Friday.</span> <span id="s73">That's why, I still do that.</span> <span id="s74">Friday is the cooking and cleaning day.</span> <span id="s75">But Saturday is nothing.</span> <span id="s76">This we kept the day of rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">So your father didn't work on Saturday?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s79">In the beginning, no.</span> <span id="s80">In the beginning, no.</span> <span id="s81">But after a couple years because life was harder, everybody started to open the stores Saturday, so my father did too.</span> <span id="s82">But, in the house it was no work at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Could you tell me the names of your brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">And their ages?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Their ages?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Well, what approximate year they were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">I told you, my oldest was born in 1913.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Yeah, it was 1913.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">The other one...</span></p> <p><span id="s91">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Albert.</span> <span id="s93">Albert Amalbert(ph)41.</span> <span id="s94">41 three years later.</span> <span id="s95">Then it's me.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">The first one then was Moise.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Moise, Moise(ph)42.</span> <span id="s98">Then Albert, then third it's me, my sister...</span></p> <p><span id="s99">What is her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Rachel, Rachel.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">And then my youngest brother, Joseph.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">And did you all have the same schooling?</span> <span id="s103">Did they all attend the Alliance school?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">No, not in Greece because they are too young to go there.</span> <span id="s105">46 then it was in Italy, the oldest one.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">The oldest one went to study in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Italy, yes.</span> <span id="s108">He left nine years old, he went in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Oh so he spent all his high school...</span></p> <p><span id="s110">When he came back, he didn't need to go to school here in my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Was he in Naples, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Yes, Naples.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">In a Jewish school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">No.</span> <span id="s115">Convito Nazionale Vittorio Emmanuele So, a public institution?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Yes.</span> <span id="s117">But, he would sleep over there.</span> <span id="s118">My grandmother was living in Italy at this time in Naples.</span> <span id="s119">But she goes to visit him every week, every Saturday or Sunday, I don't know, but he stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">But he ultimately came back to Greece?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Yes, when he finished school he came back to Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">And what did he do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">He was working as a--not secretary, what can I say--he kept the books from one electric company.</span> <span id="s124">Account.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">And how about Albert?</span> <span id="s126">He was working also?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">He was working with my father in the store, Albert.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">And Rachel, was she still in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Now, could you tell me, did you have any hobbies or interests as a child that you liked to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Oh I don't know--artistic things or music, did you play--?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">I used to play my little mandolin(ph)59 but when the war came, I forgot about everything else.</span> <span id="s134">I would only read a lot, knit and crochet, sewing...these things I used to do and because this is things I can do in the house.</span> <span id="s135">My father didn't believe the girls to go work outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Yeah, they have to stay in the house, so these things I used to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">What about getting together with friends, did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Yes, a lot, a lot with friends, almost every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">We used to go to their house, they used to come to my home, we used to go walks outside.</span> <span id="s142">That's all, but not in parties and things like that like here.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">No, no, not like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Was this boys and girls or just girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">We were mixed with friends of my brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Did you have friends who weren't Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Yes, I say that because there were not a lot of Jewish people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Right, so...?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Two.</span> <span id="s153">Two Jewish girls and the others were gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">What was that like?</span> <span id="s155">Did you experience any anti-semitism as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">No, no, none at all.</span> <span id="s157">They were very friendly and very helpful and everything.</span> <span id="s158">No I didn't, that's true.</span> <span id="s159">I don't know the Greeks they didn't show anti-semitism before the war.</span> <span id="s160">This happened after.</span> <span id="s161">This happened after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">So you said you liked to play the mandolin (ph)73 and you liked to read.</span> <span id="s163">What types of things, was it European literature in translation into Greek or was it Greek?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Greek, Greek books.</span> <span id="s165">We had no library there.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Classical Greek authors?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">That's right.</span> <span id="s168">Only Greek, nothing else because I didn't speak fluent any other language and I'm not interested to read something I wouldn't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">But it wasn't like a famous author translated into Greek?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">No, we don't have any libraries over there to find the books we needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">So, it was a very small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Did you, at that time did you travel in any other places in Greece, had you been to other cities or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Only Janina and one time in Athens.</span> <span id="s175">I told you my father, he was very strict, what can I say, he didn't believe that the girls had to go far away from home.</span> <span id="s176">They had to stay home until they get married.</span> <span id="s177">But after the war, I went everywhere you can imagine here.</span> <span id="s178">Being in this country, I had more freedom.</span> <span id="s179">I went to California, Hawaii, Israel, east and west Europe, even Birkenau and Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">What about your mother, you haven't talked much about, what was your mother like?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">My mother comes from a big family, eight children, four boys and four girls, and she was the oldest.</span> <span id="s182">So, she used to help my grandmother work at home.</span> <span id="s183">She was a real housewife woman more than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Was she educated?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Not too much.</span> <span id="s186">You know those years, the woman they never had higher education.</span> <span id="s187">If they finished elementary school, it was a big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">But she could read?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s190">Even my grandmother, she used to read.</span> <span id="s191">Though she had cataract in her eyes she used to read the small little romance books, something like that, to pass the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">So your family comes from the Sephardic tradition?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s194">[WE HAVE DISCOVERED SINCE THE INTERVIEW THAT THIS IS NOT SO] Is there anything specific that you would like to tell me about that type of a life, were there observances that you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Well everything what they should do for holidays, Rosh Hashonah, Yom Kippur, Pesach, everything we did much better than here I can tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">You did have a synagogue in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s198">One, but it was enough for the people there really.</span> <span id="s199">Janina had more synagogues because there were more people.</span> <span id="s200">But the holidays they kept very good.</span> <span id="s201">When Rosh Hashonah, Yom Kippur came you feel the holiday, you felt that.</span> <span id="s202">Here you don't feel the Rosh Hashonah coming because nobody around shows.</span> <span id="s203">Only when I go to synagogue, then I know is holiday.</span> <span id="s204">Even Shabbot now.</span> <span id="s205">I feel only when I go to shul.</span> <span id="s206">I realize that.</span> <span id="s207">Here, I don't see nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Yeah, it's different.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">But still, after my husband passed away, almost every Saturday I am there.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Well, it's important.</span> <span id="s211">Were there any Jewish youth organizations in Greece?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Janina they had because there were more people over there but in Preveza, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">So you weren't involved in any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">There were not too many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Did you ever help your father in the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Well, yeah, once in a while but only if they need extra help, that's why I went, but not too much because there were two.</span> <span id="s217">My second brother and him, they manage very good.</span> <span id="s218">I told you there was not big city and the business is not so big so they didn't need extra help, but sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Was this town, is it near the water?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">It is?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Yes, swimming.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">So you went to the seashore all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Swimming all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">In the Aegean Sea, which sea is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Ionian Sea.</span> <span id="s227">No, I don't--it's Sagul (c.) 107 is a gulf, Amuzakikos Gulf, is a gulf it's not sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Is the Ionian Sea outside.</span> <span id="s230">But, this is a small gulf, Amozakikos Gulf.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Is that walking distance then to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s233">All over the city is walking distance because it is so small.</span> <span id="s234">But it was a very nice walk all through the city, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Was it mountainous in this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">No, not too much.Janina has mountains.</span> <span id="s237">Janina has a lot of mountains.</span> <span id="s238">Snow and cold in the wintertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s241">But Preveza, it has humidity rather then cold, and a lot of rain.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Sort of a Mediterranean climate?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">What did the buildings look like?</span> <span id="s245">Did they have red clay roofs?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">How can I say these things?</span> <span id="s247">they put one on top of the other ones and till...</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Shingles?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">No, not shingles.</span> <span id="s250">I don't know how to call them in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">The clay, the red clay...</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Yeah, like clay, one the top of the other they put like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">And were the buildings white usually?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Most of them, most of them.</span> <span id="s255">You don't see dark like here.</span> <span id="s256">No, no, all paint.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">What about your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">My house, white.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">White house.</span> <span id="s260">Did you have any pets?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">One dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">You did.</span> <span id="s263">What was your dog's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Matzil.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Maztil?</span> <span id="s266">Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">I don't know how we got this name, Matzil, but he was over there when the Germans came to pick us up.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">So, you left him.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Couldn't take him with me, who can do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Matzil in Hebrew means to save, lahateel(ph)125.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Yeah, matzil is the word they use for a lifeguard in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">I didn't know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">So, maybe it had something to do with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">I don't know.</span> <span id="s276">My father and my mother, they call him Mathile (ph)127, I didn't ask where they got this name.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Okay.</span> <span id="s278">Now maybe, is there anything else you can remember about your childhood that you could tell me, about your schooling?</span> <span id="s279">What about your high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">My high school was in my hometown, in Preveza.</span> <span id="s281">That is where I finished the high school, there.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">So, it was an academic program like a regular high school?</span> <span id="s283">It wasn't a technical school?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">No, no, it's a regular normal high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Like a public high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Yes, but I think the public schools over there and the high schools especially were higher than here.</span> <span id="s287">They had more subjects and subjects like they have in first and second year of college.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Yeah, it's more intensive.</span> <span id="s289">Definitely.</span> <span id="s290">It was like a gymnasium, kind of?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Yeah, it was called a gymnasium over there.</span> <span id="s292">There, they don't call it high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Right, so it was a gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Yeah, but the last two classes, seventh and eighth, they had so hard subject.</span> <span id="s295">Like I said, first or second year of college.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Like physics...?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Physics, and mathematics, algebra, geometry, and everything else.</span> <span id="s298">But here I see nothing of that kind, no, only when you go to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Right, they like to play in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">That's alright, that's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Carefree.</span> <span id="s302">So, before the Nazis came did you have any knowledge or had you heard about the Nazis or anything that was going on in...</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Well, I thought they would be stuck over there in Germany and I didn't know they were going to start dispersing all over Europe little by little.</span> <span id="s304">We heard about Polish people but they used to say that Polish people they are a little harder to them.</span> <span id="s305">They didn't go along good.</span> <span id="s306">And the Polish they hate the Germans.</span> <span id="s307">So I said we are far away we don't have nothing to do with them.</span> <span id="s308">But we didn't realize that one day they were going to come to us; they planned to come to Greece too.</span> <span id="s309">We didn't realize that.</span> <span id="s310">And in the meantime, we didn't hear anything what happened over there.</span> <span id="s311">Everybody used to say, if they will take us to Germany, they are going to put us to work until the end of the war and then we will come back.</span> <span id="s312">I said alright, we'll go to work, fine, I don't care.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">So that's what they told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">So, do you remember when the Germans invaded Greece and came to your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Sure I remember that, my God!</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Could you tell me what it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">How can I explain when I saw the first soldier or the first officer with this dress?</span> <span id="s319">We're scared to death because we know what happened to Poland and the other countries after that.</span> <span id="s320">I thought something would happen to us too but it's nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s321">In the meantime they obliged us, all the Jewish people, to go every day, every morning, in the police and give our presence to say we are here...to be ready to pick us up any time they wanted.</span> <span id="s322">You understand?</span> <span id="s323">So we didn't have any choice and we couldn't escape in the mountains because small mountains were close to the city.</span> <span id="s324">But we had all the people in the house, my grandmother, my father was not so well, and we couldn't leave them and go the mountains.</span> <span id="s325">And they couldn't follow us over either.</span> <span id="s326">For myself I could have a job in the mountains and teach Greek to the village girls but how could leave my family and go there?</span> <span id="s327">You understand?</span> <span id="s328">It was terrible situation for us and for my parents too because they couldn't move so easy.</span> <span id="s329">And 175 my father says what happens will happen to all of us.</span> <span id="s330">So we accept our fate, all of us.</span> <span id="s331">Just to be together, so we could help each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">This was '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">What month?</span> <span id="s335">Was it in the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">No.</span> <span id="s337">I think it was the same time, March, something like that.</span> <span id="s338">And one year later exactly, they pick us up.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">So they had been occupying for a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Were your businesses open?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">They were and we were allowed to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Until the last moment, the last day.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Did they beat you in the streets or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">No, no.</span> <span id="s347">I forgot to tell you.</span> <span id="s348">Six months before we had...six months before we had the Italian occupation.</span> <span id="s349">You remember we had the Italian war then.</span> <span id="s350">When the Italians left, right away the Germans came.</span> <span id="s351">And they started restrictions.</span> <span id="s352">No Jews allowed to go out at nighttime and we had to wear the star of David in our arm.</span> <span id="s353">We don't have the right to go to movies.</span> <span id="s354">We don't have the right to go outside nighttime, everything like that.</span> <span id="s355">So I thought it was temporary.</span> <span id="s356">I said until we will be free and they go we have to accept this life, we couldn't do nothing else.</span> <span id="s357">In the meantime you couldn't talk to them, they had such a wild language nobody knew German to this time and you couldn't talk to them.</span> <span id="s358">But really they were mean, very mean.</span> <span id="s359">I remember, the worst part, they brought prostitutes in my home.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Yes.</span> <span id="s362">And my father and mother were so scared.</span> <span id="s363">Myself and my sister went to a friend's house, a gentile, to sleep this night because they didn't want us to be in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">You mean the Germans were sleeping in your homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">They came in our homes yes, but this time...</span></p> <p><span id="s366">And then they brought prostitutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">That's right, they did sleep nighttimes but in my home they brought the prostitutes for a night.</span> <span id="s368">But another house, they kept the whole house.</span> <span id="s369">They throw the people out and they stay in the house.</span> <span id="s370">Don't say what happened then.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">So you then couldn't imagine that they were going to deport you?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">No!</span> <span id="s373">The only thing bothers me why we were obliged every day to go to the police office and say that we are here.</span> <span id="s374">They know that we are not going anyplace, they knew that.</span> <span id="s375">See, the girls in this time and this city they are not so free to do whatever they wanted to do.</span> <span id="s376">Their lives were very closed.</span> <span id="s377">You had to go certain time and certain place.</span> <span id="s378">not too late, you know.</span> <span id="s379">With them, too different.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">When was it that they deported you?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">25th of March.</span> <span id="s382">I can't forget the day.</span> <span id="s383">25th of March, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">That was late in the war really.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Late in the war?</span> <span id="s386">I think we were the last country occupied from the Germans.</span> <span id="s387">213 We had so dark, we didn't know nothing what happened outside from our home.</span> <span id="s388">It's unbelievable, that.</span> <span id="s389">I remember we had a cousin in Athens who was more in touch with the situation that used to write to us.</span> <span id="s390">"Our cousin is very sick, we pretend 216 that the situation is so good.</span> <span id="s391">We have to try to take him somewhere to get well."</span> <span id="s392">These people in Athens they escape in the mountains, they hide with our friends and they were saved.</span> <span id="s393">But we couldn't do that because in my hometown there were so few Greek, or Jewish people and the people... (the city) was so small, everybody knew us.</span> <span id="s394">Wherever we go, they would recognize right away.</span> <span id="s395">But in Athens which was bigger city you could hide.</span> <span id="s396">Nobody know if you are Jewish or Gentile.</span> <span id="s397">In my hometown it was difficult to do that, that's why you couldn't hide.</span> <span id="s398">But for me it was so easy to go to a small village and teach Greek.</span> <span id="s399">So be busy over there and go far away from home.</span> <span id="s400">But I couldn't do that, I couldn't leave my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Can you tell me then what happened...when you were deported and where you were taken and what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Yes.</span> <span id="s403">I told you two, three o'clock in the morning, 1944, 25th of March, they knock on our door.</span> <span id="s404">Right away, I said to myself, "Oh, the Germans".</span> <span id="s405">And I realized that because I heard the walking in the streets, you know, the boots.</span> <span id="s406">I said to myself, the Germans.</span> <span id="s407">And in the meantime, no lights in the house.</span> <span id="s408">The lights went out.</span> <span id="s409">The Germans start to scream to get ready and pick up whatever you can, and go.</span> <span id="s410">No, we were so nervous.</span> <span id="s411">Can you imagine, from the sleep, sleep, wake like that.</span> <span id="s412">What can I take in the dark, no lights or nothing.</span> <span id="s413">So we took whatever we could.</span> <span id="s414">The only thing my father and my brothers, they took some money in case we need wherever we go.</span> <span id="s415">So, we went, they took us right away downtown near the city, port.</span> <span id="s416">They had already the cars over there already.</span> <span id="s417">One by one they put in the car.</span> <span id="s418">That's all.</span> <span id="s419">And who couldn't get in the car because of his age, they had to push him.</span> <span id="s420">So, they took us to 240 another city.</span> <span id="s421">We passed all the cities 241 to go to Athens.</span> <span id="s422">In every place we stop they pick up the Jews from there and they put in the cars.</span> <span id="s423">243 they concentrate all the Jews from these small cities and from Athens too, and from there they deport us to Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">In trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">In trains, in _________ trains, not passenger trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">So you were all taken to Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Yes.</span> <span id="s428">Were you together with your family at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Oh, all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">And how many days did it take to get to...</span></p> <p><span id="s431">It was eight, nine days, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Did you have food?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Food.</span> <span id="s434">They put us raisins, I remember.</span> <span id="s435">But we had some food with us.</span> <span id="s436">I don't know how, what.</span> <span id="s437">We kept 250 know nothing.</span> <span id="s438">And sleep it is out of question.</span> <span id="s439">One on the top of the other one.</span> <span id="s440">I was so happy when I arrive to Birkenau because I thought that at least we go someplace to wash ourselves, to take a little fresh air.</span> <span id="s441">Boy, what a disappointment when we arrive over there.</span> <span id="s442">Just down in the pavement where the train stopped, there were German officers.</span> <span id="s443">And they start, " Left, right, left, right, left, right".</span> <span id="s444">We don't know what this meant.</span> <span id="s445">We find out later what this means, "left, right".</span> <span id="s446">One is for concentration camp, and the other is for crematorium.</span> <span id="s447">We didn't know that.</span> <span id="s448">When we arrived over there, we find some Jews from Greece, from Salonica(ph)259, who went to Birkenau a year before us.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Yeah.</span> <span id="s451">My husband was a year before me there.</span> <span id="s452">So, we ask them, what happened to our parents, where they are?</span> <span id="s453">Oh, yes they say, they were so calm--forget about your parents, you look for yourself now.</span> <span id="s454">I couldn't believe that.</span> <span id="s455">I couldn't believe but he said to me, you will believe, when you will see the crematorium.</span> <span id="s456">One hour later, the flames from the crematorium are already up.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">What happened to your brothers at this time.</span> <span id="s458">Were they selected to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Yes, they put them to work, all three.</span> <span id="s460">They were young, they didn't keep people over 45 and under thirteen or something like that.</span> <span id="s461">All of them under and over went to the crematorium but my brothers were young and healthy and they could work.</span> <span id="s462">Look over here, this way.</span> <span id="s463">This one was eighteen, seventeen, I don't know how much he was.</span> <span id="s464">He was very strong boy and the other ones too, so they put them to work.</span> <span id="s465">But they had lousy job, that's why they went so fast.</span> <span id="s466">All of them, they worked in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s467">They put them there.</span> <span id="s468">And you know what the job was in the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">To unload the bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">No.</span> <span id="s471">To put them in the flames, in the oven.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Oh, they went to the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">That's right, they worked over there and the whole job is to put the people in the oven, put in the oven.</span> <span id="s474">After they kill them with the Zyklon B .</span> <span id="s475">They take the bodies and put over there.</span> <span id="s476">They had another commando, I can't remember the name, who took the gold teeth, who cut the hair and things like that, and then they put them in the oven.</span> <span id="s477">It was a terrible job to do that's why they couldn't stand a lot on the job, it was depressing.</span> <span id="s478">And my oldest brother, we used to have correspondence once in a while when he find people who work in Birkenau they used to send us sometimes packages from there and letters.</span> <span id="s479">And they used to say we have everything here but the job we are doing is terrible.</span> <span id="s480">Here are nice people that he knew from Greece and he had to put them in the oven.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">What did you do?</span> <span id="s482">What was your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">I was 286.</span> <span id="s484">I change a hundred jobs, not only one.</span> <span id="s485">The first one was dig ditches, make something like that.</span> <span id="s486">And I didn't know.</span> <span id="s487">I didn't know how to touch the shower.</span> <span id="s488">And all my hands were bruised 289 the German soldiers, they used to laugh because I didn't know to do the job.</span> <span id="s489">After that they changed me, they put me to work in other things, but not things that I can do as woman.</span> <span id="s490">Men's jobs.</span> <span id="s491">I worked almost until November.</span> <span id="s492">I got the job from March until November.</span> <span id="s493">After that we transfer to Ravensbruck and Malhoff 295.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Oh, you went to Ravensbruck?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Ravensbruck and Malhoff 296.</span> <span id="s496">Two more, the last two months.</span> <span id="s497">Over there, they put me work nighttime.</span> <span id="s498">Make caps for pistols.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">And it was terrible job too because I couldn't keep my eyes open the whole night.</span> <span id="s501">I was so terrified to hold that gun and things like that.</span> <span id="s502">And for what?</span> <span id="s503">to kill our people.</span> <span id="s504">That's it.</span> <span id="s505">That's.</span> <span id="s506">.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">When you were going through all these camps and everything, were you with other Greek Jews at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Girls.</span> <span id="s509">Yes, there was a bunch of girls with me, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">How did you communicate with the other prisoners or did you communicate with them at all?</span> <span id="s511">Because I assume--you knew French, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Yeah, but I didn't see any French people there.</span> <span id="s513">The only thing, you're not going to believe.</span> <span id="s514">I met over there in Birkenau, one girl from Poland who didn't speak Greek, who didn't speak French, who didn't speak nothing else besides Jewish and Polish which I don't know.</span> <span id="s515">First time in my life I heard Jewish language over there.</span> <span id="s516">In Greece nobody speak Jewish.</span> <span id="s517">Even the rabbi doesn't speak Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">[Yiddish] Right.</span> <span id="s519">It's an Ashkenazic language.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">That's right.</span> <span id="s521">We didn't know that.</span> <span id="s522">But this girl, we attached because we had bought the shovel and not come into ____, (c.315), not at all, got friendly.</span> <span id="s523">I mean, to--a little bit together, that's all.</span> <span id="s524">When I came back all of a sudden, I saw her here in Whitelock (c.316) Street with a child in her hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">In America?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Yeah.</span> <span id="s529">I didn't recognize in the beginning.</span> <span id="s530">First of all after so many years, everybody changed from 1945 'til '51, everybody changed.</span> <span id="s531">What is ____?</span> <span id="s532">(c.319).</span> <span id="s533">I thought my God, this girl I know but I couldn't find where I remember, from where.</span> <span id="s534">So I went to her and I said, excuse me do I know you?</span> <span id="s535">Were you in Birkenau?</span> <span id="s536">(c.322) Do you work in haus commando camp?</span> <span id="s537">She says to me yes.</span> <span id="s538">I didn't know her name.</span> <span id="s539">I don't even that.</span> <span id="s540">She says to me and I saw the number.</span> <span id="s541">It was much different than mine because she was in camp from '39.</span> <span id="s542">She had the good life, very early (c.325).</span> <span id="s543">So she said, yes I remember that.</span> <span id="s544">Did you work over there, yeah.</span> <span id="s545">Did you do this, yeah.</span> <span id="s546">Did you do that?</span> <span id="s547">Do you remember the Greek girl who couldn't talk?</span> <span id="s548">She says, no I don't.</span> <span id="s549">That's all right.</span> <span id="s550">But since then, we're friends here.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Oh, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">We see each other very often, really.</span> <span id="s553">She has two boys, the same age with my girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">But we were--how we could communicate all this time together?</span> <span id="s556">nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">That's what I was wondering because I know this was a problem and it was also a problem for a lot of the Italian Jews because they didn't know any other language.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">I didn't, I get in touch with Italians over there.</span> <span id="s559">It's so hard to communicate.</span> <span id="s560">You're not in the mood to communicate, nobody there.</span> <span id="s561">Just the Greeks who knew you and who go through the same way that you do now.</span> <span id="s562">But the only thing is, we didn't have any touch with other girls, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Were there any incidents or episodes that happened while you were in camp that stand out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s565">Something I never can forget.</span> <span id="s566">I told you my brothers were working in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s567">And it was just across from my block where I lived, was the block of the ladies but the men were on other side.</span> <span id="s568">So my brothers, I knew they work over there and I wanted to go see them one time.</span> <span id="s569">So they told me, you can do that something.</span> <span id="s570">Sunday, the blockova can help you to go one day when you don't work outside here.</span> <span id="s571">You are free, you can go see them.</span> <span id="s572">So I went to the blockova who was a Polish Jew.</span> <span id="s573">So I told her, listen, I said, I don't remember even the name.</span> <span id="s574">I heard my brothers are there.</span> <span id="s575">I would like to give me permission on Sunday; it's a day that we have rest, right, have rest.</span> <span id="s576">On Sunday, leave me one hour to go and see them.</span> <span id="s577">You know, what she did?</span> <span id="s578">She slapped my face because I asked her that.</span> <span id="s579">Since then, I hate the Polish people myself because they are so bad.</span> <span id="s580">She could do something, she could help me, right?</span> <span id="s581">But she didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">She was a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">She was a Jew, Polish Jew.</span> <span id="s584">But she was really bad.</span> <span id="s585">She wanted to be good with the Germans and she slapped my face.</span> <span id="s586">I was so mad, I was crying.</span> <span id="s587">I said, what can I do.</span> <span id="s588">I know my brothers are just across and I can go and see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">How did you ask her?</span> <span id="s590">Did you ask her in German, or---?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">I didn't know German.</span> <span id="s592">Nothing, just the way, you know.</span> <span id="s593">With the hands whatever I could do.</span> <span id="s594">Because I have somebody else from the camp, another Greek girl.</span> <span id="s595">She saw her husband, was working with my brothers.</span> <span id="s596">I said, if she can go, why not me?</span> <span id="s597">I don't take off from the job today, I have to work.</span> <span id="s598">But Sunday is my day of rest.</span> <span id="s599">I could go over there and visit my brothers.</span> <span id="s600">She says no.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Is there any other thing like that stand out that you had either witnessed or happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">The revolution that happened at the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">In Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Birkenau?</span> <span id="s606">You were there during the revolution?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Sure, it was a day that we had to go to work.</span> <span id="s608">This happened the two last days of Succoth.</span> <span id="s609">The Germans--every time they wanted to do some selections or bad thing, they find the holidays.</span> <span id="s610">So it was the last days of Succoth and I know that because the Hungarian girls were very religious people.</span> <span id="s611">I don't know how they went through, they passed books over at the crematorium, in the camp.</span> <span id="s612">They used to read and pray with the shovel in their hands.</span> <span id="s613">One had the shovel, the other had the book.</span> <span id="s614">Every time they saw the Germans, they hide the book.</span> <span id="s615">You are free and they took the book out and they read again.</span> <span id="s616">But this group was very religious and every holiday, the camp, they show--they tell us that this is Rosh Hashonah, Yom Kippur, something--holiday, you know.</span> <span id="s617">So we know that this was Succoth, the last days of Succoth where we go to work again the same way like every day.</span> <span id="s618">Six o'clock to five o'clock waiting outside for the appel, couple of hours rain or shine, cold or snow, never mind.</span> <span id="s619">After that, go outside from the camp with the music.</span> <span id="s620">It was seven o'clock, eight o'clock when outside at work, outside we hear bullets going here and there, here and there.</span> <span id="s621">We didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s622">We thought the Americans or the Russians came to liberate us.</span> <span id="s623">All of a sudden we heard this blochkova said, schnell (ph)(c.388), schnell in the block, schnell, schnell in the houses, to go back again we come.</span> <span id="s624">We didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s625">They rush us inside the block, they close the doors.</span> <span id="s626">Too quiet.</span> <span id="s627">In the meantime, the bullets were going left and right, left and right.</span> <span id="s628">I see the soldiers going around here and screaming but we didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s629">Finally when they stopped we find what happened.</span> <span id="s630">The boys in the crematorium cause a cross-fires.</span> <span id="s631">They find out that they supposed to be killed because the Germans, they knew, they did after five, six months when the people work in the crematorium, they were sick and tired, you know, and disgusted.</span> <span id="s632">They can't do the job straight the way they want.</span> <span id="s633">So they decide every five, six months, change them.</span> <span id="s634">Kill them and replace with new ones.</span> <span id="s635">The Germans used to replace the people who worked in the Sunderkommando after five or six months with new ones.</span> <span id="s636">So they knew that so they decide to do as much damage as they could because they knew they were dead anyway.</span> <span id="s637">The organization that they used to make over there that guard munitions, with guns, whatever they could do to damage.</span> <span id="s638">So when the time come and they call them to go over there, they jumped on these guards that they disarmed them and they took their arms.</span> <span id="s639">In the meantime, the Germans called for help.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">I'm just -------- papers.</span> <span id="s641">(c.411) The Germans called for a--help.</span> <span id="s642">Four, five hundred people came again, Germans, to give help with them.</span> <span id="s643">So it was impossible for the Greeks to win.</span> <span id="s644">They knew that.</span> <span id="s645">So said at least they're going to die last time free.</span> <span id="s646">They kill as much as they could but in the meantime the crematorium was down and all the people who were over there--that's where my brothers were with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">At the crematorium at the time?</span> <span id="s648">So were they part of the uprising, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Yeah.</span> <span id="s650">Sure, they're there.</span> <span id="s651">But what a use.</span> <span id="s652">It was two, three hundred people who working over there in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s653">All of them went at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Which brothers were these?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">All three.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">All three?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">All three were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">So you know that they were all working at the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">I knew because I told you, I find out... It was across the street, the crematorium, across from my block.</span> <span id="s660">In the afternoon, we used to eat outside.</span> <span id="s661">I used to see some one of them walking but it was not allowed to come close because of those electric wires.</span> <span id="s662">It wasn't allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">' What were your food conditions in Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Forget about that!</span> <span id="s665">Who thought of food?</span> <span id="s666">To get the soup in the morning, you had to fight and wait hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Can we stop for a minute, would that be okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Yeah, we can stop it.</span> <span id="s669">This is better.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Mrs. Carasso is going to read a written account that she wrote telling about the story in the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">In the crematorium worked a group which was called sonderkommando where just after ______(c.439 the people died in the gas chamber, to cut their hair, extract the gold teeth and put them in the oven.</span> <span id="s672">Terrible work but obliged to do it.</span> <span id="s673">Every five or six months, they killed them and replace with a new group with the same luck.</span> <span id="s674">___(c.444) September, last days of Succoth, we got up as usual at 4 a.m. and waiting outside in line until 6 a.m. until it gets light and go to work.</span> <span id="s675">I forgot to mention that every day, going and coming back from work, we had music playing for us.</span> <span id="s676">Also playing from prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">What kind of music?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Music--whole band, violin, cello, the whole band.</span> <span id="s679">Jewish people playing.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Was it classical music?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Different things, different things.</span> <span id="s682">But Jewish people playing, that's what's important, not Germans.</span> <span id="s683">That was an irony.</span> <span id="s684">Only that we needed, the music.</span> <span id="s685">We went to work as usually, out of the camp.</span> <span id="s686">We went and suddenly at 9 or 10 a.m., we heard bullets whizzing right and left and not too far from us.</span> <span id="s687">Soldiers running here and there with their dogs and guns, screaming and cursing.</span> <span id="s688">We didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s689">We start to laugh and cry and hope that the Allies were close and that was the reason of this turmoil.</span> <span id="s690">They called us to go back right away to the camp and they locked up in our block.</span> <span id="s691">We were ordered to be quiet.</span> <span id="s692">In the meantime, the bullets kept going left and right.</span> <span id="s693">This turmoil continued for couple more hours.</span> <span id="s694">We stuck our nose with anxiety, in the window, and we were waiting with anger (?)</span> <span id="s695">(c.480) and impatience to see some foreign soldiers, American or Russian to come there and open our doors to freedom.</span> <span id="s696">But that we dreamed day and night.</span> <span id="s697">But what disappointment.</span> <span id="s698">No Americans, no Russians showed up.</span> <span id="s699">Instead we had, it was a revolution in the crematorium, The prisoners, sunderkommando, killed themselves but also they killed all of the German soldiers who happened to be there this time by blowing up the building.</span> <span id="s700">They were there six months.</span> <span id="s701">They knew they would be killed in this place so they decide to take revenge and kill as many Germans as they could.</span> <span id="s702">And on this sunderkommando were working my three brothers and this was their end.</span> <span id="s703">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Thank you for reading that.</span> <span id="s705">So this was in 1944, still?</span> <span id="s706">In Succoth, 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">What happened after that?</span> <span id="s709">Now you were taken to Ravensbruck after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Yeah.</span> <span id="s711">November, they took us to.</span> <span id="s712">November.</span> <span id="s713">I don't know.</span> <span id="s714">They emptied the camp but they took us into the Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s715">Over there I had another job nighttime.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">That's when you were filling the ----?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Pistols, pistols, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Now in Auschwitz then, what did you do--?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">My husband was in Auschwitz, not me.</span> <span id="s720">I was Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Birkenau, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s722">That's right.</span> <span id="s723">What other job, you said you had a job digging out in the ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Yeah, digging was in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">The whole time, you were digging?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">The whole time, digging.</span> <span id="s727">Different kinds, not only digging.</span> <span id="s728">They used to make just a bit hard--take piece of stones--move from one place to another.</span> <span id="s729">Or pieces of the grass, move from one place to another.</span> <span id="s730">Just to be busy, you know.</span> <span id="s731">That's the worst part of every job.</span> <span id="s732">But the only thing we did and schnell, and schnell and schnell all the time.</span> <span id="s733">Fast, fast, fast.</span> <span id="s734">We had so much strength this time to do fast job like that but we had to, no choice.</span> <span id="s735">Not only--to Ravensbruck, they put us to nighttime.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">And in the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">No, nighttime.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">You only worked at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Nighttime.</span> <span id="s740">Did you sleep in the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">No, how we could sleep?</span> <span id="s742">They don't leave you quiet to sleep over there, my God.</span> <span id="s743">To catch a little sleep, we're praying to leave us alone.</span> <span id="s744">But it was really a very hard job and we were very disappointed because Germans were really cruel to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s745">You thought that they had something personal with us.</span> <span id="s746">I told you my brother that used to send me packages when I was in Birkenau only when transports came from the other cities when they came to Auschwitz, they brought stuff with them, colognes, dress things, food like we brought.</span> <span id="s747">So all of these they gave to these people who working in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s748">The people, they distribute between them--who had someone where to send in the camps, they did, but who didn't have it, did nothing.</span> <span id="s749">So my brothers they found a way to send one package sometimes.</span> <span id="s750">This was a big holiday for us because we knew my brothers were alive.</span> <span id="s751">But after this happened from the crematorium, that's it.</span> <span id="s752">After the revolution in the camp, no packages, no news, nothing from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Is there anything else from your time in the concentration camps that you can tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">About the revolution--the crematorium, I told you.</span> <span id="s755">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Then you were in Ravensbruck?</span> <span id="s757">and you were in one more?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Malhov, Malhov.</span> <span id="s759">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Is that a work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">It was a rest camp for sleeping the whole day.</span> <span id="s762">We didn't do nothing there.</span> <span id="s763">All day we were in bed, believe it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Did you get sick at any of these times?</span> <span id="s765">Did you catch anything, typhus or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s767">No, no.</span> <span id="s768">Just temporary.</span> <span id="s769">What are those, I don't know.</span> <span id="s770">One day, it's unbelievable but you're going to laugh, I was in Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s771">My feet were swollen from the sun.</span> <span id="s772">My eyes were swollen here too.</span> <span id="s773">They told me it's because I don't have enough vitamins.</span> <span id="s774">I said where am I going to get vitamins here?</span> <span id="s775">So they put me to the hospital for that.</span> <span id="s776">They didn't do nothing, they just let me lay in bed.</span> <span id="s777">I stay over there four days in the hospital.</span> <span id="s778">No special care, just relax at least.</span> <span id="s779">The last day, I'm supposed to return to my block, I dreamed of my mother, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s780">This never happened before.</span> <span id="s781">She said to me, don't worry, everything will be all right, I'm with you Don't worry, you'll be all right.</span> <span id="s782">Next day--I feel chills myself, one thing--because I never dream my mother over that, never.</span> <span id="s783">But this last day, she said don't worry, you'll be all right, you'll be all right.</span> <span id="s784">I'm with you.</span> <span id="s785">Next day they let me go to the camp again with the other girls.</span> <span id="s786">We stay over there till the day--to this day, 1944, we're supposed to transfer again.</span> <span id="s787">To Berlin, I don't know or where I don't know.</span> <span id="s788">So we got ready, we start to walk again, day and night time.</span> <span id="s789">May, but it was real cold over there, believe it or not, and we walking for two days.</span> <span id="s790">We stopped just for a while to get a rest and walk again.</span> <span id="s791">Food, forget what had.</span> <span id="s792">All of a sudden, after two days walking, the guards disappeared.</span> <span id="s793">We start to talk about how the Greeks were together, the only bit of--.</span> <span id="s794">Where we going now, where we going, don't know nothing, where to go here?</span> <span id="s795">Nobody, nobody to tell us what to do.</span> <span id="s796">So we just got a group of a couple of girls together.</span> <span id="s797">We start to see where the other people go, we go too.</span> <span id="s798">Because it was the only way.</span> <span id="s799">So we went to--.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Can I stop you, I want to flip the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Yeah.</span> <span id="s802">No language, no thing.</span> <span id="s803">We're walking to find out where all the people go, we go too.</span> <span id="s804">So in the meantime I met some cousins from Janina.</span> <span id="s805">We got all together then--some boys not only girls.</span> <span id="s806">We decide together to go here or there until we find a place.</span> <span id="s807">Finally one agent came and tried to concentrate all the Greeks in one place and we went with him.</span> <span id="s808">They put us in hotel--in a school, not hotel--in a school for one month.</span> <span id="s809">It was--I think it was this one--they put us in a school.</span> <span id="s810">And we have regular food over there and freedom to do or to go, wherever we want to go.</span> <span id="s811">I had a real terrific time then.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">This is after the liberation then?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Yeah, after.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Who--what month were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">May, 1945.</span> <span id="s816">In the street, I told you.</span> <span id="s817">We're walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Oh, you're just walking?</span> <span id="s819">I'm sorry, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">We're walking and the guards left us.</span> <span id="s821">That's why I didn't know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">I see, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">So when we met our--these people from Greece, men and more girls, we got all together, make a group and then decide to go all together to one place.</span> <span id="s824">So they concentrate us in this school over there all together.</span> <span id="s825">We stayed till they collect all the people around, it was almost five, six months, we stay there.</span> <span id="s826">In the meantime we had freedom to do everything we wanted to do.</span> <span id="s827">We went out nighttime.</span> <span id="s828">We went daytime, we're free!</span></p> <p><span id="s829">How did you get money or anything?</span> <span id="s830">You were there--were there societies, aid societies, Joint?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Not yet.</span> <span id="s832">Nobody reach us yet.</span> <span id="s833">But we managed somehow, I don't know how we managed.</span> <span id="s834">The boys were more capable ______(c.631) Where did the food come from then if it wasn't---?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">In school they give us food, in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">So you were at this school and they just took care of you?</span> <span id="s837">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Right, in school they gave us everything.</span> <span id="s839">Then the UNRRA, you heard the UNRRA?</span> <span id="s840">, they contact us.</span> <span id="s841">The doctors examine us and they gave us vitamins because everybody was short of vitamins.</span> <span id="s842">I didn't have my period all this time myself because the Germans they used to put something in the soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Yeah, we don't have any period.</span> <span id="s845">I didn't have any...</span></p> <p><span id="s846">The whole time in the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Yes.</span> <span id="s848">No, no.</span> <span id="s849">That's why they tried to treat us.</span> <span id="s850">But everybody was anxious to go home this time.</span> <span id="s851">Nobody want to stay there.</span> <span id="s852">No matter, if we didn't find nothing with house.</span> <span id="s853">So we stay in this school and after six months, September, they put us in a plane and send us back to Greece.</span> <span id="s854">Another disappointment, we're going back to Greece.</span> <span id="s855">No one, no one from the Joint was in port to wait for us.</span> <span id="s856">Nobody was over there.</span> <span id="s857">First night, be in Greece, myself, I slept on the pavements of the high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Yeah.</span> <span id="s860">Nobody was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Was anyone with you?</span> <span id="s862">All the people that were with you left and went back to try and find their families?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Everybody had somebody who come to pick them up from the plane.</span> <span id="s864">I had nobody because I was not from Athens myself.</span> <span id="s865">I was only with my sister, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Then you--when did you find your sister, _________?</span> <span id="s867">(c.645) After the liberation, we were separated for a short time but we got together soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Oh, so she went through the camp?</span> <span id="s869">I didn't realize that, okay Yeah.</span> <span id="s870">Going from Birkenau to Ravensbruck, they put us in plain--in small cars, small cars.</span> <span id="s871">Not cars like this, cars with the wheels with no cover.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Cold, like the things--it was outdoors?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Yeah, no cover, no nothing.</span> <span id="s874">Just the cars.</span> <span id="s875">We stay over there So we're going front myself in a car and my sister was going in another car, in the back.</span> <span id="s876">So we didn't pay attention.</span> <span id="s877">Her car fell in a ditch and I didn't see it.</span> <span id="s878">We continue ourselves, continue, continue.</span> <span id="s879">All of a sudden, I remember, where is my sister?</span> <span id="s880">where is my sister?</span> <span id="s881">I said.</span> <span id="s882">Nobody know because she stuck over there.</span> <span id="s883">I find my sister three months later--another surprise.</span> <span id="s884">All this time, I was crying, I was all the time with my sister and now the last time we're free, I lost her.</span> <span id="s885">I couldn't really say anything about that.</span> <span id="s886">So one day we were a group outside to eat.</span> <span id="s887">All of a sudden one of the women come to me.</span> <span id="s888">I didn't even know her.</span> <span id="s889">She came to me, says to me, she was from another camp, from a village, a little farther from the barracks where we stationed ourselves.</span> <span id="s890">She says to me, do you have a sister?</span> <span id="s891">I start to cry.</span> <span id="s892">I say I know I have a sister but I don't know where she is.</span> <span id="s893">She says to me, I know who she is.</span> <span id="s894">I didn't know this woman, never saw her in my life.</span> <span id="s895">I said, how do you know she is my sister?</span> <span id="s896">She says to me, you look alike.</span> <span id="s897">Believe it or not, we don't look alike, with my sister.</span> <span id="s898">I don't know then but now we don't look alike.</span> <span id="s899">She says to me, you look alike.</span> <span id="s900">I tell you where she is.</span> <span id="s901">She told me.</span> <span id="s902">I ask again.</span> <span id="s903">How do you know it's my sister?</span> <span id="s904">Your sister is in the next village here.</span> <span id="s905">How can I go myself?</span> <span id="s906">Do I know.</span> <span id="s907">So when we came to this camp over there, were some people from Yugoslavia, Jewish people, took care of the camp, Yugoslavian people.</span> <span id="s908">He took care of us, food, something to get dressed, things like that.</span> <span id="s909">This--his name was Melumed, Melumed (ph)(c.670).</span> <span id="s910">I said, Melumed said--you're not going to believe that.</span> <span id="s911">Somebody told me--he know the story that I lost my sister this way--somebody told me that my sister is in this village.</span> <span id="s912">How can I get there?</span> <span id="s913">He says to me, I just came from there, he says to me.</span> <span id="s914">How should I know?</span> <span id="s915">I didn't know them.</span> <span id="s916">So how can we go?</span> <span id="s917">how can do that?</span> <span id="s918">He says to me, don't worry.</span> <span id="s919">I'll try to find a way.</span> <span id="s920">He was the head of the camp.</span> <span id="s921">Next day, all of us saw him come with my sister.</span> <span id="s922">You don't believe how it felt when I saw her, at least I had somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">So the two of you came back to this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Yeah, came back together.</span> <span id="s925">Went to Amsterdam over there.</span> <span id="s926">We stayed in the school.</span> <span id="s927">I don't remember some still there.</span> <span id="s928">It's a city near Berlin.</span> <span id="s929">I don't remember that really.</span> <span id="s930">I have this story all written and I don't remember anything.</span> <span id="s931">Anyway, we got together with my sister since then and we came back to Greece together in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Did you find any relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">I didn't find the most important, my family.</span> <span id="s934">Always, I hoped that some one of my brothers escaped.</span> <span id="s935">Because they said someone escaped to Russia.</span> <span id="s936">I said, maybe, it's one of my brothers, maybe.</span> <span id="s937">I was going downtown and I was looking and looking here and there to see if I could find one at least from my brothers or a familiar face.</span> <span id="s938">Maybe I'll find some one of my family--nothing, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">To tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Then you stayed in Athens for a while?</span> <span id="s942">Is that how you met your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Yeah.</span> <span id="s944">__________(c.687).</span> <span id="s945">I need somebody to take care of me.</span> <span id="s946">Who's going to feed me?</span> <span id="s947">I don't have house, I don't have nothing nowadays.</span> <span id="s948">So I start to work in the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s949">Over there, I met my husband because he came three months later to work there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">I see.</span> <span id="s951">Do you want--we could--if you have a picture of your husband from around the war period, we can include him in this project also.</span> <span id="s952">If you can tell me about his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">My husband was not from Janina or Preveza.</span> <span id="s954">He was from Salonika.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Would you know anything about what his childhood was like or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">The only thing I have is his picture when he was in the army, if we can find this picture.</span> <span id="s957">It was too old picture for him--he was in the army then.</span> <span id="s958">Charles, his brother, was very active in sports; very active in sports and my husband was a pharmacist.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Did he work in America as a pharmacist?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">No, he had to go to school and have the American degree.</span> <span id="s961">In the meantime, I had the small child, three years old and I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s962">He says to me, how can I go to school?</span> <span id="s963">Who's going to take care of you?</span> <span id="s964">So better start to work.</span> <span id="s965">So he starts to work here.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">What was his occupation here?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">He was working--you know how I did--at a doctor's hospital in Charles Street.</span> <span id="s968">He was a pharmacist with no language.</span> <span id="s969">Every time the nurse used to go to the pharmacy and ask for medicine, my husband would say write, write.</span> <span id="s970">Because he didn't--couldn't understand what she talked.</span> <span id="s971">She used to write the name of the medicine and give to him.</span> <span id="s972">But after one year, he quit because the pay was not good.</span> <span id="s973">He had family to feed.</span> <span id="s974">And I couldn't work either myself because I had one child and pregnant, how can go to work?</span> <span id="s975">So after that, he quit, after a year.</span> <span id="s976">He start to work at Read's Drugstore, two shifts a day to make the money he needed.</span> <span id="s977">He didn't have nobody but the Joint really, he helped us in the beginning.</span> <span id="s978">When he saw that the salary went up, they gave less, you know.</span> <span id="s979">They used to give certain amount every week for the expenses.</span> <span id="s980">Rent, I have to pay rent here.</span> <span id="s981">I have to pay for everything, right?</span> <span id="s982">So they give us certain amount.</span> <span id="s983">Every time he saw it went up, they reduce the amount till he got free.</span> <span id="s984">He got only what he needed.</span> <span id="s985">Finally he decided to make--to start a job, his own.</span> <span id="s986">He's not going to work for somebody else.</span> <span id="s987">He succeeded really.</span> <span id="s988">He did very good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">He opened his own pharmacy?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">No, how?</span> <span id="s991">He had to go to school to have the degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">So what did he--?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Ship chandler.</span> <span id="s994">He worked with ships, with the Greek ships.</span> <span id="s995">He opened the store.</span> <span id="s996">He got merchandise for the ships and the people from the ships, they used to come in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s997">They used to go to the store and buy things and send back to Greece.</span> <span id="s998">He got this job and forgot the pharmacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">What for four years in college again to have the American degree?</span> <span id="s1001">He didn't know English either but somehow he managed his way.</span> <span id="s1002">He did very good but then everything has an end.</span> <span id="s1003">That right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">I suppose so.</span> <span id="s1005">Is there anything else right now about your story that for the sake of our tape and our interview that you haven't mentioned, that you would like to mention?</span> <span id="s1006">That you can think of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1008">I don't think I have anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Any details that you left out, that you would like to---?</span> <span id="s1010">Anything specific again that stands our in your mind of a particular--either from your childhood or anything that happened during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">I told you my childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Right.</span> <span id="s1013">So nothing stands out, aside from the things that you've already told me about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">I don't recall anything that I left out.</span> <span id="s1015">I think I said everything.</span> <span id="s1016">That's why I told you to read this one because here when I wrote this one, I have more quiet, you know.</span> <span id="s1017">I express myself much better when I am quiet.</span> <span id="s1018">But I thought I mentioned everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Could we go on and talk a little bit about your brothers here that you have pictures of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Which brother is this on the left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">This, Josef.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Joseph?</span> <span id="s1024">What Jani?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">The younger, the younger, was still in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">What can you tell me about his personality?</span> <span id="s1027">What was he like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Oy.</span> <span id="s1029">He was full of life and so amusing, this boy, it's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1030">He was full of life.</span> <span id="s1031">He made everybody in the house laugh with his jokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">So he had a good sense of humor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A lot.</span> <span id="s1034">A lot more than everyone of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Did he do that in school also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Yes.</span> <span id="s1037">And a thousand friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Yeah, a lot of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1040">My house, when the kids were home, my house was full of kids, one going and coming, going and coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">What kind of--he went to the Alliance School or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">No, no.</span> <span id="s1043">Alliance was in Janina; was not in Preveza.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">He just went to a public school in Preveza?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Yeah, the regular school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">What--did he have a bar mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">We didn't have bar mitzvah over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">You don't have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Not this time.</span> <span id="s1050">In shul, they did something but that's it.</span> <span id="s1051">Not big like here.</span> <span id="s1052">Nothing to compare with this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">I know, I realize that.</span> <span id="s1054">But he could read Hebrew and ....</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Yeah, he could read in school, Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1056">Learned in school, I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">He went to a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Well, the elementary school they have Hebrew too a little bit.</span> <span id="s1059">A little bit, not too much.</span> <span id="s1060">I had a little more in Alliance myself.</span> <span id="s1061">But in Preveza I had a little bit, not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Was it for only Jewish students or ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">No.....</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">He was in a Jewish school or was it a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1066">Alliance was a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s1067">But this one was a public school.</span> <span id="s1068">But the rabbi from the shul used to take couple hours every week and just teach them the basics of the Jewish language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">He tried to do there?</span> <span id="s1070">(c.745) Because there were very few boys over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">I see.</span> <span id="s1072">So that's how they got a Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Yeah, just a little bit, not too much.</span> <span id="s1074">Enough to know that he's Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">But in Alliance, we had regular hours for Hebrew, for French, and Greek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">So it was more rigorous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1079">I was not in Janina at this time.</span> <span id="s1080">Coming back to Preveza, no Alliance there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">I see.</span> <span id="s1082">So he grew up in Preveza?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">The whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Did he go to Italy?</span> <span id="s1087">Was he born yet when you were in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">I think he was born--he was one year old maybe, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1089">He was very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Did he do any sports or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Everywhere.</span> <span id="s1092">Sports is the boys' thing, you know.</span> <span id="s1093">Everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Which sports in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Baseball.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Like American baseball?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Well, it seems to me it's like the American, yes.</span> <span id="s1098">Baseball.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Did he play soccer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Soccer, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">So he was friendly and outgoing and humorous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">He was the youngest in the house, you know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">So when you were deported, then he worked in the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Yeah, that's the luck.</span> <span id="s1105">If he was working somewhere else, maybe he could be saved.</span> <span id="s1106">But no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">How about--which brother?</span> <span id="s1108">This is Albert?</span> <span id="s1109">Or this is Moise?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">No, no, this is Moise.</span> <span id="s1111">Albert is the other one, the small picture I showed you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Okay, would you want to talk about Maurice for a few minutes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">I told you Maurice I know so little because he left when he was nine years old and he came when he was in school.</span> <span id="s1114">He was like a stranger to us when he came back because he didn't know even Greek.</span> <span id="s1115">He forgot his language after so many years.</span> <span id="s1116">But slowly, we got used to him and he started to talk Greek better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">What was he like?</span> <span id="s1118">Was he serious?</span> <span id="s1119">His personality?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Oh, he was very serious, this one.</span> <span id="s1121">He was the--my father's strong hand over the house but we--he used to do a lot of things, helped anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">He lived--all the children lived in the same house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">All together, all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">So he was--he's the one who worked in the ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Electric company.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Right.</span> <span id="s1127">So like a bookkeeper kind of ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Well, like an administrator because he did the whole thing over there.</span> <span id="s1129">that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">None of these brothers were married, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">No, no.</span> <span id="s1132">This is the reason I thought someone of those--someone, at least one will be back.</span> <span id="s1133">But nothing.</span> <span id="s1134">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">What about Albert?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Albert, I told.</span> <span id="s1137">He was finished the school, the elementary school in my hometown.</span> <span id="s1138">After that he went to help my father in the store because he needed somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">So he didn't go to gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">No.</span> <span id="s1141">He didn't have any chance, this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">What was his personality like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Very serious boy, very serious boy.</span> <span id="s1144">It's not like modern boys to run here and there.</span> <span id="s1145">He was very--family boy this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1147">He liked to stay with the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Well, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Was he protective of you and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">All the time, all the time and all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">But you said that you had combined friends.</span> <span id="s1152">Was this the brother that you had the joint friends with, Albert?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">These boys had friends their age.</span> <span id="s1154">So I used to go excursions, daytime, for example.</span> <span id="s1155">From morning till afternoon.</span> <span id="s1156">With them and their friends too.</span> <span id="s1157">My friends, too, together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">So you all went together?</span> <span id="s1159">That's nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1161">Alone, we're not allowed to go alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">That's right.</span> <span id="s1163">Where would you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Some small place we had near my city.</span> <span id="s1165">Outside, very nice, like you go for a picnic outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Did you ride your bicycle there?</span> <span id="s1167">Or how did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Are you kidding?</span> <span id="s1169">Bicycle at this time?</span> <span id="s1170">We're not allowed girls on bicycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">You weren't allowed to bicycle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Very strict upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">I told you.</span> <span id="s1175">We're not allowed to go out by ourselves.</span> <span id="s1176">Every time I wanted to go, just a walk outside--not a ride, to walk a little outside--someone had to be with me.</span> <span id="s1177">Tell me!</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">It's another world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">I wanted to go to movies, I have to go shop around.</span> <span id="s1180">I can't go by myself and the movies...</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Even with your friends, you couldn't just go--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">No, no.</span> <span id="s1183">We had to have a male companion.</span> <span id="s1184">They shop around too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">This is all your--did all the girls there have the--look like this for all the girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">From this hometown, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">I told you it was small city, that's why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">In Janina it was a little different.</span> <span id="s1189">But my hometown, ______(c.799), I couldn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">In Athens, it couldn't have been like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1192">Are you kidding, not to go by yourself wherever you want to go?</span> <span id="s1193">No, Athens was not like that.</span> <span id="s1194">But my hometown, I told you, it was a very small town--Jewish people very low.</span> <span id="s1195">They live together just like that.</span> <span id="s1196">You couldn't do anything because if you say something, the whole city would talk next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Do you know things about your family, like the--how long they've been in Greece?</span> <span id="s1198">I mean, they're Sephardic, had they been there since the Spanish expulsion in 1492?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Much before the expulsion.</span> <span id="s1200">They're born over there and raised in Greece and nothing else.</span> <span id="s1201">They say...</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">[PLEASE NOTE: AGAIN - WE HAVE DETERMINED TAT THE GANI FAMILY WERE OF ROMANIOT DESCENT, WHICH IS THE GROUP WHO RESIDED IN GREECE AND THE BALKANS]</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Many generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Yeah, many.</span> <span id="s1205">They say we come from Israel.</span> <span id="s1206">But I don't see anything, I don't know where.</span> <span id="s1207">My parents they didn't speak no other language except Greek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Do they know Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">No, nothing, no.</span> <span id="s1210">But they kept the holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">So--but they were Sephardic, not .....Eskewazyes</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Sephardic, 100%.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">So they were probably from the Spanish expulsion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Only my husband's family.</span> <span id="s1215">My husband's family half Spanish.</span> <span id="s1216">Because his family comes from Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Right.</span> <span id="s1218">_____(c.818) My husband's mother didn't know one word Greek, only Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Oh, wow.</span> <span id="s1222">Yeah, I guess in Salonika, they had a lot of ,,,, A lot.</span> <span id="s1223">There were a lot of Jews over there and they kept the Spanish language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Ladino?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Ladino, yeah.</span> <span id="s1226">Even the gentiles, they're obliged to learn Spanish because they couldn't work in Solanika.</span> <span id="s1227">Because all the commerce was in Jewish hands.</span> <span id="s1228">Except for that the Jews didn't work in Salonika on Saturday.</span> <span id="s1229">The gentiles, they were obliged to stop work too because they couldn't do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">I didn't realize that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">It was really--it was Jewish, Jewish, Jewish city.</span> <span id="s1232">Everywhere.</span> <span id="s1233">How many shuls they had over there?</span> <span id="s1234">10 - 15, I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s1235">How many shuls they had in Salonika?</span> <span id="s1236">a lot.</span> <span id="s1237">My husband, the first time went over there, he was crying to see how Salonika became ghost-ridden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">So you visited afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1240">I visited Israel five times.</span> <span id="s1241">I went by the way in the eastern Europe one time because my husband and I wanted to say a prayer, a kaddish we say, to my parents.</span> <span id="s1242">We don't have any grave here.</span> <span id="s1243">So I said to my husband, one time we have to go to Birkenau because I know there they died.</span> <span id="s1244">So I went over there but believe me, we passed all the eastern European countries.</span> <span id="s1245">You couldn't talk to them, first of all, because the language is so different.</span> <span id="s1246">But when I arrived to Cracow in Poland and we're going closer to Birkenau, I start to cry myself because I felt, I felt my parents are dead here and I don't know where.</span> <span id="s1247">So I went to Birkenau and I took a little sand from that and I brought over here, just one time.</span> <span id="s1248">Then I went to block where I was sleeping.</span> <span id="s1249">I saw the bed, I showed my husband the bed where I was.</span> <span id="s1250">Still the beds are there, still the blocks are there, everything, a little ruined now after so many years, but still they're there.</span> <span id="s1251">I told my husband, you see this bed.</span> <span id="s1252">I slept in the second floor, my sister and I and a couple of friends.</span> <span id="s1253">In one bed were sleeping six girls, like sardines.</span> <span id="s1254">We couldn't turn from one side to another.</span> <span id="s1255">And food, forget about that.</span> <span id="s1256">A piece of bread with margarine and salami what they have.</span> <span id="s1257">I used to eat half at nighttime, half in the morning.</span> <span id="s1258">Because we didn't want to work with empty stomach.</span> <span id="s1259">So many times, they used to steal at nighttime, the other girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1262">They were hungry, I don't blame them.</span> <span id="s1263">But we had nothing more than that.</span> <span id="s1264">So when I show it to him, my block and where we slept and the life we had over there, he says to me now let's go to Auschwitz and I show my block.</span> <span id="s1265">So we went after left Birkenau, was a half-hour walking distance.</span> <span id="s1266">Went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1267">First of all they show over there the rooms where they have different things from the people who were there.</span> <span id="s1268">Suitcases, shoes, hair, these cans from Zyklon B and things like that.</span> <span id="s1269">Or they have different rooms and you visit and you can see them.</span> <span id="s1270">When finished all of that, then he says, let's go to my place.</span> <span id="s1271">He took me--this was more distant this place because it was two blocks--two ______(c.866) blocks.</span> <span id="s1272">My husband says this was our first floor and this was my sleeping place.</span> <span id="s1273">But it was like a house.</span> <span id="s1274">Mine was like a barn, you know.</span> <span id="s1275">Different.</span> <span id="s1276">They wanted to show to that crowds and the Red Cross that they treated good, the Jewish.</span> <span id="s1277">And he was going to sports over there, play baseball and basketball, whatever it is, with the other prisoners.</span> <span id="s1278">They had more freedom there.</span> <span id="s1279">We were really prisoners in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">I guess it depends, you know, whenever he got there, the state of health that he was in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">No, he was lucky because when they told us, when we were at Birkenau what profession we have.</span> <span id="s1282">My husband says pharmacist.</span> <span id="s1283">I didn't say nothing because I didn't have any profession.</span> <span id="s1284">I was just in the school and then in the house, what profession I have?</span> <span id="s1285">So just because of that, they put him in the section where they kept the professionals, the doctors and things like that.</span> <span id="s1286">Going to Auschwitz, they put him over there, to take care of the sick people.</span> <span id="s1287">How they take care?</span> <span id="s1288">No medicine, no nothing, just with aspirins and water.</span> <span id="s1289">But the only thing is, he had a little freedom, more than I did.</span> <span id="s1290">He was not scared of this selections they used to make once in a while, but always the holidays, Peseach, Succoth, Rosh Hashonah, Yom Kippur, all the holidays.</span> <span id="s1291">When we come back from work, they rush us in the block again and the blockaltester came to visit us.</span> <span id="s1292">What's that, it's going to be a selection.</span> <span id="s1293">God, everybody tried to hide because even if you are strong, if you have something, small thing in here or in your stomach or somewhere else, crematorium right away.</span> <span id="s1294">So we were scared to death.</span> <span id="s1295">They used to wake up us, 11, 12 o'clock from the sleep to visit us.</span> <span id="s1296">The next day, midnight...</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Selection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">They took the numbers of the selected girls and the next day you see this girl disappeared.</span> <span id="s1299">One day was in the line for work, next day they're not.</span> <span id="s1300">You didn't know from one day to another what would happen.</span> <span id="s1301">Today you are alive, you work.</span> <span id="s1302">Next day, maybe you're not.</span> <span id="s1303">Depends how lucky you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Tell me.</span> <span id="s1306">When I was liberated, I was 100 pounds, like that.</span> <span id="s1307">I'm not fat, I never was fat but I never was 100 pounds either.</span> <span id="s1308">After the liberation, I told you they kept us to this hotel for three months, two months, I don't know how long.</span> <span id="s1309">You know what we did the whole day.</span> <span id="s1310">Eating and sleeping, eating and sleeping.</span> <span id="s1311">We came back to Greece I was just like that fat.</span> <span id="s1312">I couldn't bend myself and tie my shoes, so fat I was.</span> <span id="s1313">That's true.</span> <span id="s1314">But after that, slowly, slowly, I lost a bit.</span> <span id="s1315">Not because I kept any diet but I didn't eat like that and I move a little around.</span> <span id="s1316">Over there, I was sleeping because I was so tired; I wanted so much to sleep.</span> <span id="s1317">At work, I was looking, having my shovel in my hands, I was looking.</span> <span id="s1318">If nobody was looking, to lay a bit in the grass and sleep, to find just a moment to rest.</span> <span id="s1319">My friends and my sister used to say oh go in this corner and sleep.</span> <span id="s1320">I'll take a look.</span> <span id="s1321">If somebody comes, I'll wake you up.</span> <span id="s1322">This was something we used to do for them.</span> <span id="s1323">Go, lay in this corner.</span> <span id="s1324">I'll take a look.</span> <span id="s1325">If somebody comes, I will wake you up again.</span> <span id="s1326">We were so dead for sleeping, so dead.</span> <span id="s1327">And going to block to relax, you know, in the block were 100 kinds of girls over there Different nationalities, different education, different background.</span> <span id="s1328">They start to fight.</span> <span id="s1329">We want to go to sleep and relax, they start to fight.</span> <span id="s1330">They fight in their languages.</span> <span id="s1331">I didn't know what they say, what they did but the only thing fight and scream.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">When you came to Athens, what did your sister--?</span> <span id="s1333">You met your husband then at the Joint?</span> <span id="s1334">Did you come to America at the same time with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">No, I came six months before my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">She got married in Greece also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">No, she married here, after me.</span> <span id="s1338">I was married in Greece but she was younger, I told you.</span> <span id="s1339">She married here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">But she managed to come to America too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Did she live with you then when ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">No, they send her to Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">She lived one year in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1346">She went to school all this year and after that, the Joint--because the Joint helped her send to school over there--she quit.</span> <span id="s1347">She came to New York and she start to work over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Did she try to come to the same city?</span> <span id="s1349">You had come to Baltimore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">I didn't know where to go because they asked me if I had relatives here to help me, to go to America.</span> <span id="s1351">I said, I didn't want to say I had relatives because I didn't want to bother them to help me.</span> <span id="s1352">I said I'm old enough, I'll go over there.</span> <span id="s1353">I can work and do my--make my life.</span> <span id="s1354">I don't like to bother nobody.</span> <span id="s1355">So I said I have nobody.</span> <span id="s1356">So they had opening; was open here in Baltimore so they send us here.</span> <span id="s1357">I said after all, I have some friends in New York but I didn't like to bother anybody.</span> <span id="s1358">I said New York and Baltimore, they aren't far away.</span> <span id="s1359">If I have _____(c.918), I'll go visit them.</span> <span id="s1360">But I didn't go.</span> <span id="s1361">I didn't say that I have relatives in New York, I didn't want to say that.</span> <span id="s1362">So they send me here.</span> <span id="s1363">I said, fine.</span> <span id="s1364">Here, I don't care.</span> <span id="s1365">Stranger keeps you sending you there, it'll be a new place.</span> <span id="s1366">But I'm glad.</span> <span id="s1367">My husband, though, all the time, he didn't like Baltimore when he came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Because we're the first Greek who came to Baltimore, the first one.</span> <span id="s1370">We don't have nobody.</span> <span id="s1371">The gentile Greeks lived but far away and different.</span> <span id="s1372">With somebody in our own religion, you know,...
