but don’t come back here.</span> <span id="s223">You know, you had to sing a song that the German ha -- hat -- the Hitler song, before every class.</span> <span id="s224">So it didn’t even bother me at that time, because it was a song.</span> <span id="s225">But when we finally were thrown out, more or less right out of school, my mother says -- decided that was for me to get -- time to get out of the -- Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: It’s too bad that she didn’t have enough sense to -- to take herself out of there, too.</span> <span id="s228">They had a chance to go.</span> <span id="s229">My brother never came home, and he was four years younger, so -- those were tough years.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: You mentioned

size of it.</span> <span id="s236">So we -- so you -- the only thing wa-was, had to get -- had I -- ha -- I was thrown out of school at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Who told you you couldn’t come back to school, the teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: I think it must have been the -- the gymnasium [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: The -- the teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Gi -- well, th-the gi -- the gymnasium [indecipherable] the one tha -- the -- the people who were in charge of that.</span> <span id="s241">They told us, out.</span> <span id="s242">And lot of the other schools, smaller schools were left -- left a little later, but that’s when -- when -- when I -- my mo -- my mother and father thought it was time to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: And let me just tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s245">My father did have a sister here in the United States, which were came -- which were -- came here in 1914, so she was already a -- a -- an American through and through.</span> <span id="s246">And she -- she thought it would be good for me to move.</span> <span id="s247">That’s -- that’s the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: But what -- but my parents never thought that it would -- there would ever come to the -- to term that the -- that they would have to leave there, or that they would do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s250">And when I finally -- when I finally -- let me finish the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Well, now, I’m -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: There is something to that.</span> <span id="s253">There -- when I finally came to -- that my father and mother were go -- coming, they went to Stuttgart and Koblenz, which is the -- the -- the seat of an American consulate, to apply for a visa and a -- a permit.</span> <span id="s254">Now my par -- when people here send the -- the necessary papers, they were not official enough to allow a family of three more to make a living here.</span> <span id="s255">So the American government decided that this is not the pla -- they -- they -- they cannot, without help from somebody else in ge -- in America, make a living here.</span> <span id="s256">So on that basis, they tried other places, and a lot of my friends, their parents came over.</span> <span id="s257">And they could never come out, and they were sen -- then sent to Poland in the concentration camp, and killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s259">How long did you stay in Germany after you couldn’t go to school, and before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: I -- I think it was the -- within a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: It was a matter of months?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Yeah, it was already a matter -- a question to -- whether I should go or not go at that time.</span> <span id="s263">They knew that I had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Yeah, but I meant you were out of school just for a few months before you left for the United States, is that what you’re saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: I’m -- I’m saying that the feeling that we have to get out was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: So as soon as possible, I don’t remember exactly the time schedule --</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: -- but she -- but they did the best that they -- they had to make the ap-applications --</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: -- to the consulate in the -- in the u -- in the United States.</span> <span id="s272">And I had to go to -- for the -- to Stuttgart where there’s a counselor.</span> <span id="s273">And they gave me all the ex-examinations and essay, and then they said you can go.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s275">So you went to school til about 1936 --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: -- or early ’37 --</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: -- okay.</span> <span id="s280">So what was your response at the age of 15 that you would have to leave your family?</span> <span id="s281">That’s a tremendous --</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Excitement.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Excitement?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Excitement.</span> <span id="s285">Yeah, I didn’t realize the -- the real danger, I was really -- I’m t-too young -- I was either too young or too stupid.</span> <span id="s286">I couldn’t understand it that why -- why I go by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: But you weren’t frightened to leave your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Were you afraid to leave your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s291">I was not afraid.</span> <span id="s292">I-I-I was the kind of guy who lived -- I -- I used to go to bicycle riding for long distances.</span> <span id="s293">And I didn’t feel that way at all.</span> <span id="s294">Matter of fact, when I came to here in this country, they s -- were surprised how easily I got along with the boys playing soccer, right in the middle of the -- 78th Street, where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: So you were -- you would describe yourself as a very independent child when you were in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Yeah, I was -- I -- I -- I -- the fr -- my friends were [indecipherable] all of -- all of them, were almost all gone.</span> <span id="s299">You know, the German friends which I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: The German friends wouldn’t talk to me any more after all, because the -- that was t-too dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: But this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Did that bother you, when your German friends wouldn’t talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: I don’t remember that, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s306">I don’t remember anybody bothering me, but I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Do you remember you being -- feeling bad about that, that your German friends wouldn’t talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: No, I wish I would have -- I would feel that way, but I don’t -- I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: They were human beings to me, they were boys, they were f -- played -- guys I played with, not guys I -- it was a -- it was a rough time in my life.</span> <span id="s311">And when I came over here, United States was not in good shape in 1900 -- in th-that time.</span> <span id="s312">Not a real good shape that they could afford so many people.</span> <span id="s313">So over here my parents -- when I came, my people who took me in, my -- there was a my -- an aunt of mine, didn’t have the kind of money to really ta -- put me up.</span> <span id="s314">So in the beginning my father used to send 20 or 30 dollars whenever he got [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s315">Then after awhile they -- he -- he didn’t have any more money, and then all of a sudden I hear -- I don’t hear any more at all.</span> <span id="s316">And that’s how that -- [indecipherable] to nothing, until I didn’t find out that Koblenz was being evacuated by the Jews.</span> <span id="s317">And I didn’t know whether they’re going to anywhere.</span> <span id="s318">But all I found out later on that they were sent to Poland.</span> <span id="s319">And I found through different organization, the Jewish organization, that they were sent to Poland and they were killed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I did get some money from Germany.</span> <span id="s322">If [indecipherable] is interested at all, I got 5,000 dollars from -- from [indecipherable] because I -- my father owned that house.</span> <span id="s323">That house was worth a lot of money.</span> <span id="s324">But at that time they were willing to give -- give me five gra -- I was the only one left of the family, they were giving me 5,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s325">I want to tell you what I did with it.</span> <span id="s326">I took my kids, when they were about eight, I took them to Germany, show them where I was born.</span> <span id="s327">And that’s what I did with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s329">Let’s talk about when you left, how -- how you came over to the United States.</span> <span id="s330">So your parents told you you’d be coming to the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: -- and you said you were excited.</span> <span id="s333">And ho --</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I was excited is exactly right.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: And where di -- how did you leave?</span> <span id="s336">What did you take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: That’s also a little story.</span> <span id="s338">My father and mother took me to Bremen.</span> <span id="s339">I come to the -- to the -- to the barrier to go on the boa -- ship, and my par -- and they asked me what -- they ki -- the Germans spoke to me German, naturally I didn’t speak anything English, and said, I guess you got all kinds of money and all kinds of stuff, in a joking way.</span> <span id="s340">I bet you’re loaded here [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s341">So I said, oh, I’m a real big shot, I have everything.</span> <span id="s342">So you know what he did?</span> <span id="s343">They took me on board, they took me apart.</span> <span id="s344">They took every piece of my clothes off.</span> <span id="s345">They took every piece of my clothes off, my shoes underneath, they took the shoes off, they thought there may be something underneath there.</span> <span id="s346">Would you believe that?</span> <span id="s347">And then I -- and I really -- I really was -- thought I was a joker.</span> <span id="s348">So that was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: What was the name of your boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: The Manhattan.</span> <span id="s351">SS Manhattan, or the SS Washington, was two ships who were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s352">One was the SS Washington, one was the SS Manhattan.</span> <span id="s353">I don’t know which one it was.</span> <span id="s354">Those two went back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s356">And what did your parents say to you?</span> <span id="s357">Do you remember what you and your parents talked about when you were saying goodbye?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: What you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Do you remember what you and your parents said to each other when you were saying goodbye?</span></p>

<p><span id="s364">A: And I don’t remember it well, myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s366">So then you were on --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: I came in, I was on top of the boat, and I looked down, they were standing there, and [indecipherable] forget, I would forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: I’m sure.</span> <span id="s369">I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: It’s a long time since I talked about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s372">And then on -- who else was on -- who were the other passengers on this ship?</span> <span id="s373">Were there other children like you?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Oh yes, cu -- I don’t remember the -- there was a lot of people who are im-im-immigrating into, Jewish, American, ger -- and Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Were there other children?</span> <span id="s376">A: And my father spoke to some of them before I went on and [indecipherable] to -- to look out after me.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: And because when I got here, somebody took me off the boat, who was an uncle.</span> <span id="s379">And a -- a person I -- p-person I didn’t even know, but he was an uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: And at that time you did not speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No, not a word.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s383">And -- and then you -- you moved in with your relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: And then the excitement of the ship, and the -- and the -- to sit on -- to sit on the -- on -- on the boat and look at the -- at Coney Island.</span> <span id="s385">They were explaining to us Coney Island.</span> <span id="s386">You could see Coney Island from -- from the ship.</span> <span id="s387">And the excitement of the people br -- to go back to the United States in general, was immense.</span> <span id="s388">And I never forget that either, you know?</span> <span id="s389">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: And they -- they made that tr-trip worthwhile, you know, I mean, at least.</span> <span id="s391">And I was -- my father gave it -- somebody, they must have given somebody money, because that man who was -- took care of me really well.</span> <span id="s392">Made sure I had enough to eat and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s393">Not that -- the Americans gave us plenty of ice cream.</span> <span id="s394">We never even had ice cream before we got there.</span> <span id="s395">An ice cream.</span> <span id="s396">And then being o-on the boat, there was a couple movie stars on the boat, so we watched [indecipherable] from the sides.</span> <span id="s397">It was the excitement.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Were there other teenagers, other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s400">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s401">None I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: None that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And so you landed.</span> <span id="s405">What did America mean to you as a 15 year old boy?</span> <span id="s406">Do you remember what it meant to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yeah, [indecipherable] America was like.</span> <span id="s408">I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s409">I could -- I don’t remember the -- the -- how I felt about it.</span> <span id="s410">It was excitement.</span> <span id="s411">In general it was the excitement.</span> <span id="s412">You know you are going to a free country, a free country where everybody gets fr -- is treated alike, and I can go to school again, an-and that somebody is going to take care of me.</span> <span id="s413">And not that these people wanted me so badly, but they took it for granted that that’s part of their duty, that -- was a relative.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Did you start school right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Right away.</span> <span id="s416">There I had a very good experience.</span> <span id="s417">I went to a neighborhood in Queens, and the lady in th-the -- the teacher ti -- tis a -- not the teacher, the superintendent, or what?</span> <span id="s418">Who is the --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: The principal?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: The principal.</span> <span id="s421">The principal decided she’s going to teach me English.</span> <span id="s422">So she took me up for an hour every day in class, and sh -- made me -- made me learn -- play English.</span> <span id="s423">And the best English I learned on the -- on the soccer team.</span> <span id="s424">But how she took care of me, so at -- at the -- at the graduation she made a big speech about how well I adjusted to the American life.</span> <span id="s425">Which was not so hard to adjust to.</span> <span id="s426">You know, I lived in a nice -- a fairly nice neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: And you were living with your relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yes, an -- an an -- an aunt.</span></p>

school?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: I went to high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: What high school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Sha -- jer -- Franklin K.

And we were talking about the fact that you had come to the United States, you were playing soccer, you had American friends, you went to high school, you were living with your relatives, and then you went on to -- you also went to night school.</span> <span id="s458">What were you studying in night school?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: It was mostly English.</span> <span id="s460">I took German as a -- as a cla -- as a course to get good marks, because I spoke German pretty well.</span> <span id="s461">So that’s what I had, but w-was mostly English and [indecipherable] geography, whatever it is -- had to be.</span> <span id="s462">It was enough -- enough -- enough to -- to graduate school.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: And how old were you when you graduated?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: I say 18 and a half or 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Well, when you came to the United States at age 15, what grade did they put you in?</span> <span id="s466">Did they put you in

go to high school, and when -- wh-why -- she’s -- she’s -- she thought she has more of a -- a way of finding out how you -- how I get along than anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: And being a boy and getting -- playing a lot of sports was very easy for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s477">Le-Let’s go

<p><span id="s481">A: I had a Bar Mitzvah in my -- in our house, in the living room.</span> <span id="s482">The rabbi was in attendance, and about five or six rel-relatives.</span> <span id="s483">And we had a very nice dinner, it wasn’t as -- quite as wild here, as it is here.</span> <span id="s484">But we had [indecipherable] Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s485">The rabbi made a speech, and I don’t consider that it was anything unusual about it at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: So you -- did you read from the Bible?</span> <span id="s487">Did you chant?</span></p> <p><span

you talk about it, it’s so hard to -- to understand how un-un-un-unders -- un-understanding people are.</span> <span id="s503">How they could be so completely un-understanding towards the Jewish people or anybody else.</span> <span id="s504">Because they’re getting along now.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: So now you’re back, you’re in th -- in New York, and you graduate from high

have enough money to get -- to get my -- help my parents to come back over.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: And you had communication with your parents still?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: So this was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Well, we had communication -- I don’t remember th-the -- we had some sort of a com --</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Communication?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: -- connection, yeah.</span> <span id="s530">Because I had to have it.</span> <span id="s531">Or maybe I just ca -- hoped that there’s -- that th-there’s a possibility they still may be alive.</span> <span id="s532">Because I don’t think there was any ed -- any medication -- any --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: -- communication, except -- except -- no, because they were sent to Poland by Hitler, so there couldn’t have been any.</span> <span id="s535">The only a

Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s538">So you graduated from high school in 1941, and you looked for a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: I looked for a job --</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: You said you were 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: -- ve-ve-very hard at that time, that was after the war.</span> <span id="s542">There really was -- especially prices, the -- the money which you got was hardly anything worth -- you couldn’t even live on it, I think it was maybe 12 - 13 dollars a week da -- at that time, for a young kid like me.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Wa -- okay, so you graduated in June of ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Okay, and you -- then did you get a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: I got a job at a -- at a

think I made 12 dollars a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s551">And then you worked for them for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Until I don’t -- I don’t know, I don’t remember the -- some of the frequences.</span> <span id="s553">I di -- I -- I moved around plenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: You had different jobs, is that what you’re saying?</span> <span id="s555">You had different --</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: I had no trouble finding jobs.</span> <span id="s557">I had tr-trouble finding money.</span></p> <p><span

then things picked up a little bit.</span> <span id="s565">Business picked up, everybody had to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: But I don’t remember tha -- anything diffi -- difficult, or in -- hard to b -- to -- that I had -- did anything unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: I don’t think I was old enough

work, but I got a better job.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: And I -- I got another job, then I-I got up to 20 dollars a week and I suppose that was a lot of money at the time, and so [indecipherable] came the army.</span> <span id="s578">In the army, of course, I’m making 90 dollars a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: When did you go into the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: 25 -- in ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Well, a little earlier than that.</span> <span id="s582">More --</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: No, the war was over in ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: It couldn’t be ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: No.</span> <span id="s587">So you went into the army, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: I going -- go in the army --</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: -- and wh -- and wh -- and what -- wh -- and what --</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: And then you wh-what -- where -- where were you stationed?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Oh, when I went in the army, they looked at me, they saw a little German boy who don’t speak good English, what’s he doing in the army?</span> <span id="s593">But th -- he drafted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: And I really enjoyed in -- in -- in -- and wanted to be in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Got in the army in Fort Dix.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: In New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Fort Dix didn’t know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s600">They didn’t know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s601">I’m not speaking good English, I -- I -- I don’t know anything about anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: So they put me in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s604">So I was working in the kitchen as KP for two or three months.</span> <span id="s605">Getting -- getting good and fat, but I -- what I -- but I did -- did complain.</span> <span id="s606">And I did complain because I was feeled, if other people complain, I can complain.</span> <span id="s607">And they gave me a -- th-they put me in the ca -- in a place in -- down -- down south, a-a-and -- where they made th -- they -- they want to teach me how to make Morse Code.</span> <span id="s608">Speak to each other a-all -- in a Morse Code because I didn’t have to worry about the language so much.</span> <span id="s609">So I had a -- and worked myself up to a -- to a lieutenant colonel’s [indecipherable] and I was in a -- in the maneuver with him for two months, to give him these -- the signals, so -- so they can communicate.</span> <span id="s610">And in that thing, in that thing, I-I came on and I get a notice in -- in -- it was carl -- in -- in [indecipherable] on maneuvers, all German speaking people, please report to wa -- headquarters.</span> <span id="s611">That’s me.</span> <span id="s612">I go to headquarters.</span> <span id="s613">He said listen, you gotta chance to do something here.</span> <span id="s614">You gotta chance to make yourself a name, or whatever.</span> <span id="s615">We can teach you how to ta -- [phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: You were talking about how you were now down south in the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: -- in the army, and they needed German speaking --</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Spe -- they need German speaking people --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Soldiers, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: -- did I tell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: So when I -- I -- I was told that I can -- I can join a -- a -- a school to teach interrogation.</span> <span id="s624">And it’s taken my three months, and it’s done in Maryland, Camp Ritchie.</span> <span id="s625">Camp Ritchie, Maryland.</span> <span id="s626">And they’ll give you a -- give you a test before, and if I’m interested in a re-report this -- this -- which hap -- ever happened, I reported it.</span> <span id="s627">And I did go to the school.</span> <span id="s628">I went to Cambridge u -- beautiful place.</span> <span id="s629">That’s where the Clintons go.</span> <span id="s630">Beautiful.</span> <span id="s631">We had -- we were there three months, and we t -- heard how to -- to interrogate.</span> <span id="s632">You know how you do that?</span> <span id="s633">You have prisoners, American guys, they’re playing prisoners, they teach them how to do -- well -- well, that was a big job.</span> <span id="s634">And I speak German, so to me it came natural.</span> <span id="s635">So they used a lot of German Jews, who -- for that purpose.</span> <span id="s636">And I loved to get out of that -- the -- the swamp in the -- in the -- in down, and I went that school, and I don’t know, three months after that I got a call, get ready, we’re going overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Well now, were you a citizen yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Had you become a United States citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: So what is -- that’s what I said, you think [indecipherable] should be a citizen.</span> <span id="s641">So I said -- he di -- they didn’t realize it.</span> <span id="s642">So they took us to [indecipherable] house, and they made me a citizen.</span> <span id="s643">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: What did it feel like to be a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: I wa -- I felt like a citizen anyway.</span> <span id="s646">I mean, I di-di-di -- it didn’t -- didn’t bother me whether they make me a citizen or not.</span> <span id="s647">They’re not going to sent me back to Germany.</span> <span id="s648">So I -- I went over there, and went over on the Queen Mary with 15,000 other soldiers.</span> <span id="s649">We had no place to sleep, no place to la -- ah, it was awful.</span> <span id="s650">English food.</span> <span id="s651">The English tomatoes we had them for breakfast.</span> <span id="s652">So I bitched, just like the other soldiers.</span> <span id="s653">I’m getting -- I became a bitcher.</span> <span id="s654">Now, we went over to E-England and they assigned me to the first division.</span> <span id="s655">The first division is the number one division of the United States Army.</span> <span id="s656">Is the [indecipherable] machine given to people who will get first the in -- and do in combat, always.</span> <span id="s657">So I said [indecipherable] and I joined the first division.</span> <span id="s658">And when I enlisted to the first division, and I listened to all those guys, how they all die, and before they even dead, they were so worried about everything, I says [indecipherable] maybe this is not a good place for me.</span> <span id="s659">Maybe I can get a better job.</span> <span id="s660">So I asked the colonel, I’m not so sure whether I’d -- I -- I don’t like to be on boats, and that’s -- you have to be on boats over there.</span> <span id="s661">He said, I got another job for you, the airborne.</span> <span id="s662">We need a man in a hundred -- hund -- what is it, five or six, or five or s -- five or six parachute infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: 101st Airborne?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: 101st Airborne.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: First Airborne.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: If you want that, we’ll transfer you to England to the -- the -- and you have to learn how to jump an airplane.</span> <span id="s667">That’s also a job that takes about two weeks.</span> <span id="s668">So I went -- I made 14 jumps, and they made me a paratrooper, and I -- they assigned me to a five or six parachute infantry, which is one of the regiment of the hu -- 101st Airborne.</span> <span id="s669">And that’s where I made it all the way through, through the whole war, wouldn’t -- I didn’t get killed, would you believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: So now you’re in England, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: From where?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: From England, you said you were put into the 101st, and you learned how to parachute.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Oh yeah, we -- we jumped on D-Day, you know, we jumped.</span> <span id="s674">We jumped on D-Day, the night before five -- I have the whole book here, it’s -- I jumped at -- what is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: So you left England to go on D-Day in June of ’44, to jump on -- into Normandy?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: And where did you land?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: In Carentan par -- in -- Carentan is the little French town where we had landed it.</span> <span id="s679">Say, maybe you heard Saint wi -- Mere-eglise, St. Mere-eglise?</span> <span id="s680">It’s right next to it.</span> <span id="s681">That was 101st Airborne, we jumped there.</span> <span id="s682">Very confusing, lot of people got -- lot of killed -- got killed.</span> <span id="s683">Lot of -- very, very confusing because as the -- the planes, they were -- some of the planes that mo -- listened to the -- to the -- to the real thing.</span> <span id="s684">They put them in the -- in the wrong places where they -- they were afraid to go, where there was too much flak, so that they would be shot down.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: So you di -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Lucky enough, I made it down from the airplane, and we had -- we had clickers so that we -- that we don’t have to speak German.</span> <span id="s687">The ke -- click -- click the one click and two click.</span> <span id="s688">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: So you were with other paratroopers, parachuters --</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yes, I was -- I was -- I was part of a parachute team, five or six.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: And I was -- we in charge of -- in other words, when it -- when -- when the -- when the -- the -- they’re working on the -- o-on the area, they -- they trying to clear the area, they get a -- a -- a prisoner [indecipherable] find out what’s the matter him.</span> <span id="s693">Wh-Where is he going?</span> <span id="s694">You know, the American soldiers, get going, I haven’t got much time.</span> <span id="s695">So it was very difficult sometimes to k -- to keep an American -- a German al-alive to talk to him.</span> <span id="s696">Th-There -- these -- these boys were hot from -- from ameri -- from -- from England, also in the middle of -- of -- of being shot at from all over the place, bullets and th-the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the flak was flying from -- from -- from the -- from the -- from the ships, from -- from the ba -- from ot -- it-it was -- we dug -- I dug so many holes.</span> <span id="s697">I tr -- we tried to dig down and o -- sideways, because there was so many things flying around.</span> <span id="s698">But lucky enough I made it, I made -- I got hurt a couple of times, but never -- I got see the fr -- the -- the -- the -- the por -- por -- what do you call the -- the Purple Heart.</span> <span id="s699">I got the Purple Heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: You were wounded?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: You were wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Got wounded in the town of Bastogne.</span> <span id="s704">That, I’m sure you heard about it.</span> <span id="s705">I was [indecipherable] Bastogne speaking to prisoners when they were shooting -- when the German bombs were bombing Bastogne.</span> <span id="s706">So it was not a fun -- a fun thing, even though the American soldiers are very, very, very terrific.</span> <span id="s707">They good -- they good work, hard working people, and so many of them got killed.</span> <span id="s708">Unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Now here you are, a Jewish soldier, and you’re interrogating German prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: No [indecipherable] was.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: No what?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Never mind -- never mind the name Jews.</span> <span id="s713">If they would have made the wo -- woulda -- word -- the word Jewish, or they say something like that, I would -- I would have killed them, I think.</span> <span id="s714">Maybe.</span> <span id="s715">I don’t whether I would have done that.</span> <span id="s716">You know, and I would think --</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: But what was your -- what were your feelings here --</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: [indecipherable] feelings think -- ma -- my -- basically feels that he’s a soldier like I am.</span> <span id="s719">He is a soldier like I am.</span> <span id="s720">He is doing his duty for the country.</span> <span id="s721">How can you shoot a man like that?</span> <span id="s722">You can -- when -- when you couldn’t help it [indecipherable] the shooting was going on and you hit people, you didn’t even know you’re hitting them, but when you’re right in front of them, you have them in front of you, and say you [indecipherable] you say something or I shoot, I couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s723">Not -- every day is people who do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: And there were some American soldiers who did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: There’s always somebody who gets killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: There’s -- there’s so much blood, so much blood in -- in a ca -- in a war, it’s hard to believe.</span> <span id="s728">And when you see those young kids who -- 18 and 19 years old, you see them laying in the dirt with their -- the-their stuff coming out all over, and that -- it’s a terrible thing and you never forget it.</span> <span id="s729">Enough of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: But my -- my question is, being a Jewish soldier and knowing that your parents were left over, and -- and your brother, did that influence your feelings towards these German soldiers?</span> <span id="s731">Your particular situation, do you think that influenced you?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: I don’t know, I -- yeah, I -- I -- you know, I think -- I think, when I’m a soldier, I’m a soldier against a soldier.</span> <span id="s733">Not against a Jew, or a Christian or anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: I’m a soldier.</span> <span id="s736">I’m going to kill this guy, everything, unless he kills me.</span> <span id="s737">So it really has nothing to do with -- with religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: So I -- I will -- I will -- listen, I ha -- I had awful lot of people in -- in front of me who could have been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Can you imagine how many people -- sometimes 10 - 15 guys, Americans, will bring in prisoners [indecipherable] you can’t go shoot them all.</span> <span id="s742">It don’t make sense.</span> <span id="s743">Tho -- some of those poor guys, they’re just as bad off as I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: So now you are working your way from France, and where -- wher -- how did you move through Europe?</span> <span id="s745">What was your pathway through Europe, once you’d landed, once you parachuted into France?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: After -- well, we parachuted twice, once in -- in -- in France and once in Holland --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: -- on a Jewish holiday, Rosh Hashonah, they made me jump.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Oh, you parachuted --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: The -- there was a -- parachuted -- we para -- right near a zone in -- in -- in -- in -- in Holland.</span> <span id="s751">We were there to a reunion a few years ago, with my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: This was in 1944, I guess?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: In the fall of ’44?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: No, no, no, this -- this -- this meeting we had, it was just about five years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: No, no, no, no, when you parachuted in.</span> <span id="s757">When you parachuted into Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: It was in the fall of 1944.</span> <span id="s760">It was after D-Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: After D-Day, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Yeah, so it was the fall of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yeah, well the -- that -- that was -- the war was on the way, our wa-way.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s765">And then -- yeah, an-and -- and then you -- you -- and you -- were -- you were still interrogating German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Were you still interrogating German sol --</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: I’m continue interrogating all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: What kind of questions did you ask them?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: The questions I -- where you shooting, who shooting at me?</span> <span id="s771">What kind of gun is it?</span> <span id="s772">Is it -- is it a machine gun, is it a -- a rifle?</span> <span id="s773">Are there more than five people, is there a hundred people?</span> <span id="s774">What’s -- what’s the -- what -- what for -- what’s the chance for us to get in th -- in there?</span> <span id="s775">Can we -- can we go?</span> <span id="s776">And you hope to God -- out of six guys you get one question.</span> <span id="s777">This is -- this was my job, and -- a-and whether it worked or not, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Did anybody ever ask you how -- any of the prisoners ever --</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: -- ask you why -- how do you know German so well?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: No.</span> <span id="s782">What I got, I got mostly German sol-soldier [indecipherable] officer said, if you want to kill me, shoot me.</span> <span id="s783">You haven’t got the guts.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: That’s what he said, right in my face.</span> <span id="s786">And I didn’t shoot him.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s788">But nobody asked you how did you know German so well?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s792">My German was -- must have been pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Yeah, I’m sure it was.</span> <span id="s794">And then w -- after th -- Holland, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Now after Holland came jo -- Bastogne.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: In Bastogne, then we went into Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf.</span> <span id="s798">Düsseldorf I lost one of my -- one of our officers, the colonel, and I -- and I -- and then -- he took a -- he wanted [indecipherable] he wanted to see how these things are near the Rhine.</span> <span id="s799">We would l-l-lay along the Rhine, and we lost that -- that c-colonel.</span> <span id="s800">Very nice man, very well done.</span> <span id="s801">Just killed him, just like that.</span> <span id="s802">For no reason they -- the war was almost on the way, you could see the war was on the way off.</span> <span id="s803">And he wants to go, I want to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Do you remember his name?</span> <span id="s805">Do you know -- remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: No?</span> <span id="s808">All right, so now you’re in Düsseldorf, and then where do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: I know, I know because his -- was in charge of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s811">And then you continued on from Düsseldorf to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: After war?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Düsseldorf, after Düsseldorf, where did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Where did you go after Düsseldorf?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Düsseldorf, we went towards -- Düsseldorf we went towards southern Germany.</span> <span id="s817">The Russians were moving and we were moving towards Russia.</span> <span id="s818">We were going towards the downward, down, down [indecipherable] and we ended up in -- near Garmisch Partenkirchen garden -- Garmisch Partenkirchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Partenkirchen, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: In Garmischen we were -- we were -- we found all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s821">I found Hitler’s fake -- Hitler’s signatures [indecipherable] I have them in a -- in a book.</span> <span id="s822">Do you see any things with Hitler in that pile?</span> <span id="s823">You’ll find it, if -- I found Hitler’s stationary, so I wrote some letters on that stationary and sent it to the New York Times here, or to one of the newspapers.</span> <span id="s824">I have two [indecipherable] of it here in a -- if you find any, keep them.</span> <span id="s825">Here -- you know [indecipherable] to me.</span> <span id="s826">And I-I wrote a letter to my cousin, who gave it to the Herald-Tribune I think at that time was -- it was -- it went out of business [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s827">And tells me -- tells of how a German Jewish boy goes o -- gets Hitler’s papers, writes them --</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Wh-Where exactly did you find this stationary?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Where exactly did you find this stationary?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: In his hou -- in his house on -- on -- on top of the mountain.</span> <span id="s832">In Garmisch Partenkirchen the war was over two days before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Oh, so now the war is already over.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yeah, it was all over, the war.</span> <span id="s835">So we di --</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: And Hitler’s dead, you know that Hitler --</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: You knew that Hitler was dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: No, I had no idea of anything.</span> <span id="s840">I ha -- I [indecipherable] everybody was still alive as far as we were concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: So these guys took -- took as many people [indecipherable] prisoners as possible.</span> <span id="s843">And two days after this, my colonel and I, we became friendly because he likes where I [indecipherable] I sometimes [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s844">He said -- he calls me up, he said, get going, we gotta be there, we got something.</span> <span id="s845">That was -- the war was so over, two days already.</span> <span id="s846">We got a car.</span> <span id="s847">We gotta go, we have a big fish down in Austria.</span> <span id="s848">So we went in the Jeep, two of us.</span> <span id="s849">We got into -- in Austria and we went into a -- an old [indecipherable] you know, those old [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s850">So we went in there, and there opens up a door.</span> <span id="s851">There sits Mr. Goering, with two American generals and his wife, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s852">So what do I do?</span> <span id="s853">There’s this maniac German in front of me.</span> <span id="s854">I should shoot him, right?</span> <span id="s855">In front of my colonel, and two generals?</span> <span id="s856">So the general said to me -- said -- said to my colonel that, let your men get rid of the people in this [indecipherable] and make it a -- an officer’s place, where they can stay for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s857">I went inside, and there’s Mrs. Goering, who I knew because from the movies, she’s a movie star.</span> <span id="s858">I said to, Mrs. Goering, you may have to leave.</span> <span id="s859">A matter of fact, you get your ass out of here within 15 minutes, otherwise I’ll boot you out of here myself.</span> <span id="s860">And I’m a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s861">That’s all.</span> <span id="s862">And I [indecipherable] around and she starts screaming and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s863">I said to the sergeant [indecipherable] just get rid of her.</span> <span id="s864">Get her out of the house and throw her outside, let -- let her walk out -- walk on.</span> <span id="s865">That’s my Goering -- my life [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s866">I saw him -- you see him sitting there all -- all dressed up in his uniforms and everything.</span> <span id="s867">And there’s the American generals in their Jeeps, but Goering is in this beautiful st -- fancy go -- [indecipherable] fancy car he has, and a chauffeur there.</span> <span id="s868">But he didn’t ask for [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s869">He got to Munich and he killed himself.</span> <span id="s870">That wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Did you say anything to Goering?</span> <span id="s872">Did you say anything to Hermann Goering?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: No.</span> <span id="s874">No, they wouldn’t let me -- first of all, the generals kept him -- kept me away from there too.</span> <span id="s875">That was too much of a fish for them to catch.</span> <span id="s876">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s877">See that big, fat bastard in front of me?</span> <span id="s878">After all, I know he killed my parents and he killed everyth -- so many Jewish and American and all.</span> <span id="s879">What can you do?</span> <span id="s880">Take my gun and shoot?</span> <span id="s881">I’d be dead.</span> <span id="s882">The minute I would touch my gun I’d be dead.</span> <span id="s883">Because he was too much a -- too much of a guy to fi -- they want him alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Gunter Haimann.</span> <span id="s886">This is tape number two, side A, and you were -- you had finished talking about telling Mrs. Goering to leave her house, which she did?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: What’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: You had just finished telling the story about seeing Hermann Goering and Mrs. Goering and asking her to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s890">Well, what happens -- what happens after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s892">So sh -- did she leave then?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s894">That -- that was completely out of my say.</span> <span id="s895">I was just a sergeant, I was a tech sergeant.</span> <span id="s896">These were generals there.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Okay, so you don’t know if she left.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: No, I know that -- my colonel told me they’re putting them in the -- in the -- in the Mercedes -- they put them back in the Mercedes and take them to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: That’s what he told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: And I’m sure that’s what he did because he was -- I know wa -- h-he was put -- they would have put him back in the -- into Munich.</span> <span id="s903">That’s where he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: While he was in the Nuremberg Trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: And I meant Nuremberg [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Yeah, and then he committed suicide before he was to be hanged.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: He committed suicide --</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: -- before he --</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Well, this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: -- it’s the same thing.</span> <span id="s916">He wouldn’t have lived long anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s918">So then, where did you go after that?</span> <span id="s919">You’re still -- you’re still in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Yeah, well, wa -- then th -- we had about a month of n-not too much.</span> <span id="s921">We had [indecipherable] to fill and this -- and th-that’s -- it’s beautiful -- beautiful area where we were.</span> <span id="s922">[indecipherable] in -- in -- in -- in Austria.</span> <span id="s923">It’s bel -- right below th-the German border.</span> <span id="s924">It’s very, very gor-gorgeous country.</span> <span id="s925">And th -- don’t forget, all those people are still Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: While you were in Germany, while you were there, did you feel American or German?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Only -- only American, never German.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: You did not feel German?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: No way.</span> <span id="s930">E-Even when I went to the bakery or something like that.</span> <span id="s931">No, unless the-they speak English, I never change.</span> <span id="s932">I never would dare change, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Yeah, but I meant inside, did you feel any connection with Germany, having been born --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: None at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: -- having been born there?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: I felt very ji -- I felt just where I was belong, where I belong right now, in the army, in -- i-in where I was in -- in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: What was it like for you to wear the uniform of an American soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: What kind of feeling did that give to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Supri -- su-sup-sup -- superiority.</span> <span id="s941">It is some sort of a superiority.</span> <span id="s942">It is something above [indecipherable] when you have so much in your hand, you have almost everybody there, you’ve even got a like -- you can sharpshoot anybody you want and you can -- probably can get away with it.</span> <span id="s943">So yo-you feel like shooting.</span> <span id="s944">We [indecipherable] we were not Germans, we are Americans.</span> <span id="s945">We -- yo- you should see in -- in the little town of Turamsee, the people came to flock -- flock to us, they want to be part of it, they want the -- they want a -- th-this -- the school they want to be part of, they wanted to -- to talk to us.</span> <span id="s946">And they di -- they really did -- th-th-the Austrians are much nicer than Germans.</span> <span id="s947">They were much nicer to us, because the war was over, too.</span> <span id="s948">But then, from then on was downhill.</span> <span id="s949">I’m finished after that.</span> <span id="s950">We spend about a month there, and I went mountain climbing one weekend with a -- a guide.</span> <span id="s951">They gave me a guide and we had two or three women who na -- knew the way, and they took us up -- guides, up to the mountains, to a place where we could sleep.</span> <span id="s952">Was beautiful.</span> <span id="s953">That’s a beautiful country there.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Now this you did on recreation?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: This is -- yeah, the war is over.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Did you go by -- earlier did you see any labor camps or other kind of prison camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: I-I went -- I -- I skipped that labor camp for a reason, it just hurts me.</span> <span id="s958">There was a place where -- where -- Hitler wrote a book, “Mein Kampf.”</span> <span id="s959">He made a -- a -- a ca -- a -- a --</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: This was when he was in prison, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: When he was in prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s964">He made a camp out of -- against -- for the Jews, and we come into that camp.</span> <span id="s965">I was right in the beginning.</span> <span id="s966">I -- sometimes in the beginning, sometimes we -- we switch around so we have -- so we can watch what we doing.</span> <span id="s967">And all of a sudden I see guys walking around with [indecipherable], you know?</span> <span id="s968">And -- and then they didn’t know what to do, and I didn’t know what to do either.</span> <span id="s969">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s970">I spoke to a -- the -- one of the colonels says, listen, these people haven’t eaten anything.</span> <span id="s971">They haven’t e-e -- they haven’t gotten anything.</span> <span id="s972">I don’t know -- we don’t know what to do yet ourself.</span> <span id="s973">We don’t know what the doctor says to do.</span> <span id="s974">The best thing is don’t give everything away.</span> <span id="s975">Don’t give all your candy and [indecipherable] you’re gonna hurt them.</span> <span id="s976">You couldn’t stop the Ameri -- you couldn’t stop the Americans.</span> <span id="s977">They gave everything they could find.</span> <span id="s978">They [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s979">A-And th-then -- then the -- we were there two nights, just to keep them calm.</span> <span id="s980">But they all in their uniform.</span> <span id="s981">You should see those little -- we went in th -- I went into one of those homes.</span> <span id="s982">I don’t even want to describe -- describe it because it’s unbelievable how that people can be alive in th -- it.</span> <span id="s983">What they went through and how long they were there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s984">But I don’t remember if they were wi -- man or wife.</span> <span id="s985">I don’t even remember that.</span> <span id="s986">I -- I co -- did one thing.</span> <span id="s987">I get in the middle of town -- because I speak German, I was rather involved in that time there.</span> <span id="s988">I put out on top -- on the top of one of those -- those -- those [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s989">I said, I want every one of these American -- these German soldiers to bring all their pay, all their p -- clothing, which they don’t need all the time, and even if they need, and put them in the middle of that town so these people can eat -- they can live with it.</span> <span id="s990">So the -- the -- naturally they all came.</span> <span id="s991">They all -- came all -- they all were afraid they were gonna get killed.</span> <span id="s992">You know, [indecipherable] speaking the right way, whether they like it or not.</span> <span id="s993">And I had no intention of killing anybody.</span> <span id="s994">I wasn't alone, there was 20 of us, whole uniform.</span> <span id="s995">But we got most of them, and then the doctor spoke to us.</span> <span id="s996">Don’t give them any food.</span> <span id="s997">Don’t give them anything to eat.</span> <span id="s998">It’s just killing them.</span> <span id="s999">They had nothing to eat for -- any [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1000">That was awful.</span> <span id="s1001">That’s “Mein Kampf”.</span> <span id="s1002">That was a -- I forgot that very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: What was -- what was the name of that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: “Mein Kampf”?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: No, no, no, what was the name of the camp that you came across?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: I just said -- I said, I try to forget again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Oh, okay, yeah.</span> <span id="s1008">Did you come across any other camps, prison camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: No, that’s the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: That’s the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Don’t forget, I’m -- I’m -- I’m with a first, front line company.</span> <span id="s1012">101st is no -- no -- they don’t jus -- they don’t sit around waiting for work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Did you meet --</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: I -- I-I -- I -- I was walking along in -- in Holland, into a nice area.</span> <span id="s1015">Things are quiet and they was running, the children were walking around, all of them [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1016">Next to me, everything started flying.</span> <span id="s1017">Some guys collected guns and -- and ammunition.</span> <span id="s1018">They wanted to somehow collect something or other.</span> <span id="s1019">They blew about four or five American soldiers right in the air.</span> <span id="s1020">Right here, standing there.</span> <span id="s1021">After you [indecipherable] where that happened.</span> <span id="s1022">So I tell you, I don’t care what you say, you don’t think -- those things you don’t forget.</span> <span id="s1023">But that’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: What you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: -- generally speaking, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: It’s -- it’s -- it’s not easy -- it’s not easy to repeat this, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: [indecipherable] I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s1031">Wel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Do you know, I -- I think of -- I think of what happened to my parents when they went to camp.</span> <span id="s1033">How did they -- how were they treated, or were they killed right away?</span> <span id="s1034">I hope so.</span> <span id="s1035">Will I ever find out?</span> <span id="s1036">I doubt it.</span> <span id="s1037">It’s tough life.</span> <span id="s1038">But I have a nice family now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: When you were -- when you were walking along, did you just see any survivors walking down the roads at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: You mean when I had -- when they blew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: After the war was over, and you said you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: After what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: The war was over, and you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1045">Oh, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: In Germany, did y -- yeah, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: I -- I tell you, I [indecipherable] civilians [indecipherable] too, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: At Germany, I -- I h -- I had -- I had my children there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Well, no, we haven’t gotten to that</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Yeah, but I took -- I -- I -- I came across some people who were sick.</span> <span id="s1052">They should have killed everybody, they should have killed all the Americans.</span> <span id="s1053">When you hear things like that, there -- there’s always something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1055">No, but what I was asking was, this is immediately after the war, and you had come across that one camp where you saw the survivors, but when you are out walking on the roads, did you see any other survivors walking?</span> <span id="s1056">People trying to get back to their town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Ah, the soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Soldier -- or -- or -- or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: -- some Holocaust survivors, Holocaust survi -- did you see any of them walking home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Oh, lots of them after the war [indecipherable] by the hundreds.</span> <span id="s1062">They all walk, always -- all in -- my job was a -- oh, what?</span> <span id="s1063">At least 10 or five -- 15 days, we had a group of -- I got about 30 -- 30 girls who speak German, who know how to ta -- type.</span> <span id="s1064">They got the -- in the [indecipherable] in town I wa -- I was at, and we gave discharge papers.</span> <span id="s1065">The Germans were afraid to go home.</span> <span id="s1066">They afraid to go home with their [indecipherable] without the discharge paper.</span> <span id="s1067">So we made some sa -- sa -- would you believe that?</span> <span id="s1068">But that’s true, it’s happen.</span> <span id="s1069">They were afraid that they were so -- they -- they -- they were scared, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1070">Such proud people.</span> <span id="s1071">Ph-Phony bastards, that’s all they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: So did you come across any Holocaust survivors in other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: No, only in that camp, there’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Only in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Yeah, in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: I didn’t -- I wa -- don’t forget, most of the ca -- were in -- in camps in Poland, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Right, right, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1079">And so you stayed for how much longer in -- in the army in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: To wa -- how long did I stay in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Yeah, in Europe, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: No, I di -- th-they -- they let me go in Camp Dix.</span> <span id="s1083">They took me home --</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: When did you come back to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: On the ship, on a Swedish ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: About a -- within -- within the months after the war was over.</span> <span id="s1088">It was very quick, and they put me in a -- in a Swedish ship.</span> <span id="s1089">That was difficult to [indecipherable] the police had -- the cops put -- they were afraid of -- a lot of the soldiers had a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1090">They got money paid and they were gambling like crazy on -- on -- on the ships.</span> <span id="s1091">So that also was a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: And all these problems are all with the -- cause that -- when the -- when there’s too much money.</span> <span id="s1094">But after I was back in the United States, they -- they didn’t -- within two days I was out of the army.</span> <span id="s1095">They gave me my money, I -- I -- I -- I think I got 1400 dollars pay -- back pay or whatever it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: And what did you do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: I went to -- to the aunt where -- she died in the meantime, during the war, but her ska -- her -- her a -- that’s [indecipherable] is the -- well, si -- I’m con -- no connection with -- with the -- with René, but they also connected a little bit.</span> <span id="s1098">So when I went back I went there, I went to the house.</span> <span id="s1099">That’s all I had, I had nothing else.</span> <span id="s1100">So I -- I ha -- I paid her -- I had to pay my -- my dues.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: I wanted to ask you, when you were in Germany, did you want to go back to Koblenz to check --</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: I did.</span> <span id="s1103">I did when I was in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: No, while you were in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: -- when I was in Düsseldorf, wh -- wh -- I told you the man died.</span> <span id="s1106">I took the [indecipherable] and I spoke to one of the police officers that -- what I want to do.</span> <span id="s1107">Tell him that I had my parents lived -- used to live there, and they have a house there, they had a house there.</span> <span id="s1108">I want to know what I can find [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1109">They ga-ga-gave me a Jeep and a man, and we went down the Rhine from co -- from Cologne to Koblenz.</span> <span id="s1110">And I found very little, except one person I knew, somehow was related to my uncle, who was married to a non-Jewish man -- a woman.</span> <span id="s1111">But -- and I went -- nothing really important there.</span> <span id="s1112">Listen, I -- I didn’t -- I got letters from teachers, they need [indecipherable] they need food there, that I’d always took care of you when -- when -- when -- when -- when school was on, I be -- I never gave you a bad mark, and thing -- stories -- stories like that, just to get some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: This is while you were still in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Yeah -- no, no, I’m here now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Yeah, things weren’t good after that in Germany, not right away.</span></p> <p><span

never be a place like the United States.</span> <span id="s1203">Never.</span> <span id="s1204">I mean, it’s just a very unusual [indecipherable] it’s just an unusual place.</span> <span id="s1205">To be able to -- to -- to live in a place like that, in harmony with so many people, it’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s1206">And -- and -- and most people make the decent living, and nobody’s killing themself.</span> <span id="s1207">That -- tha-that’s what I call something which -- which nobody ever will equal, I don’t think, at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Do you feel that you are a different person today, or you were a different adult because of what you went through, because of the losses you had?</span> <span id="s1209">The fact that you had to leave Germany at the age of 15 and come to the United States?</span> <span id="s1210">Would you have been a different person than you are today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: If I would have stayed in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Well, if you hadn’t had the challenges --</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1214">I think the American wa-way is the only way to live.</span> <span id="s1215">It has nothing to do with really, the other people.</span> <span id="s1216">Because here not everybody is going to be alike, but the biggest part of -- just -- just look at the -- the [indecipherable] the White House, what’s going on at -- the time.</span> <span id="s1217">It’s mutual.</span> <span id="s1218">It’s somehow mutual that they’re gonna get to a -- to a -- to a -- to a

year.</span> <span id="s1221">It’s 90 percent all of the time.</span> <span id="s1222">If it’s not good, it’s almost good.</span> <span id="s1223">And there’s gonna be some bad ones.</span> <span id="s1224">There’s gonna be a few bad ones, but very little compared to what -- what they had in the -- what they have in th -- in different pl-places the world.</span> <span id="s1225">They don’t even know how to live, people.</span> <span id="s1226">They don’t know what life is like.</span> <span id="s1227">It’s too bad -- it’s just a -- it’s too bad that I had to lose my wife.</span> <span id="s1228">That’s what hurts me more than anything else.</span> <span id="s1229">And my wife was younger.</span> <span id="s1230">She was 15 years younger than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Did she work?</span> <span id="s1232">Did she have a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Yeah, she loved to, she -- she -- she worked in a -- in an office.</span> <span id="s1234">And she had -- she worked for a gr -- [indecipherable] for people who -- who make [indecipherable] presses.</span> <span id="s1235">And she has -- took care of the office, and she had what, four or five girls working for her.</span> <span id="s1236">And she loved it.</span> <span id="s1237">She was a good worker.</span> <span id="s1238">She was the kind of wife everybody should have.</span> <span id="s1239">I know I should have said that befor -- before.</span> <span id="s1240">No, but truly so.</span> <span id="s1241">And I -- and I -- I just speak to her -- to the -- to the grandchildren about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Then you know the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: When your children were 15 years old -- when your children were 15 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: -- did it bring back memories for you of what life was like for you when you were 15 and had to leave your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: You know, I was so completely harmonized to American life that nothing else even matters in Europe, in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: There’s nothing could hurt it.</span> <span id="s1250">There’s nothing could hurt the United States in -- in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1252">Did it -- did -- how religious are you now?</span> <span id="s1253">Are you -- do you call yourself religious, or secular, how do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Well, I’ll tell you, we -- we should be a little bit more religious.</span> <span id="s1255">I -- I tell you, I -- I was Bar Mitzvah and her parents were not -- not -- not unusually re-religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: And I na -- I don’t know why I’m not more religious, I should be more.</span> <span id="s1258">But now why should I be more religious, when I lost so much of it?</span> <span id="s1259">But that’s not a fair way to look at it either.</span> <span id="s1260">So you have -- now I have -- I have families who need to th -- this religion, and I got -- I ca -- my wi -- grandchildren are terrific.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: What is it like -- you said you did go back to Germany, and you went back to Koblenz.</span> <span id="s1262">What -- what’s that like?</span> <span id="s1263">What was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: [indecipherable] more often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Ye

th-th -- my theory is that it could be very well made American, nice American co-country, that there is [indecipherable] there, they have the ingredients of a nice country.</span> <span id="s1269">They have a beautiful country and they have a -- they have a feeling [indecipherable] feeling are very nice.</span> <span id="s1270">I like that country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: But do you have feelings of ang --</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: [indecipherable] feeling towards the [indecipherable] I mean, the country itself.</span> <span id="s1273">The co -- everything you

id="s1279">Q: So, do you have any feelings of anger when you go to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: For who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Of anger, anger.</span> <span
