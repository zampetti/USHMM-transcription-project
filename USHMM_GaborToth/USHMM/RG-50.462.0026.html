were born and a little about yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">SA: I was born in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">JF: In what city?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">SA: Lodz, 1916.</span> <span id="s6">I was the only child born to my parents after 11 years they were married, and fortunate, my parents were very wealthy, and very well known.</span> <span id="s7">My maiden name is Kaplan, and I was raised, fortunately, I was raised very well, surrounded with a lot of love, over protected, having all of the things, whatever I want to have; I don't even have to ask twice, having mates in government, but I still had the time to finish my school.</span> <span id="s8">I have college education.</span> <span id="s9">I was married.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">JF: Before we get into that period of your life, could you tell me about your parents—what did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">SA: Well, my father was a manufacturer of clothing, and we have a lot of proper ties and we have our own manufacture place, and we have a big wholesale place.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">JF: What kind of community did you live in?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">SA: Strictly Jewish—as a matter of fact, the only gentile person that I know was the person which takes care of the property where I lived—how would you call this, say, janitor, yeh?</span> <span id="s14">They usually have in Poland, a family, that wasn't Jewish people, usually gentile people, and they took care of everything, like, clean the street, and Jewish people didn't do this, as far as I know in my experience.</span> <span id="s15">That was only contact with a gentile person.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">JF: The community that you lived in, was this a fairly wealthy community?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">SA: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">JF: And what about your family's social life?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">SA: My mother was very active.</span> <span id="s20">She was the vice president from ORT.</span> <span id="s21">We have this organization, the same, and my parents were very active in—they call this tzedakah—helping people, poor people, like my father used to borrow a lot of money to needed peo ple, but there was difference than here.</span> <span id="s22">You were never allowed to mention who did it for you.</span> <span id="s23">The name, they didn't publish this, they just do it because they feel that it's better to do, God gave them wealth, and they want to share with people they needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">JF: This was not through a Jewish community organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">SA: No, it was not.</span> <span id="s26">It was just private, and my father was active in the Jewish committee life—they had all kinds of names.</span> <span id="s27">If they need something, or if they had projects they wanted to build a mikva, so, my father helped them out a lot.</span> <span id="s28">And all kinds of other things which the Jewish community tried to help their own people, the best way they can, in our place.</span> <span id="s29">That means that they have all kinds of institutions: where somebody was sick, and didn't have help, there were people volunteers, to help them out, to stay with them, take care of them, because the Polish government never did nothing for a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s30">The only thing they did is taking taxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">JF: So the highly organized part of the Jewish community...</span></p> <p><span id="s32">SA: Yes, yes, definite, yes in our place, yes.</span> <span id="s33">It's called Bikkur Cholim, that means helping the sick people.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">JF: What about the synagogue experience in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">SA: My parents were very religious, so they don't have Conservative.</span> <span id="s36">I don't know if they have Conservative synagogues in my hometown.</span> <span id="s37">I only know that they have a very beautiful synagogue—a temple, like—which the women were separated from the men, but my father, he went to a place what they call a Shtibl, that means the Hasidic people, the really Orthodox people, they pray in a separate place.</span> <span id="s38">I mean, the synagogue was like more Reform for them.</span> <span id="s39">They come together and they studied the Talmud and my father was a scholar, and we have Shas.</span> <span id="s40">I don't know how you would call this.</span> <span id="s41">It's not an encyclopedia, it's more—twenty-four big Bible books, very big; then we have two sets like this in our library, and my father was a scholar all the time.</span> <span id="s42">When I remember my father if he had a minute of time, he was always sitting by the Bible and studying.</span> <span id="s43">When his friends come, they always talk about all kinds of rules and all kind of misunderstanding and they was very much involved in studying the Bible.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">JF: So he did not go to the Lodz synagogue...</span></p> <p><span id="s45">SA: No...</span></p> <p><span id="s46">JF: He went to the shtibl.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">SA: Right.</span> <span id="s48">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">JF: What did this mean as far as your Jewish training was concerned?</span> <span id="s50">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">SA: My Jewish training?</span> <span id="s52">Because I went to a school which had special Jewish training; it was like they have here, Gratz College.</span> <span id="s53">Well, we have the special—we call this a Gymnasium, that was a private school, that was not a public school.</span> <span id="s54">Like parochial schools here, that was a private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">JF: Now in your early years, you went to what kind of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">SA: I went to kindergarten when I was seven, from five to seven...</span></p> <p><span id="s57">JF: A Polish school or a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">SA: No, no, Jewish school...</span></p> <p><span id="s59">JF: A Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">SA: Yes, I never went to school with Polish children.</span> <span id="s61">All my life I went to school with Jewish children.</span> <span id="s62">I didn't even know that this existed, Jewish and gentile children together.</span> <span id="s63">I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">JF: Your associations, your friends were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">SA: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s66">JF: From this school?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">SA: yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">JF: And most of your Jewish knowledge, academic knowledge, was from the school that you attended?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">SA: The school and my home—I used to sit, I was free to ask my parents any question.</span> <span id="s70">And, I was never afraid that if I am going to ask something which is not right, because my father and my mother teach me if you have some difficulties then come to me, and I was always told the best way.</span> <span id="s71">They can explain to me.</span> <span id="s72">I told you before if something was very difficult, so I was told that a Jewish person believe in God, and God give us so much knowledge, and we cross the order our knowledge we don't understand, so our belief in God, we must be satisfied with this answer that we have believed that whatever happened, God did it, and did it for a purpose.</span> <span id="s73">I was shocked when I found out later in my teens there are so many poor people.</span> <span id="s74">I didn't even have the chance to know poor people when I was—until I was a teenager.</span> <span id="s75">When I became a teenager, I have just faced a lot of things which I didn't know before, and I asked my parents why somebody is so well and have everything, and it's not fair that other people have nothing.</span> <span id="s76">And I always want as a child, I remember I always want to know why people are poor and I would like to help them, and I did it in my teens.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">JF: How did this happen in your teens?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">SA: I was introduced to a committee, there was students, a little older than I was.</span> <span id="s79">And they had a place, like they rent a hall, and the very poor children came over five o'clock.</span> <span id="s80">They received food because there was a lot of families that the children were hun gry.</span> <span id="s81">There was a lot of families that couldn't give the heat in wintertime, and the children were frozen, their hands, and they couldn't make their homework.</span> <span id="s82">So this committee, which was from young men and women, they take care of them.</span> <span id="s83">They fed them, they make their homework there, if they have some difficult with homework, they help them, and how did we know this—it was by interviewing.</span> <span id="s84">If a family wants to help their child, they just come over or call us, and then we have the committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">JF: Who sponsored this committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">SA: We, young women, young teenagers, and students, what they we sponsor this with money what was made every Sunday at dance, and the money what we took in for the dance, we support the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">JF: So this was not affiliated with the kehilla in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">SA: No, not the kehilla.</span> <span id="s89">No, that was only the need from our people to help the poor.</span> <span id="s90">And that is what I was faced with the first time with poor people, and my mother don't even know that I went there, because I don't think she would allow me to face this.</span> <span id="s91">I was very over protected, that her child was not allowed to see nothing bad.</span> <span id="s92">But the first time when I find out we go to check the circumstances, I was just shocked.</span> <span id="s93">People don't have electricity, they don't have not even enough bread.</span> <span id="s94">And that was the first time I met, how should I say, wealth, the opposite of wealth, that is poor?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">JF: During these growing up years, did you have any occasion to experience any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">SA: Yes.</span> <span id="s97">They didn't allow students when they finish Gymnasium, then you have to go to college.</span> <span id="s98">If you was Jewish, they give you all kind excuses, but they don't take you.</span> <span id="s99">My husband I meet him in this place—what we were to poor children, because he was there a—what should I say, a director.</span> <span id="s100">Coming back from Italy, he went to medical school in Italy, because they didn't take him in Poland because he was Jewish, and they didn't even take you to the army if you were high education then, I don't know how the rule is here, then you couldn't be a plain soldier, you had to have some higher degree when you go to the army.</span> <span id="s101">Because he was too well educated, they just postponed.</span> <span id="s102">They didn't take him to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">JF: This is your husband you're talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">SA: My husband.</span> <span id="s105">Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s106">JF: Was anybody...</span></p> <p><span id="s107">SA: My first husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">JF: Your first husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">JF: Was anybody else in your family in the army—your father, or anybody else that you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">SA: No.</span> <span id="s112">I know my uncle which was the only uncle he supposed to go to the army and they did everything possible, they gave away everything, a lot of money, he shouldn't go because they know if he would go in the army, he would not come back.</span> <span id="s113">The Jewish people know that if they would go to the army, whatever they going go they would come in contact with the gentile people, they would be treated terrible, and they would never come back home, anyplace, so that's what the Jewish people did everything possible, not to go to the army.</span> <span id="s114">They even cut fingers that they should have an excuse, or take out all their teeth, or whatever, because they was afraid that would be the end of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">JF: You, then, had applied to a college and were rejected after the Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">SA: No, I wasn't rejected, because I went, in our town we had a college which you wouldn't be able to make doctor degree, but you would have your college education which was private and paid a lot of money—only the very wealthy kids be able to attend this.</span> <span id="s117">If I would like to have a profession like a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer or anything, that wasn't so popular for a woman took a profession.</span> <span id="s118">A woman has to be educated, but usually the woman is not the breadwinner.</span> <span id="s119">That was like this, maybe today's it's the same thing like here.</span> <span id="s120">So that with mine, college was no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">JF: So you did attend college?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">SA: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">JF: Were you ever in a program where you were trained for anything in particular or studied anything in particular for your future work?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">SA: Not a profession.</span> <span id="s125">I like very much to became a doctor, because I had something in me, or a nurse, but I wanted to become a doctor and surgeon.</span> <span id="s126">I have something in me with I said always, I probably was in my other life a doctor, a surgeon, because I just feel anything that has to do with medicine is just come to me like—I am here, it's me, but there was no way my parents would say, "What, you would go away from the house?</span> <span id="s127">There was no way, and a woman, a doctor?</span> <span id="s128">What did you need it for?"</span> <span id="s129">Well, this is the dream came true after the war.</span> <span id="s130">I was in Sweden and then I be able to make my nurse's degree.</span> <span id="s131">So that's what I accomplished, a little thing from my dream.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">JF: What happened after your college years in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">SA: I was very sheltered from a lot of things so that I didn't really have the experience, to face myself, like, anti-Semitism, but it was in my experience before the war, was a lot of things they just want to do against the Jews, anything possible, like, if you have a property, if you were a gentile, there was no pressure, but my father has a few properties so they pressed him to do things what was impossible, to do it, like, we don't have the bricks on the property, we had colors [painted wood sidings?</span> <span id="s134">...Ed.]</span> <span id="s135">So special to Jewish people, they had to put the grey color on, and they have to put and this in this time—which they don't have the people to do it because, all the people was taken, the painter.</span> <span id="s136">You don't even a painter to do your house and if you don't do it in this time, they gave you a very big and ankara, how do you say this in English, penalty, and you have to pay a lot of money because your house is not paint grey the way the governments want to do it.</span> <span id="s137">To this in this time.</span> <span id="s138">And then it was painted grey, they came with some other thing.</span> <span id="s139">The paint is watery and you had to paint with oil paint.</span> <span id="s140">There were no kind of things what was unbelievable hard to do even to people if they had the money, and now the professions like you was a—that's the reason Jewish [people...Ed.]</span> <span id="s141">never went to work because they didn't give them a chance to go in—if you were Jewish, forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">JF: Could you explain that a little bit more?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">SA: Yes.</span> <span id="s144">Suppose you want to be a carpenter, or you want to go and have a trade.</span> <span id="s145">No, because you are Jewish you don't belong here.</span> <span id="s146">They maybe don't tell you exactly you're Jewish, but they ask you nationality, they know.</span> <span id="s147">You put Jews, they say we gonna call you.</span> <span id="s148">They never call.</span> <span id="s149">That's the reason they ask a lot of questions why everybody in Poland, why people don't have trades like a carpenter or engineer; engineer is college—so not everybody could afford to go to college to another country.</span> <span id="s150">And that's the reason Jewish people were very limited.</span> <span id="s151">There wasn't too many—was very wealthy people be cause they don't need professions, they went like businessmen, they sell, they buy, but, uh, if somebody like to work for anything, there was no way, because you were a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">JF: Was your father's factory affected by these laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">SA: I tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s154">My father, I didn't know that he had some difficulties; he probably has but he was fortunate enough to have the money to pay.</span> <span id="s155">There was things what didn't go right because, they are like always, they don't like the Jews, but if you showered them with money or something else, that was kosher so they don't look too much in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">JF: When did you first start hearing of what was happening in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">SA: Oh, '39 I think.</span> <span id="s158">The '36, 1936 or 1937.</span> <span id="s159">I really, between this time.</span> <span id="s160">They sent the German people to a border.</span> <span id="s161">The border was Zbaszyn.</span> <span id="s162">In the beginning, they send, not the very rich people, they sent; they would just come to the house in middle of the night and they say, "Go out in a nightgown; not allowed to take nothing with you."</span> <span id="s163">"Where are we going?"</span> <span id="s164">"You will see."</span> <span id="s165">And then we have the message, "There are so many thousands of people stay in (I just said the word and I forgot) the border Zbaszyn, and the kehilla, the Jewish kehilla went there and there was terrible.</span> <span id="s166">People was at nightgowns and pyjamas, hungry, cold and they say, "Well, here is the people and take care of them."</span> <span id="s167">So I remember in my time, the Jewish kehilla...I was there between them, my parents was there.</span> <span id="s168">We brought over clothes—there was like the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s169">The Jewish kehilla right away find volunteers and we went to people what they donated clothes and they donated food and we came there.</span> <span id="s170">And when I was there, all of the people, if they have somebody to sponsor them, like a family, they let them out.</span> <span id="s171">So everybody took...I remember in my house was two families, because we had a big house and there was two families, one older couple from Germany, and a young couple, which he was a bookkeeper, and my father right away give him work as a bookkeeper, so they be able to start their life again.</span> <span id="s172">And then we build the same thing like all the German people if they didn't have their home and they didn't have anybody to sponsor them, so they came to this place and they have food.</span> <span id="s173">We feed them and I work very hard there in the kitchen, feed them, my mother, all my mother's friends, and they was sponsored by the Jewish kehilla and was sponsored by people where they have the money to put it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">JF: Was this your first exposure?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">JF: And what did these people tell you about what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">SA: They were shocked.</span> <span id="s178">Because they say that they were thinking that Germany is their country.</span> <span id="s179">That they belong to Germany.</span> <span id="s180">Some people was even—I met people were the third generation, Jews.</span> <span id="s181">They didn't even know that they were Jews.</span> <span id="s182">But they found out later when Hitler came to them and said, "We are not Jews, we are German people, this is our fatherland."</span> <span id="s183">And they show to them your great-great-grandfather or something—he was a Jew, so you was a Jew.</span> <span id="s184">I had a lot of friends like this.</span> <span id="s185">They don't even know no thing about Judaism because they wasn't a Jew, they count themselves that they not Jews, they gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">JF: What feeling did you have about what was happening in Germany in terms of whether it would affect you in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">SA: We didn't believe it would affect us.</span> <span id="s188">We was just afraid of the war, but we didn't believe—see, that was the whole thing—that we didn't take too serious about what happened in Germany—because we have a chance to go away from Poland, if we would believe that the time would come the same thing like what happened in Germany—to us, a lot of people would be left [i.e., survived, Ed.]</span> <span id="s189">, my family too.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">JF: Did you know any people who left?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">SA: Yes.</span> <span id="s192">They even came to my parents and they said, "We going to leave it and if you want to go with us."</span> <span id="s193">And my father said, "What do you mean I'm going to go with you?</span> <span id="s194">Where am I going to leave all my things, my factory, my property, what are you talking?</span> <span id="s195">Where should I go now?</span> <span id="s196">And that was the wrong thing because they don't believe that the time would come that Hitler would do things.</span> <span id="s197">Knowing what he was doing in his country, they were really very naive.</span> <span id="s198">If they went to the third generation Jewish people, but we don't believe that he would come to Poland, that he would be so strong.</span> <span id="s199">We believed that the war would start in Poland, Poland would go to war and they would not come over.</span> <span id="s200">You couldn't believe it sometime; you see reality, but it is very had to believe that.</span> <span id="s201">I, myself, was in Auschwitz and I saw crematoriums; they told me they burned your people and I said, "It's not true.</span> <span id="s202">How in the world can people burn people in the Twentieth Century?</span> <span id="s203">How is it possible; there was when the people were wild, God knows how many thousand years ago, they didn't do even this, too?"</span> <span id="s204">And they say, "Look, the steam is out;" I say, "Maybe they have a factory or something, and maybe they just want to scare you to death."</span> <span id="s205">That what I was feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">JF: You mentioned before that you had been married previously...</span></p> <p><span id="s207">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">JF: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">SA: I was married in 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">JF: And your husband you said had been trained as a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">JF: In Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">JF: Was he able to practice medicine in...</span></p> <p><span id="s215">SA: No, he didn't finish...</span></p> <p><span id="s216">JF: He didn't finish?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">SA: No, he didn't.</span> <span id="s218">There was a year he missed because we was married and my parents took him to their business and he didn't finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">JF: So he worked in your father's business?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">JF: Were you living with your parents then at that time or had you established your own home after you were married?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">SA: I had my own condominium, how you call this here, because in the same property on where my parents lived, so I have my own place, but we was with our parents because I was the only child and my parents just feel that the only happiness they could have in life is, to be together.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">JF: Did you have any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">SA: I had a son, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">JF: Is he alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">SA: No, no, he is not...</span></p> <p><span id="s227">JF: What year was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">SA: The year after my 193-, in the beginning of '38 and I will remember him.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">JF: When did things start changing for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">SA: The things start changing for me when they come.</span> <span id="s231">Well, first of all, we had a ghetto [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s232">JF: You mentioned the ghetto.</span> <span id="s233">Could you back up a minute and talk about the time preceding the invasion?</span> <span id="s234">Did you have any idea that this would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">SA: No, we don't, but later on, that was like 1939, they came over, that was a Friday night, we was told to close the windows with black at night not the lights because that was a time of war and we hear a lot of bombs, airplanes coming down and they came over Friday night [September 1, 1939, Ed.]</span> <span id="s236">.</span> <span id="s237">I don't think that the army didn't fight with them too long—because they were too strong and I think we have a lot...</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s239">JF: This is tape one, side two of an interview with Mrs. Sally Abrams, October 13, 1981, with Josey Fisher.</span> <span id="s240">You were mentioning the spies?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">SA: Yes, the Polish army must have a lot of spies because if the soldier want to put on the shoes, the shoes were two left shoes.</span> <span id="s242">The bullets didn't fit to the guns and everything was so mixed up they don't even have a chance to fight them back, so they came over—and on the streets, people were showering them with flowers, the German army...</span></p> <p><span id="s243">JF: The Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">SA: I don't know.</span> <span id="s245">I didn't do it but I saw it.</span> <span id="s246">Probably Jews, too, as my mother said, "Look, they are not so bad," she says, "I went through a war with the German people in 1914, and they are not so bad as we think."</span> <span id="s247">So we allowed to have the lights, they took the curtains away right from the windows and everything was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">JF: So both Jews and non-Jews welcomed the Germans...</span></p> <p><span id="s249">SA: Yes, they were all...[unclear] with flowers.</span> <span id="s250">A few days later, we was sitting in our house with our uncle and aunt, all our family which they came from a small place because they were told that they would murder all the Jews, so they left their wealth and everything and came over to us, because in a big town, they felt they more safe.</span> <span id="s251">And all of a sudden, we [heard a] knock on the door and two Germans from the Gestapo came over with guns, and I run to them and I was begging them, "Please don't take my husband!"</span> <span id="s252">And they said, "Are you the owner of this property?"</span> <span id="s253">I says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s254">"So give me all the money what you have and all the things what you have, if not,"—my child was sleeping in another room.</span> <span id="s255">They walked to another room and they put the gun right to his head.</span> <span id="s256">If not, he would be dead in a minute.</span> <span id="s257">I started to cry so.</span> <span id="s258">"I give you everything in the world, but please let them live!"</span> <span id="s259">And whatever I have in the house, jewelry, diamonds, a watch, money, whatever I have I went to the drawers and my husband was just numb.</span> <span id="s260">We usually we know if they come they just take away the man and that's what we figured would happened to the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">JF: Where did they take the men?</span> <span id="s262">What was your knowledge of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">SA: We really didn't know where, but we was afraid, everybody was afraid, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s264">The second day that was like...must be a propaganda too, because they said all the men should leave; if they would find men, they would murder them.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">JF: Where were they supposed to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">SA: They don't know, they were supposed to leave town, but they say if they find men, they murder them.</span> <span id="s267">So everybody run away, and they say to Zizing there was a small town near our place, Lodz, and the men started to walk there.</span> <span id="s268">All the men, like armies, and the minute they came into this open place, there must be from them [the Germans...Ed.]</span> <span id="s269">that they did it, the Germans, because they shot them down right away, with bombs, with machine guns, on the way that must be made up, that the whole rumor, that they did it because they wanted to kill them.</span> <span id="s270">It was easier to kill them if they walked than to come to every house and kill them.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">JF: How many men do you think were in that...</span></p> <p><span id="s272">SA: Hundreds of hundreds of thousands.</span> <span id="s273">My own husband started to walk away, but he came back and he said, "No, I can't do it, whatever happens to me I want to be together with my family."</span> <span id="s274">But all the people what they walk away, they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">JF: These were all men from Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">SA: Yes, yes, they went to Zizing, that was a small town, when they were told one talked to the other and nobody really knows how the rumor start.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">JF: How did they decide to go to that specific town?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">SA: Because one talked to another and say, "When we stay here we are going to be killed."</span> <span id="s279">How this rumor start, I don't know, but I am suspicious that the Germans, they do this, because they were prepared there, and the same way when they were walking they were prepared with bombs and gun machine.</span> <span id="s280">They just shot them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">JF: How did you find out about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">SA: Some of them came back, what they tried to survive, and they told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">JF: And how many days was this after the invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">SA: A few days.</span> <span id="s285">A few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">JF: What happened then when the Germans were in your home?</span> <span id="s287">Would you describe...your husband, this was after this period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">JF: After this massacre?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">SA: Yes, after this massacre they were talking that we going to have a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">JF: The Germans left your home.</span> <span id="s292">You were...to backup just a minute.</span> <span id="s293">When the German men were in your home...</span></p> <p><span id="s294">SA: Yeah, when they have the money and they have the jewelry, they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">JF: They left?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">SA: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">JF: And no one was hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">SA: No, no one was hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">JF: And it was after this point that they talked about the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">SA: Right.</span> <span id="s301">How did I know they talk about the ghetto, I find out—and we had a man which was a roofer, a gentile, and he was doing our roof.</span> <span id="s302">He used to come to our house for just to get work, and to be paid.</span> <span id="s303">One day, I opened the door.</span> <span id="s304">I was, still had the maid there.</span> <span id="s305">A man came over with a uniform and I look at him and I says, "Mr. Berger," and he started to talk to me German.</span> <span id="s306">And I said, "Did I make a mistake, are you Mr. Berger which fix our roof?"</span> <span id="s307">And he says in German, "Yes, I am a..</span> <span id="s308">.</span> <span id="s309">Volksdeutsche."</span> <span id="s310">We didn't know this he is, maybe he wasn't; I don't know.</span> <span id="s311">I know that he was gentile.</span> <span id="s312">And he said, "I am sent from the government to be your Treuhä nder."</span> <span id="s313">Treuhä nder means in German, he's going to take all the properties and all the things what we have—under his—he's going to take care of them—because we are Jewish people, not allowed to have nothing—and he started and then we started to talk pretty friendly and I said, "Well, who sent you?"</span> <span id="s314">And he said, "The Government.</span> <span id="s315">I am a Volksdeutsche and this is mine.</span> <span id="s316">What you have here now that everything is mine."</span></p> <p><span id="s317">JF: So all of your family properties were given to this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">SA: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s319">He said but unfortunate, he don't know how to write and how to read, so he depends on us, but my husband has to take all the books and do it for him.</span> <span id="s320">He came every day and things what he has to do—like, go to an office or something—my husband has to go, and do for him.</span> <span id="s321">So he had a special tickets he went that this and this Jew goes with this and this man for business, so my husband was allowed to go out from the ghetto, with him, to put the money in the bank or other things, and came back after an hour or two.</span> <span id="s322">But when he was in my house, I don't know, maybe something a little conscious in him, I don't know what, but he was looking at my son and he didn't have children, and he said, "We going to close, going to be a ghetto.</span> <span id="s323">You going to be taken to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s324">They going to shave your heads.</span> <span id="s325">They going to torture you.</span> <span id="s326">Please give me your son, he will survive.</span> <span id="s327">I don't have children," he said, "and I will take care him as my own child."</span> <span id="s328">And I was looking at him and I laughed so terribly.</span> <span id="s329">I says, "You must be crazy.</span> <span id="s330">What are you talking...what are you talking?</span> <span id="s331">How do you know?"</span> <span id="s332">He says, "If you live long enough, you will see that everything that I told you will be the truth."</span> <span id="s333">And my house where we lived was in the corner, and my house was supposed to be not in the ghetto—but my house would be in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s334">I would be able to stay there, and he said to me, "You are unfortunate because your child could still remain here," he said, "with me—as your Treuhä nder because other people has to just leave the house and go out, and go where the ghetto is, where they make wires and in this and this quarters all the Jews has to come together if they have place or not."</span></p> <p><span id="s335">JF: So your home was the edge...</span></p> <p><span id="s336">SA: Yes, that supposed to be.</span> <span id="s337">So all my friends and all my families they brought together whatever they need to stay with me because we have a pretty big house, and the last minute he came over to me and he said, "You have to leave the house.</span> <span id="s338">This house is too pretty and too big to give them this for you.</span> <span id="s339">That's what they decided," he said.</span> <span id="s340">He even do me a favor, he said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s341">I'll want you to take out things what you feel that are very necessary for you and I'm going to turn my head and pretend that I don't see it, and you have to leave the house."</span> <span id="s342">And I was so naive and so dumb that I said to my husband, "You know what?</span> <span id="s343">I'm going to take the keys and they not going to go in."</span> <span id="s344">Some of friends, even my husband, said, "Let's demolish everything, the mirrors, the crystals, the everything."</span> <span id="s345">I said, "Please, don't be so, well, what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s346">We going to come back, again."</span> <span id="s347">Then I took the keys from everything, and I left with nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">JF: You took nothing with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">SA: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s350">Just a few, but he, himself, the Treuhä nder, Mr. Berger was his name, he said, "You going to walk out with nothing.</span> <span id="s351">I told you—you could take something, whatever you needed."</span> <span id="s352">I was so shocked I was so—that was unbelievable to me that people could do this, something like this, so I took out a few things, a few clothes and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s353">Everything was left there.</span> <span id="s354">As a matter of fact, all of the wealth from other people was brought to this house, and this house was—they demolished it later on, I was told, and made a beautiful public park from the place after the war.</span> <span id="s355">And we was taken to small quarter of our town, wired around with electric wire and surrounded by German soldiers and we have to live in this quarters.</span> <span id="s356">Some people lived with a few families in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">JF: How did you find a place to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">SA: Fortunate, my husband's parents was living in—like, a condominium in this place where they have the ghetto, so in the beginning, we were living together, for a long time, a year, and then my husband found a little room on the third floor, which we moved there...</span></p> <p><span id="s359">JF: Another building?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">SA: To another building, yes, not too far from my husband's parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">JF: So that just you and your husband and your baby were taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">SA: And my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">JF: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">SA: Yes, I lost my father a few months before the war; he died naturally.</span> <span id="s365">He was operated and he died.</span> <span id="s366">So he was fortunate not to face the war.</span> <span id="s367">And I live with my mother, my husband and my son in the ghetto, and everybody has to go to work.</span> <span id="s368">And we were five years in this ghetto facing that every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">JF: What kind of work were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">SA: I was fortunate, too, because I have a lot of friends and they know me so I work in a drugstore.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">JF: A drugstore inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">SA: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">JF: What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">SA: I was in the laboratory and preparing all kinds of syrup and we had...They sent very little medication for the Jews.</span> <span id="s375">Sometimes we were with nothing, and some days they sent a little, so we have to make from the little tablets; we have to make medication and we tried to survive and to give the people the best care we can so there was a lot of work.</span> <span id="s376">There was—they sent sometimes sugar; we'd be able to make syrup, but sometimes for months we would have nothing, we just have to...people were dying on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">JF: Were you paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">JF: By whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">SA: By the Jewish kehilla.</span> <span id="s381">You know, we had the top of the kehilla, was a man, his name was Rumkowski, and they make him the top—like from the—he's supposed to be running the ghetto.</span> <span id="s382">And the Jewish kehilla, the few people what they were left, we have a lot of people what they were very brave and some of them went out from the ghetto—dangered their life.</span> <span id="s383">They could be shot.</span> <span id="s384">But some of them was fortunate to come back and bring food for sick people and they supply us with the minimum it's possible to survive, because a lot of people, every day, you could see dead people on the street, swollen from hunger.</span> <span id="s385">They were laying down, there was...terrible, the children.</span> <span id="s386">And every day was another selection, you faced that almost every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">JF: Your food was rationed.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">JF: About how much food were you...</span></p> <p><span id="s390">SA: Very little food, sometime we could survive for a week without bread, and if they give you bread, there was rationing so little that you really don't know what to do with it.</span> <span id="s391">Then the Jewish kehilla, they start to make like, kitchens in every quarter to...There was cheaper to cook soup and everybody came to with their own pot and they ask how many people you have in the family and they give you so much which wasn't really food.</span> <span id="s392">Maybe people what they work that they have a little more.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">JF: In other words, instead of distributing all of the food, they cooked it and then distributed...</span></p> <p><span id="s394">SA: Yes, they cooked it...</span></p> <p><span id="s395">JF: And distributed it...</span></p> <p><span id="s396">SA: Distribute cooked.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">JF: Could you buy any food with your own private money?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">SA: No, no.</span> <span id="s399">You could only buy—You have ration, your food.</span> <span id="s400">There is so much today.</span> <span id="s401">You go to this and this store and so much ration would be, if you show your identification.</span> <span id="s402">But we didn't have stores to buy food.</span> <span id="s403">Only thing we can buy with our money, there was a very little, like, medicine or to pay a doctor, but not food.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">JF: What kind of work was your husband doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">SA: My husband was in hospital—I forget the name of the hospital, my God, and almost have the function as a doctor, because they were very short in help.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">JF: This hospital was within the walls of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">JF: Staffed by Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">SA: Yes.</span> <span id="s410">Everybody in the ghetto was Jewish.</span> <span id="s411">There was no other people, no gentile people.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">JF: Was your mother also working?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">SA: Yes, she has to work or if she wouldn't work, she would be taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">JF: And what about your son?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">SA: My son was small.</span> <span id="s416">My son was, we still supply our children.</span> <span id="s417">We do the best we can.</span> <span id="s418">Like, he went to kindergarten.</span> <span id="s419">We had a few volunteers, which we put together for the children to be occupied.</span> <span id="s420">So we had like a kindergarten for the children and any day you take your child and you put them in this room, and you don't know if you going to find them back, or if you'll be back.</span> <span id="s421">Then, you say good-bye in the morning.</span> <span id="s422">Everybody went to their own work.</span> <span id="s423">You didn't know what's going to happen to you, because they used to come and they used to come to places and just they say, "Today the children will go," and they took all the children in a place and they say, "We take the children away."</span> <span id="s424">And if you going to say, "Oi," or if you going to protest or something, "Remember, we going to kill you together with your children."</span> <span id="s425">That's what they did.</span> <span id="s426">Because a mother, she couldn't be—just stay quiet when she see that somebody is hurting her...so automatically she has to scream or something, so she was killed and the children was killed.</span> <span id="s427">So every day was another selection.</span> <span id="s428">One day was old people, the second day was young people, the third day was children, and then the fourth day was sick people.</span> <span id="s429">So you never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">JF: You say that volunteers took care of the children in these nursery schools...</span></p> <p><span id="s431">SA: Yes, they really wasn't paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">JF: They were able to do this work as opposed to doing another work...</span></p> <p><span id="s433">SA: No, that was all right.</span> <span id="s434">If they say they work with the children, they was tolerated for a while.</span> <span id="s435">But later on we don't, there was very little children left so this was, just out.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">JF: Was there any kind of education for the children going on in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">SA: As much as you can just do like private, not professional people like teachers.</span> <span id="s438">We just tried to survive.</span> <span id="s439">We even have theater, we have concerts.</span> <span id="s440">We have some few musicians.</span> <span id="s441">We have a library.</span> <span id="s442">This only thing to pretend that our life would go on.</span> <span id="s443">Just to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">JF: Were these schools or the teaching that you referred to before, was it organized in one place, or was it done individually by people in their homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">SA: No, it wasn't organized in one place, like, my son was in kindergarten—that was used to be a school there, so we brought the children there, but later on, they took care of a lot children, they just took them in buses—out—and they say that they going to keep them for a while.</span> <span id="s446">They going to bring us back the children.</span> <span id="s447">Just not to panic.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">JF: Did anybody believe them?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">SA: In the beginning they believe, but later on, we just stopped to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">JF: Was there any kind of religious ceremony going on in...</span></p> <p><span id="s451">SA: In the ghetto, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">JF: Regular services?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">SA: As much as possible.</span> <span id="s454">No, there wasn't, no.</span> <span id="s455">We don't have special places—private, in the house if you feel it's a holiday today, so you private, but people was so absorbed with surviving, and food, that every day, if you survive, that was like a miracle.</span> <span id="s456">There was only—like you just want to live this day, you don't think what's going to happen tomorrow, because you know—that you have no way of knowing what's going to happen tomorrow.</span> <span id="s457">So much thing happen in one day.</span> <span id="s458">And there was all kind of things.</span> <span id="s459">They took people, young people, and they say they going to take them to a special place, they going to work, and they going to pay the families, but then, and some families received some money, like, their sons—they work in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s460">That's what they say in another place, and they received the money for their son, for a short time, some survived and some died.</span> <span id="s461">They gave them awfully hard work to do in the ammunition factory...</span></p> <p><span id="s462">JF: The Germans paid the families...</span></p> <p><span id="s463">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">JF: For their son's working?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">JF: And this continued throughout the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">SA: For a short time.</span> <span id="s468">No, very short time.</span> <span id="s469">Later they stopped because this person wasn't here anymore.</span> <span id="s470">And they pay us not with their money, with our money, the ghetto money...</span></p> <p><span id="s471">JF: They used the ghetto money?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">SA: Of course, we don't have the money.</span> <span id="s473">They used to get it from...</span></p> <p><span id="s474">JF: Did you have any knowledge of where these people were going, what was happening in the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">JF: In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">SA: Yes, I have cousins, they survived.</span> <span id="s478">They were sent out—to very hard work.</span> <span id="s479">Very hard labor.</span> <span id="s480">In an ammunition factory, in a factory for chemicals what they became sick, their lungs...[not clear], I don't know the name of it.</span> <span id="s481">It was a very danger chemical which you get red hair and your skin get yellow, and sooner or later, you couldn't survive on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">JF: Now, did you hear from this family when you were still in the ghetto, were you able to get any news?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">SA: No, none, no, no.</span> <span id="s484">Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s485">When they go out, we didn't know where they are.</span> <span id="s486">Because nobody came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">JF: You have no idea, then of the extermination camps...</span></p> <p><span id="s488">SA: No...</span></p> <p><span id="s489">JF: While you were in the ghetto in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">SA: They were talking about—but we really don't believe it.</span> <span id="s491">Maybe we try to consciously not believe it, like, a self-defense, but, yeah, they start to talk, some people say when they take them out, they torture them and they die, and some people say different.</span> <span id="s492">As a matter of fact, when they took us out, there was a chief of the German army which took all the people from the street and talked to them.</span> <span id="s493">He said, "I promise you a hair wouldn't fall down from your head.</span> <span id="s494">You go to a beautiful place which you going to be together with your families, with your children, and this is a place which you going to have a light work, you going to be paid good, you going to have food, and don't worry about nothing.</span> <span id="s495">I promise you," he said, "in the name of my wife and my children."</span> <span id="s496">Rebofe was his name, now I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">JF: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">SA: Rebofe, yes.</span> <span id="s499">And they [The Germans, Ed.]</span> <span id="s500">were happy, too, and they have the ghetto, they don't have to go out to the front to get shot.</span> <span id="s501">They don't have to fight.</span> <span id="s502">That's the reason they tried to keep it as long as possible, that their life should be saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">JF: There were German soldiers patrolling...</span></p> <p><span id="s504">SA: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s505">JF: The inside of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">SA: The inside was Jewish police.</span> <span id="s507">They have Jewish police.</span> <span id="s508">They have Jewish hospitals.</span> <span id="s509">Everything in the ghetto was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">JF: Can you tell me a little about the Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">SA: Well, the Jewish police really kept, as much as they could, people from crimes—like we didn't have nothing to heat our room.</span> <span id="s512">So some people went to places and they just took out the wood, demolished, and bring home and use it.</span> <span id="s513">And that was a crime, because the Jewish police was controlled by the German police, and if they patrol and they saw something like this, they just killed the person.</span> <span id="s514">So the Jewish police tried to protect as much as possible the person he shouldn't steal, he shouldn't be killed.</span> <span id="s515">And they have a lot of things that are—like people start to dig from the ground and try to plant vegetables that the family should survive if they will have enough vegetables.</span> <span id="s516">So one person try to steal from the other—like this was my neighbor, and I didn't have it so he went to the place.</span> <span id="s517">This is what the police was protecting, too.</span> <span id="s518">As much as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">JF: You feel that they were helpful, then, to the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">SA: I think so, yeah; if they wouldn't be then there would be just, people get wild.</span> <span id="s521">They had to be controlled.</span> <span id="s522">Yes.</span> <span id="s523">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">JF: What kind of treatment did you receive from the German guards who were involved in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">SA: Treatment?</span> <span id="s526">Shot.</span> <span id="s527">If you went too close and they say, "Go away," if you didn't go away so fast—we have curfew: to this and this time you can't be on the street.</span> <span id="s528">If you were five minutes later on the street, you get shot.</span> <span id="s529">Terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s530">You was just afraid to look on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">JF: Were they inside the ghetto patrolling or only around the perimeter?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">SA: They was patrolling around, but some of them was inside, too, some places.</span> <span id="s533">What they feel that—maybe people would go in and survive because they would be able to take something from—so they patrol inside, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">JF: Were you aware of anybody who was able to get in and out of the ghetto with any kind of safety?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">SA: I, yes.</span> <span id="s536">I know a person who did it; I think he is alive today in Israel.</span> <span id="s537">He went—like he play—that he is together with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s538">The Gestapo was like—he bring them—Jewish people.</span> <span id="s539">Like I said, he know this and this family.</span> <span id="s540">They still have some jewelry, or if they still have something valuable—so he went to the Gestapo and told them this and this family is wealthy.</span> <span id="s541">So they called the people to the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s543">JF: This is tape two, side one, of an interview with Mrs. Sally Abrams, on October 13, 1981, with Josey Fisher.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">SA: So he was playing like he would be on their side, but actually he was a very good person.</span> <span id="s545">He make a lot of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">JF: He told them that certain families [unclear]...Were these actual families or was he...</span></p> <p><span id="s547">SA: No, that was the truth.</span> <span id="s548">Some of them still was able to smuggle in before they went to the ghetto, their diamonds, gold, furs...</span></p> <p><span id="s549">JF: So he turned these families over to the Gestapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">SA: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s551">And the Gestapo took from them anything they have, and they trust him, like, he was one from them, right, because they didn't know the Jewish people, they need Jewish people to tell them about us, right?</span> <span id="s552">But, he was so friendly with them that he was able to get a uniform as a German soldier, and he went out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s553">If they would catch him, he would be killed.</span> <span id="s554">And he knows a lot of the places where he can buy food, so he went there and he bought food, and bring over to the ghetto and save a lot of people...lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">JF: He did this several times?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">SA: Yes, as much as he would be able to do it.</span> <span id="s557">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">JF: And he was able to do this successfully?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">SA: Yes, but the Jewish people hated him because they didn't know the truth because they say, my God, he is a Gestopovich, he's going—he's a big traitor, he's goes to them and tells...</span></p> <p><span id="s560">JF: An informer?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">SA: Yes.</span> <span id="s562">But later on he realized what he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">JF: And this man is still alive in...Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">SA: I think so.</span> <span id="s565">He's in Israel.</span> <span id="s566">I forgot his name.</span> <span id="s567">I will come to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">JF: Was anybody able to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">SA: Gertner was his name.</span> <span id="s570">Gertner.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">JF: Gertner?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">SA: Yes.</span> <span id="s573">Escape from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">JF: Uh-uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">SA: Well, they were shot, they tried.</span> <span id="s576">I don't think they was left alive.</span> <span id="s577">Anybody which tries was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">JF: You heard that they were shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">SA: Yes.</span> <span id="s580">Later, not when I was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s581">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">JF: Can you describe any other aspects of the ghetto to us?</span> <span id="s583">What it was like on the streets—what...</span></p> <p><span id="s584">SA: Terrible.</span> <span id="s585">Terrible.</span> <span id="s586">Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">JF: What it was like to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">SA: Terrible.</span> <span id="s589">Terrible.</span> <span id="s590">You have to be very strong and you have to be really a super person to stay in the ghetto, and live, because you see on the streets people begging for food, children swollen, dirty.</span> <span id="s591">Very hungry, wild.</span> <span id="s592">You see, on the streets people dead, what they was laying down waiting if the wagon would pick them up.</span> <span id="s593">You was afraid every minute you faced any little thing, any little knock on the door, any little thing what somebody was talking loudly, you think, oh, the Gestapo is here, they going to take me, they going to take me and my child.</span> <span id="s594">You didn't know one minute from the other what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s595">There was a nightmare, it was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">JF: People were brought into the ghetto from other towns outside of Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">SA: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">JF: What was the interaction between the natives and the newcomers?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">SA: Some of the newcomers find work, but they were young people, but a lot of people what they brought in, like, they brought in the, Gypsies, they put them in one quarter of special houses, a few of them, overnight.</span> <span id="s600">In the morning, you found, you go in to the house and you found that they were be in middle of supper.</span> <span id="s601">You found a little food on the table, a spoon on the table, and the walls were spread with blood.</span> <span id="s602">The floor was with blood.</span> <span id="s603">I don't know—we didn't know if they took them out and they shot some of them, they shot some inside.</span> <span id="s604">There were terrible screams, but nobody was allowed to go there.</span> <span id="s605">They just disappear.</span> <span id="s606">But you see in the house what happened—a massacre.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">JF: One large group of Gypsies were brought in...</span></p> <p><span id="s608">SA: Yes, right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">JF: And how many people do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">SA: Few hundred.</span> <span id="s611">I don't know.</span> <span id="s612">I don't know.</span> <span id="s613">We was not allowed even to go near.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">JF: Was this the only time that a group of Gypsies was brought in like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">SA: No, there was from Czechoslovakia, people brought in.</span> <span id="s616">Some of them gen tile, they didn't have—like a husband was Jewish and the wife was gentile, or other people, like some of them couldn't take it, the hard life, and they die very soon.</span> <span id="s617">Very, very soon.</span> <span id="s618">They couldn't find work and they was taken out, because if you don't look good, if you was sick, they look at you, they just take you out and kill you.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">JF: Were there any public executions?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">SA: There must be, but I didn't see.</span> <span id="s621">I heard of it, but I didn't see.</span> <span id="s622">Like they say, "You going to end like he end."</span> <span id="s623">And they didn't like they took a group of people—I didn't see personal, but I heard of it that they took a group of people and they just kill or hang somebody and they say, "If you not going to follow our instructions, you going to wind up like he or her."</span></p> <p><span id="s624">JF: How did you feel about Rumkowski and the rest of the Jewish Council?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">SA: I know Rumkowski before the war.</span> <span id="s626">He used to come to my father.</span> <span id="s627">Always for money, because he was, he didn't have children of his own, but he was, he has orphans and orphanage homes.</span> <span id="s628">He always came to this children, if you need clothes or something.</span> <span id="s629">I remember that he came to our house and said, "I need so much clothes, winter is coming for the children."</span> <span id="s630">My father used to give it to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">JF: He was soliciting contributions for his orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">SA: Yes, but, uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s633">JF: What was he like?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">SA: In the ghetto?</span> <span id="s635">No, before the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">JF: Mmm...</span></p> <p><span id="s637">SA: Normal, normal, but in the ghetto, he was terrible, wild, terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">JF: Can you describe him to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">SA: He was thinking, maybe in his own way, he didn't want to do nothing bad, but it came out like—he, himself, sent people to death.</span> <span id="s640">Maybe thinking that if he sends so many people, may be the people in the ghetto would survive.</span> <span id="s641">I think this way that he wants.</span> <span id="s642">Like we have in Warsaw was the capital from Poland.</span> <span id="s643">They had somebody which they want to make him the same as Rumkowski was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s644">He commit suicide, because he said, "Who I am to give people away or do things," and he couldn't take it, but he took it a long time because he has his own guard...</span></p> <p><span id="s645">JF: You're talking about Rumkowski?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">SA: Yes, yes, he has his own guard, he has his own favorite people, and he used to put in writing that if somebody is his favorite, he should go to this and this place where they give the ration, he should have double.</span> <span id="s647">He used to do favors to his friends, but people hate him.</span> <span id="s648">They were thinking clearly that he shouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s649">For who is he to give out people to die?</span> <span id="s650">But I myself think that he would think, "All right, if I give so many people to the Gestapo, maybe I can save the other people."</span> <span id="s651">That was my only way of thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">JF: Do you think that the Jewish council was able to help your people in Lodz during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">SA: They help as much as they could.</span> <span id="s654">No, they wouldn't be able to do nothing more because they were told if they didn't do the things what the Germans told them, they just killed them.</span> <span id="s655">They wouldn't be able to do nothing more, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">JF: During those years in the ghetto, did you feel the same way towards Rum kowski as you do now—at the time that it was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">SA: I, I didn't have him because I know him before that he wasn't a person like this, that he would really be happy to kill people.</span> <span id="s658">People don't know him from before, but I personally felt that if he wouldn't do it, somebody else would do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">JF: You had mentioned before that he became wild.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">SA: Yes, he became wild, like, doing things that he not supposed to do, but it he wouldn't do it for the other side, he would be killed and the other—he said to himself, because, I had a friend who was his secretary.</span> <span id="s661">She used to be mine—I used to go with her to school—I used to talk about him a lot with her and she said to me, "He has favorite people, what he give them, the talents"—they call it talent is permission for more food.</span> <span id="s662">But he said in the meantime, he was saving a lot of people.</span> <span id="s663">If they would come to him and they would say, "Look, I need 200 people today," and he wouldn't give them the 200 people, then they would take anybody; they wouldn't take 200, they would take a thousand.</span> <span id="s664">So he in his own mind was thinking, "All right, I'm going to do whatever they say.</span> <span id="s665">Maybe, I'll be able to save them."</span> <span id="s666">But the majority was very mad on him, because they was thinking that he shouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s667">But if he wouldn't do it, they would do it anyway.</span> <span id="s668">I know, when I was in concentration camp, they brought him there: him, and he was married in the ghetto, his wife and his brother, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">JF: Did you get to talk to him when...[unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s670">SA: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s671">They just kill him right away.</span> <span id="s672">No, they just brought him and they show it to him.</span> <span id="s673">"You see where your people are?</span> <span id="s674">They are in here."</span> <span id="s675">And they said to the people in concentration camp, "You can do with him anything you want; if you want to kill him, kill him."</span></p> <p><span id="s676">JF: You saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">SA: I was told.</span> <span id="s678">I just saw when he came.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">JF: You saw when he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s680">SA: Yeah, I wasn't able...I was, yes, taken from the train and came because it was far away and they say, "See now they got Rumkowski; that means nobody is in the ghetto anymore; the ghetto is clean, because he was till the last minute."</span> <span id="s681">I was pretty lucky because I was taken out to Bergen-Belsen in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">JF: So you heard from other people that he was shown to the group...</span></p> <p><span id="s683">SA: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">JF: And that they were told that they could do whatever they wished [unclear] with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">SA: Right.</span> <span id="s686">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">JF: Do you know what happened?</span> <span id="s688">Did you hear what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">SA: They kill him.</span> <span id="s690">They kill him, I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">JF: The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">SA: The Germans, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">JF: Did you hear what happened as far as the Polish people's response...</span></p> <p><span id="s694">SA: To him?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">JF: To him.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">SA: They were very mad on him.</span> <span id="s697">They were very mad on him.</span> <span id="s698">They say, this what I was told.</span> <span id="s699">They say, this what I was told, that they want to kill him, but they didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">JF: They didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">SA: They didn't, no.</span> <span id="s702">The Germans killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">JF: Now, you were in the ghetto until 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">SA: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">JF: Was your family still with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">JF: All the family that had started out together was still together?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">SA: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">JF: Can you tell me what happened then in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">SA: A small amount of people was left in 1944, like, doctors, nurses, and police, and they was just put in to a few small quarters, and we live a few days there.</span> <span id="s711">I had my mother with me, and I know, I was aware of it, that if they would see my mother, which was not old at all, but she was looking older, that they would kill her, maybe us, too.</span> <span id="s712">So I was told to leave my mother, and the place where we live before, and I should go with my husband and my children to other quarters where we was allowed to stay, not knowing what's going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s713">I told my mother that I am going to leave her for a few hours, at night, because daytime, she couldn't walk out—because if they would see her daytime, they would kill her.</span> <span id="s714">So I begged my mother, and I say, "Mom, stay here till night, if it's going to get dark, then I'm going to try to bring you where we are now."</span> <span id="s715">Thank God, I succeeded.</span> <span id="s716">We are, me with my husband.</span> <span id="s717">Our life was very bad, in danger, big risks, but we did it, and we smuggled my mother into the place where we was stationed for a few days.</span> <span id="s718">And then the way I told you before: Reboke was his name, he was the commander of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s719">He has a big speech to all of us and he say, "Tomorrow, you take the more necessary things with you.</span> <span id="s720">Don't take bad things; good clothes, whatever you have the best, take with you.</span> <span id="s721">You going to be sent to arbeitslager, that means a place where you be able to work, you would remain with your families together, and I swear on my wife and my children that the hair wouldn't fall down from your head.</span> <span id="s722">You'll be safe."</span></p> <p><span id="s723">JF: Did you believe him?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">SA: No.</span> <span id="s725">I didn't know what to believe.</span> <span id="s726">Just to think that we have to go, and we didn't know where, that was terrible, as the whole life there—but this was like the end of it, that you didn't have enough strength just to take this anymore.</span> <span id="s727">But we was put in the train, not in a normal train, in a train that had no windows that they bring all the merchandise, not for people, and we was so packed in like sardines—and no food, no water, nothing.</span> <span id="s728">A lot of people died there, in the trains.</span> <span id="s729">They were very weak and hungry, and they just died.</span> <span id="s730">Some people have small children and the children died.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">JF: You were still together?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">SA: Yes, we were still together, my mother, my husband and my child, yes.</span> <span id="s733">There was a very small window which only one eye could look out, and one of the people there—saw walking people, their heads were shaved...</span></p> <p><span id="s734">JF: How long were you on this train?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">SA: A few hours.</span> <span id="s736">And they have stripes on the floor, blue and grey.</span> <span id="s737">And on every opening from the train which you can open and close was a German soldier with a gun.</span> <span id="s738">And this person asks the soldier, "What's here," and he says, "Don't pay attention, just these people are crazy.</span> <span id="s739">It's a mental place."</span> <span id="s740">Well, this was the place where we was bound—Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">JF: You were only on the train a few hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">SA: I was a few hours on the train which the conditions were terrible.</span> <span id="s743">Some people have diarrhea, some people—was terrible.</span> <span id="s744">And they opened the door and that's all I remember was screaming and hitting.</span> <span id="s745">"Los, los, los!"</span> <span id="s746">[quick, quick, quick] If somebody couldn't go quick down, they was pushed on the floor and hit and that's all I know.</span> <span id="s747">My husband was taken away; I was left with my mother and my child—and people were screaming, crying, and two men which was working there—Jewish men—came over to my mother and they say to her—I was walking with her—"Is she your daughter?"</span> <span id="s748">She says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s749">"Whose child is this?"</span> <span id="s750">I says, "Mine."</span> <span id="s751">Two men said to my mother, "Take him and let her go by herself."</span> <span id="s752">And I looked at him and I said, "Who are you to say what I should do?"</span> <span id="s753">And we came to the point where German soldiers started in the front of us and they took all the women and the children.</span> <span id="s754">"Los, los!"</span> <span id="s755">to like there was a place here, like, an opening from another place, and I was staying with my mother, and my mother grabbed my child and she started to walk, and I said, "Where are you walking?"</span> <span id="s756">I said, "Wait!"</span> <span id="s757">And the soldier just put, "Los down," and my mother left with my son and I started to scream.</span> <span id="s758">I said, "What are you doing?</span> <span id="s759">This is my child, this is my mother, this is not her child."</span> <span id="s760">And he look at me and say, "Los, you are crazy," and somebody came to me and said, "Don't holler, he's going to shoot you."</span> <span id="s761">I started to holler.</span> <span id="s762">I don't care what he's going to do.</span> <span id="s763">So another soldier came to me.</span> <span id="s764">He look at my [me?]</span> <span id="s765">nice, and he says, "Look, be quiet, I'm going to tell you something.</span> <span id="s766">Your mother goes to a special place, to an old age home; your child will go to a special place for children now.</span> <span id="s767">They going to treat them very nice; going to be able to see them for the weekend.</span> <span id="s768">Please don't holler.</span> <span id="s769">Your life is in big danger.</span> <span id="s770">You see him?</span> <span id="s771">He's going to shoot you right away."</span></p> <p><span id="s772">JF: This was the German guard who told you this?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">SA: Yes.</span> <span id="s774">Right.</span> <span id="s775">A German guard.</span> <span id="s776">And I was left, and ten minutes later, they told me, I don't believe it.</span> <span id="s777">There was a terrible smell, and there was a whiff not that far away, how do you call if you to burn something and...</span></p> <p><span id="s778">JF: Smoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">SA: Smoke, and some people say, "You see, this is the smoke from our people; what just took them on the other side."</span> <span id="s780">And I fight with them, "Please don't talk like this.</span> <span id="s781">That's not true.</span> <span id="s782">They promise me I will see my child, I will see my mother"—and that was the end.</span> <span id="s783">And then I was left by myself; didn't have any power to live.</span> <span id="s784">I didn't do nothing to survive.</span> <span id="s785">As a matter of fact, I wanted to go a few times to the gate; the gate was elec trocuted.</span> <span id="s786">I wanted to go a few times and finish my life because I was left alone completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">JF: What stopped you from doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">SA: Sometime when I walk there, a German soldier said, "Halt; don't go too close."</span> <span id="s789">And a few days later when I was there, I found a relative, was my cousin—she was ten years younger than I am, and when she saw me, we stayed together, and anytime I want to go out and I said, "I can't take it anymore."</span> <span id="s790">Something came to my head and say, "Look, if you going to do something, you could help her to survive—she is such a young child.</span> <span id="s791">You have nobody else from the family," and then I guess God want me to live because he put in my head, maybe, when the war would finish, you would find your family together, not believing that they were not anymore, that they are burned in crematorium.</span> <span id="s792">Probably there was like a self preserve myself, I don't know, but it happened because anytime I was tortured, and I look up to the sky and I saw the sky and the stars and I say, I pray to the stars and say, "Please, if I'm to survive, please let my family survive.</span> <span id="s793">I should be able to meet them," and then I said something strong was in me, like, I said to myself, "They could torture you, they could not give you to eat physically, but what I have here, inside, they are not allowed to touch and they would never touch.</span> <span id="s794">They could do so much physically with you, but they would mentally they could not disturb you.</span> <span id="s795">You going to remain you."</span> <span id="s796">And I guess that this helps me to survive because other people—they do something maybe for their survival, maybe they—I don't know, maybe some people was able to get some more food one way or the other.</span> <span id="s797">I don't know.</span> <span id="s798">But I didn't do nothing to survive.</span> <span id="s799">As a matter of fact, I was sent twice to the gas chambers and I didn't do nothing to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">JF: Can you describe those times for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">SA: Yes.</span> <span id="s802">We had selections, they called it.</span> <span id="s803">Mengele, Dr. Mengele.</span> <span id="s804">You heard about him.</span> <span id="s805">He put everybody out because we had like a long, they called a barrack, a long, like, a factory made from bricks which the people what they came before us they build themselves—they make the people build this barracks and there was very primitive—there was no quarters, nothing.</span> <span id="s806">Just was, just like to shelter from the rain.</span> <span id="s807">So he took everybody out from the barracks with very big reflectors, very big lights, naked, completely naked and you have to hold your hands up.</span> <span id="s808">That means, you couldn't have nothing hide, and with very big lamps, look over you and he had a left side and a right side and we never know, which is the good side—the left side or the right side.</span> <span id="s809">They say, people say, between them that when the selection some people what they took it out, they going to go to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s810">So my little cousin, she was operated in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s811">She had gallbladder operation in the ghetto, and she had an open wound.</span> <span id="s812">The scar wasn't completely healed.</span> <span id="s813">Well, when she was naked, I was afraid they would see this, they would send her to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s814">So, I didn't know what to do with myself.</span> <span id="s815">Put her in front of me, then she would be sent to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s816">So I put her in back of me and I wanted to hide her side.</span> <span id="s817">So I was just probably making a back turn, and he look at me and he said, "On left," and I went to the left.</span> <span id="s818">And my little cousin, he said, "On right."</span> <span id="s819">He didn't see the scar.</span> <span id="s820">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s821">And when I was walking on the left, somebody, a German woman, I don't know who she was, I never saw her in my life—she went through to him and she said, "Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s822">Look on her, what did you put her on this side?</span> <span id="s823">Look, she is so young, so beautiful."</span> <span id="s824">So he was very angry.</span> <span id="s825">I remember one thing—he took me here with his fist and he push at me so far that I couldn't stop running until I fell.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">JF: He pushed you at the back of your neck?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">SA: Yes.</span> <span id="s828">He pushed me in the front.</span> <span id="s829">I should run.</span> <span id="s830">Like he said, "Run."</span> <span id="s831">And I start to run and I couldn't stop until I stop and I fell down.</span> <span id="s832">And I found myself, by myself, and I look around and I say, "Where I am, who, who?"</span> <span id="s833">Then I saw the people walking, with the right side.</span> <span id="s834">So I went to them and they say, "My God, how are you doing here?</span> <span id="s835">You come to us, they will thinking that you want to run away."</span> <span id="s836">And they saw what happened to me.</span> <span id="s837">That was one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">JF: Before you leave this incident, you say that your cousin had received surgery in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s839">SA: In the ghetto, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">JF: This was still in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">SA: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">JF: And her wound was open?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">SA: The scar wasn't completely healed and if they see on your body, any little thing, they send you right to the gas chamber—because they were selected only the young and the people that they still could survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">JF: Was this soon after that you got to the new concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">SA: A few months, yeah, soon, because I wasn't too long in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s846">I was sent to another place, but the second time I survived in Bergen-Belsen it was—I probably had a lot of fever and pneumonia, whatever happened.</span> <span id="s847">I don't know.</span> <span id="s848">I faint and I was laying on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s850">JF: This is tape two, side two of an interview with Mrs. Sally Abrams, October 13, 1981 with Josey Fisher.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">SA: So, I was on the floor, and they cover me with a shmata [an old rag] and I'm dead; and that happened in the same barrack with me was a doctor, Ginsburg was her name, and she was a close friend of mine.</span> <span id="s852">So usually the doctor always said, "Who is this?"</span> <span id="s853">And they say, "This is Sally Bebber."</span> <span id="s854">Bebber was my name from my husband.</span> <span id="s855">And they say, "Sally Bebber died," and she take off the shmata and listen to my heart, and she says, "She not dead, she's alive."</span> <span id="s856">So we have this what called like a Krankenstube, the sick people was taken.</span> <span id="s857">So I don't remember what happened, but I remember one thing—that my body was pulled and on the stones.</span> <span id="s858">They put me probably in the shmata and they pull me to this Krankenstube, this place where the sick people are.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">JF: This, say the word again—kanken—.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">SA: Krankenstube, that means, not a hospital, but there was a place where sick people, they attend sick people.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">JF: But you received no treatment there?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">SA: No, no.</span> <span id="s863">That's all I remember is I was left, and a bucket of ice water was poured all over my body, and I remember like—shivering from cold, that's all I remember.</span> <span id="s864">I must be unconscious for a long time.</span> <span id="s865">But one day, Mengele came over and I open my eyes, and he sit in one place and he said to me, "You have pain in your throat."</span> <span id="s866">I couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s867">I just sat with my head like this, and he said to the person which was taking care, the nurse, "Make her inhalations or something," that she should give me steam or something because he used to do this.</span> <span id="s868">He used to come to sick people and make them well, and then make experiments on them.</span> <span id="s869">And then killed them.</span> <span id="s870">Well, I don't remember nothing what happened, but one thing I remember, I open my eyes.</span> <span id="s871">It was very dark, and I saw a light, two candles.</span> <span id="s872">And I said to myself, "This is you die already."</span> <span id="s873">And then you see the two candles.</span> <span id="s874">Who is there, and I was looking around and I see a girl in the white uniform.</span> <span id="s875">And I was thinking, "You are dead, that's the way you die.</span> <span id="s876">That's not bad."</span> <span id="s877">And probably my tears was running, but I didn't feel nothing.</span> <span id="s878">And this girl come over to me and she said, "What are you crying?"</span> <span id="s879">I says, "I don't know that I'm crying."</span> <span id="s880">But I said, "Are you dead, too?"</span> <span id="s881">She says, "What do you mean, am I dead?</span> <span id="s882">I talk to you."</span> <span id="s883">I said, "I'm dead, no?</span> <span id="s884">I see two candles."</span> <span id="s885">She says, "You see two candles because it's Friday night.</span> <span id="s886">I just light the candles."</span> <span id="s887">I said, "Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s888">I didn't see the candles so long till I walk out from my house."</span> <span id="s889">And probably I fell back unconscious.</span> <span id="s890">Then I felt, I don't know how long this took, somebody is pushing me and stroking and and saying, "Steh auf, steh auf.</span> <span id="s891">Wake up, wake up."</span> <span id="s892">And I open my eyes and I saw the same girl, and she said, "Come down with me.</span> <span id="s893">I'm going to take you someplace."</span> <span id="s894">And I couldn't move.</span> <span id="s895">I said, "What do you want from me?</span> <span id="s896">I can't even move."</span> <span id="s897">She says, "I'm going to help you."</span> <span id="s898">And she practically carried me down and she opened the door and there was a lot of clothes and she was looking at dresses and she took a dress—a very big dress—very white, black velvet, and put on me.</span> <span id="s899">She said, "That's going to keep you warm.</span> <span id="s900">Come with me."</span> <span id="s901">And I said to her, "What are you talking?"</span> <span id="s902">There was a curfew and you was not allowed to go out from the barracks; if you go out, you was killed.</span> <span id="s903">And she says, "Come, come with me.</span> <span id="s904">It's O.K." She said, "I'm going to take you."</span></p> <p><span id="s905">JF: Where were these clothes from?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">SA: I don't know.</span> <span id="s907">That was like a room, probably from people that are dead, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">JF: And the candles—was that permitted in the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">SA: No, I don't know nothing—there was no barrack, there was like a Kranken stube, it was sick people.</span> <span id="s910">I don't know.</span> <span id="s911">I have no idea what is permitted or not.</span> <span id="s912">Of course, not in our barrack, there was nothing permitted.</span> <span id="s913">And she practically dragged me like she hold me with both hands, and we was the only one—dark, and she, the door opened and she pushed me to my barrack.</span> <span id="s914">My barrack was the Number 31.</span> <span id="s915">And people was looking at me and he said, "Who in the world brought you here?</span> <span id="s916">They didn't kill you?"</span> <span id="s917">And I told them the story.</span> <span id="s918">I says, "I don't know if I'm alive or dead."</span> <span id="s919">That happened to me.</span> <span id="s920">And the same night, 5:00, they took out all the people that was there together with her, to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">JF: Including the woman who had gone [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s922">SA: Yes, everybody, everybody.</span> <span id="s923">Then I figured out later on that she probably wants what she did.</span> <span id="s924">She wants to save me.</span> <span id="s925">And I never saw this woman before.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">JF: She was a German woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">SA: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">JF:

everybody.</span> <span id="s936">No, they don't even make a selection, who was good, who was sick, and who was healthy.</span> <span id="s937">Everybody put in a big truck, and went to the gas chamber with them, and that was the second time I was saved from the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">JF: What happened after you were on the truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">SA: I wasn't on the truck.</span> <span id="s940">I was in the barrack.</span> <span id="s941">She was—they took the people from the Krankenstube on the truck...</span></p> <p><span id="s942">JF: Oh, I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">SA: I was in my barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">JF: It was the Krankenstube that was taken...</span></p> <p><span id="s945">SA: Yes, right, right.</span> <span id="s946">I was there a few weeks—then I was sent to different kind of places and I always have my little cousin with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">JF: Before we leave Bergen-Belsen, can you tell me what conditions were like there in terms of your living conditions...</span></p> <p><span id="s948">SA: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">JF: What the barracks were like?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">SA: Terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s951">It couldn't be worse.</span> <span id="s952">I don't think that animals would sur vive now.</span> <span id="s953">Not in this kind of conditions because it was terrible.</span> <span id="s954">We don't even have a place, a place to sit.</span> <span id="s955">I remember I was standing and sleeping.</span> <span id="s956">You not allowed to go out even you have to go through your normal human functions.</span> <span id="s957">You have a time when you have to go out, good or bad.</span> <span id="s958">If you be able to take care, it's O.K.</span> <span id="s959">If not, you just made wherever you stay, and the conditions was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">JF: There were no bunks in your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">SA: No, no, you sleep—there wasn't even a floor in my barracks.</span> <span id="s962">In my barracks was only not cement, but was mud.</span> <span id="s963">There was only put bricks together.</span> <span id="s964">And we was not even—I don't even have a place to stay, not to sleep.</span> <span id="s965">And there was terrible—one time happened to me they took us—all of us—they took us to a place and they say we are going to have—we going to get washed.</span> <span id="s966">And then we know if they tell you that you going to have a shower, you know they going to gas you.</span> <span id="s967">That was we know it, already.</span> <span id="s968">And we was all prepared for this and I bless it.</span> <span id="s969">I said, "Thank God, everything would end."</span> <span id="s970">And I look on the showers that the gas should come out and I see water is coming out.</span> <span id="s971">We was naked.</span> <span id="s972">All the dresses was out.</span> <span id="s973">How can you believe it?</span> <span id="s974">We talk to each other, we say, please touch me, "Are you have water?"</span> <span id="s975">"Yeah, we are wet."</span> <span id="s976">And we wait for the gas and the gas didn't come—water.</span> <span id="s977">And they bring us soap and we was washing ourselves.</span> <span id="s978">And after a while, German Gestapo—who knows as says—they came with, from rubber...</span></p> <p><span id="s979">JF: Whips?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">SA: Whips, and they start to whip.</span> <span id="s981">"Schnell, schnell, schnell!</span> <span id="s982">Aus!</span> <span id="s983">Aus!</span> <span id="s984">Aus!"</span> <span id="s985">Winter, 40 degree, wet, everybody grab a dress and when it came to me, I didn't have a dress.</span> <span id="s986">Everything was taken.</span> <span id="s987">There were ten girls left naked.</span> <span id="s988">They probably grabbed two dresses.</span> <span id="s989">No, they say grab—some people wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s990">I was left naked with ten other girls.</span> <span id="s991">Then they start to whip us.</span> <span id="s992">We have to run to the barrack naked.</span> <span id="s993">When I came to my barrack naked, we was standing and shivering—no clothes.</span> <span id="s994">O.K.</span> <span id="s995">Then the stubabba [?]</span> <span id="s996">is the girl what she is supposed to take care of the barracks, the eldester they call her.</span> <span id="s997">So she had a little more food for her work.</span> <span id="s998">So she came over and she brought all ten of us a quilt to cover.</span> <span id="s999">So we don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1000">Should we laid down on the mud or cover ourselves, or should we put it on the mud, the blanket, and lay naked?</span> <span id="s1001">They always used to take me in the middle, because I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1002">I must have looked terrible, I must be very thin or something because they always say you going to freeze to death.</span> <span id="s1003">So I was in the middle.</span> <span id="s1004">I remember one, few minutes or hours, I don't know, they put the cover on ourselves.</span> <span id="s1005">I feel on the top I feel nice and on the bottom, I feel I was in mud.</span> <span id="s1006">I was cold.</span> <span id="s1007">They probably felt the same thing so they do another way.</span> <span id="s1008">We put the quilt on the mud.</span> <span id="s1009">I, we was staying five days like this.</span> <span id="s1010">Naked completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">JF: All ten of you were like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">SA: All ten of us, yes.</span> <span id="s1013">Then they brought us some shmata, I don't remember what, but they brought us some shmata.</span> <span id="s1014">I always say they give us shoes from wood so I always was lucky to have a small—I couldn't put my feet in.</span> <span id="s1015">So I was holding the shoes in my hand running barefoot.</span> <span id="s1016">That was very cold so I put my feet in and I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1017">I don't know how I survive, really, it's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1018">First of all, they put chemical in your food.</span> <span id="s1019">What this is very important that you stop to have feelings.</span> <span id="s1020">You don't know, if you are woman, first of all the girls, the first minute, everybody lost the period [menstrual, Ed.]</span> <span id="s1021">from the shock.</span> <span id="s1022">I didn't have, didn't menstruate for as long as I was in concentration camp and when I came to Sweden, it took a few months until I came back to my normal.</span> <span id="s1023">But, you don't have a feeling.</span> <span id="s1024">You was like a robot.</span> <span id="s1025">Whatever they tell you to do, you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">JF: There was a chemical that was put into your food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">SA: Yes, definite.</span> <span id="s1028">Because the doctors in Sweden ask me: they say, "If you would only know how it looks [the chemicals, Ed.]</span> <span id="s1029">you could tell us a lot, that we would give you needles, we would give you medicine to bring you back," because when I came to Sweden, I was 60 pound.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">JF: How did you know they were giving you a chemical?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">SA: Because, later on, when we came to Sweden, when they examine our bodies, they found out a lot of things what happened to our blood we don't know.</span> <span id="s1032">I only know one thing: that your head wasn't working completely and you have nothing, I wouldn't say energy because energy you couldn't have anyway because if a person is cold and so hungry, there is no way of having energy, but we don't have in our heads something to say, "They going to kill you anyway, do something to survive."</span> <span id="s1033">You was like a robot.</span> <span id="s1034">They tell people to dig graves.</span> <span id="s1035">They know the graves is for them.</span> <span id="s1036">They did it.</span> <span id="s1037">If you know you're going to die, you dig your grave.</span> <span id="s1038">At least you could hit somebody.</span> <span id="s1039">At least you could do something, spit in his face, what you want to do.</span> <span id="s1040">We don't have nothing which was working in our brains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">JF: So you saw no resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">SA: No resistance whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1043">I was told that there was a few people that they brought them there.</span> <span id="s1044">There was one girl, she was in the show business from French, and they tell her to take off the clothes, naked.</span> <span id="s1045">So she took the gun from the German soldier and she killed him.</span>

and don't open the crown [water spigot?]</span> <span id="s1332">because you going to die, it's poison.</span> <span id="s1333">I said, "Well, God sent it to some at the right time."</span> <span id="s1334">I opened the spigot—rusty water came out, like brown, and I was drinking, drinking, and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1335">And I said, "Well, this is it."</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">JF: You did this on purpose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">SA: Yeah, and what happen?</span> <span id="s1338">I wake up, and I had no diarrhea anymore.</span> <span id="s1339">Would you believe it?</span> <span id="s1340">This looks really like not true.</span> <span id="s1341">I wake up and I felt refreshed.</span> <span id="s1342">I slept, I drinked the water, and no diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1343">Then they start again.</span> <span id="s1344">I don't know how long we was there, they start again with the whips to chase you out, out, out.</span> <span id="s1345">And we came to another camp.</span> <span id="s1346">I don't remember, when we walk out from Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s1347">Nobody want to believe that we are not killed because there is a—nobody walked out from this place alive.</span> <span id="s1348">Where was I taken?</span> <span id="s1349">To Bergen-Belsen?</span> <span id="s1350">No.</span> <span id="s1351">There was another

think.</span> <span id="s1355">Yes, I was there not too long.</span> <span id="s1356">Yeah, was before.</span> <span id="s1357">And from this place from Gross-Rosen, and we was sent to a—I don't remember where—it was not far I think from Bergen-Belsen, because being there, there was talks that the German people are losing the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">JF: The talk was where?</span> <span id="s1359">In Gross-Rosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">SA: No.</span> <span id="s1361">In the other camp—I don't remember the name.</span> <span id="s1362">And they were talking that the German people were losing the war—which we don't want to believe.</span> <span id="s1363">But one day, we look out from the barracks—we was not allowed to go out—because it seems that I see now that it was the end of the war, close to the end.</span> <span id="s1364">We saw big trucks coming in and somebody said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s1365">They all left us—all the German soldiers are not here anymore.</span> <span id="s1366">We are left by ourselves."</span> <span id="s1367">And we start to walk out and was true.</span> <span id="s1368">There was no soldiers.</span> <span id="s1369">The house that they live was empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">JF: This was the camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">SA: After Gross-Rosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">JF: After Gross-Rosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">SA: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1374">And the big trucks came in with civil people and they say that they going to take us to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1375">We start to talk about the war, and they say, "Yeah, it's almost the end."</span> <span id="s1376">On the way, we saw soldiers with white...</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">JF: Arm bands?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">SA: Arm bands.</span> <span id="s1379">My cousin said, "What this means white?"</span> <span id="s1380">I say, "Before the war, I know it.</span> <span id="s1381">The soldiers had the white flag, or white—that they are giving in.</span> <span id="s1382">That is like I'm not going to fight anymore.</span> <span id="s1383">I'm giving in.</span> <span id="s1384">They was, I said what I know—what I don't know what this means here."</span> <span id="s1385">But we was taken to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1386">Bergen-Belsen was almost empty.</span> <span id="s1387">The old people what they went there died.</span> <span id="s1388">There was a big epidemic of typhus, diarrhea, and we was there a few days, and my cousin, that was summer, that was not winter anymore, it must be '45, because I was taken in May, I think, no, before, later, June, July, but it was summertime.</span> <span id="s1389">My cousin became very ill with very high fever.</span> <span id="s1390">She couldn't lay in the barrack anymore—so there was tents outside.</span> <span id="s1391">I put her in the tent and I was near her.</span> <span id="s1392">She couldn't even eat what they give it to her.</span> <span id="s1393">And I felt that I was going to get sick very bad.</span> <span id="s1394">So I take the bread what we have what we couldn't eat and I gave to one girl and I said, "Show me where I can get help.</span> <span id="s1395">They should take her a hospital, a room, anything."</span> <span id="s1396">And she told me, she says, "Go straight here."</span> <span id="s1397">I gave her all the bread what I have, "and you going to find somebody there what they will take her to the hospital."</span> <span id="s1398">I came there, and I must be very sick with high fever.</span> <span id="s1399">I remember one thing.</span> <span id="s1400">Ask for help and then I remember, like two soldiers took me by my arms, and bring me over to a room what must be a doctor there, because he was dressed in white and he said to me, "Stick out your tongue."</span> <span id="s1401">And he said, "She is kaput, she is done."</span> <span id="s1402">That's all I remember.</span> <span id="s1403">I wake up and I was in the Krankenhaus again.</span> <span id="s1404">Not able to move, and I look at my skin and all the skin was like I would be burned, bubbles, and the bubbles open and the water was running down—and this water must be poison because I was had all my body was full of wounds, and I couldn't move.</span> <span id="s1405">And I was laying and there was a German girl—Autie was her name—she bring me food and water and I wake up one day and I said, "Why did you sit on my leg?"</span> <span id="s1406">And they say, "Nobody is sitting on your leg."</span> <span id="s1407">They open the cover and my leg was like this.</span> <span id="s1408">I have thrombosis, blood clot.</span> <span id="s1409">So one leg was like this...</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">JF: Swollen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">SA: Swollen.</span> <span id="s1412">I don't think there were doctors, but must be helped—private, but anyway, I was listening, how they say that they have to cut off the leg.</span> <span id="s1413">Why they didn't do it, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1414">I was there...I don't know how long I was there, and I was always asking where my cousin is.</span> <span id="s1415">I says, "I left her and she don't even know where I am."</span> <span id="s1416">I had no answer for it, nobody cares.</span> <span id="s1417">But one day when I was there, I guess, I was operated with open wound because it was very painful and I couldn't lay down.</span> <span id="s1418">I have to lay on my stomach.</span> <span id="s1419">Somebody came, I should sign papers.</span> <span id="s1420">We going to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1421">I don't even know, don't remember; I probably signed the papers and they took me out...</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">JF: Were you ever informed as to what this other infection or whatever was on your skin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">SA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span

my body and the body was like poisoned, and when I was in this stage, I weighed sixty pounds.</span> <span id="s1428">I have no eyelashes, I lost my whole eyelashes, my whole eyebrows, and I lost my hair.</span> <span id="s1429">I must look like a ghost.</span> <span id="s1430">I never look in the mirror.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">JF: You were still in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">SA: I was in Bergen-Belsen, and I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">JF: And who was treating you?</span> <span id="s1434">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">SA: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1436">Probably not doctors.</span> <span id="s1437">Yes, I wasn't even—I was so sick and I was not allowed to drink.</span> <span id="s1438">I probably must have a lot of liquid in my body.</span> <span id="s1439">I don't know if they were doctors or nurses.</span> <span id="s1440">Some people, I was truly more unconscious than conscious because I had typhus, and had typhus and stomach typhus together and I was not in a coma, but I was delirious, talking from the fever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">JF: Had the war actually ended at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">SA: No.</span> <span id="s1443">The war was ended, but when they took me to Sweden, that was in Sweden was Chrabia Bernadotte [Count Folke Bernadotte, Ed.]</span> <span id="s1444">.</span> <span id="s1445">He was the head of the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">JF: This was in what month you went to Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">SA: That was summertime—I remember the flowers.</span> <span id="s1448">It was May...Is May flowers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">JF: Summer of '45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">SA: Flowers—yes, flowers already—yes.</span> <span id="s1451">May, it must be.</span> <span id="s1452">And this Chrabia Bernadotte went to Germany and make a change.</span> <span id="s1453">He gave them so much food or trucks, whatever, that he should be able to take out 200, the sickest, people and take them to his country and save them.</span> <span id="s1454">And I was between the 200.</span> <span id="s1455">We went to Lü beck—Lü beck is Germany, already, but I was two weeks in Lü beck because I had developed a sickness—yellow joint...</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">JF: Jaundice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">SA: Jaundice, yellow, you're yellow in you.</span> <span id="s1458">I was not allowed to move.</span> <span id="s1459">So I was two weeks there, treated, and then they took us with Red Cross army ships to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1460">There was with the army—so means they steal us.</span> <span id="s1461">But they change, they take a next change, 200 and they took us to Kalmar: Stockholm is the capital, Kalmar is the second.</span> <span id="s1462">Took us to the hospital and again, I was thinking I'm dead.</span> <span id="s1463">I wake up.</span> <span id="s1464">I was in a real bed with white sheets.</span> <span id="s1465">I look around.</span> <span id="s1466">I had a night table and there was like silver, a cup for your tea, a cup to drink water, and there was from the Red Cross army—no, from the Red Cross was a little box was a lipstick, little powder, it was toothpaste, there was a brush, and all of a sudden, I hear music, and I say, "Oh, my God!</span> <span id="s1467">It's so good to be dead.</span> <span id="s1468">You stay in a bed and it's so clean.</span> <span id="s1469">And it's so nice, it's real beautiful room, and I hear music," and look with my head and I saw the Salvation Army, so dressed in uniforms and they play music, and all of a sudden a man came over to me, tall, not young, put flowers on my bed, give me a kiss on my forehead and talk to me in Swedish, and I was just looking.</span> <span id="s1470">I didn't understand nothing, but I look at him and I saw a tear from his cheek.</span> <span id="s1471">And then I must fall asleep and then the nurse came to me.</span> <span id="s1472">She was talking Polish and I said to her, "Are you dead?</span> <span id="s1473">And tell me, it's so good to be dead.</span> <span id="s1474">It's so beautiful here."</span> <span id="s1475">She said to me, "You're not dead."</span> <span id="s1476">I says, "What do you mean?</span> <span id="s1477">I was in Bergen-Belsen and this is not Bergen-Belsen."</span> <span id="s1478">And she says, "No, you are in Sweden," and she said to me.</span> <span id="s1479">I says, "Well, and the music?"</span> <span id="s1480">She says, "The Salvation Army playing for you and you going to have the best care as possible.</span> <span id="s1481">We all promise to take care of you."</span> <span id="s1482">And I look at her and I say, "You just want to make me feel good, but this is not true."</span> <span id="s1483">I says, "I remember a man came to me and give me flowers.</span> <span id="s1484">Who would give me flowers and kiss me?</span> <span id="s1485">I had nobody."</span> <span id="s1486">She says, "You know who the man was?"</span> <span id="s1487">I says, "No."</span> <span id="s1488">She says, "That was King Gustav.</span> <span id="s1489">That was the king from Sweden.</span> <span id="s1490">He said he came to greet you."</span> <span id="s1491">And—I was there three months.</span> <span id="s1492">So I was in Sweden, I was three months there and we was treated wonderful.</span> <span id="s1493">They gave us clothes, cosmetics, anything we need.</span> <span id="s1494">It was a wonderful country.</span> <span id="s1495">There was a lot of people from ours [Poland?]</span> <span id="s1496">and they take care of everybody real good.</span> <span id="s1497">And, uh, later on after the three months, I felt that I had to do something—to show myself that I can take care of myself and I was still with my little cousin.</span> <span id="s1498">She was coincidentally sent to Sweden—and I found her on the paper, her name, and she was in another place, and yeah, I forgot to tell you, that before we took sick—that was in Bergen-Belsen, we heard voices from planes.</span> <span id="s1499">"You were liberated, you are free, we are here from England and the United States.</span> <span id="s1500">We have plenty of food for you and we have everything for you.</span> <span id="s1501">But don't touch the food what's left in Bergen-Belsen—because everything is poisoned.</span> <span id="s1502">And we couldn't tell you the reason that we couldn't come right up, down, to you, but we will as soon as possible."</span> <span id="s1503">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">JF: You heard this before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">SA: Yes.</span> <span id="s1506">Before I, yes, before I left.</span> <span id="s1507">Yes.</span> <span id="s1508">In Bergen-Belsen, before I took sick.</span> <span id="s1509">And after two hours, they came down and they looked exactly like the spacemen; they have white uniforms covered completely their body, gloves on the head, only you can see the eyes.</span> <span id="s1510">Everything was covered because there was a big epidemic there, and the only mistake they made was they brought a lot of food and people start to eat and they die right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">JF: You were there when this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">SA: Yeah, I was, then I was sick already.</span> <span id="s1513">I was too weak to eat, because I couldn't even eat what they give it to me.</span> <span id="s1514">The bread I told you.</span> <span id="s1515">That's when I gave my bread away, and then when I went to look for help for my little cousin, what I told you already.</span> <span id="s1516">And now I come back to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1517">When I, three months I was there, and I felt that I want to go to work—so they ask me what I want to do.</span> <span id="s1518">So I said I would like to go to the hospital to work.</span> <span id="s1519">Whatever I will be able to do.</span> <span id="s1520">So they told me that I could work and could take my schooling there if I wanted to become a nurse.</span> <span id="s1521">But I told them I'm not going to go by myself because I have a little girl here which is always with me.</span> <span id="s1522">And they accepted.</span> <span id="s1523">So we went—what they got—which was talking beautiful Swedish and German.</span> <span id="s1524">There was a Swedish man—he took us on a train.</span> <span id="s1525">They gave us a few sandwiches, and a few clothes, that we was able to manage, and we came to Utran.</span> <span id="s1526">Utran was a suburb from Stockholm and there was a sanatorium.</span> <span id="s1527">And we have a beautiful room there and we learn the language very quick, and I went a few hours at night.</span> <span id="s1528">I had school and in the daytime I was working in the hospital, and we was there a few months.</span> <span id="s1529">I find out that was a tuberculosis place.</span> <span id="s1530">I wasn't afraid of [for, Ed.]</span> <span id="s1531">myself, but I was afraid of [for, Ed.]</span> <span id="s1532">my cousin.</span> <span id="s1533">I says, "She so young and she could catch the disease."</span> <span id="s1534">And I start to go to Stockholm, there was a mizize [?]</span> <span id="s1535">like a Jewish kehilla, in Stockholm and I told them the story and I say, "I would like to take her out from this place to give her...[unclear]."</span> <span id="s1536">They say they couldn't do it because they short of people.</span> <span id="s1537">I says I would pay Sweden back with me.</span> <span id="s1538">I'm not afraid.</span> <span id="s1539">I lost everything.</span> <span id="s1540">I can get sick, but I don't want it this child to get sick because she's too young for it.</span> <span id="s1541">So they say they couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s1542">So I had to find another way to get out.</span> <span id="s1543">I was there a year.</span> <span id="s1544">I was very happy there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">JF: In this...</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">SA: In this sanatorium, yeah; we had a beautiful room, we was treated very nice and the work was not hard and I had my schooling.</span> <span id="s1547">And then, I find another way to come to Stockholm, and I went to a place where you could be teached to be a nurse, to Stockholm, and I took it out, my cousin, and we went together in Stockholm, because they didn't work in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s1548">They didn't work in—not a citizen.</span> <span id="s1549">They call it nedengad [not clear] in Swedish, but you have to show if you have a school to go or if you have something to accomplish, then they let you live in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s1550">So I came there and we have our, she went, I took her out from Utran and she became a special nurse for children when she was finished, and I was there—and in Stockholm I met my husband.</span> <span id="s1551">He came from Poland.</span> <span id="s1552">I didn't remember everything, no, I didn't.</span> <span id="s1553">If I would tell everything, I don't know, probably it must be something in a person that God do it to you that you should be able to get things what they so terrible that you couldn't even live with this, to survive, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">JF: You met your husband in Stockholm, and you married in

you at the end of the war since you got here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">SA: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1568">I suffered a lot.</span> <span id="s1569">I had a few times a nervous breakdown because I have terrible nightmares.</span> <span id="s1570">That they take away my children and the soldiers came and the soldiers was after me with guns and I was screaming.</span> <span id="s1571">Wake up in the middle of the night, and I couldn't live with myself.</span> <span id="s1572">I was few times very sick and I have a few times woke up and my leg because my leg was healed by

Abrams.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">SA: I would like to share to all of you, not just to you, together my feelings that we are here left for a purpose.</span> <span id="s1580">That we should make the world that this shouldn't happen again.</span> <span id="s1581">That our children shouldn't have this experience what we have.</span> <span id="s1582">[Mrs. Abrams is crying during this statement.]</span> <span id="s1583">That they should do anything in their power, Jew or not Jew, to tell the world the truth because they didn't tell the truth to the world.</span> <span id="s1584">It was too terrible to tell.</span> <span id="s1585">And I guess now the truth came out, and I feel that we very fortunate that people taking their time and they want to put it in writing or in records that thing what happened.</span> <span id="s1586">That the world should know, and now I'm going to tell you my feelings when I came back to Ger many after many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">My children, my son and his wife was sent to Germany from the government and they have to stay two years in Germany and maybe more if they like it.</span> <span id="s1588">My son supposed to open in Hamburg, a German consul, and my grandson was born in Germany.</span> <span id="s1589">I would never in my life to go to Germany if they would offer me a million dollars, because I always said I couldn't put my foot on a place where so many blood was shed, but when I heard my grandson was born, and we was not young, I said to my husband, "I don't know what's going to happen to us, but I only wish I have, I would like to go and see my grand son."</span> <span id="s1590">And we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">We have a lot of nachas and happiness from our children, but we want to be there and go to places where we was before.</span> <span id="s1592">And I insist my children to take me to Bergen-Belsen, and they took me to Lü beck.</span> <span id="s1593">When I walk in, there was a museum in front and all the horrible pictures, what they was very well known, and when I walk into the place, what before was gas chambers and such terrible things happen—I think this was in Lü beck
