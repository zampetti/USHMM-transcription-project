id="s10">September 24, 1998</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Trude, I’d like you to just begin by telling us your name, your date of birth, and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I’m Trude Sherntine Heller, and I was born on June 19, 1922, in Vienna, Austria.</span> <span id="s13">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family, and your family life in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: I was an only child, extremely cherished by my parents.</span> <span id="s15">I was spoiled, and I didn’t even like being spoiled, but I was an only child and -- and my parents doted on me.</span> <span id="s16">I was -- I had friends of all kinds, always, lots of friends, because I was an only child.</span> <span id="s17">And they weren’t only Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s18">And I had one girlfriend in particular that still is my best girlfriend.</span> <span id="s19">And we are luk -- luckily we both wound up in the United States.</span> <span id="s20">And I had a wonderful life.</span> <span id="s21">I had everything I ever wanted.</span> <span id="s22">I had many animals to keep me company, I still like animals.</span> <span id="s23">I grew up very happy and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Sorry -- yeah, this is -- what is it, a truck backing up?</span> <span id="s25">That’s a truck backing up.</span> <span id="s26">I -- I’m sor -- I was hoping it would --</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Now I don’t know where to --</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: I’ll start you.</span> <span id="s29">So you had a lot of friends, you had pets.</span> <span id="s30">You had a happy life.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yeah, very happy life.</span> <span id="s32">And I grew up like that, not very interested in politics.</span> <span id="s33">I -- I was sheltered.</span> <span id="s34">My parents sheltered me from everything.</span> <span id="s35">I was not alone with my husband till the day we’re married, that’s how sheltered I was.</span> <span id="s36">I wanted to bring that up.</span> <span id="s37">We were never left alone.</span> <span id="s38">And that’s how they kept me from many things.</span> <span id="s39">So when the time came for all the unrest, and so forth, I belonged to a gym class, and I was never allowed alone, and I was 15.</span> <span id="s40">And I always had somebody walk with me, and I was walking to a -- my gym class through the city of Vienna when it was two days before the vote of the anschluss.</span> <span id="s41">And we -- as I walked through the city of Vienna, everybody was shouting and yelling for their party.</span> <span id="s42">They were the Social Democrats, who had the three arrows.</span> <span id="s43">There were the Christian Socialists, they were black, white and red.</span> <span id="s44">There were even Communists with hammer and sickle.</span> <span id="s45">And everybody was shouting for their party.</span> <span id="s46">There wasn’t one swastika in sight.</span> <span id="s47">I took my gym class, and when I came out, the entire city was a sea of swastikas.</span> <span id="s48">Every policeman, every building.</span> <span id="s49">There were synagogues burning already.</span> <span id="s50">There were books being thrown out of libraries, that had Jewish writers.</span> <span id="s51">It was something that it was burn into my mind that I can never forget, and whenever I hear that the -- the Viennese didn’t want to be part of Germany, I can’t believe that, because I was there.</span> <span id="s52">And I hope everybody knows that, because they wanted it, and they asked for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">And I knew very little about anything at the time, but I went home, and my father came home, and he said, “Let’s leave.”</span> <span id="s54">And my mother said, “What do you mean leave?”</span> <span id="s55">He says, “Let’s get out of here.”</span> <span id="s56">We always had our passports ready cause we liked to travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">And my mother says, “How can we leave everything we have here, and we have nothing anywhere else, and where would we go?”</span> <span id="s58">And my father said, “I don’t care where we go, let’s get out of here.”</span> <span id="s59">And my mother wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s60">And I -- I just couldn’t imagine what was happening at that time, and I learned very fast.</span> <span id="s61">And it was an unbelievable moment in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: I want to continue with that, but I -- I feel that we need to talk a little bit more about your family life, your Jewish identity.</span> <span id="s63">Tell me --</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: -- a little bit more about your parents, and what memories you have as a child.</span> <span id="s66">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Were they well off, what kind of business?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: My parents were in the tailored supply business.</span> <span id="s69">Everything in Austria was tailor made, every suit, and every dress, and every hat, and every underwear.</span> <span id="s70">And my parents had all the supplies for tailors.</span> <span id="s71">And that was our business.</span> <span id="s72">My father was originally from Kraków, Poland, and he came from a family of -- he had three brothers and a sister.</span> <span id="s73">His father died when he was young, and the mother was a real -- they call it a queen.</span> <span id="s74">She was a real go-getter, and she worked her boys real hard, and they were very successful.</span> <span id="s75">And as a matter of fact, I used to go visit them, and then my father would go to the grave with his father, which was in the little town of Merkow, Poland.</span> <span id="s76">And we went there every year, and in -- in Merkow is where my father had grown up.</span> <span id="s77">And we went to visit where he used to live, and I had to stoop down, and be on a dirt floor, that’s where he was born.</span> <span id="s78">And they did very well, and moved to Kraków.</span> <span id="s79">And they were in the dried fruit business, and my father was at the railroad station checking out carloads of fruits going to Vienna when they came and said they were looking for him to go into the military.</span> <span id="s80">So he got on that train with the fruit, and went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s81">And there he met my mother, and stayed.</span> <span id="s82">So, that’s how I came about.</span> <span id="s83">His whole other [indecipherable] his family stayed in Kraków, and as a matter of fact, they all ended up on Schindler’s list, eventually.</span> <span id="s84">But my father became very Viennese, and loved cars, and my mother was a very wonderful business woman.</span> <span id="s85">She’d rather be in business than at home.</span> <span id="s86">And they always had somebody to keep me, either English miss to teach me English, or a French mademoiselle that teach me French.</span> <span id="s87">So I knew a little bit of both languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Were you particularly religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Not very.</span> <span id="s90">We belonged to a -- a conservative synagogue.</span> <span id="s91">I remember the rabbi’s name, even.</span> <span id="s92">And the men and women did not sit together, but because I was a young girl, I was allowed to sit with my father every now and then, and I did.</span> <span id="s93">But we only went for holidays, and I was confirmed.</span> <span id="s94">And -- but we weren’t very religious.</span> <span id="s95">My mother did not grow up very Orthodox.</span> <span id="s96">Her mother was Orthodox, but her father grew up in an orphanage, and therefore wasn’t, and he loved to eat things that weren’t kosher, and -- to the great concern of my grandmother, who was.</span> <span id="s97">And there was an interesting thing, my grandfather on my mother’s side, his father loved symphonies, and music, and so forth, and he was in -- attending a concert when fire broke out, and all the -- the doors went in instead of out.</span> <span id="s98">And many people died from the smoke inhalation, hundreds.</span> <span id="s99">And when they told his mother that the father had perished, she died.</span> <span id="s100">And she left two little children who grew up in an orphanage.</span> <span id="s101">And he was still Jewish, but had not been brought up with a lot of it.</span> <span id="s102">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s103">I was a mixture.</span> <span id="s104">My father was -- came from Orthodox home, but my mother didn’t.</span> <span id="s105">And we never had any pork or seafood, or anything like that, but we weren’t kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Was -- was Judaism important to you?</span> <span id="s107">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Were your friends Jewish, that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Half of them were, and half of them were not.</span> <span id="s110">I -- it was -- I knew I was Jewish, it was important.</span> <span id="s111">I -- I learned about Judaism.</span> <span id="s112">But it wasn’t anything -- I don’t know, it -- it didn’t come up as much, and I didn’t -- since I was so sheltered, I did not have very much anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s113">And that’s all I remember, and I didn’t really follow politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: You didn’t feel different, or your community didn’t see you different than everybody else is, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Not very, no.</span> <span id="s116">On holidays, yes.</span> <span id="s117">Also in school, because we had religion in school, and a given hour we separated, and I always thought that was terrible, I still do.</span> <span id="s118">It made us different, and -- and that’s what I remember most.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Any other memories of, sort of, life before the -- the Germans came in that you think are -</span></p> <p><span id="s120">-</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: I -- I did go to a lot of dances, starting at 14 years old.</span> <span id="s122">There were some -- although there were all kinds of dances, there were a lot of Jewish dances, and I went to the Jewish dances, most every Saturday.</span> <span id="s123">I wasn’t allowed to go with friends, I went with my parents.</span> <span id="s124">And my parents sat with me, and my father sometimes went and slept in the car, but they wouldn’t leave me alone, and I had a very good time.</span> <span id="s125">I loved dancing.</span> <span id="s126">And di -- these dances were always organized by some Jewish people who made a living out of it.</span> <span id="s127">And they were very wonderful, because Vienna was full of dancing.</span> <span id="s128">So that’s -- that was my youth, I -- I liked -- I liked school, and I liked my friends, and I had a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: And you met Max during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I met Max -- the first time I -- I met him mac -- well, I didn’t meet him, but saw him, is when I was 14, and we had a friend who knew both of us, who want to introduce us, and we refused to be introduced.</span> <span id="s131">But then at 15 in the summer resort, I won a prize, and that’s when he came to ask me to dance with him.</span> <span id="s132">And then he ask me what -- what are you doing tomorrow, and I told him I was going to play tennis, and he came to the place, and that’s when he asked me to marry him.</span> <span id="s133">Which is awhile back.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: And you’re still together.</span> <span id="s135">A: Happily.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: So you began to tell me about the events of -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: -- March --</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Mar --</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: -- in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: This must have been very shocking to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: It was a complete shock to me.</span> <span id="s143">It was a life changing hour, and a growing up hour, and also of taking things in hand.</span> <span id="s144">My mother was an extremely nervous person, very hysterical for everything, so I became the leader with my mother, because I was more calm.</span> <span id="s145">And so I aged very quickly.</span> <span id="s146">At that time, that day when everything went awry, my father started to say we’ve got to leave here.</span> <span id="s147">But then, things happened so fast.</span> <span id="s148">The very first week of Hitler’s coming into Austria, somebody came with a rifle, knocked on our door, and said, “Car keys.”</span> <span id="s149">That wa -- that’s all that -- that was the whole interchange, and we handed over the car keys.</span> <span id="s150">And then somebody came and said, “I like this apartment.”</span> <span id="s151">My parents had bought it before they were married, and had put in a bathroom, and -- a co -- like a co-op, they had done all the alterations and everything, it was ours.</span> <span id="s152">And we had to be out in six hours or die.</span> <span id="s153">And what do you do first?</span> <span id="s154">Do you pack, do you find a place, do you moo -- what do you do?</span> <span id="s155">So one of my parents went and got boxes, and one went to find a place to live, and I started packing.</span> <span id="s156">And in six hours we were out with as much as we could pack.</span> <span id="s157">The rest we had to leave just like it was.</span> <span id="s158">You know, we had all kinds of built ins, and things, and was all gone.</span> <span id="s159">And the -- we moved to a place that was almost like a ghetto, because it was an very old house, and most of the people there had to move out quickly, had to move into places like that, so that was quite a shock.</span> <span id="s160">We had two stores, and you were no longer allowed to have employees that were not Jewish, and we always had help in the house, living in, and she had to leave, and the people in the store could no longer help us.</span> <span id="s161">So -- but they were still open, and we were trying to sell enough to have enough money to -- for every day things, because the bank accounts were closed, and all in all, this was our income.</span> <span id="s162">So we lived like that until Kristallnacht -- Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s163">Kristallnacht, we woke up in the morning, and my father had said -- we didn’t know it was happening, and my father said, “Things are getting so bad.”</span> <span id="s164">This was already November.</span> <span id="s165">He said, “Why don’t I take some of our valuables to the store and hide them there?”</span> <span id="s166">And he took out cameras, and some jewelry, and -- and he left.</span> <span id="s167">And as he left the phone rang, and my girlfriend called and said, “Don’t let your father leave,” and hung up.</span> <span id="s168">We had no idea what was happening.</span> <span id="s169">You know, what people don’t realize is there was no television, and there was -- there was very little communication, so that nobody knew it was happening, really.</span> <span id="s170">So about two minutes later, doorbell rang, and it was my father, and he said, “I’m lost.</span> <span id="s171">I’ll never see you again, they arrested me, and they’re taking me away.”</span> <span id="s172">And I knew one of the men, and I ask him could I leave some keys with you?</span> <span id="s173">So he had all this camera, and jewelry and all on him, and he took that and put it somewhere.</span> <span id="s174">And then he put on long underwear because he was cold, and my mother was almost screaming.</span> <span id="s175">And then she had an idea, and she went next door to the neighbor, it was a Jewish woman with a son who was not well.</span> <span id="s176">He was si -- a very sickly man at the time.</span> <span id="s177">And she said to her, “Would you hide my husband?”</span> <span id="s178">And she said yes, and she put my father in her closet.</span> <span id="s179">They came and took her son away, and she didn’t tell them that my father was hiding there.</span> <span id="s180">Luckily at that time, there was no concentration camps yet, so they send him home because they -- they didn’t know what to do with him.</span> <span id="s181">So we felt better that we -- you know, that my father survived, and he did, too.</span> <span id="s182">But this is how it was done.</span> <span id="s183">It was -- it -- it snuck up on us.</span> <span id="s184">It -- it -- we couldn’t believe people would do things like that.</span> <span id="s185">So then we didn’t know what to do about my father, then we found out from the radio that the Viennese had 24 hours to do with the Jews as they pleased.</span> <span id="s186">And they were taking away Jews from everywhere.</span> <span id="s187">Men.</span> <span id="s188">They -- they put men into prisons and things, but they had no room for the women yet, that came later.</span> <span id="s189">But I went downstairs and got a taxicab, and my father laid down on the floor of the cab, and the cab driver did not give us away.</span> <span id="s190">And we went to the store -- one of our stores, and we have a friend, a mutual friend of my husband and mine, who was helping us out in the store, and he had opened it that day.</span> <span id="s191">And we went in there -- we closed the store with the iron gates from the inside.</span> <span id="s192">The store had no bathroom, and nothing.</span> <span id="s193">We wen -- we went in there and we closed that.</span> <span id="s194">And this young man and I, and my mother and father stayed in there.</span> <span id="s195">We had a telephone, and my girlfriend kept us aware of what was happening.</span> <span id="s196">She also sent somebody with some sandwiches to po -- put under the door.</span> <span id="s197">We didn’t know how long we didn’t there -- we would be there.</span> <span id="s198">We stayed about 30 some hours in there, and even though it was so terrible, we told stories -- we had no light, we couldn’t turn on a light.</span> <span id="s199">People knocked on the doors, and we didn’t open.</span> <span id="s200">And then finally my girlfriend says they have lifted this terrible thing that -- of Kristallnacht, and she said, you can come out now, I think.</span> <span id="s201">But we were still scared.</span> <span id="s202">And when we looked out, the Nazis had put a swastika seal on the key lock -- on the -- where the key goes, and at that time the keys were these large keys with the long tops.</span> <span id="s203">And I took a key, the key from the inside, and I unlocked it, and it didn’t tear.</span> <span id="s204">Because that would have been certain death.</span> <span id="s205">Nobody could hurt the swastika seal.</span> <span id="s206">We ha -- w -- I had an aunt that wa -- had no husband.</span> <span id="s207">She lived with her sister and her daughter, and my father went in to hide there, because they didn’t expect a man to be there.</span> <span id="s208">And he spend the next two days there.</span> <span id="s209">The young man that was with us, was -- they looked for him many times.</span> <span id="s210">He would not have survived if he had been hiding with us.</span> <span id="s211">It was a horrendous day.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: When you went out of this building, and this was right after Kristallnacht -- A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: What did you see?</span> <span id="s214">What was -- what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: A lot of broken glass.</span> <span id="s216">All Jewish businesses had been torched, or broken.</span> <span id="s217">All the merchandise was either looted, or thrown out.</span> <span id="s218">It was -- it was horrible.</span> <span id="s219">And w-we couldn’t believe we survived it, or that my father survived it.</span> <span id="s220">And h-he came back home after two days, and we had no more stores, we had nothing, you know.</span> <span id="s221">I remember going out of the store, I even took money out of the cash register, I remember that.</span> <span id="s222">But we -- we -- thank God we survived it, and we were looking for ways to get out of Vienna.</span> <span id="s223">As you know, nobody wanted us.</span> <span id="s224">No country wanted us.</span> <span id="s225">The countries, most of the time just were closed to us, and you couldn’t get out of Austria unless you had a permit to go to another country.</span> <span id="s226">So we had no such thing.</span> <span id="s227">And then, after that, it was probably in January, my father got an invitation to come to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s228">And nobody ever came back from that.</span> <span id="s229">And that same day, the same friend was visiting me, and my father said, “I’m leaving.”</span> <span id="s230">And -- and my mother says, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s231">He says, “I’ll find something, but I’m not going to the Gestapo.”</span> <span id="s232">And this young man said, “Please take me with you.”</span> <span id="s233">So they each put a shirt and a shaving brush into one of my dolls suitcases.</span> <span id="s234">I still had dolls with suit -- I never liked dolls, I liked teddy bears -- and put it into little suitcases like that, they each had one.</span> <span id="s235">And they left.</span> <span id="s236">And my father and I had made up a whole language between us.</span> <span id="s237">And they were gone.</span> <span id="s238">And a few days later, I got a call from Antwerp, Belgium.</span> <span id="s239">My father said, “We’re here, we’re safe,” and he told me what to do.</span> <span id="s240">And what he did was this, he got on a train from Vienna to Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s241">Well, there was no more border between Austria and Germany, but there was a border between Germany and Holland.</span> <span id="s242">And before he came to the border, he contacted one of the waiters that looked simpatico, and he said, “I have money I’d like to give you if you would hide my friend and me under table.”</span> <span id="s243">And he said okay.</span> <span id="s244">So they got under table at the border, they put tablecloths over them, and then they stood in front of the table while they searched the train.</span> <span id="s245">They found the two little suitcases, and nobody claimed them, so they searched some more.</span> <span id="s246">In the meantime they had the heating unit in their back.</span> <span id="s247">They said it was unbelievable, and they couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s248">But they finally left, they couldn -- nobody knew what happened to these men.</span> <span id="s249">So, when they got to Rotterdam, my father said to this young man, “Get out of the train and stretch, and act like you’re lighting a cigarette, like you’re going to get back on, because they’ll be looking for us.</span> <span id="s250">And then make your way to the exit, and go to the streets, and when you find the -- a place that has a kosher sign on it, they’ll help you.”</span> <span id="s251">And that’s exactly what they both did.</span> <span id="s252">They found a place with a kosher sign.</span> <span id="s253">They went in and told them they were refugees, and what should they do.</span> <span id="s254">These people knew -- these Jews knew that in an -- in Belgium, in Antwerp, they were giving 30 day permits to people to stay.</span> <span id="s255">So they made them up false papers, and they send one by car, and one by bus to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s256">And that’s how they got to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s257">And our family in Poland send us money -- send my father money so he could exist.</span> <span id="s258">And my father said to me, “And you do the same with mother.”</span> <span id="s259">And I said [indecipherable] gave me all the details, he described the waiter, and said, “He said he would help you.</span> <span id="s260">And have twice the money.”</span> <span id="s261">So my mother and I packed up huge boxes, and send them to my father in Belgium.</span> <span id="s262">They did not get there, they took out all the valuables, but I do have my things that -- from my grandmother, and pictures, and all that really survived by going to Belgium.</span> <span id="s263">My mother and I got on the train, the train that we knew he would be on.</span> <span id="s264">We went into a compartment of people who were -- turn out to be some Jews, and there was one young man that had a shaved head.</span> <span id="s265">He had already been to a camp, and they let him out and said, “If we catch you again, you’re dead.”</span> <span id="s266">And they had no place to go.</span> <span id="s267">Nobody had any place to go, and I couldn’t tell them what we were doing.</span> <span id="s268">I felt like a traitor, but I wasn’t going to say, because there’s no way that many could be under tables.</span> <span id="s269">We went to the dining car, and I spotted the waiter, and I s -- I -- sit in front of me -- I had the menu in front of me, and I spoke to him, and I said, “I have twice the money, you promised my father.”</span> <span id="s270">I identified myself.</span> <span id="s271">And he said to me, “Don’t speak to me, I’m being watched.”</span> <span id="s272">And that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s273">So here were my mother and I going into no man’s land.</span> <span id="s274">We went back to the compartment and one of the people there had gotten a telegram from a friend that -- on the border in Achen -- no, in Cologne, in Cologne, there was a hotel, an hourly hotel, a fleabag hotel, who would allow Jews in -- un-under the eaves for a certain amount of money.</span> <span id="s275">So we went with them to this place, it was a horrible place.</span> <span id="s276">And they put us all under the eaves.</span> <span id="s277">They also had people there that smuggled people across, that came there, and for money they said, “We’ll get you across the border to Belgium.”</span> <span id="s278">So we -- we did this.</span> <span id="s279">I was a young girl.</span> <span id="s280">There was a waiter there who liked me a lot.</span> <span id="s281">My mother was hysterical with this, there was nobody to protect me.</span> <span id="s282">And I had to really get out of his way.</span> <span id="s283">And I learned a lot very quickly.</span> <span id="s284">And then we started with trying to be smuggled out.</span> <span id="s285">It took five weeks of unbelievable things.</span> <span id="s286">We were caught five times.</span> <span id="s287">There was ice and snow.</span> <span id="s288">My mother had a 105 temperature.</span> <span id="s289">And we used to walk like half the night through the woods, and then be caught and sent back.</span> <span id="s290">They didn’t know what to do with the women, the men disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Were you -- when you were doing this, were you with other people, or was just you and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yeah -- no, they usually took five or six for one trip.</span> <span id="s293">Some of them had bought out the border police, but not all of them, just some of them, and they’d let us go on, and then later on we’d hear a car coming, we’d throw ourselves in a ditch.</span> <span id="s294">Then we’d hear a motorcycle, and that didn’t catch us, but then the man came on his mot -- on a bicycle, and he caught us.</span> <span id="s295">We once made it to no man’s land, to a -- we had walked all night, and I had to go to the bathroom so bad, and they had an outhouse surrounded by German border police so I couldn’t go, cause they all liked me, because I was a young, big girl with no protection.</span> <span id="s296">I -- we sat -- we were soaked to the skin, and we sat and waited to be picked up from the other side.</span> <span id="s297">And the German border police came and send us back again.</span> <span id="s298">And one of the -- one of the people there had send me a note that he was in love with me, and that he knew what I was doing, and he wanted to join me when I got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">And I should -- gave me his name and address I should write to him, and I said sure.</span> <span id="s300">And when the border police came in, I dropped it under the table, I didn’t want to be found with that.</span> <span id="s301">And that was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s302">Each time they send us back as far as our money would go, and you become very wise, you know.</span> <span id="s303">The men disappeared, the women were sent back.</span> <span id="s304">You become wise, you know.</span> <span id="s305">You become street-wise.</span> <span id="s306">So after five weeks of this, constant trying to get across the border with fashing, which is Mardi Gras time in Cologne, going on with -- they wouldn’t even have us at that hotel, we found some other place, and my mother was very ill.</span> <span id="s307">And we were like up under the eaves, and had -- we had no ration cards either, so we couldn’t buy any food, and I would go out in the street, and I found this little cheese shop, cheese and bread.</span> <span id="s308">And the proprietor was this very jolly, nice, fat man.</span> <span id="s309">And I went in and I said, “I don’t have a ration card, but I’m hungry.”</span> <span id="s310">And every day he sold me cheese and bread, or every few days.</span> <span id="s311">So he was a good man.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">And my accent was Viennese, so in Germany they knew immediately that I wasn’t from there.</span> <span id="s313">So they knew what I was doing.</span> <span id="s314">I once fell down a whole flight of steps, and two German officers picked me up, and I couldn’t say thank you, because they would have known immediately that I wasn’t German.</span> <span id="s315">We had a lot of terrible incidents like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">And then one day my father called and said he had found a Gestapo man who wanted money out of the country -- out of Germany, and he was smuggling people across.</span> <span id="s317">And he send him to us and told them he would pay him on the other side, so he could get money.</span> <span id="s318">This man made us first go to the border police and be searched.</span> <span id="s319">We were searched each time, everywhere.</span> <span id="s320">There was a woman searching women, and a man searching men all over the body.</span> <span id="s321">And then he took us -- we had to walk about three hours through the night, in the woods.</span> <span id="s322">And then he picked us up in cars without lights, and we drove for two hours without lights, at night.</span> <span id="s323">And then we drove into Antwerp, and he delivered us.</span> <span id="s324">I went into hiding for two weeks.</span> <span id="s325">I couldn’t -- I was afraid to go in the street.</span> <span id="s326">It was an after in fact.</span> <span id="s327">I had another incident before that in Vienna when they made me wash the streets one day, the people that I knew and grew up with.</span> <span id="s328">And they taunted me, and they send away all the other people and they surrounded me, and started touching me.</span> <span id="s329">And German officers came in and stopped it.</span> <span id="s330">And I cried for two days and two nights, and had to have a shap to stop it.</span> <span id="s331">So here went again, I was scared to death.</span> <span id="s332">I was real brave until we got to Antwerp, and then I be -- I just let loose.</span> <span id="s333">And after two weeks of not leaving the place, my parents made me go to a movie with them.</span> <span id="s334">What they didn’t know is there was a Communist giving a speech for the movie, and I was so afraid, because you get so afraid of anything political, or anything that has to do with the law, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Must have been quite a reunion, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Oh, unbelievable, yeah.</span> <span id="s337">And then it came to where you had to get a p-permit every 30 days, and that -- that was another thing that was almost impossible to get.</span> <span id="s338">We couldn’t work, and -- but somehow, I was young, I still went dancing.</span> <span id="s339">I had made friends, I went dancing.</span> <span id="s340">But it was tough, very tough, and we got permits, and then we had this little apartment that was very nice, and the landlord wanted more money, we really couldn’t afford it, and so he told us to get out.</span> <span id="s341">And we hadn’t gotten out, and he called the police and said we were refugees without permit.</span> <span id="s342">And the police came, and we had a permit.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">But after they left, my father was going to kill that man.</span> <span id="s344">I mean, he lost his composure completely.</span> <span id="s345">The man lived upstairs and my father was running up the steps, and I ran behind him, and I pulled him, and I said, “Don’t do that, don’t do that,” you know, “you’ll kill all of us.”</span> <span id="s346">But he was -- went berserk that somebody could do that.</span> <span id="s347">Luckily he wasn’t home, so he didn’t kill him.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Was your father working in Antwerp?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: He couldn’t.</span> <span id="s350">You weren’t allowed to -- ma -- th -- ou -- our relatives send us money.</span> <span id="s351">I still had a grandfather in New York -- in Vienna, and he send us money.</span> <span id="s352">We lived very cheaply, we -- they had parts of -- of things that they sold in the butcher shop, that they gave away.</span> <span id="s353">My mother was great cook.</span> <span id="s354">And this young man I told you about that escaped with my father, and he was there, and we fed him, too.</span> <span id="s355">And we just existed for a year, couldn’t find any place to go.</span> <span id="s356">Nobo -- you know, nobody wanted us.</span> <span id="s357">We were like in limbo.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: I’m -- I’m intrigued by the fact that while you were in Germany and on the run -- A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: -- you were able to communicate with your father.</span> <span id="s360">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Or that your relatives in other places -- A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: -- were still, at this point -- you were able to all communicate.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yes, it was early on.</span> <span id="s364">They were not set up yet as -- as well, that’s why we were so lucky to get out so early.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: You communicated by phone, by [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s366">A: By phone -- b-both, yes, both.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: And in -- at this point in Belgium, they had no premonition that they were going to --</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: -- have problems either?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: None at all, none at all.</span> <span id="s371">Life went on as before.</span> <span id="s372">Then our -- our relatives in Poland found that we had a th -- a cousin 10 times removed in the United States, and we contacted him, and he send us papers.</span> <span id="s373">They were not very good.</span> <span id="s374">He had no money in the bank, he had five unmarried daughters, he had no insurance.</span> <span id="s375">He had to state all that, that when you guaranteed for family to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s376">We took that to the American consul in -- in Antwerp, his name was Leroux, and he was a very nice man, and I -- I spoke some English, and I said, “I -- I want -- we’ll work and we won’t need any help,” and -- and he believed me, and he said, “Okay.</span> <span id="s377">The first visas I get for Austria, your mother and you will go, but your father can’t because he was born in Poland,” and Poland was a different quota.</span> <span id="s378">There was a -- there was a strict quota system of where you were born, only so many a year allowed into America, no matter what.</span> <span id="s379">So our visas came, and we had to leave, and leave my father behind.</span> <span id="s380">And it was a terrible goodbye, but he had promised me the first Polish quota would go to my father.</span> <span id="s381">And we -- we got to New York on March 10th.</span> <span id="s382">We went on a Dutch ship during the war -- already the war had started, through the channel.</span> <span id="s383">We had to anchor at night.</span> <span id="s384">The winds were the worst in March, of any time.</span> <span id="s385">The entire ship was seasick to such an extent that when we got to New York, a lot of people were taken off on stretchers, that’s how bad it was.</span> <span id="s386">We had no music -- we had to -- there were sunken ships, and mines all over the place.</span> <span id="s387">I remember seeing them go by.</span> <span id="s388">We had to wear our what do you call it?</span> <span id="s389">So you don’t sink?</span> <span id="s390">Our life preservers.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">We had to wear them day and night, and it was not a good crossing, but we made it.</span> <span id="s392">We made it, and came to New York.</span> <span id="s393">My mother had a brother that was in New York already, and he got us a room for three dollars a week, and we went to work the day we got there.</span> <span id="s394">My father, May the ninth send us a telegram that his passport was at the consulate, and he had booked passage on the 11th, and we woke up on the 10th, and Hitler had marched into Belgium.</span> <span id="s395">We had no idea what had happened to him, and we waited till July the 18th.</span> <span id="s396">July the 18th, my -- Max, my husband, who I s -- I wrote to all the time, and he wrote to me, we were in touch always.</span> <span id="s397">H-He was my good luck omen, always.</span> <span id="s398">I -- somebody knocked on the door on July the 18th, and there was Max, and behind him the Western Union boy with the telegram from my father that, I’m alive.</span> <span id="s399">So my father had been put in a cattle car in Antwerp the day of the anschluss of Belgium.</span> <span id="s400">And he was sent into the desert where they had all camps, and they had all [indecipherable] with -- with -- left from years before.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: The desert where?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: In France.</span> <span id="s403">They -- these were cattle cars, all cattle cars, standing up, they went three days and three nights, and only half people survived.</span> <span id="s404">And he got out there, and said he was a cook, and he was, he was a very good cook, and he figured if he’s in the kitchen, maybe he’ll have some to eat.</span> <span id="s405">They had very little to eat.</span> <span id="s406">But then he escaped from there into Marseilles.</span> <span id="s407">So that was -- you know, for two months we have no idea.</span> <span id="s408">But he did escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">And I got all kinds of papers for him.</span> <span id="s410">It took another year, and he did come to the United States.</span> <span id="s411">So -- the other thing I forgot to tell you is, while I was in Belgium, we were looking for ways to get out of Belgium, we heard that the Chilean consul had left town, and the [indecipherable] consul was selling visas to Chili.</span> <span id="s412">So immediately my parents send me in, and with our passports, and we bought visas to Chili.</span> <span id="s413">We picked up our luggage one -- aboard a ship to Chili, and we were spending the last night before the trip at home, when in -- midnight the doorbell rang, and in Belgium the houses are build one onto the other, all the bedrooms are upstairs, and you had these huge mirrors to see who is at the door.</span> <span id="s414">At the door was the Chilean consul with the car, with the flag.</span> <span id="s415">We knew immediately he came to cancel our visas.</span> <span id="s416">And I still have those passports, we cancel -- they cancelled the visa.</span> <span id="s417">They took our luggage off the ship.</span> <span id="s418">The ship sank, and everybody drowned.</span> <span id="s419">It was -- the Simon Bolivar was the name of the ship.</span> <span id="s420">Hundreds of people drowned.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: It sank because of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yeah, it sank because of mines.</span> <span id="s423">It ran a mine.</span> <span id="s424">Q: And why had they cancelled your visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Because we bought it, we -- they didn’t want us either.</span> <span id="s426">Q: Did they give you your money back?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s428">That was -- that was black ma -- black market money, you know.</span> <span id="s429">That -- that was another miracle, to survive, you know.</span> <span id="s430">Sometimes I go through all those miracles, and say how did we survive.</span> <span id="s431">But that was close.</span> <span id="s432">Another close one.</span> <span id="s433">And -- so that’s how we ended up in New York.</span> <span id="s434">I went to work the first day.</span> <span id="s435">I wanted to eat.</span> <span id="s436">And everything else then went well.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Let’s back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s438">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: You had mentioned that -- well, let’s back way up.</span> <span id="s440">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Maybe you can describe in a little bit more detail -- A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: -- the life in Vienna after the anschluss, before Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: I mean that -- that’s a period of what, eight months or something.</span> <span id="s445">A: Na -- from March to November.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Yeah, it’s a while.</span> <span id="s447">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: What your daily life was like, what you saw, what you experienced, how you spent your time.</span> <span id="s449">Who was on the streets, what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Well, first of all, we all had to get a paper with our name.</span> <span id="s451">All Jewish men became Israel, and all Jewish women became Sarah.</span> <span id="s452">We lost our identity completely, and numbers.</span> <span id="s453">And we had to carry identification of who we were.</span> <span id="s454">And we were stopped sometimes, just to show our identification.</span> <span id="s455">It was hazardous to walk on the street.</span> <span id="s456">There was a park nearby, but every bench said, no Jews allowed.</span> <span id="s457">And it was -- it was dangerous for us to go there, because there was some of the young Hitler youth, or SA, the yellow uniforms, who were very reckless, and felt their muscle, so to speak, and they’d attack Jews, and beat them, and do terrible things to them.</span> <span id="s458">So we couldn’t do that either.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Did you witness this?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: I saw that -- this -- the washing of the streets, and the things.</span> <span id="s461">I never witnessed any beating, actually, but I heard about many of them.</span> <span id="s462">We lived across the street from a police station, and I could see what was going in and out, and I could see them just arresting people in the street.</span> <span id="s463">Like, sometimes they’d ask for identity, and if you were Jewish, they took you away.</span> <span id="s464">And as I said in the beginning only the men.</span> <span id="s465">And also they - - there were incidences of where they got Jewish girls to come and be measured all over.</span> <span id="s466">They wanted to know the difference between Jews and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s467">So they’d take all these nice Jewish girls, and measure them everywhere.</span> <span id="s468">And one of them was sexually assaulted that I knew.</span> <span id="s469">And there’s no one to take up for it, I mean, it was condoned.</span> <span id="s470">It was -- it was perfectly fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Were you ever measured?</span> <span id="s472">A: No, I wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Did you ever sort of suffer any physical abuse, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Not really physical, just that one incident I told you, when I washed at the [indecipherable] washed the street, and they got me into this room.</span> <span id="s475">My mother was taken away to another room, and she was screaming, and -- and they started to attack me -- when the Germans stopped it.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: And this was a -- a group of Austrians -- A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: -- men and women?</span> <span id="s478">A: Men only.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Oh, men.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Men only, yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s481">No, they were going to sexually assault me, and they called me by name, they knew who I was, because they were from my neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: What were you thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: I was petrified, petrified.</span> <span id="s484">I was also very young in that respect, I knew nothing about that.</span> <span id="s485">I -- I was completely illit -- illiterate in sex -- in sexual things, and my mother knew, and she was screaming.</span> <span id="s486">I didn’t know what they were going to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: But you knew it was bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: I knew it was terrible, cause they started touching me.</span> <span id="s489">And I was saved by two German officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Did you think they abused your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: No, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s492">They had her with some other women.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Now, you also had this added responsibility of trying to take care of your mother.</span> <span id="s494">A: Mm-hm, I did, that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: That must have been -- that must have been -- A: She was -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: -- difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: My mother -- my mother’s face mirrored all her emotions, she couldn’t help it, and that was bad.</span> <span id="s498">But I did it.</span> <span id="s499">I was strong at the time, and then at the end, I wasn’t so strong.</span> <span id="s500">And when I talk about it today, I get jittery, very jittery.</span> <span id="s501">So many years later.</span> <span id="s502">I can even hear it in my voice myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Well, it was -- it must have been, you know, a tremendous responsibility, but there was the emotional component, but also as --</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: -- probably a little bit of a burden.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Well, when you’re young, it do-doesn’t come up, really, you just do it.</span> <span id="s507">But you learn very quickly what’s dangerous, and what isn’t, and you learn very quickly to try and get out of the way of it.</span> <span id="s508">And those few weeks in Germany were such a horror of survival, not only o-of trying to get across, but for my mother and me to save me, cause I was a young kid.</span> <span id="s509">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: You’re saying that you were prey.</span> <span id="s511">A: I was prey, completely, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Well what -- what do you think gave you -- because you were a sheltered child, what gave you the instincts, or the strength to do what you had to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s514">It comes.</span> <span id="s515">You do what you have to do, because I -- I used to say to my parents I didn’t want to be so sheltered, but that didn’t help much.</span> <span id="s516">Including in the United States, when I was engaged to be married, they were still sheltering me, so they never changed, so -- but you grow up.</span> <span id="s517">I hope I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: When you were living in Antwerp, the conditions were difficult, but were you frightened still, or did you feel fairly safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: No, I felt fairly safe.</span> <span id="s520">The only frightening part was to get another permit every 30 days, and to get a place to go.</span> <span id="s521">I mean, we were really -- we were -- we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s522">We weren’t allowed to work, and it was hard [inaudible] and I was so young.</span> <span id="s523">Of course, by that time, I was 16, 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Were there a lot of other refugees there?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s526">There were a lot of refugees who all weren’t allowed to work, and got into skirmishes because there nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s527">They didn’t like each other, or something.</span> <span id="s528">I could never believe that, sometimes fights broke out over little things, and then they’d send them back to Germany.</span> <span id="s529">A lot of people were sent back.</span> <span id="s530">And that was the scary part.</span> <span id="s531">I -- I’ve had friends, and I -- my mother was wonderful, she always cooked something, and there was always somebody that needed a meal, that was in our situation, so we always, somehow it was, you know, she made it easier for that year.</span> <span id="s532">We stayed exactly one year, exactly, from March first to March first.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: And that was, I think, right be -- A: 1939 to 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: That was probably right before Germany came into Belgium, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s536">We left March first, and they -- they went in ma -- May the 10th.</span> <span id="s537">Q: From Holland to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: May 10th, yeah.</span> <span id="s539">Those dates are imbedded in my mind.</span> <span id="s540">Q: Good timing.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s542">But we got out, and so did my father, so I’m very grateful for that, but we did lose a lot of family.</span> <span id="s543">My father’s family lived in Kraków, and one of the family, a dist -- more distant cousin that I never met, owned the factory that Schindler took over, and he got 14 members of the family onto Schindler’s list, and so -- but a lot of them did perish.</span> <span id="s544">But Schindler saved a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Are those -- are they[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s546">These relatives of yours that were saved by Schindler, are they -- are any of them still around?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Are they in Israel, or the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: No, they’re in the United States.</span> <span id="s550">We helped to bring some here, and they’re -- maybe six are alive, so -- End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s553">Have to rearrange a little.</span> <span id="s554">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: I was just wondering if in these weeks that you were tr -- what?</span> <span id="s556">Oh.</span> <span id="s557">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s558">Is sound okay now?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Yeah, no, it’s fine.</span> <span id="s560">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: If in this very frightening period, when you were trying to get into Antwerp.</span> <span id="s562">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: If there was maybe one or two experiences that are -- that you still think about, that were s -- especially strong memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Oh I -- I -- I think about all of them.</span> <span id="s565">I know that it was a terrible thing to be in that hotel, helpless to what might happen.</span> <span id="s566">To be at the mercy of guides that dealt in human beings for money, and you really didn’t know where they were taking you.</span> <span id="s567">It was awful to know that we had no ration cards, that nobody was to help us, that we didn’t know anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">We were just at the mercy of so many people.</span> <span id="s569">And even though there were a lot of good people in the world, not enough of them.</span> <span id="s570">Because we were afraid to speak to anybody.</span> <span id="s571">I was afraid to open my mouth.</span> <span id="s572">And i-it was so awful when we walked through the woods in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s573">One time they took us through a -- a train tunnel, and I -- I thought, what if the train comes?</span> <span id="s574">And we walked through tunnel for a long time.</span> <span id="s575">And then when we came out the other end, there was a street, a road, and -- not much of a road, but a road, and we were so relieved to be on the other side of that tunnel, and that’s when we were caught again.</span> <span id="s576">And I was lying on the -- in a ditch when we heard something coming, and all of a sudden I had a gun in my ribs.</span> <span id="s577">And we came out of the ditch, and they took us all the way back, when we had gone through that whole tunnel, you know?</span> <span id="s578">And we had to g -- walk all the way back, and be searched again, and sent back to Cologne.</span> <span id="s579">And this happened so many times.</span> <span id="s580">It -- I think sometimes I don’t even want to remember it all.</span> <span id="s581">I kind of slop over it because it’s hard.</span> <span id="s582">Especially when my mother was so ill, and I didn’t know what to do, you know, we -- we didn’t have any medicine, we didn’t -- we couldn’t call a doctor, and here we were in -- in strange country, and hiding.</span> <span id="s583">And I’m sure that a lot of people that went through a lot more than I did, but at that time, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s584">It was terrible because we had no protection of any kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: How did you know whom to trust?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: We didn’t.</span> <span id="s587">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s588">Each time we turned money over to a guide, we had no idea whether he’d help us or not.</span> <span id="s589">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s590">Sometimes -- I’m wondering if we were caught because we were caught, or because somebody tipped them off, and just took our money.</span> <span id="s591">But they did make us walk, always, half the night.</span> <span id="s592">And the weather was awful at that time, very cold.</span> <span id="s593">So -- but --</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Did you get help from -- let’s say, people who were living in villages, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s596">We -- we never let on that we were there.</span> <span id="s597">Later on I read when I was in Belgium that several people were killed by gunshots, they were trying to escape.</span> <span id="s598">So, we didn’t, you know, we lived through it.</span> <span id="s599">I -- it was just -- it’s hard to verbalize what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Most people that learn about the Holocaust have no idea what it really meant.</span> <span id="s601">It is the people that lived through it, and even me, who went through some of if, when I hear about others, can’t imagine that they lived through it.</span> <span id="s602">So I guess it’s all relative.</span> <span id="s603">You do what you have to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: How’d you calm your mother down?</span> <span id="s605">A: It was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: You said she was a very nervous -- A: Very nerv -- never calmed her down.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: But you obviously needed to prevent her from -- A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: -- screaming, or really having a fit.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Oh yes, yes, yes, I did.</span> <span id="s610">And I -- I -- she did okay, as long as I did all the negotiations and things, and I did.</span> <span id="s611">And even in Belgium, dealing with all the embassy, or whatever, I was the one to do it all.</span> <span id="s612">And even then it was a little dangerous, because I was a young girl.</span> <span id="s613">Because I was prey, as you said.</span> <span id="s614">I had incidents even there.</span> <span id="s615">And that’s only because young girls at that time were considered like open territory.</span> <span id="s616">And my parents protected me, but it wasn’t easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Well, I think especially when you needed favors.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yes, that’s exactly right.</span> <span id="s619">Unless we could pay for it.</span> <span id="s620">I was asked a couple of times for those favors, for -- for paying in those terms for favors.</span> <span id="s621">And even though I didn’t know exactly what it meant, I was frightened a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: But you never felt so desperate that you would consider it.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Never.</span> <span id="s624">No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: This is interesting, this is an area I must say that hasn’t been explored very much.</span> <span id="s626">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Which is the fact that women during the Holocaust had many different problems to consider --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: [indecipherable] or challenges to overcome -- A: Oh, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: -- than man, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Of course, and many of them didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s632">I don’t know if I should bring this up here, but I have a cousin who was in Schindler’s List, and one day some Germans came in, and recruited women for their bordellos, and they picked my cousin.</span> <span id="s633">And her -- her fiancé, th -- they were younger than I am, and they were not married yet, but they were engaged, he was the head of the factory.</span> <span id="s634">He was a very clever young man, and he walked up to the German and said, “She is my best worker, if you take her away, it’ll hurt the war effort.”</span> <span id="s635">He thought he’d kill him, but he didn’t, he just left, and left her.</span> <span id="s636">So this is how far we all were from that, you know, never -- never knew what to expect.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Were you conscious at the time of w -- of -- it must have been harder because you were female?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s639">I only knew they took away all the men, and I was still there.</span> <span id="s640">We had no feel of time, it -- it seemed like forever that we were there, and it was only five weeks, it seemed like a lifetime.</span> <span id="s641">Everything’s you know, nothing worked.</span> <span id="s642">It -- it all came together, and that’s when I ended up in Antwerp, I was just a complete wreck.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: In that time that you were in Antwerp, of course, the war -- the war officially began.</span> <span id="s644">A: Yes, ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: How much information did you get about what was happening in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Oh, very little, very little, from Poland.</span> <span id="s647">We knew there was a war on, we were thankful the war had started.</span> <span id="s648">And my husband-to-be, Max, had sent me a letter with his picture, and with a marriage proposal to come to the United States, and he’d marry me and bring me to the -- by proxy -- and bring me to the United States, and then I could divorce him if I didn’t like him.</span> <span id="s649">But his picture wasn’t good enough, I thought it was a terrible picture.</span> <span id="s650">But my parents wouldn’t let me go anyway.</span> <span id="s651">They -- I don’t know why they thought I would be better off with them than going to the United States by myself.</span> <span id="s652">But I was still young, too, you know, so that didn’t work either, but he tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: You also talked about -- started to talk about how after, sort of, a period of, sort of, great challenges, where you just had to get through it, you would just break down.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s655">I -- I guess that’s my make-up.</span> <span id="s656">I can get through things and then go to pieces afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Are some of those traumas still with you, I mean are there -- there’s certain things that happened to you, or that trigger memories that --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: -- bring all this back today?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Oh yeah, yes, it does.</span> <span id="s661">It seemed like another lifetime, but yet, when I do something like this, it takes me awhile to go to sleep again.</span> <span id="s662">Because so many vivid things come up.</span> <span id="s663">Then also I’ll say, why didn’t I think of saying that, and that, so it would be recorded for later on.</span> <span id="s664">And we all know it was a bad time, we all have a different story.</span> <span id="s665">My children knew very little about that, too.</span> <span id="s666">Told them very little about it, and they’re more and more interested now.</span> <span id="s667">And I hope in time to come my great-grandchildren, and great grand -- great-great-grandchildren will listen and learn something, not only from me, but from others.</span> <span id="s668">I once spent five hours in -- in the museum -- in the Holocaust museum, and all I did was listen to stories, because everybody has a different story.</span> <span id="s669">Everybody could write a book, and I was just lucky, very lucky.</span> <span id="s670">So many times I’m lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Let’s just briefly sort of catch up.</span> <span id="s672">You -- you came to New York, you worked for a while.</span> <span id="s673">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: You eventually --</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: My -- my husband Max and I kept in touch, and -- Q: Your future husband Max.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: My future husband Max.</span> <span id="s677">We kept in touch.</span> <span id="s678">My father was not yet here.</span> <span id="s679">I got a job with National Silver Company, I was cleaning the offices.</span> <span id="s680">I’d never cleaned anything in my life.</span> <span id="s681">I was cleaning offices, and I was wrapping silver.</span> <span id="s682">And the boss was very nice to me, and he helped me bring my father to this country.</span> <span id="s683">I was forever grateful to him, his name was Bernstein.</span> <span id="s684">And my husband Max kept -- he couldn’t call me often, because he couldn’t afford it, but he wrote me letters by parcel post, and we were in touch all the time, and he asked me to marry him.</span> <span id="s685">Well, it wasn’t easy for my mother to think about moving from New York to Greenville, South Carolina.</span> <span id="s686">And my father came, finally, a year later, and Max came to see us, and asked for my hand in marriage, and my father at the time said, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s687">And ma -- Max said, “I have a job, and you don’t.”</span> <span id="s688">But they relented, and we all moved to Greenville, South Carolina, and we were married there in 1942, in Greenville.</span> <span id="s689">The only place with an air conditioner was one restaurant, and that’s where we put our chuppah, and we were married in August.</span> <span id="s690">It was 104 degrees, and the air conditioning didn’t work, but it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s691">It was a hot wedding.</span> <span id="s692">And still is, 56 years later.</span> <span id="s693">Yeah, it’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: You have a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Three children, 10 grandchildren, one great-grandchild.</span> <span id="s696">Four of the grandchildren are married, one’s getting married next month, and one in the spring.</span> <span id="s697">And two great- grandchildren are on the way, and our family is growing.</span> <span id="s698">I was -- I am an only child, and now they’ll -- by April we hope to be 27.</span> <span id="s699">I like it a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: And I know you -- you both got very involved with the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yes, I -- when I first came to Greenville, Max invited me to come for New Year’s Eve, 1941, right after the war broke out.</span> <span id="s702">And -- of course my mother wouldn’t let me go by myself, so -- but I had really wanted to move to Greenville, so my mother came with me on the train to Greenville, South Carolina.</span> <span id="s703">Max picked us up, and he drove, and drove, and drove, and drove to his house.</span> <span id="s704">Probably 20 minutes.</span> <span id="s705">Going back it took two minutes, he just wanted me to think it was a bigger city than it was.</span> <span id="s706">But I came to Greenville for New Year’s Eve, and he knew everybody, he was the eligible bachelor in town.</span> <span id="s707">I didn’t know anybody, so around midnight I started crying.</span> <span id="s708">He had to rush me out of there, and he drove me around for two hours, and I cried and cried, and I came back to the house, said to my mother, “I want to go home, and never hear of Greenville again.”</span> <span id="s709">And I moved in February.</span> <span id="s710">Love is stronger than anything else.</span> <span id="s711">I just knew he was right, and he was for me.</span> <span id="s712">Nobody else was.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Meanwhile, you barely knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Well now, I’d known him, you know, from Vienna, from when I was 15, and his letters, you know, were wonderful, and he’d call me when he could, and he came to see me, and I just knew that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: I have a question for you, I didn’t ask Max this, but sort of an interest to me, you were newly arrived in the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: -- when the United States went to war.</span> <span id="s718">A: [indecipherable] war.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: You must have had a very different perceptive, having just escaped, than the average American.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s721">Whenever I speak, I always say thank God for the American soldier.</span> <span id="s722">Can you imagine what the world would have been like?</span> <span id="s723">Can you even imagine?</span> <span id="s724">I have been warned at times in high school that there were skinheads present.</span> <span id="s725">And then I even do it more, because what good have Nazis ever done?</span> <span id="s726">Name one good thing.</span> <span id="s727">Never anything good, only bad.</span> <span id="s728">And if the American soldier hadn’t intervened, where would we be?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Where would anybody be?</span> <span id="s730">So, when I came to the United States, and there was a war, I was -- I was just hoping that they’d beat them.</span> <span id="s731">I couldn’t understand why somebody hadn’t done something sooner, that this madman was taking over all of Europe.</span> <span id="s732">So I was very glad about it.</span> <span id="s733">Course I didn’t figure what happened with Japan [inaudible].</span> <span id="s734">That was different, but I -- I couldn’t believe that this was -- you know, let go that long, that nobody could tell how bad it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: When you were living in New York, were most of the people you came in contact with native Americans, or were they other people who had come from Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Both.</span> <span id="s737">Mostly Europeans I would say at the time, in New York.</span> <span id="s738">Nobody in Greenville.</span> <span id="s739">Q: The reason I’m asking is did you sense a di -- a difference in attitude toward the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: What occurred to me in New York was they really didn’t want refugees.</span> <span id="s741">They are afraid we were taking jobs that Americans would have.</span> <span id="s742">And they weren’t very kind about that.</span> <span id="s743">I think after awhile, they could see that a lot of brain came with it.</span> <span id="s744">Doctors, scientists, and artists.</span> <span id="s745">And then it became more palatable.</span> <span id="s746">But I think they really didn’t want us to take jobs, and we had to have jobs.</span> <span id="s747">I started working pinning the flowers on hats, the day I came.</span> <span id="s748">And my mother took a very menial job as cutting out ol -- from old uniforms, cutting out buttons and zippers, dirty stuff.</span> <span id="s749">But we ate.</span> <span id="s750">And we weren’t afraid to work, and they could see that.</span> <span id="s751">We were anxious to work.</span> <span id="s752">I ended up doing some piecework, and I was told not to go so fast.</span> <span id="s753">I wanted to make more money by going fast, and I was told not to work so fast, because the others didn’t want to work so fast.</span> <span id="s754">But the attitude to us at first was, you know, we’re taking jobs away.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: And you felt that?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s757">But it -- when I went to Greenville, it was different, because there weren’t any people like us.</span> <span id="s758">I don’t think there were maybe one or two, that’s all, afterwards.</span> <span id="s759">We were sort of the first ones, refugees, to come to Greenville.</span> <span id="s760">And we were really welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: What about the difference in attitude toward going into war?</span> <span id="s762">Obviously you knew why we were going there.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: But do you think that your fellow Americans wer --</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: I -- I think at the time, yes.</span> <span id="s766">I really think there were a lot of volunteers, and most people understood that that was a very necessary war, although to me, no war is -- is necessary.</span> <span id="s767">My husband always says, “What they should do is take the old people to fight the war, instead of the young ones.”</span> <span id="s768">Then it wouldn’t last very long.</span> <span id="s769">But I came to Greenville in ’42, so everything was still going on in Europe, you know.</span> <span id="s770">And the hardest thing we -- we were doing was trying to get people to write affidavits for other -- for people still left.</span> <span id="s771">Everybody was afraid to do that.</span> <span id="s772">They’d have to take care of them.</span> <span id="s773">And we said, “Look, we -- we are making our way,” you know.</span> <span id="s774">And -- and that was a disappointment, great disappointment.</span> <span id="s775">Some did, but not too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: But that was something you got involved with?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Oh yeah, yeah, we sure did.</span> <span id="s778">I -- you know, we -- we worked every day, all of us.</span> <span id="s779">And Greenville at the time didn’t know many Jews.</span> <span id="s780">No -- there weren’t any Jews that stood out that -- in politics, or public life, or whatever.</span> <span id="s781">And so people didn’t know much about Jews, and they actually felt my head for the horns.</span> <span id="s782">I mean, that’s what they thought Jews had, was horns.</span> <span id="s783">And -- so we -- we had a lot of groundwork to do.</span> <span id="s784">Even today we have big discussions with people, and -- it’s very pleasant, though.</span> <span id="s785">And also there was some anti-Semitism, but it was mostly they’d never known a Jew.</span> <span id="s786">They didn’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s787">And there were a lot of good people, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: What surprised you most about this country when you -- when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Well, when I first came to New York, the vastness of it just overwhelmed me, and I had to take the subway the first day to go to work.</span> <span id="s790">I had a friend who took me on the subway.</span> <span id="s791">It overwhelmed me, really, even though Vienna was a big city, but Antwerp was not, and all of a sudden everything was so big.</span> <span id="s792">All but our room.</span> <span id="s793">My mother and I had to stay in a little room and get dressed and undressed on top of the bed.</span> <span id="s794">But otherwise, everything was big.</span> <span id="s795">And in Greenville it was the other way again.</span> <span id="s796">All of a sudden I was in this small town, because at that time Greenville was a small town.</span> <span id="s797">Since then it has grown tremendously, but that’s the -- so it’s okay, it’s an okay place.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: After all of these years -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: And now we’re talking about many in this country.</span> <span id="s800">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: And since -- since your experiences in Europe, are there certain things, whether it’s a smell, whether it’s seeing a man in uniform, is there -- is there something that -- a -- a sound that brings it all back to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Well, mostly it’s when I’m asked to speak somewhere.</span> <span id="s803">I speak to lots of fifth graders, and they’re wonderful.</span> <span id="s804">They all write me letters.</span> <span id="s805">And I have boxes and boxes of letters of kids, cause I always say, “Tell me what you learned.”</span> <span id="s806">And then I don’t sleep very well.</span> <span id="s807">I -- it all goes through my mind.</span> <span id="s808">I sometimes go through old pictures, and it brings back memories.</span> <span id="s809">I’m lucky to have those old pictures, not everybody does.</span> <span id="s810">When I’m with my cousins, I remember the times when we were all little together, and what has happened since.</span> <span id="s811">Max and I really never spoke German at home, mostly because we were angry, and didn’t want our children to know the language.</span> <span id="s812">Our children were angry with us for not teaching them.</span> <span id="s813">But at that time we just didn’t want any part of German.</span> <span id="s814">We talked to each other when we sm -- met somebody German that wasn’t younger than us, didn’t trust them.</span> <span id="s815">Didn’t -- we were thinking, where were you?</span> <span id="s816">We still doing this a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Not much, but a little.</span> <span id="s818">So, you could say we’re still a little prejudiced, but we try not to be.</span> <span id="s819">The first time Max had somebody apply for a job as secretary who was German, we talked to each other, and he hired her, and she became a wonderful woman, and wonderful secretary.</span> <span id="s820">But I want everybody to think that way, that when they said all Jews were bad, and all Jews should die, I never want to do that about any class of people, including Germans.</span> <span id="s821">There were some good Germans who tried, and were afraid of their own lives.</span> <span id="s822">There were a lot of bad ones who wanted to take advantage of people.</span> <span id="s823">I could never understand the people that worked in concentration camps who did things they didn’t have to do.</span> <span id="s824">Where were these men that could kill children, and then go home to their own children?</span> <span id="s825">How is it possible?</span> <span id="s826">How -- what kind of human being was that?</span> <span id="s827">And that -- I always ask myself that, how is it possible?</span> <span id="s828">I -- I can’t -- and so we never wanted to hate anybody.</span> <span id="s829">And we taught that to our children, they know that.</span> <span id="s830">And we tried to be fair, and I hope we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Is there anything else you want to say about some of the, maybe adjustments you had to make in completely changing your lifestyle, your country, everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: You know, at the time you just do it.</span> <span id="s833">You have to, there is no choice.</span> <span id="s834">We never had a choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: But perhaps certain aspects of that adjustment are more che -- A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: -- diffi -- difficult at first.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Oh, they were all difficult, I guess, but we were so grateful for every good thing.</span> <span id="s838">Today’s young people have a lot of choices, and sometimes that doesn’t come out too well, because they have so many choices.</span> <span id="s839">We had no choice at all.</span> <span id="s840">It happened, we had to do what we had to do.</span> <span id="s841">I -- I don’t know what else to say about that, but sometimes that’s not all bad, that -- that we did it because we had to do it.</span> <span id="s842">Sometimes it’s better than having too many choices.</span> <span id="s843">And I -- I -- I don’t know why I say that, I want my children to have choices too, but not too many.</span> <span id="s844">At one point you have to make a decision.</span> <span id="s845">My husband is a great decision maker.</span> <span id="s846">I’ve learned that from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add, cause I’m -- A: Na --</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: -- delighted that you were able to do this, and -- A: Well, I’m --</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: -- share with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: -- I thank you for doing this, and I think it’s very important.</span> <span id="s851">I think that the world must know what happened, and not forget.</span> <span id="s852">I want thi -- my family to know all these little details.</span> <span id="s853">I want them to be good people, and they are.</span> <span id="s854">We are v-very lucky, we have lots of good people.</span> <span id="s855">I -- I hope I taught them all the right things.</span> <span id="s856">I -- it was difficult to suddenly bring up American children.</span> <span id="s857">I had to go out and buy books with nursery rhymes and songs to teach them.</span> <span id="s858">I didn’t know any.</span> <span id="s859">And that goes not only for that, but for everything else.</span> <span id="s860">It’s a whole different life, and also with every generation things change tremendously.</span> <span id="s861">We had to get used to a lot of changes, and I just want them to grow up [indecipherable] my children are very grown up, and so are my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s862">I want them to always be good, and fair, and we all love life together, and I want them to have the same with their families.</span> <span id="s863">And I’m very lucky to have been married 56 years to a wonderful guy.</span> <span id="s864">Now I’m crying.</span> <span id="s865">And I hope for many more.</span> <span id="s866">And I think that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: You know what, I didn’t want to go back and ask you this, but I’m so curious, because you were so protected, did you protect your children?</span></p> <p><span
