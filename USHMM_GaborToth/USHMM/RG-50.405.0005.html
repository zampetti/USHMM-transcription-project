DATE: June 11, 1990 I was born in Minsk in 1954.</span> <span id="s14">We lived well from the Russian point of view.</span> <span id="s15">I worked hard and [by the time we left the Soviet Union] we had a flat and a nice car.</span> <span id="s16">If you would ask people who lived in Russia, "Is this good?"</span> <span id="s17">they would say, "it is very good."</span> <span id="s18">When I was eight years old, my father died.</span> <span id="s19">My mother raised my brother, sister and me without any help.</span> <span id="s20">My mother's family was killed in the Ukraine during the Second World War, my father's father was killed in Byelorussia during the war, and my father's mother died when I was born - in the same year.</span> <span id="s21">My mother, a pediatrician, worked [was gone] 10 hours a day at two jobs, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s22">My brother Yakov, the oldest, and my sister Fayina took care of me.</span> <span id="s23">My mother prepared food for the whole day.</span> <span id="s24">We had breakfast and dinner together with mother.</span> <span id="s25">We only fixed our cold lunch.</span> <span id="s26">In those days I believe my mother slept no more than five hours a night.</span> <span id="s27">She prepared our clothes and our food.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">We lived in a government apartment with three rooms - two rooms plus a kitchen.</span> <span id="s29">The children slept together in one room.</span> <span id="s30">When I was [married] and we lived with my mother-in-law we lived five people in two rooms for eleven years.</span> <span id="s31">One room was a dining room and the other a bedroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Living so closely with other people, I think, taught us how to get along.</span> <span id="s33">I believe we learn something from every situation in our lives.</span> <span id="s34">If we have trouble and we solve the problem, then we have learned something.</span> <span id="s35">I think my mother taught me to be a good man.</span> <span id="s36">She didn't have time to sit and study with me.</span> <span id="s37">Sometimes she told me about her life and set a good example for me.</span> <span id="s38">I hope to bring her here - and my mother-in-law, too.</span> <span id="s39">I am working to bring them over.</span> <span id="s40">On the 13th of July they and my father-in-law have an appointment in the American Embassy.</span> <span id="s41">I believe in six months they could be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">My mother had a very difficult life.</span> <span id="s43">She was one of eight children and her oldest sister was married before the second war and lived in Chabarovsk, the far east of Russia.</span> <span id="s44">My mother was born in Sotanov, Kaminetsk Podolska.</span> <span id="s45">After the Bolshevik revolution and before the (second world) war, it was possible for her to get an education.</span> <span id="s46">At that time a lot of Jewish people were still in the government, from the revolution, and though it really was not easy, at that time it was not as tough to get an education if you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">The difficulties were worse after the war in the 1960's and 70's.</span> <span id="s48">I tried to enter medical school but couldn't because university and medical education and radio-electronic education were closed.</span> <span id="s49">Certain things were restricted to Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">My father finished automotive technical school before the war and went into the army until 1953.</span> <span id="s51">He fought against Germany and won a medal in the Japanese War.</span> <span id="s52">He served in the far east of Russia near the Pacific Ocean from the end of World War II until 1946.</span> <span id="s53">He met my mother in Chabarovsk, a town near the Japanese border.</span> <span id="s54">My mother finished Chabarovsk Medical University at that time and stayed to work at the University and met my father and they married.</span> <span id="s55">My brother was born in Chita and I was born in Byelorussia, about 10,000 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s56">My mother worked then like a Byelorussian woman with one job.</span> <span id="s57">While my father was in the army she traveled with him and worked as a doctor wherever he worked.</span> <span id="s58">After I was born, my father, mother, brother and sister lived in Minsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">I knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s60">I heard it a lot of times in my life on the street.</span> <span id="s61">Today I discuss this problem with someone I work with from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s62">He can't believe that in Russia it's hard for the Jews.</span> <span id="s63">When he worked in Yugoslavia with Jews, he didn't know who they were.</span> <span id="s64">In Russia everyone knew because of the stamp on our passports and we filled out a lot of forms with this information.</span> <span id="s65">This man is sixty.</span> <span id="s66">His aunt's husband (uncle) was a Jew in a [concentration] camp and his brother also.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">So we didn't really have a Jewish life.</span> <span id="s68">We didn't celebrate Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s69">In Minsk, capitol of Byelorussia, there are one and a half million people but only one small synagogue large enough for fifty people.</span> <span id="s70">It was very dangerous if someone knew you went to synagogue because you would have trouble with your job and organization.</span> <span id="s71">We did listen to Yiddish music and we would celebrate together.</span> <span id="s72">I remember my mother and father danced together and liked this music and my brother played accordion.</span> <span id="s73">My parents spoke a little Yiddish when they didn't want us to understand.</span> <span id="s74">My mother finished seven years in Jewish school and could read and write Yiddish.</span> <span id="s75">There were no schools in Minsk that could teach Hebrew or Yiddish [when I was growing up.]</span> <span id="s76">Maybe my parents would have liked to have more [Jewish culture or religion] in their lives.</span> <span id="s77">Here you see people smiling.</span> <span id="s78">In Russia people look very serious.</span> <span id="s79">Here people look for fun, they look for food and clothes, for good time, for rest.</span> <span id="s80">When people can laugh and tell jokes, when I see that people have pleasure, I like it.</span> <span id="s81">My son and I whenever we discuss the problem of moving to a new country, and each time he thanks us, saying he's glad to live here.</span> <span id="s82">And I am too, it's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">I was talking today with this man from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s84">I told him that all my mother's family was killed in the Ukraine and it was not by German people but the neighboring villagers.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">From the days of the Tsar, the Jews lived in the Pale, places where the Jews were permitted.</span> <span id="s86">These places were primarily in the Ukraine and Byelorussia.</span> <span id="s87">There was a percentage in each of these towns of the number of Jews permitted to live, and perhaps one per cent were allowed in every educational institution; high school and university, one Jew for every 100 of every other nationality.</span> <span id="s88">After the revolution these laws were ended.</span> <span id="s89">The quotas became unofficial.</span> <span id="s90">My mother's family was not wealthy.</span> <span id="s91">My mother's mother did not work.</span> <span id="s92">My mother's father was a tailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">At the start of the Second World War, my mother came to Satanov, her birthplace, and urged her family to move to [safety in the east] Chabarovsk, because within two weeks of the start of the war the Germans were already near Kiev.</span> <span id="s94">My mother's father answered her that Germans came to the same place in the first world war and never killed Jewish people and permitted them to stay in their homes.</span> <span id="s95">When the second war ended, my mother [returned and] tried to find out what happened to her parents.</span> <span id="s96">I was six years old and I remember we met a woman who told us everyone in this [Jewish] village died.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">This village was near the old Russian-Polish border.</span> <span id="s98">After 1939 the border moved to Poland because there was an agreement between Germany and Russia, part of Ukrainian Poland and Byelorussian Poland would be ruled by Russia.</span> <span id="s99">There is a river near this place which was the border.</span> <span id="s100">Under the river was a tunnel that had not been completed.</span> <span id="s101">Shortly after the war started in 1941, to this village, Satanov, people from a neighboring village came with guns, before the Germans came, and took all the Jewish people and put them in this tunnel.</span> <span id="s102">They took large stones and [sealed the tunnel and] the entire village was buried alive there.</span> <span id="s103">Men, women, and children, maybe two hundred people.</span> <span id="s104">All the belongings in the homes, and the materials of the homes were taken away.</span> <span id="s105">Nothing was left.</span> <span id="s106">This old woman lived in a typical Ukrainian hut with a dirt floor, built of bricks made of dried grass and mud and too low to stand.</span> <span id="s107">[The materials from the Jewish homes were used to improve the Ukrainian huts.]</span> <span id="s108">After the war no one was punished for the crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">I saw [what was left of the village] and my mother told me about it.</span> <span id="s110">Eight people of her family died this way.</span> <span id="s111">I think she learned about it immediately after the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">My father's mother survived the war.</span> <span id="s113">He had two sisters and his parents.</span> <span id="s114">On the second day of the war, June 22, my father went to the army.</span> <span id="s115">His family tried to leave Barisov but his father turned back because he became separated from his wife and daughters at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s116">He thought they might have gone home so he turned back to find them.</span> <span id="s117">They weren't there and when he returned to the station, the train was gone.</span> <span id="s118">He couldn't get transportation after that and remained in the town and died there.</span> <span id="s119">Nobody knows how.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">My father won six medals.</span> <span id="s121">There are two levels of honors.</span> <span id="s122">The first level is medals, the second and higher level is orders.</span> <span id="s123">He had two orders and six medals.</span> <span id="s124">One medal was for bravery, one medal for the battle of Koenigsberg, a German town, and for saving Moscow, battles with Japan.</span> <span id="s125">He attained the rank of captain by the end of his army career.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">My brother was born in 1946.</span> <span id="s127">My parents were married shortly after the war.</span> <span id="s128">My father worked as an automotive engineer.</span> <span id="s129">In Minsk an organization was operating for automobile leasing for the entire city.</span> <span id="s130">He was chief engineer/ administrator.</span> <span id="s131">It is hard to compare the living we had in Russia to the United States.</span> <span id="s132">What seemed like a lot in Russia is nothing in the United States.</span> <span id="s133">A car is a lifetime dream in Russia.</span> <span id="s134">In the United States anyone can buy a car.</span> <span id="s135">But we weren't hungry and we had enough of everything.</span> <span id="s136">My mother bought herself a new outfit maybe once in fifteen years but I had enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">I felt my mother was different from other mothers, but she was like all good mothers who try hard for her children.</span> <span id="s138">My good friends were Jewish.</span> <span id="s139">In Russia I had good friends and neighbors who were not Jewish but I always remembered I was Jewish and wondered what they thought about me.</span> <span id="s140">I can't say that every time I went in the street I had trouble about my nationality, but I had a lot of trouble in my life.</span> <span id="s141">It wasn't religion but nationality.</span> <span id="s142">I felt more free talking with people like myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">The first trouble I remember having as a Jew was in first grade.</span> <span id="s144">I think there was some in kindergarten but I don't remember.</span> <span id="s145">My son Lionel had a lot of trouble in school that began in kindergarten.</span> <span id="s146">The first time it was simple.</span> <span id="s147">A lot of names in Russia are used for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s148">There is a very strong synonym for a Jew - Zhid.</span> <span id="s149">In Polish this is not a bad word but in Russian it is.</span> <span id="s150">Every time I heard that word I was angry.</span> <span id="s151">It is a stereotype of a very bad person, a liar.</span> <span id="s152">When I read Russian literature, this word describes very bad people.</span> <span id="s153">Sometimes I would fight over this.</span> <span id="s154">In fifth grade, when I was about ten, one older boy tried to kick me and told me I should go to Israel.</span> <span id="s155">These people thought if you were Jewish you were not native, a guest and not a good one.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">In 1978 my friend left Russia and I thought about it.</span> <span id="s157">I asked my family about it because I wasn't really serious about it.</span> <span id="s158">Today I think if I had left sooner, I wouldn't have wasted so much of my lifetime.</span> <span id="s159">If I had left ten years ago it would have been better for my son and he'd have been happier.</span> <span id="s160">But in that time when I thought about leaving Russia, my son was only a year old.</span> <span id="s161">I had to make money, a lot of problems because my son was born two months premature and was very tiny, only one and a half kilograms.</span> <span id="s162">For two years he was sick and he had trouble sleeping.</span> <span id="s163">We had to take care of him.</span> <span id="s164">It was hard for us to plan then.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">It's really interesting.</span> <span id="s166">After I had enough of the good life in Russia, I decided to leave.</span> <span id="s167">When I had a flat, a car, a garage, when I could buy a summer cottage.</span> <span id="s168">After I worked at my company for ten years and I had reached a certain level as engineer, I understood that this was nothing.</span> <span id="s169">I couldn't do anything good for my son, for my family, that my life would remain the same until I died.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">In 1986 the Chernobyl accident occurred.</span> <span id="s171">It is only 320 kilometers from Minsk and from that time we couldn't read about it because Russian newspapers published very little about it.</span> <span id="s172">We learned about Chernobyl a week after it happened.</span> <span id="s173">We learned of it from Swiss radio.</span> <span id="s174">It was before the May Day celebration, and everybody went to the demonstration in Chernobyl.</span> <span id="s175">After that we learned we couldn't use the food.</span> <span id="s176">In the newspapers they told us not to eat onions because the bulb is underground and absorbed a lot of radiation.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">If I can't eat onion, how can I eat cucumber or other kind of vegetable?</span> <span id="s178">There was no reason for this.</span> <span id="s179">That's the typical Russian way.</span> <span id="s180">Someone tried to write an article that we shouldn't eat this food.</span> <span id="s181">But where were we going to get other food?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">It was difficult to buy any food in Russia, let alone without radiation exposure.</span> <span id="s183">After that somebody checked the article, and [censored it] and we could read only part of the article.</span> <span id="s184">When we were on vacation, we met a woman who worked in the medical department that checks pollution.</span> <span id="s185">She told us that all people who worked there signed that they never will tell about conditions of Minsk and other towns.</span> <span id="s186">They checked on the radiation levels of the water and soil.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">When my mother and mother-in-law write us letters now, they have more information, and they tell us conditions are even worse.</span> <span id="s188">If you know you are going to die because of the food, the air, and you can't change it, it is different than if you don't know.</span> <span id="s189">If you know you're going to die, then you don't want to work.</span> <span id="s190">Chernobyl was the last [straw].</span> <span id="s191">I had to think about my son.</span> <span id="s192">I left Russia in 1989.</span> <span id="s193">That means we were there with these conditions for three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">The situation in Russia was worse and worse everyday.</span> <span id="s195">During recent years, the official publications - newspapers, magazines and journals were not censored as much, and we could read more of the real situation in Russia.</span> <span id="s196">Economists were writing articles about conditions.</span> <span id="s197">Food and clothes cost more money.</span> <span id="s198">It's bad.</span> <span id="s199">I would see that pollution not just from Chernobyl but from Byelorussia was worse all the time.</span> <span id="s200">[For example] a lot of places were mined for potassium salt, a special kind of chemical fertilizer, and big holes remained after mining.</span> <span id="s201">Rain caused these holes to fill up with water.</span> <span id="s202">For fifty kilometers around these abandoned mines all of the plants died.</span> <span id="s203">Why?</span> <span id="s204">These chemicals in the water were so concentrated that all the surrounding vegetation died.</span> <span id="s205">A lot of villages are now deserted in these areas.</span> <span id="s206">I read that if in the spring there would be a lot of water from melting snow and rain, this area would grow bigger and bigger and bigger every summer.</span> <span id="s207">These holes were huge and more of this potassium salt was polluting this water.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">[Pollution] was happening everywhere in Russia, not just Byelorussia.</span> <span id="s209">Every river - fish were dying.</span> <span id="s210">Who owned this river?</span> <span id="s211">Who owned this land?</span> <span id="s212">Nobody cared about it.</span> <span id="s213">Everybody who came to work in these places was only concerned about himself, about what the bigger boss can get more for himself not the country.</span> <span id="s214">He would only be there for a period of time.</span> <span id="s215">People who lived there left the villages and went to towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Communism was a good idea.</span> <span id="s217">Like believing in God.</span> <span id="s218">Everybody will have what he is earning.</span> <span id="s219">But how can it be if nobody cares about it?</span> <span id="s220">It's not just that the system broke down.</span> <span id="s221">We had time to think about it.</span> <span id="s222">If I thought about it though, I could say something.</span> <span id="s223">If I said something, [I would be arrested] and die in the camp.</span> <span id="s224">Everybody tried not to think about it.</span> <span id="s225">And so we lived and worked this job and didn't tell other people.</span> <span id="s226">That's all.</span> <span id="s227">When Brezhnev was General Secretary, we could talk and it wasn't so dangerous.</span> <span id="s228">But I read about the time during Stalin and if people criticized the government they'd go to prison and die there.</span> <span id="s229">Now I can laugh afterward.</span> <span id="s230">It's strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">My wife's uncle who lived in Minsk told one joke at a celebration during Stalin's time, and they bought a cake with a drawing of the Kremlin on the cake.</span> <span id="s232">He said, while cutting the cake, "now we'll cut out the Kremlin."</span> <span id="s233">Someone who was at this party wrote a letter to the KGB and [her uncle] was arrested and died in prison.</span> <span id="s234">It's strange.</span> <span id="s235">People who live here can't understand how this could be.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A book that was published "underground" in Russia came into my hands and I learned about the Stalin period.</span> <span id="s237">I read Solzhenytzin for the first time five years ago.</span> <span id="s238">I read more interesting books and high level literature.</span> <span id="s239">Vasily Grossman, a Soviet writer, wrote a very good book in two parts about 25 years ago when Kosygin was president.</span> <span id="s240">He told Grossman the book would never be published in Russia.</span> <span id="s241">The book waited 20 years until it was published.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Recent articles and books have given us knowledge that we should leave Russia.</span> <span id="s243">Because not me nor anybody can change it.</span> <span id="s244">The party apparatus is so huge and powerful and every decision we should make must be discussed with the party apparatus.</span> <span id="s245">It's such a long way from this point to the point where things would be better and someone would give permission.</span> <span id="s246">So the good would be lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">For my job, for example, I worked as a project engineer.</span> <span id="s248">There were problems with machine building equipment.</span> <span id="s249">There wasn't enough equipment to build machines.</span> <span id="s250">In Russia it was decided that every plant that produced any kind of equipment should build machine building equipment for itself.</span> <span id="s251">This was a true political decision because every engineer understands that if I produce refrigerators, I can't produce equipment for producing refrigerators!</span></p> <p><span id="s252">The decision was that one plant which produced cars and large trucks should produce equipment for building these cars.</span> <span id="s253">We (the special design bureau) created the design on paper for the equipment but it was not possible to make it.</span> <span id="s254">It was a political decision.</span> <span id="s255">They asked our plant to build this equipment and subcontract it for additional money.</span> <span id="s256">It means that this company should arrange for another company that has the [means] to produce it.</span> <span id="s257">It's very difficult, a long way off.</span> <span id="s258">Every plant would lose a lot of money to build this equipment.</span> <span id="s259">One chief engineer of a large automobile plant told me, "If I build this equipment, I can't build the machines on the plan."</span> <span id="s260">(Every company in Russia has to meet its plan.]</span> <span id="s261">One company which produced other kind of machine building equipment that would produce our automatic line for our factory, came to our factory and asked for an explanation of the drawing.</span> <span id="s262">Sometimes as a joke we would ask this engineer about this thing.</span> <span id="s263">We [explained] we could make this project, my boss and I, in two months for 5,000 rubles, for example.</span> <span id="s264">They answered us, "We have 20,000 rubles for this project."</span> <span id="s265">It means that the government gave him 20,000 rubles for this project but it's difficult for them and it's new equipment for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">My boss said, "You can call the chief engineer of our company and ask him, maybe we can work as self-contractor for your company and we can design it after work.</span> <span id="s267">I will do the [design] work at home, for example, and plan this project for the other company."</span> <span id="s268">But when they called our chief engineer and asked him, he refused them.</span> <span id="s269">He thought that if we work at home after the job, it means that we will work on it perhaps during their working day.</span> <span id="s270">If we work eight hours during the day and go home and work four more hours on the other project, it means we won't work as hard during the day.</span> <span id="s271">This guy spent 20,000 rubles for this project and built a machine that was worse than we would build.</span> <span id="s272">It was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s273">Then nothing happened.</span> <span id="s274">This project was refused because automobile plants could not produce this equipment.</span> <span id="s275">A lot of money was wasted.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Money is paper in Russia.</span> <span id="s277">We can make new money, is the belief.</span> <span id="s278">A person could for example trade 100 dollars for 1500 rubles.</span> <span id="s279">If the official coefficient between the dollar and ruble is 60 kopecks for a dollar, the black market coefficient is one dollar for 15 rubles.</span> <span id="s280">That's the real [value] of a ruble.</span> <span id="s281">It's very difficult to understand how a country as rich as Russia, so much land and native resources in the ground, wood, and huge territories and two oceans and a lot of seas.</span> <span id="s282">This country could be the richest in the world but it's one of the poorest.</span> <span id="s283">What has done it?</span> <span id="s284">Only the wrong system.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">I couldn't solve the problems, [the deteriorating environment and an unworkable system].</span> <span id="s286">What would I have in Russia?</span> <span id="s287">When I had the things that were the dream of all Russian people, I understood that it's nothing because I couldn't solve anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Now in Minsk, the situation is the same as it was in Chicago in 1920.</span> <span id="s289">I saw the movie "The Godfather" about crime in Chicago about people who [demanded] money from others.</span> <span id="s290">The film was about mafia, people who killed people for money and asked if you opened a business to pay for it.</span> <span id="s291">This institution is now in Russia because more freedom is now the Russian policy.</span> <span id="s292">The police are weak now.</span> <span id="s293">There is no law against taking money from someone else.</span> <span id="s294">It's difficult to sue in this situation.</span> <span id="s295">You can read in Russian newspapers that a lot of groups make crime together.</span> <span id="s296">These people come to any place where a business is opened (now small businesses are allowed in Russia) and ask the owner for money to pay every month to these people.</span> <span id="s297">If you won't pay, they will break your equipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">And who will give you back your money?</span> <span id="s299">First of all in Russia, you can't insure your property.</span> <span id="s300">If I have a car and somebody damages it, and I get the money back, I'll get 5,000 rubles, for example.</span> <span id="s301">But a new car would cost 20,000 rubles.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">It means that [the criminal stands on firm ground].</span> <span id="s303">An athlete like a boxer who is, for example, thirty-five years old, who doesn't have any other kind of training, could come and demand money from me.</span> <span id="s304">These people don't protect you from the other group that might go after you.</span> <span id="s305">It's easier to make money this way.</span> <span id="s306">It can happen because for the first time the situation in Russia is not tight enough.</span> <span id="s307">Everybody can know who has money.</span> <span id="s308">If I have a business, I must have money.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">JCC WOMEN'S AUXILIARY ORAL HISTORY PROJECT INTERVIEW ON JUNE 25, 1990 SECOND INTERVIEW: YURI B.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">(I never really understood why your father died when you were eight years old.</span> <span id="s311">Could you explain?)</span> <span id="s312">He had a stroke.</span> <span id="s313">He was very ill, my father.</span> <span id="s314">A blood vessel in his head was broken.</span> <span id="s315">(Like a cerebral hemorrhage?)</span> <span id="s316">Yes.</span> <span id="s317">And he was in a small hospital, in a clinic, and he was supposed to stay without any movement because this is a very dangerous situation.</span> <span id="s318">And he was transported to another hospital and he only lived one day after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">I told you that he worked very hard in his office and he was a soldier.</span> <span id="s320">It was a difficult life for his family.</span> <span id="s321">I do not know what would have happened if he were not working in this place.</span> <span id="s322">I only know that he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">(You mentioned that before you left Minsk you saw some Mafioso types taking over, are you aware of it happening anywhere else?)</span> <span id="s324">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s325">It is in every town in Russia.</span> <span id="s326">I told you that I read about Tashkent, it is the capitol of Uzbek Republic and there were forty-seven groups (individual gangs) in Tashkent alone.</span> <span id="s327">This was officially published in Russia.</span> <span id="s328">Published about Moscow, about Chita - that's a place in far-east Russia.</span> <span id="s329">It is in every place.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">When I lived in Russia I had some - I can say business - but then I said that I was working two jobs.</span> <span id="s331">One was in the factory and it was a hard job.</span> <span id="s332">Then my friends and I, we played at parties.</span> <span id="s333">That means that when people celebrated a wedding, they would ask about a special place and music and people could talk or tell about (like a master of ceremonies) traditions.</span> <span id="s334">In Russia, in Byelorussia, when one celebrates a wedding party and when people eat or dance, this musician should make this time more entertaining.</span> <span id="s335">For example, in a wedding party, as a rule, are about one hundred people.</span> <span id="s336">This means everybody has different interests, one may like to dance, one like to eat.</span> <span id="s337">One may not like anything but I can tell him something interesting and he may enjoy himself.</span> <span id="s338">Everybody should have fun from this and musicians should try to make this happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">I had some connection with people.</span> <span id="s340">In Russia they call it to spawn business.</span> <span id="s341">That means I try to find people for whom I can play, I should find place where I can play.</span> <span id="s342">I had played for wedding parties about ten years.</span> <span id="s343">We had to pay the government out of the money we collected.</span> <span id="s344">Here you would call it a tax.</span> <span id="s345">Your own business was very difficult then, now it is more easy but more dangerous.</span> <span id="s346">I made from this party music job, two times more money than I earned at my regular job.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">I only played until I knew some people who tried to make their own business and these people had a lot of trouble from the Mafia.</span> <span id="s348">That means that it was really dangerous because they would listen on your phone and if they know that you had some money they would come to your house with guns and knives and ask about the money and if you don't want to give it up, (this has been published too) they actually shot people.</span> <span id="s349">This never happened to me because I didn't have such a big business.</span> <span id="s350">I only heard about these things but we all knew that the Mafia is a very big thing now in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Someone who works with me now, he is from Moscow, and he received a letter from his brother, who still lives in Moscow, and he wrote him something unbelievable is in Moscow now.</span> <span id="s352">The price for everything is so high that almost nobody can afford it.</span> <span id="s353">He told me that strawberries now, official cost is thirty-five rubles for one kilogram, but average actual salary rate in Russia is now one hundred eighty rubles per month.</span> <span id="s354">This means that one kilogram strawberries costs almost one quarter of a month salary.</span> <span id="s355">So the only ones who can afford strawberries are those who have their own business.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">(You saw things deteriorating in Russia, you said there was nothing you could do to make it better.</span> <span id="s357">Do you think everybody feels that way?)</span> <span id="s358">I think that everybody who thinks about it is very sure.</span> <span id="s359">If you have a lot of problems and no time to think about it - you know you have to spend at the time in lines waiting for food, then you can think about things.</span> <span id="s360">But usually you only have time to think about today, not tomorrow, or life in general, just today.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">(What made up your mind and when did you decide to leave?)</span> <span id="s362">To tell the truth, the situation is such in Russia now that everybody would like to leave.</span> <span id="s363">Not only Jews.</span> <span id="s364">And we received letters from our friends who lived with us on our floor in the apartment.</span> <span id="s365">As a rule, in Russia, all people live in what may look like houses but they have many stories, 8, 9, 12, 16, and in every floor live four or six families in four or six flats.</span> <span id="s366">Our neighbor wrote a letter to us, she is a Russian.</span> <span id="s367">She wrote that she would like to leave from Russia every time she writes.</span> <span id="s368">Her husband is in the communist party.</span> <span id="s369">Her father-in-law was a colonel in the Russian Army, not too high.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Good people who still live in Russia and do not make any deals which are against the law, they understand that they can't continue to live in this condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">When I had an invitation from Israel, without this I could not have left Russia.</span> <span id="s372">This was very difficult to get at that time and maybe almost impossible now.</span> <span id="s373">We didn't have close relatives in Israel, which means no one to invite us.</span> <span id="s374">I asked my mother-in-law and her cousin went to Israel as a tourist to meet with her relatives.</span> <span id="s375">We gave her a copy of all our papers and the information and where we lived and she took it with her.</span> <span id="s376">She was there in June of 1988 and the invitation came on the fifteenth of October.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Then I had to start thinking.</span> <span id="s378">Because nobody can know what will happen in two days, in two weeks, in two months, in Russia!</span> <span id="s379">And if you ask about permission to leave Russia, from that moment you are almost against the law.</span> <span id="s380">Not so bad now, it was more difficult earlier.</span> <span id="s381">But we didn't know what would happen with those people who try to make something different from the government policies and everybody in Russia is afraid of what might happen in the next two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">When, in 1980, some people stayed after they asked for permission to leave Russia, and they couldn't find jobs, they couldn't live in their apartments, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s383">In time - ten years!</span> <span id="s384">- they got out.</span> <span id="s385">I really had no choice, when I started to think about what could happen if I stayed in Russia, it was a difficult decision.</span> <span id="s386">But, when I think about my son, about his future, I knew that I should take this step.</span> <span id="s387">I told you that I could see the situation in Russia and I could see no solution to the problems.</span> <span id="s388">Now it is an even worse situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">I talk with people who came here a half year after me, and people who came here as tourists and still was suppression and anger and I am glad that I made the decision a year ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">After I got the invitation I began to fill in all the papers.</span> <span id="s391">I had to fill a lot of papers where I should make descriptions of all my relatives, where they were born, where my grandfather died and I should take permission from my mother and my wife's father and mother.</span> <span id="s392">And their permission, that they did not need money or support from us and we could leave.</span> <span id="s393">When we had filled out all the papers we gave it in to a special organization in Russia.</span> <span id="s394">It is part of the police and it is called the Department of Visas and Registration - OVIR, it means the Department that works with papers for people who should go traveling or leave from Russia.</span> <span id="s395">We presented these papers and we waited about two or three months, because we filled papers for us and for my wife's parents and they had permission before my wife and myself.</span> <span id="s396">But my mother-in-law was quite sick and she decided she should stay in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">In the middle of July we got permission from the Soviet government about leaving Russia.</span> <span id="s398">I stopped my work in January of 1989 and we left the 23th of March.</span> <span id="s399">In my situation I didn't have a special work, when I had permission I would go to the Personnel department of my office.</span> <span id="s400">But before, when I fulfilled all obligations for leaving Russia, I went there and the chief of the Personnel Department would sign on my work load that I would like to leave from Russia.</span> <span id="s401">I was a project engineer, that means that I should draw other work.</span> <span id="s402">I wasn't a chief.</span> <span id="s403">But people who work as a teacher or as some kind of a chief, as a rule, they should leave their job.</span> <span id="s404">How can you do a good job of teaching if you are planning to leave Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">In this time, it is not so difficult.</span> <span id="s406">I remember how it was in 1980, when somebody tried to leave from Russia.</span> <span id="s407">After they filled the applications for leaving, people who worked with them, could not have additional money.</span> <span id="s408">In Russia, we can take only part of our salary in money.</span> <span id="s409">For example, I work for a month and I have one hundred rubles.</span> <span id="s410">If the agreement which I brought you is good, I can have additional money, perhaps fifty percent.</span> <span id="s411">This additional money is not stable, it depends on chief of our office to decide who would have this money.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">When, in 1980, people left Russia, other people who worked with them could not have this money, for three, four, five months.</span> <span id="s413">It is not much but it is additional money but we all the time think about.</span> <span id="s414">It gives us something extra to buy something with.</span> <span id="s415">I heard a lot of discussions about, why should we work with Jewish people, when, if they leave, we can't have our money?</span> <span id="s416">But now it is not so because so many people try to leave Russia that it is not so much excitement for other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">For example, when I fill application, I should get a signature from chief of party office in my company.</span> <span id="s418">I didn't, I never was a member of the communist party, but these people should sign.</span> <span id="s419">After that I should go to Komsomol chief of young party organization.</span> <span id="s420">After that the chief of the labor organization should sign this paper.</span> <span id="s421">They all have to sign that I don't have any debt to them, they give me permission to leave.</span> <span id="s422">But, I saw that these people don't wish me luck, but they don't wish me bad luck.</span> <span id="s423">I saw some hostility, but not from the people who had to sign the permissions.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">To tell the truth I never wished to go to the communist party because I understood that if I am a member of the communist party and I am Jewish, I couldn't take any good level in any department anyway.</span> <span id="s425">Now it doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s426">In other times people who tried to take a higher position had to be communists, but it was not for Jewish people as a rule, whether he was a member or not.</span> <span id="s427">It is very difficult to be a member of the communist party.</span> <span id="s428">For Russian people it is a real advantage because it means for these people if they want to make good money or a good job position they should be a member of the party.</span> <span id="s429">And, in every place there are schedules about how many people should be a member of the communist party and what kind of people can be a member.</span> <span id="s430">Not only with the communist party, with all things.</span> <span id="s431">Because in Russia, very interesting thing, if you read any book which calculate statistically the conditions, you can see a same percent of people in every year.</span> <span id="s432">Members of communist party: 50% are Labor people; 30% are from collective farms; 20% are people from intellectual work, professionals.</span> <span id="s433">From these people you will see 55% are men, 45% are women, for example, in this area, in this area, and in this area.</span> <span id="s434">In the area of labor for example, 30% with Eighth Grade education; 60% with Tenth grade - I'm only trying to tell you that statistics in Russia, are not real statistics.</span> <span id="s435">People who work in our government make our statistics, which means that every place has a schedule of how many people they can take as member of communist party and what kinds of people can be a member.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">If, for five years, there weren't any place for a Jewish member, that means no Jew could be a member of the communist party.</span> <span id="s437">Or anything.</span> <span id="s438">Because there was a very funny situation, you know that in Russia there are only three or four big factories which produce automobiles.</span> <span id="s439">Our company, where I worked, built some equipment for one of the factories.</span> <span id="s440">This factory produced a big car, a car which would be used for a family car.</span> <span id="s441">This car looked like an Italian Fiat.</span> <span id="s442">The Soviet government had a license to produce this car.</span> <span id="s443">We built some lines for this company.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">After this was scheduled there were two or three people who should have special recognition from the government, medal or an award.</span> <span id="s445">I think maybe it is the same in the United States.</span> <span id="s446">I told you if somebody, if I am a soldier and I fight very well, I can have special kind of medal and the same situation is in the factories.</span> <span id="s447">There are some special awards for people who work very well.</span> <span id="s448">And if you earn this kind of award, when you retire you will have certain rewards.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">And this was scheduled for some people who should receive these awards.</span> <span id="s450">And there were some people who really worked hard and should have this recognition, but they couldn't fit into the statistical description.</span> <span id="s451">One medal and award assigned, was given one man who worked maybe very hard, but didn't make anything special.</span> <span id="s452">And when everybody heard about it, all the people were very excited.</span> <span id="s453">Why did this happen?</span> <span id="s454">they asked.</span> <span id="s455">There were a lot of people with good minds who made a lot of things for this company.</span> <span id="s456">After that somebody, I don't know who, talked about the schedule and said that these people should be first, the Ukrainians; second, someone without a higher education; he should be the same age.</span> <span id="s457">And when someone checked and found maybe five or ten people and they selected this guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">(When you left, you had to pay for your own airline ticket and what were you allowed to take with you?)</span> <span id="s459">We could take with us, two suitcases each.</span> <span id="s460">Which meant six suitcases for our family.</span> <span id="s461">So we knew what we could take and what we could not take.</span> <span id="s462">We could not take any jewelry.</span> <span id="s463">Of course, anybody who was more than eighteen years could take five pieces of jewelry.</span> <span id="s464">The cost for each should be not more than two hundred fifty rubles.</span> <span id="s465">Not much.</span> <span id="s466">We didn't have anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">If I had a good piece of jewelry, like a ring, I could sell it before we left.</span> <span id="s468">But it is very difficult as doing this is against the law.</span> <span id="s469">If it really has a high value it would be very hard to sell.</span> <span id="s470">First, I could not know the real value of it.</span> <span id="s471">If the ring is with diamond, I should go to Moscow, and in Moscow there are special organizations to tell me what the value is.</span> <span id="s472">But, if I went there and asked about a ring which cost about one hundred thousand rubles, after that I think that I can cross border because KGB knows that I have this ring and that I would take it with me and I would have a lot of money.</span> <span id="s473">And I can take no money out of the country.</span> <span id="s474">We can change ninety rubles per person into United States dollars when we leave.</span> <span id="s475">Ninety rubles for each person.</span> <span id="s476">It means that when we crossed the Russian border we had three hundred forty dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">I left my car there for my sister, but I sold some other things that we had.</span> <span id="s478">I sold them and I had maybe ten thousand rubles and I left this with my mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s479">But I know other people who had much money in Russia and now these people change this money.</span> <span id="s480">I know that if my relatives need money I can ask these people and their relative can give Russian money to my relatives in Russia and I should give them American money here.</span> <span id="s481">It is very complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">It is not a good situation.</span> <span id="s483">I told you that co-efficient between ruble and dollar from here means that for fifteen rubles I should pay one dollar, but the official co-efficient for half-ruble it is one dollar.</span> <span id="s484">That is a real difference.</span> <span id="s485">Between the official co-efficient and the black market one.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">We did not take a plane from Russia, we took a train from Minsk.</span> <span id="s487">From there we went to Briest, a town on the Russia-Poland border, from that place we took another train.</span> <span id="s488">We put on our suitcases and then stopped in Poland for maybe six hours.</span> <span id="s489">This was in Warsaw and there we spent some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">It was difficult, because when we bought the tickets in Russia, the tickets were for Austria.</span> <span id="s491">We should travel to Austria but we should change our train in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s492">When we arrived in Warsaw we found that we could not use our tickets on the train.</span> <span id="s493">This happens to all people who travel.</span> <span id="s494">These tickets were sold without a place being available.</span> <span id="s495">I can't move to Austria but I did not have a place for it.</span> <span id="s496">We had one friend in Russia who had another friend in Poland and this friend met us at the railroad station and he had a special agreement with the people who sell the tickets.</span> <span id="s497">He met us because we knew we would have this kind of trouble with the tickets.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">He agreed with people who could sell tickets and he bought these tickets for us because there is a special kind of Mafia in the Warsaw railroad station and they ask you about dollars.</span> <span id="s499">You can really spend all three hundred dollars you have on your next tickets in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s500">You can sell these tickets for anything you want.</span> <span id="s501">And what kind of money could I have?</span> <span id="s502">If I crossed the Russian border, I shouldn't have Russian money.</span> <span id="s503">I shouldn't have Polish money.</span> <span id="s504">I only have the ticket and three hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s505">And the people in Poland know I should only have this kind of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">And when we put our luggage on the train, the official people who work on this train told us you have only three seats but we don't have place for your luggage and you should take the luggage and pay for a place for it.</span> <span id="s507">In Warsaw, the trains stay in the railroad station only twelve minutes.</span> <span id="s508">During this twelve minutes I should put away my luggage.</span> <span id="s509">This train worker said, "Well, I can take it out."</span> <span id="s510">After that, I knew about it and I give him some present but this is a common practice.</span> <span id="s511">But it was a difficult time.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">When our train arrived in Vienna, we took out all our luggage and people met us and it was wild, there were maybe one hundred - two hundred people from Russia.</span> <span id="s513">There was one person from HIAS who met us.</span> <span id="s514">He told us step by step, the luggage should go here, you should stand there.</span> <span id="s515">He had all the names of the people who came and he got a lot of luggage carts and he called somebody to put the luggage in the carts and took it to the place where these people should be.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">All these people from Russia were scheduled to go to Israel but when we were in the HIAS two days after we arrived in Vienna.</span> <span id="s517">We were in Sackhmut, an Israeli organization, and HIAS and everybody was asked if we would like to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s518">When I said that I would like to do this, they asked if I had any relatives in Israel.</span> <span id="s519">I told them "No."</span> <span id="s520">I have a friend there and cousins here.</span> <span id="s521">And nobody asked me any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">When we were in Russia I had a lot of friends who left before me.</span> <span id="s523">And I read their letters in Russia and I know that before, no one was asked about Israel.</span> <span id="s524">I was surprised because I thought that everybody who lived in Russia is prepared for anything but everything can be changed.</span> <span id="s525">It is strange, but it is the psychology of people.</span> <span id="s526">It is difficult to change.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">They had a place for us to stay, not in Vienna, but near to it.</span> <span id="s528">And when we were in HIAS they gave us money.</span> <span id="s529">On the second day, but on the first day we could buy food by changing some of our dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">On the second day, when I said I wanted to go to the United States they asked me who could be my invitation.</span> <span id="s531">I had some friends in Chicago who had worked with me in Russia.</span> <span id="s532">I called them and asked them if they would give me an invitation to Chicago.</span> <span id="s533">And I told their name and we put the name on the application.</span> <span id="s534">And after that we waited maybe two weeks and moved to Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">We took a train to Italy, first we were in Rome, then after one week we moved to a place about thirty-five kilometers outside of Rome - Santa Marinella.</span> <span id="s536">It was hard there because we couldn't find a place to live.</span> <span id="s537">We had some money, but in that time, this money wasn't enough.</span> <span id="s538">In that time, there was so many people that I think HIAS could only do so much for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">We waited for a time for an appointment with the American Counsel.</span> <span id="s540">At that time we should prove that we are refugees.</span> <span id="s541">I don't know, I think it is political and you should know it.</span> <span id="s542">We should explain why we can that we are leaving.</span> <span id="s543">What happened to us in Russia?</span> <span id="s544">Why was it difficult for us?</span> <span id="s545">And the first time we had some official appointments in Rome and in Ladispoli, a place near Rome, with HIAS.</span> <span id="s546">After all the papers were filled we had an appointment at the consulate and discussed the same problem with the person at the consulate and after this we waited about ten days until we heard from them and after that, we could qualify as refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">I decided we are lucky, because people who came here on other status - not as refugees, have more problems than we do.</span> <span id="s548">Now we can see people if we have some problems, and if we can't find a job.</span> <span id="s549">The American government will help us to become citizens.</span> <span id="s550">The people who came here with other status cannot get this help.</span> <span id="s551">It is very difficult when we think about relatives who live in Russia who have the same appointment with the American Embassy in Moscow, if he decides to come here and asks about permission to come here.</span> <span id="s552">Will he have an appointment with the American Embassy in Moscow?</span> <span id="s553">and after that, if he will have good counsel.</span> <span id="s554">But if all the relatives look like my mother or a relative of my wife should come here without any medical support we can, in any case send for them.</span> <span id="s555">I like it.</span> <span id="s556">But I think that it is very difficult to support all one's relatives in the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Everybody in Italy tries to understand how the people from the American Consulate can decide who is refugee and who is not.</span> <span id="s558">I don't know how it goes.</span> <span id="s559">Because when I was in HIAS, I heard a lot of different stories, this was maybe the sixth or seventh place where we discussed this.</span> <span id="s560">Everybody spoke Russian and the translator translated.</span> <span id="s561">I could hear what everyone told.</span> <span id="s562">It was so exciting, but it seemed that when I told my story, it was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">The people from KGB questioned one man and put on a chair and used a rope and they asked him something, I didn't hear what.</span> <span id="s564">But it seemed so strange, how can this happen?</span> <span id="s565">And everybody knows everybody and somebody would write a strange story, because nobody knew what they should write.</span> <span id="s566">It is not always all the truth every time.</span> <span id="s567">Somebody would say something had happened to him and it had happened to somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Nobody knows what the people from the Embassy need to hear.</span> <span id="s569">Everyone is confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">After we got the refugee status we were in Italy another two weeks.</span> <span id="s571">First we flew to New York and after two hours came on to Chicago.</span> <span id="s572">Our friends were there to meet us.</span> <span id="s573">I was so happy to see them because I could not speak any English.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">I was very lucky in finding a job here.</span> <span id="s575">I wrote a resume' and asked my friend to correct it because I couldn't write proper English.</span> <span id="s576">And I took some information from the Chicago Tribune and sent the resume'.</span> <span id="s577">I had some appointments, suddenly I found the place where I am now.</span> <span id="s578">I came there and spoke with the owner and his firm should have a good future.</span> <span id="s579">They have a big agreement with Korea.</span> <span id="s580">The firm is not too far from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">I never designed these kind of machines in Russia but it is all right.</span> <span id="s582">The work is different than Russia, because there I worked on the drawing board, here I work on the computer.</span> <span id="s583">I am not sure of the future here, because I don't know what will happen when we finish this big project.</span> <span id="s584">I don't know what will happen to the firm.</span> <span id="s585">Maybe some people will be let go by.</span> <span id="s586">But now I feel more comfortable about looking for the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">When I came here I didn't know about the level of engineering in the United States, whether or not it was higher than in Russia, and I had nothing to compare it to.</span> <span id="s588">Now I see that I can work the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">My wife is a computer programmer.</span> <span id="s590">This is what she did in Minsk.</span> <span id="s591">She had to learn a lot because it is a different kind of computer, another kind of computer language.</span> <span id="s592">At first she studied from the book and then she took small advanced courses at the University.</span> <span id="s593">Her professor told her that she does fine and this made us very happy because we didn't know how we could work in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">When we first came here it was hard to find an apartment of our own because we didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s595">This apartment is not as comfortable as how we lived in Russia but that is not important.</span> <span id="s596">I am so glad that we are here and my son eats fruit every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">I am afraid that an explanation of what I miss in Russia, you don't have that kind of time.</span> <span id="s598">I can't begin to tell you which is the a better side.</span> <span id="s599">Russia is such a huge country and every republic is so different from every other republic.</span> <span id="s600">Even three hundred years of Russia has not made them same.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">It is very difficult to change something.</span> <span id="s602">Who lived where makes such a difference.</span> <span id="s603">Ukrainians produced bread.</span> <span id="s604">Byelorussians produced potatoes.</span> <span id="s605">Some republics can mine minerals.</span> <span id="s606">Some republics can produce, for example, Uzbek can only produce cotton.</span> <span id="s607">It may not be real cotton, it is only the first steps, they only produce the raw material.</span> <span id="s608">Some other republic uses the raw material.</span> <span id="s609">When Lithuania asked about independence, Gorbachev took all the products away from them, and Lithuania doesn't ask about independence now.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">I have friends in Russia that I would like to see again.</span> <span id="s611">And, I love Russian literature because I can understand it.</span> <span id="s612">And it is a very rich literature.</span> <span id="s613">I like the Russian language because it is my language.</span> <span id="s614">Maybe in time I will feel differently.</span> <span id="s615">I know people who say they don't miss Russia, but they speak Russian at home.</span> <span id="s616">They also try to have their children speak Russian too.</span> <span id="s617">It is part of our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">I think that I might be in Russia sometime and I didn't see a lot of real interesting towns in Russia.</span> <span id="s619">Because I didn't have time.</span> <span id="s620">The first time I have ever moved my family was to America.</span> <span id="s621">I might go back as a visitor, maybe, but I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">For the future, first, I want to help our relatives in Russia so that they can come here.</span> <span id="s623">If they can make it, I will feel good.</span> <span id="s624">They are all people I like and I want to have them near me.</span> <span id="s625">For my son, he should do well in high school.</span> <span id="s626">And we should all be good American people and then I will feel good.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">I know what I think would work for my son as a career but he should decide.</span> <span id="s628">But I try to put him on the right way.</span> <span id="s629">I think that in time he will understand the United States better.</span> <span id="s630">Even now he feels more comfortable than when we first came.</span> <span id="s631">Now he is fluent in the language.</span> <span id="s632">He goes to public school here.</span> <span id="s633">I asked him if he would like to go to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s634">I told him that in Russia we didn't have any religious education, there was no cause for it.</span> <span id="s635">When we were in Italy, he went to school.</span> <span id="s636">His school was in a synagogue.</span> <span id="s637">The first time he was very excited about the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s638">After that, when his teacher was changed, the teacher told him that the Jewish religion was best religion in the world.</span> <span id="s639">All other kinds of religion are not as good.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">When my son came home, he told me he would not go back to this school because the teacher told him a lie.</span> <span id="s641">If other kinds of religion are not as good as the Jewish religion, everyone could see this and everyone would be a Jew.</span> <span id="s642">It was a difficult time for us and he didn't go back to that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">All the people who have helped us are Jewish.</span> <span id="s644">There are two families who have helped us.</span> <span id="s645">One is the Galens (Leslie) (they live in Highland Park) and the second, they live in Lincolnwood, the Bernsteins (Harriet).</span> <span id="s646">They have come to our house and did some things for my son.</span> <span id="s647">Sometimes they play games with him.</span> <span id="s648">And sometimes we go to the synagogue with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">You know, people cannot live alone.</span> <span id="s650">We should be with somebody.</span></p></body></html>
