had a very nice life.</span> <span id="s17">I was very young.</span> <span id="s18">My mother was very, very good person, my father too.</span> <span id="s19">He made a nice living.</span> <span id="s20">We weren't rich, but we weren't poor either.</span> <span id="s21">In Poland, if you had enough to eat, you were rich.</span> <span id="s22">So, we had enough food.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: What kind of work did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: My father had people working, making shoes.</span> <span id="s25">People worked for us.</span> <span id="s26">We had about five or six people working for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Now, were you neighbors Jewish?</span> <span id="s28">Did you go to a Jewish school, a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I went to a public school, but a public school in Poland were Jews separate and Poles separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Even before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Before the war.</span> <span id="s32">And they used to throw stones at us – and we were small kids – the Polish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Was this all before the war?</span> <span id="s34">A: All before the war, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: So you were aware of a lot of antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s37">I knew it because they didn't like each other.</span> <span id="s38">They didn't like us, so we didn't like them.</span> <span id="s39">I think we could like everybody that likes us.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Did you have friends or neighbors that were Gentile when you were young?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">1 Maków Mazowiecki</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yes, yes we had.</span> <span id="s43">My father had people working for us and they were Gentiles, and we got along fantastically, but when the war started, they started robbing us.</span> <span id="s44">There were no friendships.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: So your neighbor or good friends changed on you?</span> <span id="s46">A: They changed completely.</span> <span id="s47">They weren't the same.</span> <span id="s48">Q: Do you remember how you all felt about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: How I felt?</span> <span id="s50">Terrible.</span> <span id="s51">My father, they took him to the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s52">My mother was left with five children and we didn't have to eat much, and I remember a German man came to our house and he said in German "vielleicht meine Frau und Kinder, sie leiden auch," like their children suffered too.</span> <span id="s53">He told my mother you're so young and you're beautiful.</span> <span id="s54">Leave here, take your children and go, but my mother had a mother that she had red eyes and she was old and she wouldn't leave her mother.</span> <span id="s55">She had a sister one sister she was the most beautiful girl in the whole city but blonde hair.</span> <span id="s56">She was only 18 years old and one sister had two children and my mother wouldn't leave her sister.</span> <span id="s57">So, they didn't leave so she sent away her sister, the 18 year old with white blonde hair but me and my brother – my brother is in Israel now, he's younger, four years, than me and a sister two years younger – she sent us away to the Russian side, so the border we couldn't go through so at night we went through because it was already closed, the border.</span> <span id="s58">We had a very hard time getting through there.</span> <span id="s59">We came to Lomza.</span> <span id="s60">It was in Poland, a place where my mother left.</span> <span id="s61">She was wearing a green scarf and she was crying.</span> <span id="s62">I said, “Mommy don't cry.</span> <span id="s63">We're going to see each other.</span> <span id="s64">It's not going to take long.”</span> <span id="s65">Who knew for the rest of my life I'd never see her again?</span> <span id="s66">We left and my aunt brought us there.</span> <span id="s67">She brought us to Lomza.</span> <span id="s68">My father wasn't there.</span> <span id="s69">My father was in the army and he came back home so I was praying that my mother's going to come.</span> <span id="s70">Then my father came alone and my aunt gave us away in an orphanage and she left to bring my mother, to bring the whole family here and she gave us to an orphanage, and I was crying every single day.</span> <span id="s71">Every single day, “Where's my mommy?</span> <span id="s72">I don't have my mommy.</span> <span id="s73">I want my mommy.”</span> <span id="s74">I was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: I was at that time about ten years old and my brother was little.</span> <span id="s77">He was about four years younger than me and my sister was two years younger than me and we're all in an orphanage in Lomza and we were crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">01:07:00 I was crying the most because when I was young I used to go up to mother like this holding her by her dress.</span> <span id="s79">I was very attached to my mother.</span> <span id="s80">So, what happened, my 2 “Maybe my wife and children are suffering, too” (German) father came by himself, for my aunt was there and she never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Did you find out what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: She wanted to pass the border but they wouldn't let her, a few times.</span> <span id="s83">My father was afraid to leave us and I was crying so much when I saw just my father.</span> <span id="s84">I said, “No it can't be that my father came alone.”</span> <span id="s85">My father a few times he went again to bring my mother but he couldn't pass the border.</span> <span id="s86">That, we were separated.</span> <span id="s87">We were separated and the war started again.</span> <span id="s88">We went from Lomza to Lakhva with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: You never found out any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yes, I found out.</span> <span id="s91">It was one man that my father thought – Zalewskiwas his name – that he is the biggest antisemite, the other people, he thought they were nice.</span> <span id="s92">And he helped my mother.</span> <span id="s93">He helped the brother put her in a ghetto and they brought her food and they were helping her.</span> <span id="s94">It's the only person that we thought was the biggest antisemite – he was helping my mother.</span> <span id="s95">We went to Lakhva to a small town and I went to the Russian school there.</span> <span id="s96">I was very good in school, and my father was so proud of me.</span> <span id="s97">“The war is going to finish and we're going to see your mother and everybody is going to come together.”</span> <span id="s98">My father wrote to Stalin a letter that he should let my mother come and if the war wouldn't have started my mother would have come with the children.</span> <span id="s99">All the family would come.</span> <span id="s100">But the war started and the Germans came, and we again are in trouble, run away from the Germans.</span> <span id="s101">So, when the Germans came it started being a lot of trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: What year is this do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: What year he Germans came?</span> <span id="s104">I think it's '41 or '42.</span> <span id="s105">I can't remember the dates, but I know when it started the ghetto, it was in September because the ghetto started and my father was – they made him in the committee, then we started listening and hearing.</span> <span id="s106">I wanted to run off from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s107">So we had people that were police in the ghetto – Jewish people, young guys.</span> <span id="s108">So I started running out of the ghetto to steal bread – because I was a tomboy – to bring some bread, not steal, bring some bread to the house.</span> <span id="s109">We should have something to eat.</span> <span id="s110">I just didn't eat by myself and I brought bread when I ran out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s111">I gave to lots of people.</span> <span id="s112">I say, “If I'm going to be hungry and if I'm going to die, if they're going to die, if I'm going to live, I want them to live too.</span> <span id="s113">Why should I live and they should die?”</span> <span id="s114">So, I gave to everybody a piece to that, and a piece to that, and then one time I wanted to run out and a policeman – like a Jewish policeman, he was for us good and he wasn't for the Germans – he said, “You know somebody is going to catch you and they're going to kill you.”</span> <span id="s115">One time it happened that before the ghetto start, a German man with a blind eye came and he said, “Does Jews live here?”</span> <span id="s116">and I said “no.”</span> <span id="s117">And he went in and Jews were living there and he came out and he was beating me so much.</span> <span id="s118">He was beating me like he wanted to kill me.</span> <span id="s119">Then he was gone, so I run away</span></p> <p><span id="s120">3 Stanislaw Zalewski and I came to a neighbor of ours under the bed I was laying and when he came he said, “Where is the maid?</span> <span id="s121">Ich will sie totschlagen."</span> <span id="s122">He would have killed me.</span> <span id="s123">Because for them to say a lie is the worst thing that you could do.</span> <span id="s124">That's before the ghetto started.</span> <span id="s125">I was so beaten I couldn't see.</span> <span id="s126">I couldn't walk for weeks.</span> <span id="s127">That much he beat me.</span> <span id="s128">And then I started with the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Let me just stop you for a second.</span> <span id="s130">I want to hear a little bit about how the ghetto came into being, I mean if you remember what life was like in Lakhva and how long you were there before you were confined.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: In Lakhva, the people were very nice.</span> <span id="s132">They were very good.</span> <span id="s133">Like when we came the Russians were still there.</span> <span id="s134">So, the neighbors, they brought butter milk and that brought bread.</span> <span id="s135">That became, we were like strangers there, and everybody brought something else.</span> <span id="s136">Me, my father and my sister when we came, and my brother and my sister and my father.</span> <span id="s137">They were so friendly.</span> <span id="s138">It really was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s139">I had a friend.</span> <span id="s140">She's still in New York next door, like the next house, and we became very close friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Were most of the people you associated with in Lakhva Jewish or everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Mostly Jewish, in Belorus also, but the Belorus people weren't as bad as – they became bad when the Germans came, but they weren't as bad.</span> <span id="s143">Like my mother's sister had beautiful things.</span> <span id="s144">She was young.</span> <span id="s145">I gave it away it somebody and when I came back after the war she wouldn't give me nothing back.</span> <span id="s146">They were takers.</span> <span id="s147">They didn't like Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Nobody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">01:14:00</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Did you go to school in Lakhva?</span> <span id="s151">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s152">I went to the Russian school.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: How long were you in Lakhva before the ghetto was formed?</span> <span id="s154">A: I can't remember.</span> <span id="s155">The ghetto was formed in 1942 probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: I can give you that date but I'm trying to figure out how long you were there.</span> <span id="s157">Was it weeks, was it months?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: It was a few months, not too long, a few months, and then they started the ghetto.</span> <span id="s159">Q: The ghetto I believe was formed in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">4 “I want to kill her” (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: I think it was 1942.</span> <span id="s162">I can't remember that, like my memory got completely – especially that time, I have no memory of that.</span> <span id="s163">I can't remember the dates at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: So, you were in Lakhva several months before the ghetto?</span> <span id="s165">A: In the ghetto before the Germans came, several months, yes.</span> <span id="s166">Q: Weren't the Germans there for a while before the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s168">The Germans came.</span> <span id="s169">I was in Lakhva maybe more than a year, maybe a year and half or two before – I think maybe a year and half.</span> <span id="s170">I can't remember how long when the Germans came.</span> <span id="s171">I don't even remember which year they came.</span> <span id="s172">I can't remember, but my memory slipped completely about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: So, when the Germans came to Lakhva, did they form the ghetto immediately?</span> <span id="s174">A: Not long after, a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: What was the ghetto like?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: A few families were in one house, they lived in one house, like three or four families.</span> <span id="s177">We had like – we made, it wasn't beds, it was like they made they put like wood on the top and on the bottom something like that to sleep and there were a few families living together in the ghetto, and then we started hearing that they are going to kill the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">When they're going to kill the Jews then somebody came and they said to my father that, “I think it's going to happen in the next few days.”</span> <span id="s179">So, when they started talking about burning everything, like all the things we have, we should burn.</span> <span id="s180">Nobody should have it.</span> <span id="s181">Not the Belorus, not the Germans, should get nothing that we have.</span> <span id="s182">We started putting gasoline when we knew that the next day we're going to get killed.</span> <span id="s183">So we saw everybody what they were standing.</span> <span id="s184">I went out, I remember, very early in the morning and I saw the Germans pulling up with guns, with all kinds of things, they were holding like this, you know, everything, and they were pointing at the ghetto.</span> <span id="s185">My father was running out of the house and I didn't know what he said.</span> <span id="s186">“You wait here.</span> <span id="s187">Don't go anyplace.</span> <span id="s188">We have to be together now.”</span> <span id="s189">And they started burning.</span> <span id="s190">It wasn't just my father, it was lots of people.</span> <span id="s191">I really can't remember their names, but Lopatynwas one of these.</span> <span id="s192">His name should be forgotten really.</span> <span id="s193">I remember even how he looked, and then there was other people too.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">They burned everything.</span> <span id="s195">They started burning and there was smoke, and I saw there was a bridge not far from us and I saw friends of mine sitting with the feet holding like this, and they were taking them to a cemetery to shoot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">01:18:00 5 Dov Lopatyn (1900-1944), head of Lakhva Judenrat and former Zionist leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">And my father said like that “let's run.”</span> <span id="s198">Before we were running, I was near water.</span> <span id="s199">The water was death, they called the water death like “smierc” in Polish.</span> <span id="s200">And I saw the Germans.</span> <span id="s201">They were fighting with the Jews with knives and with ax and there as one man a Rev-Zionistthe same party as Begin, and he was holding an ax on a German over the head in the water, and the German killed him right away and they went to a doctor.</span> <span id="s202">And I saw this, and I was standing with my father and my brother and my sister with their hands like this.</span> <span id="s203">My father said, “Don't go away.</span> <span id="s204">We have to be with each other.</span> <span id="s205">Maybe we'll run away.”</span> <span id="s206">So, it was burning and here I saw something that I took so much revenge, I said to myself, “I'm going to die anyway in a few minutes.</span> <span id="s207">It's going to now.”</span> <span id="s208">You didn't think you're going to survive, you're going to live.</span> <span id="s209">Who's going to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Nobody thought they were going to live, but at least before I die I'm going to have revenge, and I saw that Rochczyn– a man, he was belonging to the party like Begin and he gave with the ax over the head.</span> <span id="s211">So, a man, a doctor was there.</span> <span id="s212">He was from Warsaw himself, he came like we came, in the wartime, running away from the Germans.</span> <span id="s213">So, they told him like that, “We're going to save all your family if you're going to save that German.”</span> <span id="s214">He says, “You could kill me too because I don't give a damn anymore because I'm not going save him – he could die.”</span> <span id="s215">But Rochczyn right away they shot him.</span> <span id="s216">He got killed in the water, but they were fighting with knives, with anything they had, they said, “We're not going to let ourselves just take to the death just like that.”</span> <span id="s217">They took only the weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: What did you do to get your revenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: What I did?</span> <span id="s220">I was running with my father.</span> <span id="s221">We were running away because we saw people running, we run too.</span> <span id="s222">It was open, the ghetto, they opened the doors there.</span> <span id="s223">We started running, and there was gardens there, beautiful gardens that people made when I took up, I was my mouth was so wet like I thought I was going to die right away, so I got a pickle there, I bent down and I got a pickle, and all the four of us together, and I took that pickle in my mouth and I was holding for ten kilometers were running.</span> <span id="s224">It was a place – Prypec, they called.</span> <span id="s225">Then I found my friend there with a bullet in it and the blood was going.</span> <span id="s226">Fanny Eisen.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Your friend from next door in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes, she's in New York now.</span> <span id="s229">I took off my shirt and I bandaged her.</span> <span id="s230">We didn't know what we were doing.</span> <span id="s231">We run again and we left her there, because there was lots of people there, lots of – we saw so many people there running away from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Was she with her family also?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">6 Union of Zionists Revisionists; militant political Zionists movement founded and led by Vladimir Jabotinsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">7 Itzak Rochczyn (1915-1942),Jewish resistance fighter.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: She was running away by herself, but you know we didn't even know what we were doing because we were like crazy people.</span> <span id="s236">My father, we were running right, one after the other.</span> <span id="s237">My father said “come” and my sister got winded when we were running, and I thought she was running after us because there were woods and trees, and I thought she was running after me, and I looked in the back and I didn't see my sister anymore.</span> <span id="s238">I saw my brother and my father.</span> <span id="s239">I said “Where is my sister?”</span> <span id="s240">So, she was there, so I said to the people that were running with us –, a whole bunch of people, many people – I said, “If you're not going to go after my sister, I'm going to scream so loud that all the Germans are going to come and kill us too, because I don't want to leave her, I'm not going to see my sister.”</span> <span id="s241">Everybody was running back because they were afraid that I'm going to scream, and I was a very tomboy.</span> <span id="s242">I used to bring food to the ghetto and I used to do such things that a child that age would never do, now especially.</span> <span id="s243">The kids, we had to be grown up before we grew up so we run back and we didn't find my sister anymore and I was crying for months.</span> <span id="s244">We run away, lying in the woods at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">01:23:00 It was the time of the Jewish holidays and it was cold at night and I didn't have nothing, a little dress, and I threw away my shoes so I had bare feet.</span> <span id="s246">Everybody had nothing to wear and it was cold and we couldn't make a fire at night because the Germans would come and see us.</span> <span id="s247">So, quite a few people were running away from there.</span> <span id="s248">We run, we run, we didn't know where we were running.</span> <span id="s249">We went into a White-Russian house to take a piece of bread because we didn't have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s250">I still had my pickle.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: You were living in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: In the woods.</span> <span id="s253">All these years, till the war is finished, we were living in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Can I go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s255">When the ghetto was formed, how long do you remember, not dates, but how long you were there until you burned the ghetto down and left?</span> <span id="s256">Do you have a sense, was it months?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Just a few months, not long.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Did you have pretty much what you needed?</span> <span id="s259">Was there enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: There was nothing, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s261">It was just a piece of bread we got like a small piece of bread a day.</span> <span id="s262">No, people were hungry.</span> <span id="s263">That's why I ran out of the ghetto to bring something but they didn't let me after.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Was it initially fairly easy for you to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Well, I was little, so I just went out.</span> <span id="s266">I took out, we had to wear a star in the front and the back and I took off the star and I went out.</span> <span id="s267">I thought, “If I'm going to do that they're going to kill me.”</span> <span id="s268">And I knew they would.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Was there school?</span> <span id="s270">Were there any activities?</span> <span id="s271">A: Nothing, no school nothing.</span> <span id="s272">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Were people getting sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yes, I had typhus.</span> <span id="s275">I got typhus and I told my father, “Papa you go because I'm not going to live anyway.</span> <span id="s276">So, at least you and my brother is going to be alive.”</span> <span id="s277">But he wouldn't leave me.</span> <span id="s278">But after, we got separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Let me just before we get to that, now your father was on the Jewish council in the ghetto, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Do you remember how that happened, what he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: They were just having meetings and I think the meetings were discreet that they were afraid to talk about it, what they talked.</span> <span id="s283">That's why they burned.</span> <span id="s284">When he said, when they went to burn the ghettos, they said, “Wait, don't go nowhere.”</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: How did your father get selected to be on the Jewish council?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: I think because he was very smart, because he had a mouth to talk.</span> <span id="s287">I think he could have even been a president, but not in Poland he didn't have a chance to be anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: How many people were on the council?</span> <span id="s289">Was it men and women?</span> <span id="s290">A: Men.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">01:26:00</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: How many?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: I can't remember now.</span> <span id="s294">It was lots.</span> <span id="s295">I think five, six, seven people.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Do you know if your dad had any special responsibilities or roles as a member of the council?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: I don't think anybody – any – too many responsibilities.</span> <span id="s298">They only had the responsibility – like everybody used to get a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s299">They brought in bread to the ghetto like a piece, a few ounces of bread they should give everybody you know like they used to come to bring the bread, to take the bread in the committee, like they had to give something like a few ounces of bread a day.</span> <span id="s300">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: So they were involved in distributing?</span> <span id="s302">A: Something like that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Was there a Jewish police group?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Yes, there was a Jewish police group, yes.</span> <span id="s305">They keep the ghetto, they keep the people that they shouldn't run out.</span> <span id="s306">They shouldn't do anything that they should get killed.</span> <span id="s307">They protected the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: So, the council and the police – A: Worked together.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: They worked together and they had to answer to the Germans but –</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: They answered to the Germans that they kept that their people shouldn't get killed.</span> <span id="s311">That time I think they didn't know that they're going to take all the Jews and kill them.</span> <span id="s312">They thought it was going to be a ghetto and soon the war is going to stop.</span> <span id="s313">It's not going to be forever.</span> <span id="s314">Nobody knew it was going to be so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Do you think they followed all of the German orders or –</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: They followed the orders.</span> <span id="s317">If they followed the orders they wouldn't burn the ghetto.</span> <span id="s318">They would have gone like sheep and died but I don't think anybody of these people – these people were different kind of people.</span> <span id="s319">They heard lots of things and they say, “No, nobody is going to kill us like a sheep, we're not sheep, we're people we are human beings and we're not going to go just like that.</span> <span id="s320">Nobody is going to kill us, nobody is going to kill us without a fight.</span> <span id="s321">We're going to die anyway but at least we're going to have a fight.</span> <span id="s322">We're going to do something about it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Were you aware of any political organizations, movements?</span> <span id="s324">A: No, I was too young to be aware of these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: So, did people have weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s327">Only they took ax and knives.</span> <span id="s328">They didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s329">They didn't have no ammunition at all.</span> <span id="s330">If they would have ammunition it would be different.</span> <span id="s331">I think half of the Germans would be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Is that why they decided to burn the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: They decided to burn the ghetto for one reason.</span> <span id="s334">That they shouldn't see like it was such a smoke that you wouldn't see where a German is – where a Jew is.</span> <span id="s335">The Germans they didn't see the people, that's why we were able to run.</span> <span id="s336">That's the only reason we were able to tear up, it was like the ghetto was closed with wires, and we were able to open these wires.</span> <span id="s337">The first person that opened these wires, died, but then the people started running because it was opened.</span> <span id="s338">It was like a wire like you could hurt yourself.</span> <span id="s339">It wasn't like electric, but you could hurt yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Do you know how long people had thought about doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: I don't know how long they talked, but I know the last few days when they said they're going to kill the Jews that they were talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: You don't know if it had been planned for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: No, I don't think it was planned for a while.</span> <span id="s344">They didn't know, when they knew they were going to kill the Jews, they knew a day before, but the Germans thought the Jews were going to go.</span> <span id="s345">They couldn't know when they're going to get killed because they're going to kill them anyway like everybody is going to go like a sheep.</span> <span id="s346">Every place they went like sheep, so they're going to go here like sheep, too.</span> <span id="s347">But the only thing they didn't think was here that these people are different kind of people.</span> <span id="s348">These people will not go like sheep.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">01:30:00 They won't let themselves get killed like that.</span> <span id="s350">They'll fight and they'll do everything they could to make them impossible to do something, to just take the people to the graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Why do you think that your community acted so differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I don’t – I think that there were many like a Rev-Zionist.</span> <span id="s353">They came from the party that was Begin's not like any other party.</span> <span id="s354">These people are very tough.</span> <span id="s355">These people wouldn't let themselves, like that Rochczyn.</span> <span id="s356">You know I still see him.</span> <span id="s357">He had glasses on.</span> <span id="s358">I see him how he looks.</span> <span id="s359">I'll never forget his face, that beautiful face that – he took an ax.</span> <span id="s360">He was taking an ax and giving the German over the head you can't imagine in that moment how as a child I felt that you don't just let yourself get killed, but you kill back.</span> <span id="s361">You do something about it.</span> <span id="s362">I felt that in a few minutes I'm going to fall down anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">01:32:00 They're going to shoot me, because they were shooting, but I didn't care if I'm going to die, because that time you don't care.</span> <span id="s364">You haven't got anything to think about that you're going to survive.</span> <span id="s365">Nobody does.</span> <span id="s366">You think well I'm going to die.</span> <span id="s367">At least I'm going to die knowing that a German got killed even if it's one or two or three that somebody – that they just didn't go like sheeps.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: So this was a real spiritual turning point for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: That was something that I felt so good inside even though I knew I'm not going to live.</span> <span id="s370">I didn't think that now I'm going to sit now and talk to somebody about it.</span> <span id="s371">That I'll be able to tell my story, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: When it was decided that you were going to burn the ghetto down, and – I don't know – who's idea this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: It was a few people, and I think it has a lot to do with these Zionist people, a lot.</span> <span id="s374">These people were tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So, there was a strong relationship between the Zionist movement and the council?</span> <span id="s376">A: Oh yes, definitely, for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: When it was decided to burn the ghetto down, did you know immediately what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: I think we knew.</span> <span id="s379">My father said, “Wait a minute, I need gasoline.”</span> <span id="s380">You know like naphtha – we didn't have electricity there like we had very little electricity, so they put the lamps with – just a little bit we had, but it was enough.</span> <span id="s381">The old ghetto was burned.</span> <span id="s382">There was nothing left of it.</span> <span id="s383">Nothing in one house, nothing, because I was there after the war.</span> <span id="s384">I came after the war there and there was nothing left at all.</span> <span id="s385">But you know, even after the war when we came I was proud to come there.</span> <span id="s386">I lived there over a year.</span> <span id="s387">They took away my father to the army.</span> <span id="s388">I met my father back when they took him away to the Russian army.</span> <span id="s389">I lived there for a year for sure and I gave him my brother to the orphanage because I didn't have any money and I went to the orphanage after the war.</span> <span id="s390">I took my brother and I went on the train and they told me “do you have a ticket?”</span> <span id="s391">I didn't have a piece a bread even to eat and I was very young.</span> <span id="s392">I said, “What kind of ticket.</span> <span id="s393">I went through a war, and I was sitting in the woods for so many years, do you think I have money to buy a ticket?</span> <span id="s394">You can kill me if you want, but I'm not going to give you nothing.</span> <span id="s395">I'm going to take my brother and go and if you want to take me off of that train, you'll have to kill me first.”</span> <span id="s396">So, they let me through.</span> <span id="s397">I took my brother to Pinsk after the war in an orphanage.</span> <span id="s398">I only wanted that they dress him up and I should be able to see him again from that orphanages, from the Russians and I'll bring him back home because he didn't have nothing to wear.</span> <span id="s399">He didn't have nothing to eat, so I brought him there.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: You were a brave little girl?</span> <span id="s401">A: I had to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Let me ask you a bit about what happened when you were in the woods.</span> <span id="s403">We started to talk about that earlier.</span> <span id="s404">You were there for years.</span> <span id="s405">Who else was out there?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: There were Russian people there.</span> <span id="s407">There were lots of partisans around us.</span> <span id="s408">I was living there.</span> <span id="s409">I couldn't find my father, but I found him after.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Let's go back to where you lost your sister, did you ever find her again?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: No, after the war I found out that they killed her.</span> <span id="s412">They found her and they killed her, the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: While you were running to the woods, okay.</span> <span id="s414">When you went to the woods, did you notice the local people on the way.</span> <span id="s415">Were they helpful?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Everyone helped one another, especially the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s417">Q: What about the farmers or whoever lived along there?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: The farmers, if they would see us, they would give us to the Germans.</span> <span id="s419">We couldn't let nobody see us.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: So the local people –?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: The place where we used to live, there were lots of partisans there, so you know the partisans did something.</span> <span id="s422">They took everybody from the house to the partisans, like every man that was let's say somebody had a son, somebody had a husband, so they couldn't go and squeal because they would squeal on their own.</span> <span id="s423">So, we were able to live around there to be hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: I'm a little confused.</span> <span id="s425">When you say the people where you used to live everybody was partisans, where are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: When we lived in the woods, they went into these little towns, like in the country houses, and they took – the partisans took from each family a member, two members – like if somebody had two sons – to the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: As hostages?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Not hostages, they should fight for the Russians.</span> <span id="s429">Q: They were all willing to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yes, they were willing to do that.</span> <span id="s431">Let's say the mother is not going to squeal, not going to go to the Germans and say “my son is a partisan.”</span> <span id="s432">So, we were around these people, hidden around these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: So, the Russian partisans were able to pull a lot of the local communities in?</span> <span id="s434">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s435">They took a lot of communities in.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Then they were loyal to you because their families were involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s438">They used to hide us.</span> <span id="s439">They used to keep us.</span> <span id="s440">They were afraid like I was by a Ukrainian woman and she used to think of me like her child.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">01:39:00</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: So when you said earlier the local people would have shot you, not all of the local people?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: No, not all, but these places where we were, these people wouldn't do it because of these men that they took away, they mobilized these people.</span> <span id="s444">They say, “you're going to come, you're going to fight for us.”</span> <span id="s445">The partisans were around all over.</span> <span id="s446">So, they couldn't do it, they wouldn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Were there many partisan groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Around us?</span> <span id="s449">We saw many, but they saved a lot of Jews too.</span> <span id="s450">Q: Did they all cooperate with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s452">They weren't bad people.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: So, there were many partisan groups that worked individually but supported each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes, in the woods.</span> <span id="s455">I think they saved so many Jewish people, so many people, like so many children.</span> <span id="s456">They did a lot of things for the Jews.</span> <span id="s457">They didn't care if you were a Jew or not.</span> <span id="s458">They didn't know the difference.</span> <span id="s459">They didn't know the difference even, what's a Jew and what's not a Jew.</span> <span id="s460">Like one child asked the father, “Am I a Jew too?”</span> <span id="s461">He was Jewish like he didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Were there a lot of other kids there?</span> <span id="s463">Were there men, were there women, what was the age range?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: There were lots of kids, lots.</span> <span id="s465">Q: Who took care of you all?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: We took care of ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Were there women who started trying to take care of you because your mother wasn't there?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: I met a Ukrainian women.</span> <span id="s469">She took care of me.</span> <span id="s470">Then when time passed by, like maybe two years I didn't see my father and my brother and we found him after.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">01:40:00</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: So, you all got separated?</span> <span id="s473">A: We got separated, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: How long were you in the woods before you got separated?</span> <span id="s475">A: Maybe seven months something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Were you still with your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: I met my friend after.</span> <span id="s478">Somebody told me my friend is living not far from me and I went over.</span> <span id="s479">I walked with somebody, a man that he was a journalist before the war but he was in the partisans and I asked him, “please, could you take me?”</span> <span id="s480">He was a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s481">I said, “Could you take me to see, I think I heard that my friend is living in that place, so and so” – I don't remember the name of the place, but it wasn't far.</span> <span id="s482">We had to walk maybe an hour, hour and half.</span> <span id="s483">He said, “sure, come with me.”</span> <span id="s484">I went there and the father was sitting there and he said “I'm going to take Feigele (ph).</span> <span id="s485">I found out she's alive and I'm going to bring her – she's with people.</span> <span id="s486">She's by people.”</span> <span id="s487">So, I said, “could I come with you?’</span> <span id="s488">He says “sure.”</span> <span id="s489">When I came over there she was full of lice, you know, and you know what we did, we took ashes.</span> <span id="s490">We didn't have any soap, and we take the ashes and we put in a piece of cloth by Christian people, like Russian people and we put some cloth and we had warm water, you didn't have water.</span> <span id="s491">You had to bring water from outside.</span> <span id="s492">We didn't have water in the house.</span> <span id="s493">We made her we put her in something to make her a box and took her out from these and then we went back with her and I took her out and I had lice all over my hands.</span> <span id="s494">We washed her once and another time with water and then the woman gave us something to dry her.</span> <span id="s495">These people didn't have anything to dry her and she got dressed up with something that she had.</span> <span id="s496">She didn't have nothing to wear.</span> <span id="s497">Then her father took her back and we were sleeping at night and she dreamed her grandmother said that Germans were running after us and they were going to kill us, and I had a dream too and I woke up and I was screaming.</span> <span id="s498">I says, “You know they're going to kill us again.”</span> <span id="s499">The whole nights, all these years I have dreams.</span> <span id="s500">I always wake up with dreams that they they're going to kill my family.</span> <span id="s501">I have three children now, that they're going to kill my children and I'm going to be alone again.</span> <span id="s502">I'm going to have nobody.</span> <span id="s503">So, that time, we both fell asleep and we dreamed that we're running and we're running and they're going to kill us.</span> <span id="s504">Somebody's going to kill us.</span> <span id="s505">They're running after us.</span> <span id="s506">She said, “I have such a dream that they're going to kill us again,” and I said, “yes, I have the same dream.”</span> <span id="s507">We woke up in a sweat.</span> <span id="s508">I stayed with her for a few days and I went back where I was, where that Ukrainian woman, she took care of me very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Do you think when you look back on this that life was different for girls and for women than it was for the men and the boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">01:45:00</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s512">A woman wasn't – I think by the Russians a woman was more than it was by the Poles or someplace else.</span> <span id="s513">But I think that it was a difference, like they thought a woman can do nothing, men could do more.</span> <span id="s514">Even no matter how aggressive you were and how much you were able to do so a woman is not much, she can do as much as a man.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: You were a tough kid.</span> <span id="s516">Did you feel that your responsibilities were the same as the boys your age or that you were treated differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: I didn't think at that time how I was treated.</span> <span id="s518">I just felt “I'm going to survive and I'm going to look where my father is.”</span> <span id="s519">I didn't think about anything.</span> <span id="s520">I didn't think how they're going to treat me how they treat me.</span> <span id="s521">I knew I had to survive and I'm going to do everything possible to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: When you were with the partisans did everybody have certain responsibilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: We had the responsibility to help in the garden.</span> <span id="s524">Like I was with the Ukrainian woman, we went – I wanted to milk the cows, I learned how to milk.</span> <span id="s525">I went to the fields with the potatoes.</span> <span id="s526">It wasn't like now they have tractors.</span> <span id="s527">I worked.</span> <span id="s528">I helped them.</span> <span id="s529">I loved to do it.</span> <span id="s530">I loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Were the boys working in the fields also?</span> <span id="s532">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: So everyone worked together?</span> <span id="s536">A: Together, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">01:47:00</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Do you know if when they made certain decisions whether the women were included in making decisions or whether it was much the way –?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: I think the men only, not the women.</span> <span id="s540">They told the women what to do.</span> <span id="s541">I don't think the women made any decisions all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Women filled a very traditional role?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s544">Even the Russians, they thought “A Jew can't even fight.</span> <span id="s545">He doesn't even know how to fight.</span> <span id="s546">How a Jew could fight.”</span> <span id="s547">But, the Jews – they gave them guns and they were fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: So, even in the partisan groups, they were very good to the Jews but they wanted to make their own decisions and they didn't include the Jews in these?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: No, they took the Jews to fight also, but they didn't – I don't think they thought a Jew could fight as much as a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s550">I don't believe that they thought that.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: So, from the way that these groups were organized, was most of the decision making done by the Soviets?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Yes, the Soviets, but I don't think they made a difference between a Jew and a non-Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">The only thing they thought was that the people by themselves, not in the more like somebody was a lieutenant, or they run away from the army or something, they run away from the Germans, I don't think they thought about the Jew being different.</span> <span id="s554">I don't believe feeling even then by Ukrainian women that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s555">She didn't think of me as a Jew.</span> <span id="s556">She thought of me as a little girl that's run away from a ghetto and she wants to survive and she wants to help me.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">01:49:00</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: I understand that, what I'm trying to figure out is initially when you joined these people, was there a structure in place where the non-Jews were making the decisions and they were basically hiding you and you were helping them but it was their movement, or was everybody –</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No, I think the men made the decision mostly, the Soviet men.</span> <span id="s560">Q: The Soviet men, or Soviet and Jewish men?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: I think there were a lot of Jewish men that they made decisions too.</span> <span id="s562">They were lieutenants or like big shots.</span> <span id="s563">They made decisions too.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Now, let me ask you a slightly different question.</span> <span id="s565">Were you – did you come from a religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: No, not a religious but non not religious either.</span> <span id="s567">We ate kosher in the house – like even now, I'm not going to eat pork.</span> <span id="s568">I can't even if I want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: So when you were in the woods, and you were in the woods for several years?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: We had to eat whatever they had, but I never ate pork.</span> <span id="s571">If I knew in the woods that's Yom Kippur – one time a friend, he is now in Montreal but he went to Toronto to live – he passed by.</span> <span id="s572">When he told, “today is Yom Kippur,” he passed by like he didn't have nothing to wear and I saw him and I didn't even believe he's alive.</span> <span id="s573">And he passed by and he said to me, “today is Yom Kippur.”</span> <span id="s574">I didn't eat.</span> <span id="s575">I didn't want to eat anything even though we didn't have much to eat, we were hungry most of the time.</span> <span id="s576">We were in the water and that Ukrainian woman said to me that the Germans were on the top.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">01:51:00 They were shooting.</span> <span id="s578">They surrounded us, the Germans, and we were lying in the water very deep like in the time that was in the woods already, and we're lying.</span> <span id="s579">She said to me, “Make with your feet like this because otherwise the feet will fall off.</span> <span id="s580">They came off,” she said, “make with your feet, just work with them, just like exercise with them, do something, because otherwise you're going to lose your feet.”</span> <span id="s581">Up there they were shooting us with airplanes and around they were shouting, the Germans were running.</span> <span id="s582">In the middle of that the partisans came and they started fighting with the Germans.</span> <span id="s583">You know they were going like, how could I say it in English – even if I’m so many years, since I was 18 years old in Canada – na shtykithey were going with big knives like this one on one.</span> <span id="s584">They didn't care.</span> <span id="s585">They said, “we're going to get killed, we're going to get killed,” and we were lying in the water and all of sudden from nowhere they came and they saved probably our lives at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Were there other holidays that you were aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: No.</span> <span id="s588">I didn't even know which day it was.</span> <span id="s589">We didn't have calendars, we didn't have nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So religion wasn't that important to you while you were hiding out?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: It wasn't not important, I wasn't aware of anything.</span> <span id="s592">You don't think about anything.</span> <span id="s593">You only think that you have to survive and if you had a piece of bread or if you have something – you know what I was praying.</span> <span id="s594">I was sitting down and I was praying, “If I'm 8 with bayonets (Russian) going to be able to live, and if I'm going to survive, am I going to have bread on the table as much as I want to eat.</span> <span id="s595">I should be able to eat enough.</span> <span id="s596">Is that going to happen?</span> <span id="s597">I want to be warm.</span> <span id="s598">I don't want to be cold anymore.</span> <span id="s599">I should be able to just be in a warm, lie down in a warm oven.”</span> <span id="s600">Because they had ovens that they were baking and cooking there you know, “and I should like down there just to feel the warmth and just have bread.</span> <span id="s601">Am I ever going to have that?</span> <span id="s602">Is it ever going to happen to me?”</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: You had no idea?</span> <span id="s604">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s606">02:01:00</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: I want to hear a little bit more about what your life was like when you were in the woods because now we think you were probably in the woods for three years, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: A few years, yes.</span> <span id="s609">About two years I think I ran away in '42, from '42 to '45.</span> <span id="s610">It was quite a few years, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Was there a typical day?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I think every day we were scared.</span> <span id="s613">Every day we were running someplace out.</span> <span id="s614">Everyday we were struggling to have something to eat because it was very bad with food.</span> <span id="s615">I was like a toothpick, you know.</span> <span id="s616">It was such hard times that it's very hard to describe times like that.</span> <span id="s617">We were from one place to another.</span> <span id="s618">Even that one I was running, if not that I knew that the partisans were around I wouldn't have survived, never.</span> <span id="s619">Sometimes they used to give us to eat, they used to give us to eat – but most of the time we sometimes we used to steal a piece of bread because we didn't have any, that woman even.</span> <span id="s620">Many times we went to her house when we knew the partisans were around, in the winter, in the house.</span> <span id="s621">We went to her garden.</span> <span id="s622">She was to me like a mother, couldn't be better.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: When you were out picking vegetables or potatoes, whose garden was it?</span> <span id="s624">A: Sometimes their gardens.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Gardens?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Sometimes we used to make a fire, a small fire in the daytime.</span> <span id="s627">At night we were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">We used to take and bake them inside, with the ashes and bake them and eat them.</span> <span id="s629">Sometimes we used to eat raw, especially at night we were afraid to make a fire so we were freezing.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Were these anybody's gardens?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Everybody's.</span> <span id="s632">We used to pass by.</span> <span id="s633">Sometimes we used to steal a chicken, burn the feathers and make it.</span> <span id="s634">I can't even describe how the used to make it.</span> <span id="s635">That woman used to make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: You were on the move all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s638">Moved from one place.</span> <span id="s639">Not even three days in one place, sometimes we used to stay a few days in one place, make ourselves go and bring something.</span> <span id="s640">We would bring some bread from the partisans and bring some potatoes and bring something we ate, and we stayed a few days and then we heard the Germans are coming and we run again.</span> <span id="s641">We run from one place to another.</span> <span id="s642">We never were in one place.</span> <span id="s643">We didn't stay too long in one place.</span> <span id="s644">We couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Did you stay with one group of partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: No, we didn't stay with a group of partisans.</span> <span id="s647">We stayed with lots of people.</span> <span id="s648">We went from one group to another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: But they all treated you nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: They treated me nice.</span> <span id="s651">They treated us good.</span> <span id="s652">Q: How many were in your group running?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: The only time I thought, “If I'm going to get killed there, it's not going to be as a Jew, it's going to be as a human being, as a person.”</span> <span id="s654">I was with these people, and I met the partisans in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Did that make you feel any better?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Yes, even if you get killed, at least you're not going to get killed because you're a Jew.</span> <span id="s657">For what?</span> <span id="s658">Because you're Jewish.</span> <span id="s659">Because you happen to be born a Jew.</span> <span id="s660">The only time that I can think of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">02:05:30</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: It made a lot more sense to you?</span> <span id="s663">A: It made a lot more sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Were you in constant fear?</span> <span id="s665">A: Yes, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Now, when you were running because you said you were moving quite a bit, how many people would normally be traveling with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: There were lots of Jewish kids that ran away without their parents.</span> <span id="s668">They didn't have their parents.</span> <span id="s669">They didn't have their mothers, they didn't have the fathers.</span> <span id="s670">There were lots.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">There were about 20 people.</span> <span id="s672">Sometimes more, sometimes we met other people on the way.</span> <span id="s673">Everybody was in different groups, we met different kinds of groups of people in the woods living there like gypsies.</span> <span id="s674">The gypsies were living there.</span> <span id="s675">They taught me how to draw cards, how to – even though I never believed in it, because the gypsies were running from the Germans too.</span> <span id="s676">They were living in the woods.</span> <span id="s677">And they were very nice, very, very nice people, but they were liars.</span> <span id="s678">You could never believe anything, but they were living in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">02:07:00 Lots of times we were with gypsies.</span> <span id="s680">Sometimes for weeks.</span> <span id="s681">We used to make a tent, like a tent from wood and we used to sleep there.</span> <span id="s682">Like if you make from wood something you know like even if an airplane passes by they don't see it because it's only wood.</span> <span id="s683">So, we made like that.</span> <span id="s684">These people that were together that we met, every time we met somebody else we were never together with the same people.</span> <span id="s685">We always go that you're going to be here, I'm going to go someplace else because you are afraid you're going to stay in one place they're going to get to know that somebody is going to tell on you.</span> <span id="s686">But when I met my father it was different.</span> <span id="s687">At that time was like even before the liberation.</span> <span id="s688">I thought I was liberated already–</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: I want to get to that, but let me ask you a few more questions about your life in the woods.</span> <span id="s690">There were some people who were always with you for long periods of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yes, children mostly that run away from the home.</span> <span id="s692">Lots of kids after the war – I have one friend in Israel that she survived.</span> <span id="s693">She was there and another one was in New York, but she's in Israel too.</span> <span id="s694">She and her brother and her father were there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Were these kids about your own age?</span> <span id="s696">Were there many adults taking care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: About my own age, yes.</span> <span id="s698">Sometimes without adults, they were by themselves.</span> <span id="s699">They went to the partisans to get some bread, to get something to eat.</span> <span id="s700">They used to give us to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">They used to go to the partisans and they used to ask, because they weren't far away and we knew it, otherwise we wouldn't be able to survive.</span> <span id="s702">So, the only place we were able to get to eat, because if you went into a house, to have something to eat and you still some people used to tell they are going to tell on us.</span> <span id="s703">Even these people that they weren’t – they didn't take these in the, in the partisans.</span> <span id="s704">You know, like depends on the district you were.</span> <span id="s705">Many district it took these people to the partisans.</span> <span id="s706">You know, like their sons and their – yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So you all stuck together, the kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Yes, but we weren't together at the same time, all the time.</span> <span id="s709">We went away and then we met again.</span> <span id="s710">We were going because we were afraid.</span> <span id="s711">I was especially afraid to stay in one place.</span> <span id="s712">I was mostly with that woman, that Ukrainian woman.</span> <span id="s713">Wherever she went I was going with her.</span> <span id="s714">She was afraid.</span> <span id="s715">Her sons were in the partisans and if they would catch her they would kill her.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Did you get involved in any fighting?</span> <span id="s717">I know the Germans were trying to clear that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: No.</span> <span id="s719">I was too young for these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: But you were very aware of fighting all around you?</span> <span id="s721">A: Of course, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Like we passed by and we saw a church burning.</span> <span id="s724">The people, they put wood, they put nails with wood around and we passed by and we heard from fire – people are screaming from a big fire, and we couldn't even go near there.</span> <span id="s725">The Germans, they put nails in wood and they closed it up around and they burned these people, a full church of people.</span> <span id="s726">It wasn't a church, it was like a house because they didn't believe in churches.</span> <span id="s727">They didn't believe in God, the Russians.</span> <span id="s728">It used to be a church but then it was something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">02:11:30 I don't know what.</span> <span id="s730">They passed by near there, not far.</span> <span id="s731">We were in the woods and there was a like one place in the middle of nowhere and they were burning.</span> <span id="s732">We heard them screaming.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Do you have any other really outstanding memories of dodging the gunfire or trying to keep safe from the fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Keep safe from the fighting, I don't know.</span> <span id="s735">So many memories I have but I don't know where to start.</span> <span id="s736">We were always running from something.</span> <span id="s737">We were always running from fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: How did all of this end, and how did you find your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: I was running in the woods, that was before liberation, maybe a few months.</span> <span id="s740">They were running, all of a sudden we come to a place, I see my father and my brother.</span> <span id="s741">My father was there working and you know he was repairing shoes for the partisans and that way he was survived and they were sending him to fight.</span> <span id="s742">He was fighting, with guns, they were going to little towns where the Germans were and they were fighting.</span> <span id="s743">That's why they were able to keep my brother in the partisans with my father.</span> <span id="s744">They were there.</span> <span id="s745">When I met him, everything changed.</span> <span id="s746">After that, liberation was maybe a few months after, was the liberation and I met my father.</span> <span id="s747">He survived with the partisans, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: So when you saw your father and your brother – 02:13:00</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: You can't imagine.</span> <span id="s750">I thought they died already, because when we run away from the house and I got typhus and I told my father, “Papa leave me because I'm not going to live, you see I'm so sick.”</span> <span id="s751">So, my father says, “if I'm going to leave you what is my life going to be all about?</span> <span id="s752">I'm not going to be able to live.”</span> <span id="s753">All of sudden we were separated.</span> <span id="s754">I don't even know how.</span> <span id="s755">I can't even explain to you how because when you run, everybody runs.</span> <span id="s756">You run and all of a sudden there's trees and woods and you don't see each other.</span> <span id="s757">You don't see where you go.</span> <span id="s758">You get separated.</span> <span id="s759">I was going with people.</span> <span id="s760">I was running.</span> <span id="s761">When you're running you don't look where you're going.</span> <span id="s762">I thought my father was after me, just like I thought my sister is behind me when I couldn't find her anymore.</span> <span id="s763">My sister, she died.</span> <span id="s764">They killed her after.</span> <span id="s765">And she said she would have been my sister was running with me, she said "Zina, look the blood on my face.”</span> <span id="s766">That was only an ear that was wounded and then I run back and I never found her and I thought this happened to my father, the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: So when you saw your father and brother, it must have been like a miracle?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: It was a miracle.</span> <span id="s769">It was such an emotion, I thought to myself, “My God, I'm not alone in this world.</span> <span id="s770">I have my father.</span> <span id="s771">I have my brother.”</span> <span id="s772">You know I didn't see him after the war.</span> <span id="s773">I got married I was about 15-1/2 years old and I went to Canada and my father went to Israel.</span> <span id="s774">I saw him after 22 years, I didn't see my father and I came to see my father.</span> <span id="s775">I think he died from a broken heart.</span> <span id="s776">A year later I saw him for the first time.</span> <span id="s777">I wasn't able to afford, because my husband didn't make a lot of money.</span> <span id="s778">I married a man who was 16 years older than me.</span> <span id="s779">I didn't have such a great life, a very, very hard life.</span> <span id="s780">I went to Israel after 22 years being in Canada, I went to Israel to see my father and a year later he dies from a stroke because I think he lost a wife and three children and he loved my mother very much.</span> <span id="s781">He died from a broken heart.</span> <span id="s782">That's the only thing I could say, so you could imagine that after the war, after I met my father how it was such an emotion to me.</span> <span id="s783">I thought to myself, “I'm alone in the whole world and here I have somebody.</span> <span id="s784">I have a brother, I have my father.”</span> <span id="s785">That was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s786">I can't even say what happened to me at that time.</span> <span id="s787">I felt I'm just like somebody else, too.</span> <span id="s788">A lot of kids run away.</span> <span id="s789">They had their father, they had a sister or a brother.</span> <span id="s790">Some were alone.</span> <span id="s791">They didn't have nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: What happened to this Ukrainian woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s794">After I met my father, I left her in a very nice way.</span> <span id="s795">We were going away in another side my father was.</span> <span id="s796">I stayed with my father already.</span> <span id="s797">We said goodbye to each other crying and I never saw her again.</span> <span id="s798">I don't know what's happened to her, but I'm sure she survived.</span> <span id="s799">I know she had two sons in the Partisans and one died.</span> <span id="s800">One got killed.</span> <span id="s801">I remember their names and I remember how they looked even.</span> <span id="s802">She was really special.</span> <span id="s803">I don't know if not for her I would be able to survive.</span> <span id="s804">I wouldn't be able to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">02:17:30</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: What happened after you reunited with your father and brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: After I was with them, I didn't leave them for a moment.</span> <span id="s808">I was afraid that if I'm going to leave them that they're going to disappear and something is going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s809">So, even when we're sleeping – we're sleeping one here and on the floor, in the woods, I was afraid I'm going to lose them.</span> <span id="s810">I'm not going to be able to find them anymore, so I was afraid to leave for a second.</span> <span id="s811">Wherever they were I think I was near.</span> <span id="s812">I was afraid to leave them.</span> <span id="s813">You know, I was very scared.</span> <span id="s814">I was a very scared child.</span> <span id="s815">You know that even after the war, and the war finished, we were in a camp with my husband, because I married young in Germany in Hess-Lichtenauand I went one time out and I saw a movie.</span> <span id="s816">It was my life exactly what I went through in the ghetto, in the woods, with everything.</span> <span id="s817">I fainted.</span> <span id="s818">I fell down on the floor and I fainted and you know for two years I was dizzy.</span> <span id="s819">I came to Canada and I was afraid to leave a door closed, because my door was closed I'd leave it open.</span> <span id="s820">I thought I was going to faint.</span> <span id="s821">I was afraid to be alone in the house.</span> <span id="s822">My door was open like anybody could have gone in, if it would be the violence like now, and kill me.</span> <span id="s823">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s824">I came to Canada with a little baby.</span> <span id="s825">I was about 18 years old and I came to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">02:19:30</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: I'm going to get to that but let me just go back.</span> <span id="s828">So, when you were with your father and brother, you stayed close to them and you were still out in the wood fighting for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yes, a little while.</span> <span id="s830">The liberation was maybe two weeks after, that's all, so we still had very bad time that time, like we were in the water again, for the second time we were leaving in the water.</span> <span id="s831">Under the water, the Germans were around on the airplanes on the top and they were shooting, and we were lying down in the water again, you know like I would have froze up my feet, my arms.</span> <span id="s832">Also, my father was talking like that woman.</span> <span id="s833">He said, “Do something, do something with your feet.</span> <span id="s834">Do something with your arms because they're going to fall off.”</span> <span id="s835">About three days later, the liberation was after that, but that time I thought for sure now we're going to die because the airplanes were like this, over our heads and the Germans were all around.</span> <span id="s836">That time my father was involved with the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: You were hiding in the river?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: In the water, it wasn't a river.</span> <span id="s839">It wasn't a river, it was like –it wasn't quick sand, but it looked like quick sand.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Like a swamp?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Like a swamp, yes.</span> <span id="s842">It is very hard to describe that even.</span> <span id="s843">It's impossible, because nobody could understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">9 Hessisch-Lichtenau</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: That you would be hiding in swamps?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Dirty, filthy, no food, nothing to eat for days.</span> <span id="s847">For days we didn't have a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s848">That was after I met my father already, but at least I knew we were together and if we're going to die, it's going to be all of us.</span> <span id="s849">At least we're going to be in one place.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Can you describe liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yes, I could describe liberation because I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s852">They started screaming that, “you're liberated, you're liberated, we are liberated,” you know, “the Russians are here, we are liberated,” you know.</span> <span id="s853">I was screaming, I was yelling, I was jumping, you know, and I was holding my father and my brother like this, like all around and I said “My God, we are liberated.</span> <span id="s854">Can you believe that?”</span> <span id="s855">My father at that time was maybe 40 years old, 42 or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: You saw the Russian troops coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yes, the Russians, they came with their music playing.</span> <span id="s858">The Russians always – even when we were in the woods we would hear the Russians.</span> <span id="s859">They would always say, “sing and dance because you never know tomorrow what's going to be.”</span> <span id="s860">They are not afraid of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">02:23:00 They're not afraid of nothing, and I told a woman that I wanted to run.</span> <span id="s862">She said, “What are you afraid of something?</span> <span id="s863">So, if you're going to die, you die one time.</span> <span id="s864">You don't die twice.”</span> <span id="s865">I said, “You know I'm afraid to be in one place all the time.”</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: You're used to running?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: I'm used to running, that's right, run.</span> <span id="s868">I think I was tough – I don't think I'd be able to go through the same thing now.</span> <span id="s869">In the mind and I'm thinking now I wouldn't be able to survive, I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Well, you did what you had to do?</span> <span id="s871">A: I was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Did the Russians treat you well upon liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yes, very well, but after they took away my father into the army right away and left me and my brother alone.</span> <span id="s874">Like I told you before, they took him to the orphanage, without anything.</span> <span id="s875">Without any bread without anything.</span> <span id="s876">I didn't have nothing to eat after the war,</span></p> <p><span id="s877">nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: How long were you with your father and brother after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: After liberation, maybe a few weeks.</span> <span id="s880">With my brother I was with him all the time, but I gave him to the orphanage because I wanted him to go to school.</span> <span id="s881">I wanted him to have something.</span> <span id="s882">And I went myself too to school after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Lakhva.</span> <span id="s885">I came to Lakhva.</span> <span id="s886">Q: Where were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: I came to the Russian side.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: I’m sorry – where were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: I was liberated near Mazyr.</span> <span id="s890">It's a town near Russia there because we were running.</span> <span id="s891">We run away so far that we didn't know where we were running.</span> <span id="s892">So, we’re liberated around there.</span> <span id="s893">Right away we came to that place.</span> <span id="s894">It's a big city and they took away my father to the army, and they took my brother and I went to Lakhva to the place – because I knew lots of Jews are there.</span> <span id="s895">When I came, I met lots of my friends, lots of people that I was in the woods together who were living in the same house.</span> <span id="s896">You see the house the Germans took away and then the Russian people moved in.</span> <span id="s897">So, they were Jewish houses, so we moved into the houses.</span> <span id="s898">They all lived there.</span> <span id="s899">Then I stared – when I was living there I thought to myself, “What am I going to do with my brother?</span> <span id="s900">He hasn't got a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s901">He's got bare feet, with nothing on his feet.</span> <span id="s902">What am I going to do with him?</span> <span id="s903">How is he going to go to school?”</span> <span id="s904">At that time four years younger than me.</span> <span id="s905">I was about 14 years old, so he was about ten, so “what am I going to do with him?”</span> <span id="s906">I have to dress him up at least so I said to my brother, “you know what” – in Pinsk there was a big city, there is an orphanage there and somebody gave me the address.</span> <span id="s907">I said, “you know we'll go together.</span> <span id="s908">We'll go on the train.”</span> <span id="s909">He said to me, “How are you going to go on the train?”</span> <span id="s910">I said “You don't worry how I'm going to go.</span> <span id="s911">I'm going to go, don't worry.”</span> <span id="s912">So I told you when I went on the train, “you could kill me because I don't have a ticket.”</span> <span id="s913">So I went and got him into the orphanage.</span> <span id="s914">Then my father wrote me that he's coming back from the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Then, you know what I did?</span> <span id="s916">I went and I stealed him from the orphanage.</span> <span id="s917">I told him I'm going for a walk with him.</span> <span id="s918">When I took him out and we went back on the train the same thing – I didn't have any money so I went without money like that.</span> <span id="s919">So, I was standing at that time, when they came to control the tickets, you know, the middle [indecipherable] there is a platform.</span> <span id="s920">I went to the platform with him and I stood there.</span> <span id="s921">When the ticket control passed by I went back to the train and that's the way I came back from Lakhva from Pinsk.</span> <span id="s922">It didn't take long.</span> <span id="s923">It took maybe an hour.</span> <span id="s924">But there an hour.</span> <span id="s925">And I brought him back, and we went to my father to Lodz, to Poland.</span> <span id="s926">Then I met my husband there.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: You met your first husband there?</span> <span id="s928">A: My first husband, in Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: How long were you in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Not long.</span> <span id="s931">I was in Lodz and then my husband says he wants to go to the German side, to Germany because from Germany we could go to Canada or Israel.</span> <span id="s932">We didn't think to go to Canada, but one time when I had my baby and we were standing for milk in a place and they said, “You register for Canada but you're not going to be able to go,” they told my husband, “because you have a little baby and that baby's a few months old.”</span> <span id="s933">And he said, “Let me register and maybe we'll see,” because he was a tailor and they needed tailors.</span> <span id="s934">Then they called us to the UNRRAWe came to Canada in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">02:28:30</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Where did you leave your father and your brother?</span> <span id="s937">Where did you leave them behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: In Lodz.</span> <span id="s939">My father went before to Germany.</span> <span id="s940">He left us behind when I got married because my father didn't want me to get married.</span> <span id="s941">My father said to me, “you're too young” and he said to me “you could be a lawyer.”</span> <span id="s942">I said, “a woman a lawyer?”</span> <span id="s943">He said, “What's wrong with women?”</span> <span id="s944">You see my father was modern, even in these years.</span> <span id="s945">My father thought, “What's wrong with women?</span> <span id="s946">You're more smart than any man I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Why can't you be a lawyer.”</span> <span id="s948">He wanted me to go because I was very good in school.</span> <span id="s949">I went to school and I used to make two grades in one year.</span> <span id="s950">So, he told me I have to go to school to study and make something of myself.</span> <span id="s951">What I'm going to make I want it to be advocate.</span> <span id="s952">He said, “woman, a girl,” he said “what's wrong with girls?</span> <span id="s953">There's nothing with girls.</span> <span id="s954">A girl could be a lawyer, too.</span> <span id="s955">They more smart than men are, some women.”</span> <span id="s956">So, I didn't listen to him and I said, “Papa I'm going to go away if you're not going to let me get married.”</span> <span id="s957">I fell in love with my husband.</span> <span id="s958">He was in a Polish uniform.</span> <span id="s959">It was after the army, and he was 16 years older than me, but I didn't know it at that time.</span> <span id="s960">If I knew I would get scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: He was in the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: After the war, he was in the Russian army and then he went into the Polish army.</span> <span id="s963">Q: He was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">10 United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: So, you left your father and brother in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: No, my father went to Germany before.</span> <span id="s968">My father went to Germany and he said that, “You're going to come after.”</span> <span id="s969">So, we went after.</span> <span id="s970">We didn't come to the same place.</span> <span id="s971">My father was in Ulm, and I was in Hess-Lichtenau, near Kassel.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: But you traveled from Lakhva to Lodz with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: No.</span> <span id="s974">I traveled – yes, from Lakhva to Lodz with my father and brother, yes.</span> <span id="s975">Then when we met we didn't separate anymore but then I separated when I got married and my father went before me to Germany and then we came to our organization, through a Zionist organization we came to Germany.</span> <span id="s976">He was like in the army, the Zionist organization from the army we came to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Were you living freely all this time or did you ever live in a camp?</span> <span id="s978">A: In a camp, I was in an UNRRA camp in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">02:31:45</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: For how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: How long?</span> <span id="s982">Until I came to Canada.</span> <span id="s983">We came to Germany in 1947.</span> <span id="s984">We came to Canada in '48 so it was about a year and a half I think.</span> <span id="s985">I had my baby in '47, my son is born in 1947 in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Until that you were living freely, until you got to Germany?</span> <span id="s987">A: In the camp, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: But in Poland you were not in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: No, we were in a house living there.</span> <span id="s990">Also Jewish houses that the Jewish people used to live.</span> <span id="s991">I remember the address.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: After the war, your new husband was part of the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: They took him I don't know how it happened but they took him to the Polish army.</span> <span id="s994">He was in the Russian army and then they took him to the Polish army.</span> <span id="s995">I don't know how, because he was Russian at the time from the war.</span> <span id="s996">So, they took him in Russia to the army and then they took him to the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Was it at all difficult getting over to Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: It was difficult, yes.</span> <span id="s999">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1000">We thought because with a baby we wouldn't be able to – they wouldn't let us come.</span> <span id="s1001">My baby was very sick and we came to a place before, I forgot the name of the place in Germany before we came to Canada.</span> <span id="s1002">We were living all people together in one place.</span> <span id="s1003">The people that were supposed to go to Canada, and my son got sick and his stomach was loose all the time, all the time.</span> <span id="s1004">One time I dreamt my husband's father, which I never knew in my life, when I described to my husband he told me that he looked like that, and I dreamed that he gave me a jar of fish and he told me, “Give that to your child a little bit.</span> <span id="s1005">Then you're going to talk about me, so long live my child,” because his name is after him, Jack, you know his name is Jack, Jankel in Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">02:34:00 All of a sudden on the day after a doctor an American doctor came in.</span> <span id="s1007">I couldn't speak English at all.</span> <span id="s1008">So, I showed him that the diapers that he goes every minute, so he gave him medication and that doctor helped him.</span> <span id="s1009">I thought the child was going to die, because he was screaming nights.</span> <span id="s1010">Everybody was mad at me because the child was screaming, and I was so young at that time.</span> <span id="s1011">So, he gave him a medication.</span> <span id="s1012">After that dream, all of sudden the child got well and we came to Canada after that.</span> <span id="s1013">We came to Canada in 1948, November the 16.</span> <span id="s1014">I don't remember the liberation day, but I remember when I came to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Was the adjustment in Canada at all difficult for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1017">It was difficult because we didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s1018">We came and didn't even have a dollar in my pocket.</span> <span id="s1019">I didn't know how it looked, a dollar.</span> <span id="s1020">My father had family in the United States, in Troy, New York, so they sent us the first 50 dollars.</span> <span id="s1021">I didn't even know how American money looked like.</span> <span id="s1022">I didn't know what to do with that 50 dollars.</span> <span id="s1023">Then my husband couldn't find a job, and when he found a job they paid him 35 dollars, and 35 dollars – 39 dollars a week and I had a room and I had to pay 35 dollars a month for the room.</span> <span id="s1024">Then we got – my aunt came and they gave us 700 dollars so I paid key money, 700 dollars to move into an apartment in Montreal just for a broken stove and not a refrigerator, an icebox, and a little table and chairs, I paid 700 dollars key money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">We could have bought a house at that time.</span> <span id="s1026">The money that she gave me, I was happy to move into a house because we lived in a room, don't stay here and don't make electricity and you're burning too much that.</span> <span id="s1027">Then she made me wash the walls – her walls, like I didn't understand.</span> <span id="s1028">I thought that was the way it had to be.</span> <span id="s1029">No matter how tough I was when I had to be, I was very different then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">02:37:00 I let myself be used by a woman.</span> <span id="s1031">They couldn't understand.</span> <span id="s1032">What do I have to do for them.</span> <span id="s1033">Let them do a little bit for me.</span> <span id="s1034">We were very much used by these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: So, when you got to Canada people took advantage of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: A lot of advantage.</span> <span id="s1037">They took for a stove, for Jewish people, a broken stove with a little table, 700 dollars from us and we didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s1038">We came with nothing.</span> <span id="s1039">Absolutely with nothing and we struggled.</span> <span id="s1040">All our lives, it was very hard.</span> <span id="s1041">He wasn't a business man, he was a tailor and he worked very hard for his money and it was a hard life.</span> <span id="s1042">We had a very hard life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: It must have gotten easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: I think now it's easier a little bit, but we're getting older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Perhaps you felt that after everything you had been through, at least you were safe?</span> <span id="s1046">A: Yes, we live in a free country, and I don't think that born American people or born Canadian people they know what it means freedom.</span> <span id="s1047">Freedom means all the money in the whole world can't buy that.</span> <span id="s1048">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1049">That's the most important thing.</span> <span id="s1050">Not money, not anything but health and freedom.</span> <span id="s1051">The only thing I felt, I'm free and I can do whatever I want to do, even if I don't have nothing but I have my freedom.</span> <span id="s1052">I could go wherever what I want to go.</span> <span id="s1053">I could do what I want to do and I appreciated it very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: All those years that you were hiding, fighting, running, did you ever want to just give up?</span> <span id="s1055">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: I felt I had to take revenge one day for everything that has happened, for all these people that I saw my friends that I loved them so much.</span> <span id="s1058">I went to school with them together, get killed.</span> <span id="s1059">I saw them shot, falling down on the floor, and it started in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1060">I saw them lying dead.</span> <span id="s1061">I said no.</span> <span id="s1062">I have to live and take revenge, and you know what, right now I don't feel like I want revenge.</span> <span id="s1063">I just want one thing.</span> <span id="s1064">I don't want this thing to happen again to our people, to any people.</span> <span id="s1065">But I don't want revenge anymore.</span> <span id="s1066">At that time, I just felt that I have to take revenge and I have to live just for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: When you were liberated did you still want revenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1069">I wanted to revenge, I wanted to revenge from these Polish people that took away everything from us that they were worse than the Germans.</span> <span id="s1070">I wanted revenge.</span> <span id="s1071">I think I lived for it, just to get revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Did you ever get revenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1074">The only revenge I have that – I don't know.</span> <span id="s1075">I don't think I had any.</span> <span id="s1076">I felt – after I didn't feel that.</span> <span id="s1077">The only thing I had revenge is when I saw our country that we have a country.</span> <span id="s1078">That we are people just like anybody else, and Israel was like in 1947, 1946, when I saw that we have a country I said, “Now I have everything that I ever fought for, that we're going to have a country.</span> <span id="s1079">We're going to be able to be just like anybody else.</span> <span id="s1080">Even to be respected in other countries, we need our country, and I love that country.”</span> <span id="s1081">I think that was my revenge, that I knew we were fighting for something.</span> <span id="s1082">Even I didn't fight for Israel I fought for something that I lived to see, and it's important to me.</span> <span id="s1083">I think it should be important to all of us that country we have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">02:42:00 It's the dearest thing that I feel we have, especially now that we're getting peace, and it's going to be peace there, I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Was there some reason why you didn't immigrate to Israel instead of Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1087">We wanted to go to Israel, but it came out like that, like we stayed in a place to get some milk for the baby and all of a sudden they arranged it for Canada.</span> <span id="s1088">It just happened, it just happened but I really wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1089">I didn't think of Canada at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Is there anything else you want to add that you think we need to know that you need to remember that I haven't asked you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">02:43:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1093">If you ask me I can remember.</span> <span id="s1094">I don't even know what I want to add because it's very hard for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Let me just ask you, prior to the Germans entering Lakhva, did you all have any idea what was happening at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: No, no we didn't.</span> <span id="s1097">The religious Jews in Lakhva, the rabbis, they said that in Lakhva one rabbi died and he said there's not going to be any blood shedding in Lakhva, never.</span> <span id="s1098">It's not going to be.</span> <span id="s1099">We shouldn't fight with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1100">We shouldn't fight and no matter what happens we have to stay put.</span> <span id="s1101">But the Zionist people didn't think like that.</span> <span id="s1102">They didn't believe in that, what the rabbi said.</span> <span id="s1103">And they didn't listen to the rabbis.</span> <span id="s1104">If they would have listened to the rabbis all these Lakhva people – a few people are alive.</span> <span id="s1105">From the old ghetto there were a few thousand people that maybe a hundred people are alive, maybe.</span> <span id="s1106">I'm not even sure of that, so it wouldn't even be these people alive, if they would have listened to the rabbis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Did the Zionists have more information?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: No, they didn't have information, they had guts.</span> <span id="s1109">They said, “If somebody fights me, I'm not going to put one cheek and let the other one.</span> <span id="s1110">I'm not going to let it happen.</span> <span id="s1111">We have to fight back.”</span> <span id="s1112">And they said it to the rabbis and the rabbis were screaming, “No, don't fight.”</span> <span id="s1113">So, they didn't listen.</span> <span id="s1114">They just said that we have to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Did anybody know what was going on in Europe at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Nobody, not the small people.</span> <span id="s1117">Maybe the big people knew it, but not the small people, not the ordinary people.</span> <span id="s1118">Nobody knew, nobody.</span> <span id="s1119">They only knew these people when they fought back, they knew that, “If somebody gives me, if somebody is going to shoot me, I'm not going to let myself.</span> <span id="s1120">It's not going to happen, because I'm going to fight back, even if I don't have ammunition, I'm going to take eggs, I'm going knives.</span> <span id="s1121">I'm going to take everything I have with everything I could even I'm going to die just the same, but I'm not going to let myself get killed just like that without a fight.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">02:46:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Why do you think so few communities fought back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: I don't know because there was nobody organized it.</span> <span id="s1125">They had to have somebody organize these things.</span> <span id="s1126">If they would have had somebody who organized these things, I think people were afraid and they didn't think.</span> <span id="s1127">They just went like sheep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Do you think any of this could have been avoided?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: It couldn't have been avoided, but they could have fought back.</span> <span id="s1130">They could have prepared themselves if they would know it.</span> <span id="s1131">I think people should have prepared themselves.</span> <span id="s1132">Like I was little, and I was happy when I saw that menschI was there, saw it, when they were giving the German with an ax.</span> <span id="s1133">I felt so good inside and when they asked the doctor to help them.</span> <span id="s1134">They're going to kill my brothers and my sisters and everybody and you're telling me you're going to keep my family safe if I'm going to save you?</span> <span id="s1135">No, I'm not saving anybody.</span> <span id="s1136">You could kill me too, so they shot the doctor too.</span> <span id="s1137">It means that some people had guts.</span> <span id="s1138">They didn't just want to give up.</span> <span id="s1139">If they're going to throw away their lives at least they're going to do it for something.</span> <span id="s1140">They're going to go with a reason, with a fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: It's just hard to understand why some communities were much, much stronger this way than others?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: I think because they had somebody like Rochczyn there.</span> <span id="s1143">If they would have more like these, like now in Israel.</span> <span id="s1144">How has Israel survived?</span> <span id="s1145">Because there were these people, they were there.</span> <span id="s1146">That's why.</span> <span id="s1147">These were part of these people.</span> <span id="s1148">They learned to be like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">11 person (Yiddish); a decent person, someone of noble character.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">They learned not to give up without a fight and we never have to give up without a fight if we have to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: So strong leadership?</span> <span id="s1152">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Anything else when you look back at this time in your life.</span> <span id="s1154">What do you think about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: When I look back, I wish I could have said to everybody in all these ghettos, “Don't let yourself just go like sheep to the grave.</span> <span id="s1156">Fight back.</span> <span id="s1157">Don't let yourself, don't go to the graves just like that.</span> <span id="s1158">If you go to the grave let it be written – let it be said that you were fighting and you didn't give up, but you were fighting for something that you believed that, you have to fight, not to go like a sheep but to go like a person, like a human being, to fight back.”</span> <span id="s1159">I believe it now, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: I never give up even now, no matter hard you know.</span> <span id="s1162">We had hard times.</span> <span id="s1163">Like now, I married my husband.</span> <span id="s1164">He was very sick.</span> <span id="s1165">He was twice in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1166">He had surgery after I married him.</span> <span id="s1167">He had a surgery by-pass and then five times since we live in a house now.</span> <span id="s1168">One year he was five times with infections.</span> <span id="s1169">He went through a lot, so I never gave up.</span> <span id="s1170">I never said “he's going to die,” and I was sitting and talking to him and I said, “You're not going to die.</span> <span id="s1171">You'll see.</span> <span id="s1172">You're going to pull through it because you have to.</span> <span id="s1173">You have to.</span> <span id="s1174">You have to.”</span> <span id="s1175">I was saying to myself, “No he's not going to die.</span> <span id="s1176">It's not going to happen to him because we're going to fight and we're going to survive.”</span> <span id="s1177">It's just like anything else.</span> <span id="s1178">I'm a fighter now too.</span> <span id="s1179">I always believe when I go to sleep at night it's like a nice letter that's going to come.</span> <span id="s1180">I live day by day like that like it's going to come a letter tomorrow, something good is going to happen.</span> <span id="s1181">Like I'm waiting for the next day, every single day in my life I'm waiting for something good to happen.</span> <span id="s1182">Even if it's not going to happen, I still believe that it will happen.</span> <span id="s1183">I never believe that it's going to be an ordinary day.</span> <span id="s1184">I believe that it's going to be the most beautiful day tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Is that the way you felt when you were in hiding?</span> <span id="s1186">A: I always felt like that.</span> <span id="s1187">I think I was born like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Just tell me briefly, how did you meet Joseph, your current husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: I knew him a long time because – I met my current husband a long time ago but I didn't know him, but a few years ago, when he moved in with his wife – I used to live on the fourth floor and he moved into my apartment on the third floor.</span> <span id="s1190">He moved in with his wife and his wife had Alzheimer.</span> <span id="s1191">She was very sick.</span> <span id="s1192">I saw them and I knew them and I said – I opened the door and I let him in – I said, “These are two old people I'm going to let them in, let the door open.</span> <span id="s1193">They're carrying parcels.</span> <span id="s1194">They moved into that apartment.”</span> <span id="s1195">Then I heard from far his wife said, “That's Zina.”</span> <span id="s1196">I said, “That's Icek?”</span> <span id="s1197">And I call him Icek, because his name is Icek and not Joseph.</span> <span id="s1198">I said, “My God, he looks so old and that man is not so old.”</span> <span id="s1199">He was about 63 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s1200">I said, “My God, what has happened to them?”</span> <span id="s1201">At that time, his sister in law came – and I used to go a few times to his house to have coffee there with his wife too.</span> <span id="s1202">His wife didn't know nothing because she was very sick, Alzheimer.</span> <span id="s1203">She was still a young woman because she died at 63 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">02:53:00 So, I came up to the house and I was – I saw – when his wife died, his sister-in-law came and she stayed by me upstairs, instead of staying in a hotel, I gave her my apartment because my husband was dead already.</span> <span id="s1205">She says, “You know what, you two are so good for each other, you're going to marry him.”</span> <span id="s1206">And I didn't even think about it because first of all, his wife just died.</span> <span id="s1207">I'm going to think that I'm going to marry him?</span> <span id="s1208">I said, “You're crazy.</span> <span id="s1209">Anja (ph), why are you talking like that?”</span> <span id="s1210">That was Erwin's wife, and I knew Erwin since 1951, very well.</span> <span id="s1211">I said, “You're crazy, don't talk like that.”</span> <span id="s1212">But every single day that his wife died, I started asking him to go for a walk because he was very depressed and he was talking about his wife all the time and we were going and walking a lot, and talking.</span> <span id="s1213">Then, I fell in love with him after, and the same thing happened to him I think.</span> <span id="s1214">So, I never believed that in that age I'm going to fall in love with somebody, because I think I love him more than my life because after that he was so sick a few times he was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1215">Quite a few times, and I stood by him and I always gave him faith.</span> <span id="s1216">When he was in the hospital with a by-pass and this is the second one, because 15 years ago he had one bypass and this was the second one.</span> <span id="s1217">He thought he was not going to live because the doctor told him that that by-pass is not going to be able to make a by-pass.</span> <span id="s1218">I told him, “Don't believe the doctor what he says.</span> <span id="s1219">I heard many doctors.</span> <span id="s1220">They talk to the patient and they die before the patient dies, so don't listen.</span> <span id="s1221">You'll see that you're going to be alive and you're going to be able to have the operation.”</span> <span id="s1222">A few days later he came and he says, “You know, what we're going to try to operate.”</span> <span id="s1223">He was so happy, just like he was going to go to dance, and I said to him like that, “Before you go to the operation, have faith, believe that you're going to live and after you're going to see we're going to buy the most beautiful things for the house.</span> <span id="s1224">You're going to sell all the old junks you have and we're going to buy the nicest things.</span> <span id="s1225">You're going to see you're going to have the most beautiful life.</span> <span id="s1226">Just believe it.”</span> <span id="s1227">He was six weeks in the intensive care and I was sitting every single day and talking like that.</span> <span id="s1228">“Just believe it, you'll see, you're going to have a good life.”</span> <span id="s1229">Just like I thought in the time of the war.</span> <span id="s1230">I didn't think I was going to live but I still didn't want to believe it because I think I'm a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span
