was born in Bratislava (ph), Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s13">It is a small village in the mountains,</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Mountains in Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: I need you to state your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My name is Alice Masters.</span> <span id="s17">I was born Alice Eberstarkova.</span> <span id="s18">Q: And your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: And my date of birth, I was born on May 10th, 1925.</span> <span id="s20">Q: Now, tell me about .</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: We lived in a small village in , Slovakia, and it was a very close-knit family.</span> <span id="s22">My grandfather lived in a great big house, and he had three children.</span> <span id="s23">My mother was the oldest of the three children, and when she was married he built an addition to his house and we lived right behind his house.</span> <span id="s24">And my father came from , Poland to Czechoslovakia, and they were married.</span> <span id="s25">They had three children.</span> <span id="s26">My oldest sister was Josephine and I, Alice, and then my younger sister was Ellie.</span> <span id="s27">My father was very rich.</span> <span id="s28">My mother was not quite as rich as my father, but she followed his desires.</span> <span id="s29">And it was a very lovely, sheltered life that we led.</span> <span id="s30">We had a very happy childhood.</span> <span id="s31">My parents -- my mother was naturally totally devoted to her children and to her husband and to doing her housework.</span> <span id="s32">And my father was working in the building industry.</span> <span id="s33">Actually, he probably started out as assistant in some kind of a locksmith area, but developed into roofing and building materials.</span> <span id="s34">And he was -- we had a car, which was very unusual in the village.</span> <span id="s35">It was a convertible, scooter (ph), and we were very protected.</span> <span id="s36">My -- we loved going in the summertime.</span> <span id="s37">We loved doing things like going into the woods and picking wild strawberries, wild flowers, and in the winter we were on our skis and our skates and sledding from morning to night.</span> <span id="s38">My mother did all the sewing for us.</span> <span id="s39">We had beautiful homemade, handmade clothes, which my mother made.</span> <span id="s40">And -- which we didn't appreciate, by the way, too much because we did want to have store-bought things.</span> <span id="s41">But in the village, I can't remember, but there was a shop where they had ready-made things.</span> <span id="s42">My mother embroidered our underwear very carefully.</span> <span id="s43">Well, everything was handmade, hand knitted, and it was a very interesting, very different sort of existence.</span> <span id="s44">My father on Friday, my mother was -- had to get the house ready for sabbath, and in the evening one the children, the three of us, went to the synagogue with my father.</span> <span id="s45">Then we came home to a wonderful home-cooked meal, which was delicious.</span> <span id="s46">I always talked about oh, the wonderful things my mother made because I tried to do the same.</span> <span id="s47">I learned, in fact, from memory to do almost all the things that my mother made.</span> <span id="s48">There were two or three things I couldn't remember how to do, but I -- in the tape that I did for children, I described in detail all the different menus that we had for our dinners.</span> <span id="s49">On Saturday, we were not allowed -- after sundown, we were not allowed to put the lights on in the house.</span> <span id="s50">So everything was -- you know, had to, the sabbath had be observed very carefully.</span> <span id="s51">On Saturday morning we went to synagogue again.</span> <span id="s52">We had to be dressed very carefully with special clothes for Saturday.</span> <span id="s53">We went to the synagogue with my father, and then after the synagogue we came home and ate whatever my mother had to prepare the day before.</span> <span id="s54">Because, as I said, we couldn't cook or put the lights on on Saturday.</span> <span id="s55">And then after our meal, we went for a walk with our father.</span> <span id="s56">We went to visit the different families, Jewish families, in the village.</span> <span id="s57">And we walked up and down the village, visiting everybody and in the evening we came home.</span> <span id="s58">Oh, by the way, when -- the first house in which we lived behind my grandfather's house, we had no electricity.</span> <span id="s59">We lived in a very, very tiny little house, actually.</span> <span id="s60">It had a one-room living room and one bedroom, and a very small kitchen.</span> <span id="s61">And we had a maid, and I'll tell you how our maid lived.</span> <span id="s62">She lived in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s63">We had a kitchen table which was like a box, and in the evening, the kitchen table -- the top was removed and the box was pulled apart and that was a bed in which our maid slept.</span> <span id="s64">And as my father worked himself up and became better well-to-do, better to do, he built a bigger house, which was completed in 1938, I think.</span> <span id="s65">We just lived there about a year before we had to leave.</span> <span id="s66">And, of course, that house was large, consisted of three different units and then we had a bathroom and electricity.</span> <span id="s67">But in the house before that, we did not.</span> <span id="s68">The reason I mentioned that is because I said that Saturday after our walks when we walked with our father, when we came home in the afternoon, we would sit in the living room and tell stories and talk and really enjoy each other's company.</span> <span id="s69">And I love those evenings because it was getting dark, and I loved it when it was getting dark.</span> <span id="s70">And we couldn't put the light on until after the sabbath was over, and then the gas lamp was lit.</span> <span id="s71">But it was a very, very cozy lovely life as far as the children were concerned.</span> <span id="s72">Because my mother worked very hard.</span> <span id="s73">She had to get up every morning at 6 o'clock in the morning to light the stove so that she could put on the kettle for the coffee and tea, whatever.</span> <span id="s74">We had a baker next door, and every morning they would deliver fresh rolls.</span> <span id="s75">Otherwise, my mother did all the -- everything that was done.</span> <span id="s76">Nothing was bought from a store.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">That means noodles were made at home, and bread was baked, actually, not at home, but made and carried over to the baker to be baked.</span> <span id="s78">And then we had these huge loaves of bread that were brought home and they lasted a week.</span> <span id="s79">And then my mother made the Friday or Saturday, and everything, in fact, she had to do herself.</span> <span id="s80">And we, as children, did not really participate too much in the household chores, but we played.</span> <span id="s81">You know, we played from morning to night.</span> <span id="s82">We had a great life.</span> <span id="s83">I loved it, I always adored the village.</span> <span id="s84">And I loved all the things that it gave us.</span> <span id="s85">I mean, I, as a child, I was aware of all beauties of the village.</span> <span id="s86">I loved the woods, and I loved the mountains.</span> <span id="s87">And I couldn't wait for the snow to melt for to be -- oh, I loved the feeling of the snow melting in the village because then we could go into the forest and it was big snow drops, which I adored.</span> <span id="s88">Because the snow drops came out even while the snow was still on the ground.</span> <span id="s89">Then we looked forward to the spring because we could pick, as I said earlier, wild flowers and wild strawberries, and then -- well, we had a cow.</span> <span id="s90">We had chickens.</span> <span id="s91">And I loved all these things, everything was so great, you know.</span> <span id="s92">My job was to catch the chickens to make -- to see whether they are going to have an egg to lay.</span> <span id="s93">And I did by inserting my little finger into the rear to see whether the egg was there, because I had to lock up the chickens if they were about to lay an egg so that they wouldn't lay them just anywhere, but in a coop.</span> <span id="s94">And so I -- and then we would ride with my father in his car to the other villages because he went there on business, and it was a convertible and we would sit in the car.</span> <span id="s95">And all the children would gather around us and try to toot the horn because they hadn't seen a car like that.</span> <span id="s96">And we would be so thrilled to be going out with him to do these things.</span> <span id="s97">Well, such a very lovely life, and we traveled in the summertime.</span> <span id="s98">We would travel to visit my uncle, my mother's younger brother, who lived in the Trnava (ph), which was a spa in Slovakia, a very well-known spa.</span> <span id="s99">And he was director of the spa.</span> <span id="s100">He was actually the one who saved us in the end because he was -- shall I go back .</span> <span id="s101">.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Well, tell us about your uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Because -- now, I'm just going to give you the life in Czechoslovakia, right?</span> <span id="s105">So in summertime, we would visit our uncle in , and in the wintertime, of course, we couldn't wait for winter either because we had enormous amounts of snow.</span> <span id="s106">And the lakes froze, our river froze; we had very deep ice so we could immediately get on the ice skates and skate on the river.</span> <span id="s107">We would be up and down the hills with our sleds from morning to night, and we would also sled across the lake.</span> <span id="s108">We adored it.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">And so every season had its special things for us, which we loved.</span> <span id="s110">We were very protected.</span> <span id="s111">We didn't really know about politics or what was going on, but our parents spoke several languages, by the way.</span> <span id="s112">My mother, because Czechoslovakia once belongs to the Austria-Hungarian Empire, when my mother went to school, the language was Hungarian, okay?</span> <span id="s113">Also, Slovak, so she spoke fluent Hungarian, fluent Slovak, and she also spoke German.</span> <span id="s114">My -- the Jewish community in Bratislava, where I lived was quite intellectual.</span> <span id="s115">I mean, my uncle went to Prague University.</span> <span id="s116">He was sent to -- he was very well educated.</span> <span id="s117">That was my mother's youngest brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">My mother's sister, younger sister, was also educated and worked with my uncle in Trnava (ph) in the spa.</span> <span id="s119">I'm not sure what kind of position she had, but she probably had some administrative position.</span> <span id="s120">She was always very elegant when she came to visit.</span> <span id="s121">She had always lovely dresses and her lovely silk stockings were very impressive.</span> <span id="s122">Of course, neither of them were married at that time.</span> <span id="s123">My mother was the one who was married and had the three children and worked very -- was a dressmaker and everything was just absolutely beautiful.</span> <span id="s124">My mother had excellent taste.</span> <span id="s125">We used to go with her to the store where they sold fabrics, fabric store, and she would pick things very carefully.</span> <span id="s126">And she would dress us very well.</span> <span id="s127">Everything was beautifully made, and we had also lovely ski outfits with beautifully knitted sweaters and my mother, everything was so -- it seemed so beautiful to me when I look back at it, you know.</span> <span id="s128">I mean, nobody does things like we had at home.</span> <span id="s129">And we had my mother's linen was put away -- I mean the way they wash laundry, there was no hot water.</span> <span id="s130">I mean, I remember that they had to take the laundry to the river to rinse it.</span> <span id="s131">And the way we had to take a bath when we were little, you know.</span> <span id="s132">I'll tell you about that.</span> <span id="s133">There was a bathtub which was outside the house.</span> <span id="s134">It was made of metal and it was brought in on the Thursday, I think, every Thursday.</span> <span id="s135">So that we could all take a bath.</span> <span id="s136">And hot water had to be boiled and filled and then the three of us had a bath in that thing.</span> <span id="s137">And then when we had our hair washed, we were very well protected because in those days there was no insulin and so lots of people lost children if they were not well looked after, because they had colds or all kinds of other illnesses.</span> <span id="s138">So my mother was very protective of us and when our hair was washed, she would put a scarf around it, we couldn't go out anywhere, you know.</span> <span id="s139">So, in any case, when I did this -- I did a tape for my children when I told this story about the bathtub, my sister was very upset with me because she said I shouldn't be telling things like that.</span> <span id="s140">But I thought it was quiet interesting because it was all done very -- you know, it was fun.</span> <span id="s141">We enjoyed having our bath inside the house, and then my father got into that water.</span> <span id="s142">Of course, naturally, you couldn't boil enough water for everybody to have fresh bath, so you all managed to get a bath in that tub.</span> <span id="s143">It was a very, very beautiful life.</span> <span id="s144">That's all I can say about it.</span> <span id="s145">We loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: What about school?</span> <span id="s147">Were you in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s149">We were in school.</span> <span id="s150">There was a problem about the school, though.</span> <span id="s151">I had a problem about it.</span> <span id="s152">We in the minority, of course.</span> <span id="s153">There was -- I think there was one, only one, maybe two Jewish children in the class.</span> <span id="s154">And talking about school prayer, that really had an impact on me.</span> <span id="s155">I really minded very much not to have to -- you know, it was a Catholic country, Slovakia, right?</span> <span id="s156">So the prayers were said every morning in class, and I could not -- of course not, I could not participate in that, and I wouldn't, of course.</span> <span id="s157">My father -- well, I couldn't; I was Jewish, so I couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s158">But I minded being different, I really -- I mean, if there's a discussion about prayer in school, this really has said something to me because I definitely felt very left out.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">And I wanted to very much like everybody else, and since there were so few Jewish children, I felt that I was different from everybody else.</span> <span id="s160">The school, I looked forward very much to going to school, but once I started going, I soon realized that it was not so much fun after all, because we were really punished quite severely in school.</span> <span id="s161">We were punished by being beaten on our hands, you know, with a stick.</span> <span id="s162">Or we had to kneel in front of the class if we did something that was unacceptable in some way or we talked, whatever we did.</span> <span id="s163">And I was punished quite often, and I had to kneel in front of the class because I clowned around.</span> <span id="s164">And then I got punished some more, and I got hit on my hands quite often, but I did quite well.</span> <span id="s165">We had elementary school and high school in the village.</span> <span id="s166">The Gymnasium, which was like a junior college, was in a town which was two hours away from our village.</span> <span id="s167">My parents decided that my older sister who was very much like my mother, she was very interested in being a housewife -- when she was asked what she wants to be when she grows up, she wanted to be a mother.</span> <span id="s168">And so it was decided that she was going to go to a local high school, and when I finished elementary school, it was decided that I would be going to this junior college two hours away from the village.</span> <span id="s169">So I traveled every single day by train two hours to school.</span> <span id="s170">I got up at 6 -- 5 o'clock in the morning or whatever; 5:30, 6:00.</span> <span id="s171">My father walked me through the snow with a lantern to the station.</span> <span id="s172">I was put on the train, which was about two carriages, and we traveled to , which was a Gymnasium, which had a Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s173">And I went to Gymnasium to the -- I didn't have to go to the first year because I took a test, I was very lucky always, which was maybe not luck, but I did a test and they decided that I should go to the second year, started the second year of Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s174">There were eight years of Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s175">I started in the second.</span> <span id="s176">Of course, I didn't last long because that was 1938, and 1939 I left.</span> <span id="s177">And I came home every evening from -- every day from the school, I think at about 3 o'clock.</span> <span id="s178">I took the train at 3 o'clock, and I got back to the village at 5 o'clock.</span> <span id="s179">And I was walking back from the station, I could -- my father was building this new house into which we were going to move.</span> <span id="s180">And I would see him on the roof of that house; he was doing it himself.</span> <span id="s181">I mean, he had help, but he was working very hard to build that house.</span> <span id="s182">And we -- so schooling was good.</span> <span id="s183">I mean, you know, I did all right in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: And you also, then, before you left Czechoslovakia, had gone on a train, had left your town my yourself, which is sort of interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: To where?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: You were on a train every day to school . . . A: To school, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: .</span> <span id="s188">.</span> <span id="s189">so you had been away from home on a train by yourself?</span> <span id="s190">A: Going to school, yes, for the five days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Question about being Jewish in this community.</span> <span id="s192">I assume that there were Jewish families, but that it was not a predominately Jewish . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s194">It was mainly Catholic.</span> <span id="s195">Q: Other than the school prayer . . . A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: . . . did you feel ostracized there?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: How?</span> <span id="s199">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: I did -- well, I did and I didn't, let's put it that way.</span> <span id="s201">We had a lot of -- I had a lot of non-Jewish friends, of course.</span> <span id="s202">But the people who were worse off than I were the Gypsies.</span> <span id="s203">We had a little Gypsy girl, her name was Suzie, Suzka (ph), and she was not allowed to -- she had to sit by herself in the class in the back row.</span> <span id="s204">I mean, I was part of the whole -- I mean, just like everybody else.</span> <span id="s205">The only thing that was different was the school prayer.</span> <span id="s206">But she was completely ostracized.</span> <span id="s207">She was sitting in the back row, and she was not allowed to -- nobody sat next to her.</span> <span id="s208">I was sort of -- felt very sorry for her, and I used to -- I had made sort of a friendship with her, but she was worse off.</span> <span id="s209">I minded taking the Jewish holidays, not going to school during the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s210">I minded that, because everybody else was in class and I was not.</span> <span id="s211">And then I minded very much not participating in the Christmas and other holidays because we had a maid and she would take us -- I mean, we had lots of churches in the village.</span> <span id="s212">It is a very -- it was mainly Catholic, very religious sort of community.</span> <span id="s213">In the wrong sense, they were not religious in the sense of being good.</span> <span id="s214">But they were in the religious going to church, that's about it.</span> <span id="s215">Because they had came to it, you know.</span> <span id="s216">Most of them, I mean, many of them -- I don't know how many.</span> <span id="s217">I don't want to go into it, but there were no Germans that entered our village as far as I know.</span> <span id="s218">So whatever was done to the community, Jewish community, was done by the local people.</span> <span id="s219">You know how this turned out.</span> <span id="s220">I mean, I didn't really investigate it too deeply, but I know there were no Germans in the village at all.</span> <span id="s221">And I think that most of the things that happened to us, to our people, were greed.</span> <span id="s222">Because everybody expected or thought that we were all rich, that all the Jewish people were rich, which they weren't.</span> <span id="s223">Everybody was working very hard.</span> <span id="s224">It's true that most of the stores were owned by the Jewish people, but they were little stores eking out a small living.</span> <span id="s225">And I think that -- I don't know, my parents protected us a great deal from the outside, so I don't know that I felt -- I did feel different in having to take the days off for the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s226">And the synagogue was right across the street from the school, my elementary school that was.</span> <span id="s227">After I went to Gymnasium, I was out of it.</span> <span id="s228">I didn't go to the local schools.</span> <span id="s229">But then all the kids went to school, and I was outside the synagogue, and I felt so different.</span> <span id="s230">I didn't like that.</span> <span id="s231">I felt that I was -- I wanted to be like the others, that was the main thing.</span> <span id="s232">And I think that was the main thing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: But people weren't calling you names or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Oh, they were.</span> <span id="s235">They were, yes.</span> <span id="s236">And there were very many things like that, but, I don't know, one sort of learned to live with it, I suppose.</span> <span id="s237">I minded.</span> <span id="s238">I mean, yes, people were always calling us names.</span> <span id="s239">But I seemed to get over it the best I could.</span> <span id="s240">I mean, I didn't seem to -- yes, I guess I must have.</span> <span id="s241">I did mind it, basically.</span> <span id="s242">And I never particularly remembered that so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: But these were your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Oh, my friend, my best friend, was the daughter of the mayor.</span> <span id="s245">My father -- going back to my father, okay.</span> <span id="s246">My father was extremely popular in the village because he was very handy.</span> <span id="s247">He could do things that other people couldn't do.</span> <span id="s248">When a cross fell from one church in a storm, my father was the one who climbed the steeple to put the cross back up.</span> <span id="s249">And everybody stood in the whole village watching him do it, and I thought always that my parents would survive.</span> <span id="s250">All through the war, I thought my parents would survive because of the sort of things he did in the village.</span> <span id="s251">He was very popular, and once when there was a fire and the mayor was drunk, my father broke down the door to the fire engine and got it out and drove to the fire.</span> <span id="s252">He was very liked in the community.</span> <span id="s253">He was a hard working man who worked from morning to night, and he did all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s254">We had a little bit of a -- we didn't have a farm, but we had a plot of land, and he did all things like everybody else.</span> <span id="s255">He worked just as much as that, and he was liked.</span> <span id="s256">And I thought people would look after him, but they didn't.</span> <span id="s257">I don't really know all the details of what went on.</span> <span id="s258">When I read my mother's letters, which I haven't read, maybe I'll find out more.</span> <span id="s259">But the problem is that my parents would not have written anything that was going on, because they would have been trying to protect us from that kind of information.</span> <span id="s260">So they -- so, unfortunately, I wish my mother would have been more open about what was happening to them.</span> <span id="s261">But, you know -- you were asking me about . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Well, we were talking a little bit being Jewish in this community, but I think you've talked about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: I'm sure there was a lot -- there was quite a lot of name calling in the community, yes.</span> <span id="s264">They called, not me particularly, but they would call all people who were selling eggs or people who were poor and old, they were calling them names and throwing stones and doing things, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s265">There was a lot of that.</span> <span id="s266">But, and I told you, we were very protected and we were very close close-knit community in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s267">And our parents were -- looked after us and didn't let us see much of this.</span> <span id="s268">And -- but I did mind, for instance, of course, there were so many churches that I told you, and there was Christmas everywhere, you know, and we didn't participate.</span> <span id="s269">And I didn't like that, I love Christmas.</span> <span id="s270">I thought Christmas was very appealing, and the snow was beautiful, and people were selling all these lovely decorations for the Christmas trees and we couldn't have any.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: You said you were protected, you really didn't have too much sense of what was going on outside of your village.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: You were somewhat isolated.</span> <span id="s274">I'm just wondering if you had heard or read anything about Hitler or the Nazi Party in Germany or if you think your family had any information about what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Oh, yes, they did.</span> <span id="s276">Of course, my parents, obviously did have something.</span> <span id="s277">There was a lot of whispering going on, and there were people coming to the house and they talked about it.</span> <span id="s278">We knew something that it was going on, but they didn't tell us too much about it.</span> <span id="s279">But we knew something awful was happening, but we didn't know -- I mean, who would have thought anything like this?</span> <span id="s280">I mean, we didn't -- we knew, we knew something, but not enough.</span> <span id="s281">Our parents did not discuss with us the details about what was going on, but we had a radio and my mother turned the radio on, and I could hear somebody screaming, Hitler.</span> <span id="s282">And then there was fear of this awful occupation.</span> <span id="s283">I mean, when Austria fell, we knew.</span> <span id="s284">And, of course, we knew very much because lots of refugees came to our village.</span> <span id="s285">The reason they came at night mostly after Austria fell, my father walked them across the border of Carpathian (ph) Mountains to Poland because many of the refugees came from Germany and from Austria.</span> <span id="s286">And my father and some other men knew the way to Poland through the mountains.</span> <span id="s287">I mean, there were borders everywhere, so it wasn't -- so it was an illegal entry into Poland.</span> <span id="s288">So my father -- we knew that he was doing that.</span> <span id="s289">Lots of people, we were right on the northern part of Slovakia, which is not very far from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">But I knew that my father was doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: So rather than staying in your village, they were all headed toward Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Oh, no, they didn't come to stay to our village.</span> <span id="s293">They came to cross the border.</span> <span id="s294">They came to maybe various points in Slovakia, but the ones that came to our village came only to cross.</span> <span id="s295">They didn't come to stay; there were no refugees to stay in the village.</span> <span id="s296">They just came to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: At what point did the effect of the German effort start impacting your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: After the occupation in Czechoslovakia, which was March 1939.</span> <span id="s299">We were occupied in March '39.</span> <span id="s300">At that point, just before the occupation, everybody was very patriotic, and they felt against -- of course, don't forget we were surrounded by lots of "enemies," in quotes, because at that -- well, Czechoslovakia was very patriotic.</span> <span id="s301">We were all big patriots, and we were very much against Germany, against Austrian -- against Austria, because it was an Austria-Hungary empire at one time which was -- and then we were liberated in 1918, of course.</span> <span id="s302">Everybody was -- Austria was not particularly -- it was an enemy.</span> <span id="s303">We were, Czechoslovakia, surrounded by all these outside countries which were once our occupiers, okay?</span> <span id="s304">So at first when there was a noise about being occupied by Germany, everybody was very patriotic, having a Czech flag in the lapel, and my friend, my best friend, , who was the daughter of this mayor, took this flag away from me and said, "You are not entitled to wear it.</span> <span id="s305">You are a Jew."</span> <span id="s306">And then afterwards, after we left, she felt very bad about it, because she went to see my mother -- I know that she went back from one of her letters, that she did go and see my mother after we left.</span> <span id="s307">So she obviously felt some sorrow about it, so when Czechoslovakia fell, that's when we, of course, immediately knew that this was a disaster of the greatest order.</span> <span id="s308">That morning I used to have to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning to get a train.</span> <span id="s309">That morning I woke up and it was daylight, and I was very upset.</span> <span id="s310">And I said, "How come I'm not up to take the train to the school?"</span> <span id="s311">And I heard the radio and the noise -- and the shrieking of Hitler, and my mother and father stood by the radio in terror.</span> <span id="s312">And they said, "You're not going to school anymore," because they were too afraid to send me by train to , and so they would send , and so I stayed in the village and I went to the school, local school, and I was not enrolled in that school.</span> <span id="s313">But I went as -- I just sat there on the classes, and one day when I was sitting in the class -- I was not participating, I was just listening to what was going on -- I looked out of the window and I saw a couple of buses in the square.</span> <span id="s314">And I looked and watched what was going on, and I saw some Jewish families being put on those buses.</span> <span id="s315">It was not my family, and not my grandparents, not my parents, but some poor families from out in the village.</span> <span id="s316">And I was shocked, of course, and I didn't know what was happening, and I found out later they put them on the buses and drove them to the Hungarian border because they were just going to drop them off.</span> <span id="s317">I mean, they were told to pack up and they were going to be deported.</span> <span id="s318">And they dropped them off on the Hungarian border, and left them there.</span> <span id="s319">And, of course, it was a great shock to me, and I didn't know.</span> <span id="s320">I was grateful it was none of my family, but, you know, I was scared.</span> <span id="s321">I mean, it was very shocking.</span> <span id="s322">It was the beginning when I realized things were -- I mean, it was so frightening that one didn't dare to think too much about it.</span> <span id="s323">I mean, at least I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">My parents did not discuss these things with us, which was too bad.</span> <span id="s325">But I guess they wanted to protect us.</span> <span id="s326">So the next thing that happened was that men were put on horses -- were asked to ride horses.</span> <span id="s327">The Jewish men were asked to -- these were not horses for riding.</span> <span id="s328">These were cart horses, you know, and they were to ride them to the next town, which was sort of a torture thing.</span> <span id="s329">They got some men to do this, and, of course, it was terribly difficult for them to do that, and how can you ride these horses?</span> <span id="s330">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s331">It was a form of torturing these men.</span> <span id="s332">My father was also not -- I think he was not asked to do that.</span> <span id="s333">But some men were gathered to send to this town, and the other things that happened had to do hard labor in the street work.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">They gathered the Jewish men, and they had to that.</span> <span id="s335">And then my grandfather was very outspoken, and something happened there.</span> <span id="s336">He stood out on his front steps and started screaming at somebody who painted something on his house.</span> <span id="s337">And it was all very scary; very, very frightening.</span> <span id="s338">So how did we know we were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Well, who is giving these orders?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Who was giving -- well, there was still two priests that became head of the Fascist Party in Slovakia, okay?</span> <span id="s341">The one main priest was -- it was Hlinka, H-l-i-n-k-a, Hlinka was a priest and the Slovaks who joined his political party were called the Hlinka Guard, and they were men with arm bands, Slovaks.</span> <span id="s342">And the other priest was called Tiso, T-i-s-o, and he also became a Fascist and he was -- both these men wanted to separate from Bohemia, which is the Czech Republic now, and have an independent Slovakia.</span> <span id="s343">Well, Hitler allowed them to do that because Hitler -- then Slovakia became, you know -- well, I'm not quite sure now, you see, how that worked.</span> <span id="s344">Bohemia, which was the Czech Republic, was occupied, but Slovakia became sort of a protectorate of Germany.</span> <span id="s345">So it was participating in this with Germany, it was not occupied as such.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Did government troops come into your village, or did the local people you had grown up with enforce this?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: I think it's the local people that enforced it.</span> <span id="s348">I didn't see any government troops.</span> <span id="s349">I mean, as far as I know, there were no government troops, but the local people who joined the Hlinka Guard must have participated in this.</span> <span id="s350">I never saw a German soldier come into the village.</span> <span id="s351">But, of course, you know, we left in '39, so I don't know what happened afterwards, but as far as I know, it was local people.</span> <span id="s352">And there could have been some other officials of some, who were sent from other villages or towns, but I think it was the local people.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Were there restrictions placed on the Jewish family?</span> <span id="s354">Was property stolen?</span> <span id="s355">Did any of that sort of thing take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: No, not while we were still there.</span> <span id="s357">But shortly afterwards.</span> <span id="s358">Now, we -- my uncle, as I told you, lived in -- was the director of the Trnava (ph) spa in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s359">And, as such, he was sent to Germany into Berlin in the '30s.</span> <span id="s360">By the way, my uncle was excellent - - an excellent uncle to us.</span> <span id="s361">You see, the only person who was married of the three children of my grandfather was my mother.</span> <span id="s362">Her younger sister was not married, and my uncle wasn't married at that time.</span> <span id="s363">So he was extremely good.</span> <span id="s364">I mean, he adored the three of us, and he was very, very good uncle, model uncle.</span> <span id="s365">But he was sent to Germany to represent the spa, and he lived in Berlin.</span> <span id="s366">And so he saw, from 19 -- I'm not sure what year he went to Berlin -- but let's say it was 1934, '35, '36.</span> <span id="s367">I'm sure that was the year that he was there.</span> <span id="s368">He saw what was going on, so he was very aware of what was going on.</span> <span id="s369">My parents just never left the village, so they didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Nobody could imagine what would happen.</span> <span id="s371">But my uncle lived in Berlin; he married a woman from Berlin.</span> <span id="s372">And then he was transferred to London, and he became a representative of the Spa in London.</span> <span id="s373">He's the one who wrote my parents that it would be wise to send us away.</span> <span id="s374">Now, he ever -- and I can't begin to grasp that, because why would this man take on the responsibility?</span> <span id="s375">I mean, who would have thought something would happen to us?</span> <span id="s376">I mean, we were so remote from the main towns, but he said, "I think it's wise to send the children away."</span> <span id="s377">And he said he can make arrangements for us to go to England.</span> <span id="s378">When my parents -- that is again, a tremendous mystery -- how they ever agreed to do this is beyond me.</span> <span id="s379">I will never understand it, and I think it's amazing if you would know, if you were to know the kind of life we had and how we lived, that my parents agreed to put the three of us -- I mean, to put us on a train.</span> <span id="s380">Now, I don't know much about -- unfortunately, my uncle died so I can't ask him anymore.</span> <span id="s381">I wish I could have asked him.</span> <span id="s382">All these things came up later because I really didn't deal with all these things until a few years ago when I started to think that I better put it all down somewhere.</span> <span id="s383">And I should have asked him.</span> <span id="s384">But, of course, his wife is still alive, and I could ask her, but she won't remember why he initiated the whole process.</span> <span id="s385">Or she might, she's very intelligent, bright woman.</span> <span id="s386">She might.</span> <span id="s387">So maybe if she's still alive when I get to London, I'll ask her.</span> <span id="s388">But my uncle wrote -- I didn't see the letters, but there was a lot of talk, you know, between my parents discussed it all.</span> <span id="s389">Lots of people came to our house during those times when we were occupied in March.</span> <span id="s390">They said they think that people were very religious.</span> <span id="s391">My father was extremely religious, I told you.</span> <span id="s392">And they would come to the house and say "Where is God?"</span> <span id="s393">And to me, that's sin, such a, you know, question of people who are religious to ask that.</span> <span id="s394">And then we thought this must be really a very, very serious business, if people -- I mean, people were really talking about it, but they did not include the children with talk so that I wasn't part of this.</span> <span id="s395">I could only hear these fringe sayings things like "Where is God?"</span> <span id="s396">I remember that.</span> <span id="s397">And the fact that my parents agreed to send us will be a mystery for as long as I live, but that wasn't everything.</span> <span id="s398">So my uncle's letters went back and forth between London and my parents.</span> <span id="s399">My parents must have agreed, I don't know why, how.</span> <span id="s400">We were the only ones, and everybody said to them "How can you do that?</span> <span id="s401">How can you send your children away?</span> <span id="s402">Nothing is going to happen here."</span> <span id="s403">But my parents started to work very hard towards getting us out.</span> <span id="s404">That meant that my father had to spend an awful lot of money to get us passports.</span> <span id="s405">He started to get the passports for the three of us.</span> <span id="s406">Then my mother started to sew and to accumulate clothes for three years ahead, all sizes up to the ages of each of us for three years.</span> <span id="s407">And they started getting us ready for it.</span> <span id="s408">My father got the passports.</span> <span id="s409">My mother packed.</span> <span id="s410">We all had our suitcases.</span> <span id="s411">And one day they said, "You're going to visit Uncle Hine (ph) in London."</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Let me ask you a couple of questions, and I'll let you continue.</span> <span id="s413">In all this back and forth about whether or not you would go, did they ever discuss it with you, say, "Do you want to go?"</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s415">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s416">Maybe they did, maybe they -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s417">I can't remember that part whether they discussed it or not.</span> <span id="s418">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Did you have a lot of time to prepare for this transfer?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s421">We prepared quite a long time because my mother was sewing for a long time, and there's a play called " Transport," I don't know whether you have seen it.</span> <span id="s422">It was here recently, a few months ago.</span> <span id="s423">And the mother was preparing us in every sort of way, you know.</span> <span id="s424">Teaching -- my older sister already knew how to sew, but she was teaching us how to do things to look after ourselves.</span> <span id="s425">Then my older sister was the one who was made to take care of us.</span> <span id="s426">I mean, you know, my mother, she was instructed very carefully to take care over.</span> <span id="s427">That she would be the acting mother, she was 15.</span> <span id="s428">She was one month -- had she been one month older, she wouldn't have been able to get on the transport.</span> <span id="s429">Because the transport only took -- as far as I remember, there were children from six months to 16, and my sister was just 15.</span> <span id="s430">She would have been 16 in August, and I think they started preparing -- we were occupied in March, so I think immediately after that, my uncle must have started the correspondence and so from March until the transport, which left sometime at the end of June.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: What other things were your parents trying to teach you or guide you?</span> <span id="s432">A: About going . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: About leaving home.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Well, the main thing they were interested in is that we should be very close together.</span> <span id="s435">In other words, we shouldn't argue, that we should love each other.</span> <span id="s436">That we should be very close together, and, of course, be very careful.</span> <span id="s437">I mean, everything a parent would teach a child and they instructed, we were told how to behave, how to be -- how to be religious, which we didn't -- I did not stay religious at all.</span> <span id="s438">In fact, I could not face religion after that at all because I thought I couldn't go to the synagogue because it was to painful.</span> <span id="s439">And they taught us how to behave properly.</span> <span id="s440">All the things a parent would teach a child.</span> <span id="s441">They told us, my mother tried to teach us how to take care of ourselves.</span> <span id="s442">She taught my sister how to do sewing.</span> <span id="s443">She gave her -- I mean, she told as much as she could with everything.</span> <span id="s444">She taught us it's better to learn, to be good, to take care of ourselves, to be careful of strangers, men, you know.</span> <span id="s445">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Did they know or could they tell you where you were going and what that life would be like?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No, they didn't know.</span> <span id="s448">In fact, that was one of the big disappointments.</span> <span id="s449">They didn't know -- maybe they knew from my uncle, but we didn't know because we were absolutely shocked when we got to England and found that we were going to a children's home.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: We'll get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Now, do you remember in these several months when you were preparing to leave home what you were thinking, what you and your sisters were feeling about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: No, I don't remember too much about it.</span> <span id="s454">I don't remember every -- no, I don't, actually.</span> <span id="s455">The only thing I remember is that we looked for -- well, we consoled ourselves with the thought that we were going to visit our uncle.</span> <span id="s456">You see, that was a great pull because we loved him and he lived in England.</span> <span id="s457">It was exciting, we were going to England, okay?</span> <span id="s458">So there was some element of excitement in it, and we didn't -- we thought we were going like on vacation somewhere.</span> <span id="s459">I mean, we didn't really fully grasp that this was the end, you know.</span> <span id="s460">I mean, how could you?</span> <span id="s461">How much of it do you want to know now, about our leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: I want to check the tape.</span> <span id="s463">How much time do we have left?</span> <span id="s464">Videographer: Eight minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Yeah, I'm trying to get a sense of . . . A: It all passed very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of what your disposition was like as you were preparing to leave, and then we can continue on, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: If I could only remember all these things now.</span> <span id="s468">Q: Oh, you're doing pretty well.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: But I can't remember how I felt.</span> <span id="s470">I mean, obviously, we were excited, frightened, and we didn't -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s471">I don't know.</span> <span id="s472">Those last days are very, very mixed up because I can't really understand -- well, I don't exactly how we felt.</span> <span id="s473">All I know is that it was -- there was an element of all these feelings of fear, of excitement, and curiosity, and not feeling that one was escaping something.</span> <span id="s474">You know, because it wasn't there yet.</span> <span id="s475">I mean, I didn't think that anything would happen.</span> <span id="s476">I mean, how would I have known?</span> <span id="s477">It's very hard.</span> <span id="s478">Well, I can tell you the day that we left, but you want to start on it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: The morning that we were leaving we heard -- we heard my father cry for the first time.</span> <span id="s481">I've never heard my father cry.</span> <span id="s482">The tears -- now, it's going to difficult.</span> <span id="s483">Because it's one of the most difficult things that happened.</span> <span id="s484">See, I've never heard -- we were all packed to go, and suddenly we heard this noise coming from another room.</span> <span id="s485">And we looked at each other in horror because my father was weeping loud.</span> <span id="s486">And that was everybody that was sleeping.</span> <span id="s487">That's when we realized how awful it's going to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">This is difficult now.</span> <span id="s489">So what do I hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Take your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: So he pulled that we got on the train and traveled with my mother and my father and the three of us with all our suitcases to Bratislava, which is the capitol of Slovakia.</span> <span id="s492">That's where the train started.</span> <span id="s493">And now, again, I don't remember whether we spent the night there or whether we just went to the station.</span> <span id="s494">I know we went shopping still.</span> <span id="s495">That much, I mean, I have to go back about this shopping business.</span> <span id="s496">We went shopping because my father had decided to buy us each a blanket which I still have, and he bought me a ring.</span> <span id="s497">And then we went to the station.</span> <span id="s498">And we got to the station, there was a terrific commotion.</span> <span id="s499">There was a train on the platform, and there were hundreds of children, but I don't remember exactly -- now, Mr. Winton (ph) will be able to say that now.</span> <span id="s500">In fact, when I see him next week, I will ask him how many were there on the train.</span> <span id="s501">I thought there were 500.</span> <span id="s502">But, and I always thought we were the last train that left because we left at the end of June.</span> <span id="s503">But apparently there was another train later.</span> <span id="s504">In any case, we got to the station.</span> <span id="s505">There were hundreds of people, parents and children, little babies.</span> <span id="s506">And we were put on a train.</span> <span id="s507">My mother couldn't decide whether to keep the little one, my younger sister, so she put her on the train; she took her off.</span> <span id="s508">She put her on the train; she took her off again.</span> <span id="s509">And then she put her on the train at the last moment.</span> <span id="s510">We all waved goodbye and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: You were describing the train station.</span> <span id="s512">There were a lot of people there.</span> <span id="s513">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: A lot of people.</span> <span id="s515">Was the mood one of -- was it normal?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: No.</span> <span id="s517">That's how it was, it was very sad.</span> <span id="s518">Everyone was crying.</span> <span id="s519">The kids were crying.</span> <span id="s520">The parents were crying.</span> <span id="s521">The train pulled away, and we all waved goodbye.</span> <span id="s522">And this other -- well, another thing happened.</span> <span id="s523">My mother, we each had a gold chain and a gold bracelet and my mother said, "It's not a good idea to have this."</span> <span id="s524">My father may have said it.</span> <span id="s525">"Why don't you let us keep it for you?"</span> <span id="s526">And they took it off, and they said, "Don't travel with that.</span> <span id="s527">It's not a good idea to do it."</span> <span id="s528">So they took our little jewelry that we had which is very minor, possibly, I know that we each had a chain and maybe something else.</span> <span id="s529">I can't remember, but they decided to keep it for us and took it off.</span> <span id="s530">The moment the train pulled away, the people who were organizing the train asked whether we have any jewelry, and if we didn't, could we carry some for other children.</span> <span id="s531">And so my -- each of us was given a couple of bracelets to put under our sweater to carry for somebody else who had too much maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: I think I need to stop.</span> <span id="s533">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Are we okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Videographer: We have one minute left.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s537">Why don't we change the tape, so we don't . . . End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: One question about when you left the village . . . A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: . . . at Bratislava on the train.</span> <span id="s541">Was there a party?</span> <span id="s542">Did you say goodbye to your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s544">We went to see all the families and said goodbye.</span> <span id="s545">There may have been a party or two and all my girlfriends, because I left my very close friends behind.</span> <span id="s546">Hilda Lazera (ph) was one of them.</span> <span id="s547">Maria Berteria (ph) was another one.</span> <span id="s548">She was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s549">And we went to say goodbye to everybody, yes.</span> <span id="s550">And that was -- I don't have too clear a memory of that, though.</span> <span id="s551">Of course, my grandparents, and teachers, and synagogue, everywhere.</span> <span id="s552">We were the only ones leaving the village.</span> <span id="s553">In all that, people -- many people thought my parents were completely mad to send us away, and I'm sure that they had great doubts and they worried about it, whether they were doing the right thing.</span> <span id="s554">I'm sure.</span> <span id="s555">But I have a consolation about that because my father in one of the letters which I have has written at one point "I'm so glad you're not here."</span> <span id="s556">So I know that they felt -- I mean, that it was -- especially when the young girls were being taken away, I think that he suddenly realized -- not suddenly, I think that he wrote to us saying, "I'm so glad you're not here," although they must have been absolutely petrified about what was going on in London, because there was the propaganda about the air raids.</span> <span id="s557">We lived through the Blitz, London Blitz in London, okay?</span> <span id="s558">So they must have been very fearful what was happening, but it was better to be in England with the bombs than to be in Czechoslovakia with all the disasters that were going on, okay?</span> <span id="s559">Did you want me to tell you about our leaving?</span> <span id="s560">Okay.</span> <span id="s561">So we got on the train.</span> <span id="s562">Of course, it was very, very emotional about all those children were in the same boat.</span> <span id="s563">And there was another little girl that joined us.</span> <span id="s564">Her name was Eva Rothberger (ph).</span> <span id="s565">She was also 10 years old.</span> <span id="s566">My sister -- by the way, my older sister was 15.</span> <span id="s567">I was just then 14, and my younger sister was 10.</span> <span id="s568">Another little girl joined us, the daughter of a friend of my uncle's.</span> <span id="s569">Her name was Eva Rothberger (ph), and she came with us, so there were four of us.</span> <span id="s570">And there were lots of children in the compartment, and they were frightened, excited.</span> <span id="s571">And so other kids in the same boat, so I suppose we didn't know what to expect, but what our father told us that we were going to go through Holland and that because it was Friday night, we would get off the train and spend the summer in Amsterdam or The Hague, I'm not sure where we went through, but I think it's in Holland.</span> <span id="s572">And so we were quite excited about that, but when we arrived in Holland on Friday evening, we were told that the Dutch authorities didn't want us to get off the train.</span> <span id="s573">I think they were afraid of too many refugees being dropped off on the border in Holland.</span> <span id="s574">So they decided that they were not to get off the train.</span> <span id="s575">So instead, lots of people came to the railway station with hot chocolate and bars of chocolate and cookies and they handed these things over to us through windows in the train.</span> <span id="s576">And I was very, very grateful about that.</span> <span id="s577">I thought it was very kind, although I was very disappointed and felt terrible that they didn't want us.</span> <span id="s578">That the Dutch authorities didn't want us to get off, I couldn't -- I mean, that was very painful for me to think that these people didn't want us.</span> <span id="s579">And I couldn't understand it, but then I was very happy that these people came and I was grateful to see these people at the train doing something for us.</span> <span id="s580">So I guess I consoled myself with that.</span> <span id="s581">Now, we crossed the -- we were very frightened when we came to Germany, because there was an inspection.</span> <span id="s582">The German uniformed soldiers came on the train, all of the -- and they inspected our luggage.</span> <span id="s583">And we were frightened, and, of course, once we left Germany, we were all thrilled and cheered like crazy.</span> <span id="s584">We were thrilled to be out of Germany and said, "Now, we are -- okay, we are safe."</span> <span id="s585">And then we got on a boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: I want you to tell me more about the train ride.</span> <span id="s587">What you were doing, were you playing games?</span> <span id="s588">Did you get to know -- who were all of these other kids?</span> <span id="s589">Did you make any stops along the way?</span> <span id="s590">Were there guards on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: The people who accompanied us were young people, mostly.</span> <span id="s592">As far as I remember, they were young volunteers like probably people in their 20s.</span> <span id="s593">And they were from Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s594">I'm not sure who they were, but they just accompanied the transport.</span> <span id="s595">They were to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: They were Czech?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: They were Czech, yes.</span> <span id="s598">As far as I know, but Mr. Winter, again, I will ask him that, because he will know.</span> <span id="s599">And I don't know, but I know there were people who were specially, you know, assigned to accompany this train.</span> <span id="s600">And as far as I know, they were to come back.</span> <span id="s601">They did not have the permits to stay in England.</span> <span id="s602">So whatever did we do on the train?</span> <span id="s603">I don't -- we didn't do very much, I think.</span> <span id="s604">We were just -- we may have played a game or two.</span> <span id="s605">I don't have a clear recollection of the ride itself.</span> <span id="s606">I only remember of the train, I remember the fact that somebody asked us to carry jewels, jewelry.</span> <span id="s607">And I think mostly my younger sister, my little sister was 10 years old, was given some jewelry to put on her arms.</span> <span id="s608">And there were three of us, so we were together.</span> <span id="s609">Whereas, there were many children who were by themselves.</span> <span id="s610">So we felt fortunate in that, that at least we have each other.</span> <span id="s611">It was very important, because little Eva came by herself.</span> <span id="s612">She was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s613">And there were lots of other children, some of them were crying, obviously.</span> <span id="s614">And we tried to be brave, that's all I can tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Did you -- was it crowded?</span> <span id="s616">Did you sleep?</span> <span id="s617">Did you look out the window?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s619">No, that's right.</span> <span id="s620">I looked out of the window, I remember that.</span> <span id="s621">I was going to mention that.</span> <span id="s622">I did look out of the window, and I tried to do the best I could.</span> <span id="s623">I mean, we -- I don't know what my sister felt, and I don't know what my little sister -- my little sister was absolutely petrified, obviously.</span> <span id="s624">She was very, very attached to her mother, and her mother was very attached to her.</span> <span id="s625">She was attached to all three of us, but the baby was a baby, after all.</span> <span id="s626">And don't forget that although we were 15 and 14 and 10, I could never find an equivalent age.</span> <span id="s627">I mean, we were much younger than that compared to the children -- my children at that age, okay?</span> <span id="s628">When my children were about -- when I had children, I could never find -- I was always looking to see their equivalent age that my children and I was at the age of 13.</span> <span id="s629">And I felt that my children at the age of eight were more grown up and more sophisticated than I was at the age of 14, because it was a different world.</span> <span id="s630">It was all completely different, and they were brought up quite differently.</span> <span id="s631">So I don't know why, I tried to make the best of it.</span> <span id="s632">I thought of the things that we were going to do, and so, and see my uncle.</span> <span id="s633">And I never for one moment imagined that we would not come back to home, so I don't know.</span> <span id="s634">And, of course, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s635">I must have been terribly afraid, but I just didn't let myself feel it.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Did you see anything special when you were looking out the window?</span> <span id="s637">A: Just the country going by.</span> <span id="s638">Being -- being glad to be out of Germany.</span> <span id="s639">Q: Maybe getting further away from home?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: No, I didn't think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Were there any rules?</span> <span id="s642">Did the people who were in charge of this train tell you anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I don't remember anything about the train except Holland, and I remember the boat.</span> <span id="s644">Q: Tell me about the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: When we boarded the boat, it was dark -- it was night.</span> <span id="s646">And there was -- people were sick, and they were given tea which was the worst thing I ever tasted in my life.</span> <span id="s647">It was English tea with milk in it.</span> <span id="s648">It was very dark, and it was the worst possible thing I could have ever tasted.</span> <span id="s649">I thought that was very, very -- there were matrons on the boat.</span> <span id="s650">Some matrons, I don't know who they were.</span> <span id="s651">Nurses.</span> <span id="s652">And we arrived, I don't remember much about the boat either.</span> <span id="s653">It was night.</span> <span id="s654">I think we tried to sleep.</span> <span id="s655">I wish I could remember more about it.</span> <span id="s656">My younger sister, who died last year, unfortunately, might have better memory of it.</span> <span id="s657">My older sister doesn't remember anything.</span> <span id="s658">I tried to ask her, which she was here not long ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Had you ever been on a boat like that before?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Never.</span> <span id="s661">I've never been that far away from home.</span> <span id="s662">I've never been on a boat like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">And I think people were sick because it was a channel crossing, and it must have been -- I remember, maybe I was sick, too, and I can't recall it.</span> <span id="s664">It must have been awful.</span> <span id="s665">But when we arrived in England, which was very, very exciting -- again, it was just the -- all I remember is this hundreds of children with tags with the numbers in front.</span> <span id="s666">And a loud speaker, people were picking up the kids that were being assigned to them.</span> <span id="s667">It was enormous commotion and I was -- and our name was not called for the longest time.</span> <span id="s668">And we waited and waited for a long time, and finally our name was called.</span> <span id="s669">And there was our uncle picking us up.</span> <span id="s670">And he came with my guardian because we each, in order to get us to England, he had to get a guardian for each of us.</span> <span id="s671">And that meant that he needed a signature for each of us, I think that's the way it worked.</span> <span id="s672">But each child had to have a guarantor, and my uncle got guardians for all three of us.</span> <span id="s673">My older sister, Josie, and my younger sister, Ellie's, guardian was Marin Marais (ph), who was a pianist, a famous pianist.</span> <span id="s674">And my guardian was Ms.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Fannie Bandit (ph), who was a violinist.</span> <span id="s676">My uncle came to the station to pick us up with Fannie Bandit, my guardian, who was a spinster, very well-to-do.</span> <span id="s677">And she came to actually to meet us at the station, and my uncle said, "Now, we are going to drive to where you are going to live in Burgess Hill.</span> <span id="s678">It's a children's home."</span> <span id="s679">And we were absolutely shocked about that because we thought we were going to stay with my uncle.</span> <span id="s680">I didn't know we were going to a children's home.</span> <span id="s681">And I'm not sure, I don't know.</span> <span id="s682">Well, of course, my uncle -- it was bad.</span> <span id="s683">I understood why it happened, but my older sister was very, very upset with my uncle because she thought that he should take my little sister, who was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s684">But my uncle was in a very precarious position because he was just newly married, and he had a baby, and they had a small flat in London.</span> <span id="s685">And I think his wife was not inclined to take a child, although she says -- and she's very close to us -- I mean, wherever it was.</span> <span id="s686">She says that she participated, that she was the one who did most of the work to get us out of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s687">But she was not the sort of person who wanted to take a child.</span> <span id="s688">I mean, she just -- I don't know how that happened.</span> <span id="s689">But anyway, the three of us went to this home in Sussex.</span> <span id="s690">It was called Wyberley, W-y-b-e-r-l-e-y.</span> <span id="s691">It used to be a convalescent home for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s692">It was in Burgess Hill, Sussex.</span> <span id="s693">It was in beautiful grounds, a lovely place, lovely home.</span> <span id="s694">And they built sort of an addition in the back of this huge home where we were being housed, the children were being housed.</span> <span id="s695">When we arrived, I can't tell you how it was very painful that my uncle took us there.</span> <span id="s696">You know, very painful.</span> <span id="s697">And it was such a trauma that I don't remember whether we even went to see his home in London first.</span> <span id="s698">Whether we went to visit our aunt, but we may have gone to visit the aunt and the baby.</span> <span id="s699">Because that's another thing why we looked forward to going to England; he had a baby and we had a new cousin only about a year old.</span> <span id="s700">His name was Steven, and we wanted to see him very much because my mother was always talking to us about this new baby that we have.</span> <span id="s701">So we were very anxious to see him.</span> <span id="s702">Whether or not we went to see him before we went to this home, I don't know anymore.</span> <span id="s703">But what I think is we drove -- the reason my guardian came to the station, because she had a car and my uncle did not have a car.</span> <span id="s704">And so she was able to drive us to Sussex.</span> <span id="s705">When we arrived in this home, we were absolutely stunned again.</span> <span id="s706">So absolutely shocked because everybody in the home was from Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s707">There were no Czech children there at all except us.</span> <span id="s708">And we were extremely Czech -- we were so patriotic, and we wanted to be with Czech children.</span> <span id="s709">We didn't want to be with -- even though we were Jewish refugees, also.</span> <span id="s710">There were about 50 children in the home, and they were all from Germany, from Berlin, from all over German, and from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: All Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s713">They were all Jewish children there.</span> <span id="s714">It was a home which had a matron and lots of nurses.</span> <span id="s715">It's very elegant as far as I was concerned, I couldn't get over all the beautiful elegance of the home.</span> <span id="s716">It had a tennis court, and it had beautiful green lawns, and huge living room.</span> <span id="s717">Beautifully, everything -- the floors were shiny as can be, and all the staff that looked after us, dining room which was beautiful.</span> <span id="s718">Places were set for breakfast just in the best style you can imagine, and next to each setting there was a banana or piece of fruit for breakfast and cereal.</span> <span id="s719">I mean, I had never seen things like that in my village.</span> <span id="s720">We never had things like that.</span> <span id="s721">So there were very exciting things, but it was a terrific letdown.</span> <span id="s722">I have a diary which I wrote my, what a shock it was for us to come into a home where everybody spoke German and English.</span> <span id="s723">And we didn't speak a word of English, and we didn't speak much German either.</span> <span id="s724">We didn't speak any German, in fact.</span> <span id="s725">And suddenly we were placed in this thing, and they thought we were little hicks because they were all from big cities.</span> <span id="s726">So that was a big shock to us, but we adjusted quickly.</span> <span id="s727">We adjusted very quickly to the home, and my uncle came the first holiday to come and get us.</span> <span id="s728">And we spent a week with him at Christmastime and a week one other holiday, so we did travel to London to spend time with him.</span> <span id="s729">But my older sister has never forgiven his wife for not taking my younger sister because my younger sister later had lots of difficulties because we had to, you know, we only stayed in the home for a short period of time.</span> <span id="s730">About a year and a half.</span> <span id="s731">Because when war broke out, that area became restricted and we had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Did they teach you in this home, a school?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Oh, yes, there was a school.</span> <span id="s734">We learned English.</span> <span id="s735">We had all kinds of nice things in the home.</span> <span id="s736">I mean, the home was good.</span> <span id="s737">We had a matron and everything was done very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Did you observe Jewish holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s740">Uh-huh, we did.</span> <span id="s741">That's one thing, when we went to visit my uncle for a holiday in my diary, which I decided to read recently, I have a notation that we went to see my uncle and it was during a Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s742">And we were so shocked to find that we went to a movie, and it was a Jewish holiday and we were really glad to get back to the home because we were able to observe the second night of Shabbat.</span> <span id="s743">Because my uncle, we did nothing at my uncle's house, and we were glad to get home to Wyberley, to our home, because at least there we celebrated the holiday.</span> <span id="s744">So, you see, my -- so we did.</span> <span id="s745">Played tennis.</span> <span id="s746">We learned to play tennis.</span> <span id="s747">We went to school.</span> <span id="s748">We learned all kinds of things there, yes.</span> <span id="s749">Very good.</span> <span id="s750">But, of course, it was still a very lonely place for many of us.</span> <span id="s751">We shared -- we lived in a room, I think there were nine of us in one room.</span> <span id="s752">I have a drawing of the room where we stayed because we didn't stay in the main house.</span> <span id="s753">We -- as I said earlier, there was an addition built to the house, a temporary addition, to house the children.</span> <span id="s754">So we all lived in the back of the house, which was a temporary thing, and we shared -- I mean, there were nine in our room.</span> <span id="s755">There were nine children.</span> <span id="s756">And we had all kinds of things that were being done for us, all kinds of tutoring.</span> <span id="s757">And my older sister had to help in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s758">And eventually, I -- there were big girls and little girls.</span> <span id="s759">The little girls were like my little sister, and the big girls were like my older sister, 15 and 16.</span> <span id="s760">And the big girls had to look after -- each big girl had a little girl to look after like combing hair and doing things for her.</span> <span id="s761">And going to school, where all the big girl had to take care of the little girl, going to school and coming back from school.</span> <span id="s762">So we were taken care of quite well.</span> <span id="s763">And my uncle, we were in touch with him a lot, and we had pocket money, six pence a week for which had to buy stamps.</span> <span id="s764">We had mail from our parents because my parents found a way to communicate with us via Hungary, before Hungary -- because Hungary was not in the war.</span> <span id="s765">And through the United States, my father had a brother in St. Louis, America, and a sister -- I think it was stepbrother and stepsister in Vermont.</span> <span id="s766">And my mother got in touch with those families and wrote them and asked would -- if they would take us.</span> <span id="s767">So my uncle in St. Louis whom I've never met immediately started to proceed to try to get us over to the States.</span> <span id="s768">And I have letters and affidavits which they immediately started to do, but it was too late because, first of all, we didn't even want to go.</span> <span id="s769">The three of us didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s770">We wanted to stay in England because we didn't want to go that far away from home.</span> <span id="s771">But my other uncle would -- did everything he could to try to get us over, and he would send us letters and in the letter, he would sometimes send us a dollar or two dollars.</span> <span id="s772">And it was thrilling because we had so little money that we were always thrilled when we got a dollar, which was then five shillings, I think.</span> <span id="s773">I think so.</span> <span id="s774">In any case, we didn't really want to go away from England.</span> <span id="s775">We wanted to stay together and go home.</span> <span id="s776">That was our thought, but we were so relieved when we didn't have to go to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">But my uncle wrote in this letter saying that they have enough resources to take care of all three of us.</span> <span id="s778">Well, we stayed . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: What were your parents saying in their letters?</span> <span id="s780">It must have been great to get their mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Oh, in the letters, my parents.</span> <span id="s782">Well, we wrote a lot.</span> <span id="s783">They sent us packages, too.</span> <span id="s784">And we wrote a lot of letters, also.</span> <span id="s785">And they were very, very grateful because -- and they were always in -- well, I haven't read my parents' letters.</span> <span id="s786">I have about, maybe, 30, 40 letters; I haven't read them because it's too painful to read my mother's letters.</span> <span id="s787">But I am going to read them, and I'm going to translate them because -- not only for myself, but for my children and for whoever might want to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: But at the time, do you have sort of a vague recollection of what they wrote about?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s790">They wrote -- unfortunately, I wish they would have written exactly what was going on, but they wouldn't, of course.</span> <span id="s791">Why would they tell the children painful things?</span> <span id="s792">But it must have been very, very difficult for them already in the village.</span> <span id="s793">And it must have been -- and they wrote a little bit about my grandfather who obviously was having a terrible time because he had to leave his house.</span> <span id="s794">His house was taken over by somebody.</span> <span id="s795">And they put him into some kind of a room somewhere where he had no window.</span> <span id="s796">Because my mother wrote saying that it must be very hard for her father to be living without a window, so I don't know where they had put him.</span> <span id="s797">And they wrote us things like sent us recipes because we said be sure to send us a recipe about this and that.</span> <span id="s798">And then we would write them to say what we were doing, what we're learning, and what we were sewing, and what we were crocheting, and what we were knitting.</span> <span id="s799">And we would describe in great detail what we got for our birthdays and what -- we just gave them the most enthusiastic reports about our life in the home.</span> <span id="s800">And they were just thrilled about getting the letters, of course, and they would say how grateful they were that we were such good children and that we were telling them, that we were writing to them so regularly.</span> <span id="s801">Because that's the only thing, of course, that they had that was joyful.</span> <span id="s802">And they sent us -- I remember my mother sent us packages of knitted things, sweaters, and cookies probably.</span> <span id="s803">Whatever she could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Were you homesick?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Oh, terribly homesick.</span> <span id="s806">Many of the children in the home were very fortunate because they were just there temporarily until their parents got out.</span> <span id="s807">Those were the worst times in our lives when other children's parents came to get them.</span> <span id="s808">Because we felt terribly envious, I should say, but at the same time, we were too ashamed not to be happy for the child, okay?</span> <span id="s809">Because you had to be happy for the child.</span> <span id="s810">But, on the other hand, you knew that you never, your parents are never going to come out because the war had started and it was -- and it was just completely -- well, completely hopeless.</span> <span id="s811">We could have done -- I always wonder whether we could have done something to get them out, but we didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s812">Because, first of all, it was July and August, two months, and the war broke out in September.</span> <span id="s813">So after that, it was over; you couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s814">So we only would have had two months to do something in.</span> <span id="s815">Then my mother wrote to say that my grandmother came to stay with them from Poland, and so that they couldn't leave anymore.</span> <span id="s816">And I feel my parents were -- my father was very enterprising.</span> <span id="s817">My mother was a very bright, intelligent woman, and they would have certainly tried to escape.</span> <span id="s818">My father always wanted to leave long before we left.</span> <span id="s819">He wanted to go to Palestine, but my mother wouldn't go.</span> <span id="s820">He wanted to, he would have gone long ago.</span> <span id="s821">He was a great Zionist, he would definitely left long ago if my mother -- but my mother would not leave.</span> <span id="s822">Because my mother's family has been in the village for many generations, and my mother was very, very assimilated into the community.</span> <span id="s823">So she would not, she didn't want to leave to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s824">But my father may have tried.</span> <span id="s825">Well, he would have gone.</span> <span id="s826">Where would he have gone?</span> <span id="s827">If he had escaped, he would have probably gone into Poland, which was going to be the end, the worst end.</span> <span id="s828">Or maybe they might have continued on to Hungary, I don't know where they would have gone.</span> <span id="s829">But my uncle -- I know that my husband's aunt, who came to England, got everybody out from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Certain people, because she went around -- but she was much older.</span> <span id="s831">She was in her 30s late, and she went around and she got signatures for all her family.</span> <span id="s832">Now, we were too little to do this.</span> <span id="s833">Now, if I reproach myself about anything at all, it is because I felt if we had been a little older we might have been able to get my parents out.</span> <span id="s834">But who know?</span> <span id="s835">I don't know.</span> <span id="s836">In any case, so they wrote us these -- my mother wrote these long letters.</span> <span id="s837">I said to her in my letter "We're off the road."</span> <span id="s838">And I have a couple of those letters because when I went back to Czechoslovakia and I was given that book, a book with some photographs, among those things were two of our letters, which I was just amazed how well we wrote.</span> <span id="s839">And, well, when . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: You mentioned that you kept a diary.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s842">I kept a diary while I was at this home.</span> <span id="s843">Q: What kind . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Which is very good.</span> <span id="s845">I'm sorry now that I didn't keep it more carefully, but I kept it for about until about 1941, when I stopped.</span> <span id="s846">Because in 1941, we had to leave the home.</span> <span id="s847">Suddenly -- you see, this area was near the coast, and besides the money -- whoever supported this home, whichever organization supported which could have been American.</span> <span id="s848">I think American and British, I don't know who did.</span> <span id="s849">I don't know where the money came from actually.</span> <span id="s850">That stopped and also that area was restricted and everybody had to leave.</span> <span id="s851">So we had to be -- this is where the problems started.</span> <span id="s852">We had to be sent somewhere, and that became a great, big problem because where to send the children.</span> <span id="s853">What to, you know -- oh, I have to go back to when I told you about parents coming to get the children, it was very, very painful.</span> <span id="s854">The other thing which was extremely for me, but I'm a great -- I'm able to sort of push it aside and look at the more positive things and to survive.</span> <span id="s855">I'm a survivor, I suppose.</span> <span id="s856">When I went to the village and I saw parents walking with their children hand in hand, that broke my heart.</span> <span id="s857">I used to be terribly upset about that because I felt -- that's when I felt the worst.</span> <span id="s858">You know, but, otherwise, you look forward in the letters.</span> <span id="s859">I mean, that's about it, and the home.</span> <span id="s860">Then we had to worry about what to do because everybody had to leave.</span> <span id="s861">And my little sister -- the older children had to leave first.</span> <span id="s862">And that's it began to dawn on us.</span> <span id="s863">Of course, there were air raids.</span> <span id="s864">While we lived already in the home still, air raids started.</span> <span id="s865">But we were -- well, we had to be sort of split up because my older sister was sent to London, and she went to work.</span> <span id="s866">There was a young women's home run by a Jewish refugee woman.</span> <span id="s867">She had an ordinary house in which she had housed, maybe she had 10 or 12, 20 girls who lived there.</span> <span id="s868">It was a house that was a hostel.</span> <span id="s869">And she provided breakfast and dinner, and she also ran something called the British Restaurant, where she cooked where you could buy cheap meals.</span> <span id="s870">But I think she just ran the hostel; it was in Hampstead somewhere.</span> <span id="s871">So my sister was sent to London, and she went to that home.</span> <span id="s872">And she -- but she had to be self-supporting, so she went to work in a dressmaker shop.</span> <span id="s873">And she was -- then whatever she earned, she paid in that home to live there.</span> <span id="s874">My younger sister was sent to some families not far from the home where we were at.</span> <span id="s875">And she lived with some Quaker families, and she was very, very unhappy about having to be split up from us.</span> <span id="s876">She was very heartbroken about that because she just didn't want to leave us, but there was no choice.</span> <span id="s877">This is where my older sister blamed my uncle, that he should have taken her.</span> <span id="s878">But by this time, my uncle has lost his -- there was no job because the representation from Czechoslovakia when the war broke out, that was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">There was no more income, and he was not qualified to do -- he was an engineer, chemical engineer, but he had no job.</span> <span id="s880">The war started, and he didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s881">At that point, he couldn't have taken her.</span> <span id="s882">Or maybe he could have, and they could have done the best they could with the little they had, but they just didn't take her.</span> <span id="s883">And that, at this point, it is that my sister blames them because she felt they should have taken my little sister.</span> <span id="s884">Now, my little sister, even though my older sister and my little sister had this guardian, Myra Hess (ph), who I think paid the money that was only a cash transaction, I think she guaranteed for 70 children, you see.</span> <span id="s885">She didn't have anything personally, she drove a -- so my little sister had a hard time because I don't know what kind of family she stayed with, but she was moved around a great deal from family to family.</span> <span id="s886">And she told me that on Friday afternoons in school, they would say, "Who is going to take Ellie?</span> <span id="s887">Who can take Ellie for maybe next week or next holiday?"</span> <span id="s888">or whatever.</span> <span id="s889">And she just remembers that mainly that people would ask who will take her.</span> <span id="s890">But then she had some positive things about staying with those families because she did have it regular.</span> <span id="s891">She went to school through the entire system.</span> <span id="s892">She matriculated and she did everything that any English child does.</span> <span id="s893">She did have that privilege.</span> <span id="s894">She went through the entire system of school.</span> <span id="s895">Now, with me it was a different story.</span> <span id="s896">When I came to London and there was guardian, Fannie Bandit, who was just -- she was wonderful in one respect.</span> <span id="s897">She just loved having this child, me.</span> <span id="s898">But she didn't want me to live with -- I mean, there was no question of my living with her.</span> <span id="s899">Although she lived in a very elegant apartment on Penchley (ph) Road, and she had a housekeeper and I used to go to -- I was invited for lunches and whatever, and it was splendidly elegant.</span> <span id="s900">I can't tell you how beautiful and elegant it was because she was a grand lady.</span> <span id="s901">And she -- I mean, when I was invited for lunch, everything was set up just as if it was an important visitor had come, you know.</span> <span id="s902">I mean, the crystal and the silver and the dishes, and we would go to the dining room and then the housekeeper would come and serve the meal from the left.</span> <span id="s903">And we had to help our -- I mean, I learned all my good manners at my guardian's and she had this beautiful bathroom with a toilet that flushed.</span> <span id="s904">And she had all these lovely things and I just loved being with her, but there was no question of her taking me, you know.</span> <span id="s905">But when this home broke up in England, in Wyberley, Burgess Hill, my uncle went, this guardian with me and said, "Look, she can no longer stay in the home.</span> <span id="s906">You could do something."</span> <span id="s907">And I sat in the next room, and they argued and she said, "But you promised me that you only needed a signature from me.</span> <span id="s908">You told me that I wouldn't have to do anything."</span> <span id="s909">And he said, "Yes, but I didn't know there was going to be a war, and this thing fell apart.</span> <span id="s910">The home is no longer there.</span> <span id="s911">Somebody's got to take care of her."</span> <span id="s912">And she said, "But you promised."</span> <span id="s913">And, you know, she just didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s914">And so I sat there absolutely stricken with fear, and I hated that they argued about me like this.</span> <span id="s915">And so I said to myself will they be able to come and ask me what I'm going to do, what I want to do.</span> <span id="s916">And so I will have to tell them quickly, and what can I do that I could earn my living?</span> <span id="s917">Because my sister was already earning her own living, and I didn't have any skills.</span> <span id="s918">So I said to myself I will say that I can wash hair because that doesn't require any skills.</span> <span id="s919">So when they came out and she said to me "Well, what do you want to do?</span> <span id="s920">What do you want to do?"</span> <span id="s921">And I said, "I can be a hairdresser; I can wash hair."</span> <span id="s922">And she said no, or my uncle said no.</span> <span id="s923">In any case, they came to some arrangement where he begged her to send me to school.</span> <span id="s924">And she said, okay, she would do that.</span> <span id="s925">She finally agreed to it after a long argument, and she said, okay.</span> <span id="s926">they agreed that he would go to Bexley (ph) College to talk to them to see whether they would take me.</span> <span id="s927">Because I didn't speak English really.</span> <span id="s928">And she said, "Okay, I will pay for the school."</span> <span id="s929">And my uncle said, "She can stay with me.</span> <span id="s930">I'll put her up until she learns to short and type."</span> <span id="s931">And so my uncle whose wife had been evacuated with the baby to the country, lived in an apartment by himself.</span> <span id="s932">And he said he would be able to take me until I'm out of -- as long as I'm in school.</span> <span id="s933">So my guardian said, okay, she will pay for the school, and as far as I remember, she said she would pay him maintenance for me.</span> <span id="s934">And she would give me five shillings pocket money a week.</span> <span id="s935">And so my uncle went to the headmaster of Bexley (ph) College, and begged him to take me because the headmaster said, "I can't take her to , she doesn't speak English."</span> <span id="s936">And he begged him, he said, "You must give her a try because this is her only chance, because this lady is willing to pay for her education."</span> <span id="s937">So the headmaster said, "Okay, I'll try it."</span> <span id="s938">And, of course, I felt absolutely obligated to try to get out of there as fast as possible.</span> <span id="s939">It was a two- or three-year college.</span> <span id="s940">I was out of there in 10 months, and I got a job.</span> <span id="s941">And then I had to move from my uncle's to the same home that my older sister lived in that girl's home.</span> <span id="s942">And I went -- the headmaster complained to my uncle that I was not socializing with other children.</span> <span id="s943">When I -- during recess, I was always sitting at my desk working.</span> <span id="s944">I had to because I could learn children only phonetically because I don't understand the words they were saying, you see.</span> <span id="s945">But he kept me, and I graduated in 10 months with -- I would have preferred to stay there longer because my skills would have been better, but I was able to type and I was able to take shorthand, even though I didn't understand what I was taking.</span> <span id="s946">And when I got my first job at the book shop in England, near St. Paul's, I earned I think one pound five shillings a week and -- two pounds, five shillings.</span> <span id="s947">And with that money, I immediately got into the hostel where my sister was, and I paid all my money there, to live there.</span> <span id="s948">And that was the extent of my education.</span> <span id="s949">From there -- my guardian was always looked after me.</span> <span id="s950">I mean, she was good to me.</span> <span id="s951">She always invited me out.</span> <span id="s952">Oh, when she finally argued and decided to send me to school to show him that she is not ungenerous, she took me out and bought me a coat and a few things.</span> <span id="s953">And she gave me this pocket money every week, and she would invite me very often.</span> <span id="s954">I believe she loved me and I loved her, but that's all she could do.</span> <span id="s955">You know, she just didn't know how to do anything else.</span> <span id="s956">And she would invite me to spend weekends with her sometimes, and she had a huge family in London.</span> <span id="s957">And none of them every thought of including me in anything.</span> <span id="s958">They had children my age or younger, but this was a Jewish family in London and they did not want me in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: What did you make of this at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Felt very -- I felt it was unkind.</span> <span id="s961">Unkind.</span> <span id="s962">I felt -- they had birthday parties going for little children, for children -- I was never included in anything.</span> <span id="s963">They didn't -- but now when I go to London, they try to make a big fuss of us.</span> <span id="s964">But in those days, they didn't think of doing anything.</span> <span id="s965">But it destroyed many Jewish families that they did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Could you accept your guardian's limits?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s968">Because she was truly loving and she -- oh, one thing I must mention in this.</span> <span id="s969">For as long as she lived afterwards whenever we saw each other, whenever she was in any company at all, she would tell the story that I wanted -- "she wanted to be a hairdresser, but I saved her from this."</span> <span id="s970">Well, I let her go on telling that story until towards the very end of her life when I was with nieces and nephews, all those fancy nieces and nephews, I mean, hew nephew had invited me to dinner one day when I was older and attractive and he was a young officer in the British Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">When he invited me to dinner, it would be at the Savoy Hotel.</span> <span id="s972">You know, the fanciest place in London.</span> <span id="s973">In any case, I told him when I saw them the last time, I said, "Your aunt always told you that I wanted to be a hairdresser.</span> <span id="s974">That was her story."</span> <span id="s975">And I told him the story that it wasn't because I wanted to be a hairdresser, but because I didn't want her to feel that she should be having to pay for me, because I needed to earn my own living.</span> <span id="s976">So that was the story about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: They didn't teach you English at the first home?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Yes, they did, but it was not sufficient to be able to take -- I mean, it was basic English.</span> <span id="s979">I mean, the first words in English that I learned, I needed to learn words that would take care of my sister, my little sister.</span> <span id="s980">Because my little sister was not very well.</span> <span id="s981">She was -- what do I say?</span> <span id="s982">Not sickly, not really sickly, but she was the baby at home, she was spoiled.</span> <span id="s983">And she was frail, that's the word.</span> <span id="s984">Frail.</span> <span id="s985">And I said I must learn to tell people that she is not well, but I didn't know how to say it.</span> <span id="s986">So I would learn -- the first thing I learned was to say, "My sister has a headache."</span> <span id="s987">Those were my first English words.</span> <span id="s988">"My sister has a headache."</span> <span id="s989">That's all I needed to know.</span> <span id="s990">And when we were dispersed from this home, I had saved 15 shillings.</span> <span id="s991">Do you know how much that is?</span> <span id="s992">15 shillings, it was about $3.</span> <span id="s993">And when we were dispersed, I gave her my $3 because I said I will be able to take care of myself, but she needed -- I wanted to do everything.</span> <span id="s994">You see, when she was born, I was very envious of the fact there was a baby in the family, and so I always had a sort of slight guilt feeling that I wanted to get her out of her crib, because she displaced me from parents' bedroom when I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s995">I used to sleep in the bedroom, but when she was born, I had to get out because the crib had to come in there.</span> <span id="s996">So I always resented that part, so I always felt that I had to make up for that.</span> <span id="s997">Because I felt if something happened, that was my fault, because of my bad thoughts, you see.</span> <span id="s998">So I would give up all the money, all the money I had so that she would -- because I needed to have the peace of mind that I've done everything for her.</span> <span id="s999">So I learned to say, "My sister has a headache."</span> <span id="s1000">And I gave her all my pocket money, so that the result of my parents' teaching, you see.</span> <span id="s1001">Because my mother always wrote in every letter "The main thing is that you should get along with each other, and you've got to love each other and you have to get along with each other."</span> <span id="s1002">And so I -- and another thing, whenever I did anything at all, it was always a question in my mind was is that what they would want me to do?</span> <span id="s1003">Okay.</span> <span id="s1004">So we all behaved better than we would have done had we lived with our parents, because we always lived by the standard that we want more than -- I mean, we were -- I, particularly, was totally exaggerated.</span> <span id="s1005">The only area where I didn't follow is in the religion.</span> <span id="s1006">I did not follow my father's footsteps because I thought I was so -- and to me this whole disaster was incomprehensible, so I did not -- that's one justice -- I feel I'm perfectly justified not to have followed that.</span> <span id="s1007">So, otherwise, we did everything what my mother -- you know, I did everything for my sisters afterwards because I, no matter what they did -- I mean, they always were good.</span> <span id="s1008">We were always good.</span> <span id="s1009">But I took it upon myself to be the -- I mean, I just did not argue about anything with them.</span> <span id="s1010">I just gave in.</span> <span id="s1011">I mean, I won't say that I was absolutely like that when I was a young girl.</span> <span id="s1012">My older sister was the one who took care of us.</span> <span id="s1013">I did go through her drawers and I borrowed her blouses, and I used -- and I made her do my mending for me and do all kinds of stuff, okay?</span> <span id="s1014">Oh, we had do our own mending and, you know, we had to darn our socks and darn our -- I mean, that's the kind of -- in the last year my mother taught us all these things, to do all these things before we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Well, it must have been tough when you left that home that you had to separate from your sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yeah, we all separated.</span> <span id="s1017">But my older sister was in London, so she was in that home.</span> <span id="s1018">And I was not too far from her.</span> <span id="s1019">I was with my uncle, and my uncle was -- we were very close.</span> <span id="s1020">I was very close to my uncle.</span> <span id="s1021">He was particularly attached to me, so . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: So you visited with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: My younger sister suffered greatly because she was away from us and she felt isolated, and also she felt that my older sister and I were very close and she was out of it.</span> <span id="s1024">But we tried to look after her as best we could, but she felt very -- for the rest of her life, she felt lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Did you -- so you saw your older sister regularly in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Yeah, I saw her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: And the other sister, did you visit her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Only when -- no, we never visited her.</span> <span id="s1029">During holidays, she would visit us.</span> <span id="s1030">And then she stayed there until she finished her school.</span> <span id="s1031">I think until she got her first job, as far as I -- my older sister and I then moved together to the YWCA, which was like a hostel.</span> <span id="s1032">It was like run my matron, and the meals were served there, breakfast and dinner.</span> <span id="s1033">And we stayed there five years until we had to leave because the maximum that you could stay there was five years.</span> <span id="s1034">So until we had to leave, we stayed there.</span> <span id="s1035">I worked for about a year for this book shop, where I earned the minimum, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Then I got a job with my guardian, had a friend who was some kind of chemical engineer.</span> <span id="s1037">And he did some effort work, and I transferred to work for him.</span> <span id="s1038">And then I got a wonderful job with the Czech Armament, as a bilingual secretary, and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: This was during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1041">I think I started working with them in 1943 or '44, and I stayed with them until I came here.</span> <span id="s1042">I came here with my job, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: When you worked with the Czech government, did you get a lot of information about what was going on in the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: I mean -- I didn't know what -- we didn't get any information as the result of working with the Czech Armament where I was, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Were you still getting letters from home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: No, 1942, March 1942 was the last letter from my mother.</span> <span id="s1047">And they were deported in June 1942 to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1048">And my grandmother -- and I don't know what happened to my grandfather and his wife.</span> <span id="s1049">My uncle wrote a little note to us, and he said he was deported to Poland, but I think he was killed in the village.</span> <span id="s1050">Because there is -- when we were visiting Czechoslovakia a few years later after the war, we went to this woods, where we used to go as children to pick wild strawberries and snowdrops, and there's a monument to people who had to dig their own graves.</span> <span id="s1051">And there's a mass grave in the woods.</span> <span id="s1052">And I didn't dare to ask the man who took us there who is buried in that mass grave, but I suspect my grandfather is buried in that mass grave.</span> <span id="s1053">But I just was too frightened to ask him.</span> <span id="s1054">I didn't want to -- I mean, I did and I didn't want to know, but I should have liked to know.</span> <span id="s1055">That's one thing I didn't investigate, what happened to my grandfather.</span> <span id="s1056">I know what happened to my parents and to my grandmother, but I don't know what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Did you feel safe in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: In which way?</span> <span id="s1059">You mean from Germany?</span> <span id="s1060">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Well, there was -- no, well, I didn't feel that there was any danger.</span> <span id="s1062">Few minutes left?</span> <span id="s1063">I didn't feel -- no, I didn't feel safe.</span> <span id="s1064">I mean, you know, we lived through the Blitz and I stayed in my room, always.</span> <span id="s1065">I never went to shelters.</span> <span id="s1066">I felt -- I don't know, I just felt whatever happens, happens.</span> <span id="s1067">So I just didn't want to go to shelters.</span> <span id="s1068">At the beginning when I stayed with my uncle, I went to shelters.</span> <span id="s1069">But later on, all through the war, I stayed in my room.</span> <span id="s1070">And we had gas masks and fire , but there were some, many people were afraid that would be an invasion of England.</span> <span id="s1071">And at the beginning of the war, it looked like there may be an invasion, but I was never -- I didn't, no, I was afraid for my parents, and I thought -- all the time I thought that my parents would be okay.</span> <span id="s1072">When I heard what was going on, and I didn't know -- I mean, who knew?</span> <span id="s1073">As soon as the war was over, my older sister went back home to find them.</span> <span id="s1074">I should have gone with her, but we didn't have the money.</span> <span id="s1075">And we didn't -- I guess we decided that one of us will go back to find out what happened.</span> <span id="s1076">When she went to village, it was -- before we left, by the way, I forgot to mention that our father showed us where he would put things, hide things for us in case something happened.</span> <span id="s1077">Because my sister went to look for it, and nothing was there.</span> <span id="s1078">And the house was certainly occupied by other people and there was nothing of our things, but my mother wrote to us to say who she gave things to.</span> <span id="s1079">She left things in different places for us with different families.</span> <span id="s1080">So my sister went from family to family to try to find something to get it back.</span> <span id="s1081">Nobody would return one item to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Before we continue, I think there are, just for the record, a couple of points we need to make about your transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1086">Well, I forgot to mention that we stopped in Prague.</span> <span id="s1087">The train originated in Bratislava, but we stopped in Prague to pick up the majority of the children.</span> <span id="s1088">That was very thrilling to see all those children at the station, and, of course, then we -- I think went to Harwich.</span> <span id="s1089">It landed in Harwich, but, as I said before, I have no recollection.</span> <span id="s1090">It was night, that's all I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: And when you got off the boat, where did you disembark?</span> <span id="s1092">A: I think in Victoria Station.</span> <span id="s1093">Oh, disembark from the boat?</span> <span id="s1094">Q: Where did you land?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Harwich, right.</span> <span id="s1096">And then we took a train to Victoria Station.</span> <span id="s1097">But that I would have to confirm because I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s1098">It was a huge station.</span> <span id="s1099">I always thought it was Victoria, but it may have been another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: When you were living in England, did you keep up contact with the kids from the transport or the kids from the schools or homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: The only contact we kept -- well, Eva's parents came.</span> <span id="s1102">Eva, the little girl who came with us, the 10-year-old, her parents came and got her, and they went to South America.</span> <span id="s1103">So we lost touch, but we did see each other recently.</span> <span id="s1104">And we kept in touch later, but during the war we lost touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: There were thousands of refugee children . . . A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: . . . in England at this time.</span> <span id="s1107">Did you run into each other?</span> <span id="s1108">Did you know who each other . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Oh, we kept in touch with the children from the home.</span> <span id="s1110">As many -- not everybody, of course, because they were dispersed all over the place.</span> <span id="s1111">Many of them went -- whose parents came and they went, some of them went to America.</span> <span id="s1112">And some of them went to other parts of England, but we kept in touch with quite a few of them.</span> <span id="s1113">In fact, we became sort of a little family.</span> <span id="s1114">I mean, we had each other.</span> <span id="s1115">And we belonged to different organizations.</span> <span id="s1116">We belonged to something called the Amateur Czechoslovakia, which was made up of Czech refugees.</span> <span id="s1117">And we -- there were Hungarian clubs and Czech clubs and Austrian clubs, and all these refugees from the home, we all got together and we had dances and we had all kinds of activities.</span> <span id="s1118">And we were very -- we had a great time; we had a good time.</span> <span id="s1119">Of course, we had fears.</span> <span id="s1120">We all had the same fears.</span> <span id="s1121">There were many children who were on their own.</span> <span id="s1122">I mean, we were so much better off than many of the kids because, first of all, we had each other.</span> <span id="s1123">There were three of us.</span> <span id="s1124">Although we were not together, we were as strong together.</span> <span id="s1125">We had each other in England, and then we had our uncle and then we had -- by this time, I had two little cousins, Steven and Jane, and my Aunt Lottie.</span> <span id="s1126">I mean, there were -- my aunt was an artist and very much interested in music.</span> <span id="s1127">They lived in the music and art world, and I was exposed to all that thing.</span> <span id="s1128">And it was marvelous, and I had my guardian who also was terrific, and I was very much influenced by all those people.</span> <span id="s1129">I took the best out of all this.</span> <span id="s1130">I mean, I really learned a great deal from them.</span> <span id="s1131">But we kept in touch with our friends from the home, children's home, and then we were mostly with our refugee friends, because very few people in England -- I mean, you were a refugee.</span> <span id="s1132">You were not included -- at least, we were not -- in any of the English life.</span> <span id="s1133">It was very amazing because it was such a very different land.</span> <span id="s1134">You know, when I came to America in 1948, I felt at home here immediately, where I had never really felt at home in England while I lived there.</span> <span id="s1135">I felt much more at home after I lived in America.</span> <span id="s1136">When I went back to England, I felt -- I had spent my youth, so I felt like it's a place I know very well.</span> <span id="s1137">But the people themselves, we had very little contact with English people really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: So you didn't make good friends among English kids really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1140">We were friends -- our main companions were other refugees.</span> <span id="s1141">We stayed with the refugees mostly, and we went to all the clubs that we went to and all the dances with mostly -- almost all of them were refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: What's so different about the lifestyle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: In England?</span> <span id="s1144">Totally different from my village, of course.</span> <span id="s1145">I missed our village enormously.</span> <span id="s1146">Of course, I always had this picture of it -- well, that's where I thought I would end up, I would want to go back.</span> <span id="s1147">I missed everything about the village, everything.</span> <span id="s1148">It's just amazing.</span> <span id="s1149">I could never -- nothing was the same.</span> <span id="s1150">I mean, I could compare always to it.</span> <span id="s1151">Well, there were other things, of course, you know.</span> <span id="s1152">I mean, other things.</span> <span id="s1153">But, I mean, to me what happened here is that I felt -- I missed those things I did as a child at home and the woods.</span> <span id="s1154">This was a big town, and London was a big city.</span> <span id="s1155">And everything was paved.</span> <span id="s1156">In my village, everything was, you know, nature.</span> <span id="s1157">So I thought -- I mean, I always compared, and I just longed to be back in the village.</span> <span id="s1158">That's all.</span> <span id="s1159">Although, I liked a lot certain aspects, of course, of being London.</span> <span id="s1160">I worried a great deal about my parents, and we hoped everything would be okay.</span> <span id="s1161">As I told you earlier, I thought my parents would survive because of my father being so popular.</span> <span id="s1162">But we didn't know anything, we didn't really know what was going on in Europe, and it's possible that we could have known more and that we just didn't want to face what was going on.</span> <span id="s1163">I don' t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Did you talk about home with your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1166">A great deal.</span> <span id="s1167">Yes.</span> <span id="s1168">We worried about our parents a lot, and, of course, there was no contact at all from March 1942 until after the war when my sister went back and found out that there was no one left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Did you have dreams?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: I'm sure I had dreams, and I kept the diary in my -- in the children's home mainly for the purpose of having it for my parents when I got home.</span> <span id="s1171">That was the idea of the diary.</span> <span id="s1172">I really didn't keep it for myself.</span> <span id="s1173">I wanted them to know everything we did and how we lived.</span> <span id="s1174">And then when war broke out and everything was -- we stopped correspondence, then I stopped keeping the diary.</span> <span id="s1175">And as I say it's very hard to accept.</span> <span id="s1176">I always thought I would go back home because I don't think it would have true in the end having lived in England during the war and all these years.</span> <span id="s1177">I don't know that I would ever have adjusted to life in the village again, but in my mind it was special.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: So you stayed in England.</span> <span id="s1179">You eventually developed a good career for yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1181">Well, I worked for the Czech government in exile until 1947, '48.</span> <span id="s1182">In 1947 I was assigned to work for the second annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, which was being held in London.</span> <span id="s1183">And I was assigned there to work there by someone who had worked in the Czech government in exile and who went back to Prague immediately after the war.</span> <span id="s1184">He was a high official at the ministry where I worked, and he was -- they all went back to Czechoslovakia as soon as the war ended.</span> <span id="s1185">These were big government officials, okay?</span> <span id="s1186">The lesser people like I stayed behind and the offices continued in London.</span> <span id="s1187">Now, this friend of mine who was quite a high official in the government who was in the ministry of finance in Prague, and he's the one who insisted that I go to work for the annual meeting for the International Monetary Fund.</span> <span id="s1188">Because this time I was an accomplished bilingual secretary and the delegation was coming from Washington and from Prague and they needed someone to work with them.</span> <span id="s1189">There were 15 members of the delegation.</span> <span id="s1190">I was very young and not very experienced, and I was terrified and I didn't want to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">But this man insisted.</span> <span id="s1192">He didn't get in touch with me, but called my supervisors and insisted that I be assigned to cover this conference.</span> <span id="s1193">And I didn't want to do it, and he insisted and finally I was made to do it.</span> <span id="s1194">And this is how I ended up in Washington because the people where I worked asked me whether I want to come to Washington with the International Monetary Fund, and this is how I ended up finally getting here.</span> <span id="s1195">I was offered the job in London, and I came with the fund.</span> <span id="s1196">It was very -- it worked beautifully because immediately after the annual meeting of the International Management Fund in London, I got a recall letter from Prague, because the Communists have taken over by this time or shortly after the annual meeting.</span> <span id="s1197">The Communists took over in March 1948 in Czechoslovakia, and immediately they recalled all of the people who were working for the Czech government.</span> <span id="s1198">And I was recalled to Prague, and I left my office in the morning to look for another job and that same day, I received a letter of appointment with the International Monetary Fund.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">So I accepted this job for a year, but I worked with them for 35 years.</span> <span id="s1200">So I came to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: You know, there is something that we didn't mention.</span> <span id="s1202">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Which was your knowledge when the war was over.</span> <span id="s1204">What you were feeling at that time, how did you learn the war was over, because that's a pretty important . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: I tried very hard to reconstruct that memory, but, you know, I can't.</span> <span id="s1206">You know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Because I think we were so terrified about will we find out, that I just don't remember exactly how I found out or where I was.</span> <span id="s1208">I don't remember anything about it.</span> <span id="s1209">I remember that the war was over everywhere, absolutely scared to find out what happened to the family.</span> <span id="s1210">But, of course, we immediately sent cables to Czechoslovakia to ask about our parents.</span> <span id="s1211">And we had responses, lots of responses from different -- because we sent cables to different people asking them to find, to see to our parents.</span> <span id="s1212">And we had responses to say that they were sent to Poland, Auschwitz in June 1942.</span> <span id="s1213">So the last letter that we have from my parents is dated March 1942, and three months later, they were sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1214">So at that point, we decided that my sister would go back to Czechoslovakia to go to the village.</span> <span id="s1215">I was too petrified to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: So you knew that the war was kind of a mixed . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Yes, it was very scary; it was very frightening because, first of all, we didn't know what we'll find.</span> <span id="s1218">And then by this time, we didn't know where we would go, what we would do.</span> <span id="s1219">So my sister traveled back by herself, found nothing, nobody.</span> <span id="s1220">She came back and then this was this decision what to do.</span> <span id="s1221">We decided, well, what to do, we stayed in England for a while.</span> <span id="s1222">We certainly weren't going to go back to nothing.</span> <span id="s1223">And so we stayed in England, and that's when I decided to accept that appointment when I was recalled to Prague, because I didn't want to go to Prague by myself.</span> <span id="s1224">Besides, the country had fallen to Communism, and I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s1225">And I decided I must get out of London because I must accept the appointment for Washington, because if I didn't get out of London, we would probably still be living together, my sister and I. And my older sister would not get married until all of us were sort of taken care of, so I left.</span> <span id="s1226">And as soon as I left, my sister got married.</span> <span id="s1227">And . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Your younger sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: My younger sister got married shortly afterwards.</span> <span id="s1230">Came to London and married.</span> <span id="s1231">And I stayed in America, but I must tell you I did go back to Czechoslovakia in 1970 for the first time to my village.</span> <span id="s1232">It was shortly after the Communists -- the Communists were still there, but it was shortly after Deutsch-Czech (ph) government started making -- the Prague -- you know, there was this revolt against the government.</span> <span id="s1233">I did go back; I wanted to go back, I wanted to go back to the village because all my life there was something that was bothering me.</span> <span id="s1234">I did not really settle down, neither in England nor America, even when I was married and had three children.</span> <span id="s1235">Something bothered me very much, and I couldn't quite put my finger on it but I never felt really at home anywhere.</span> <span id="s1236">So finally we decided we would go back to the village.</span> <span id="s1237">We were going to go during the Deutsch-Czech (ph), before the Communists took -- but then I got cold feet.</span> <span id="s1238">But my husband insisted that we do go back, and so we went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1239">We rented a car, we drove to my village.</span> <span id="s1240">We got to my village at 6 o'clock in the evening, and it was totally changed.</span> <span id="s1241">Totally changed.</span> <span id="s1242">There were huge buildings.</span> <span id="s1243">I mean, it was under the Communist regime, they built these huge concrete buildings and the village was so transformed, I could not find my way.</span> <span id="s1244">In any case, I said to my husband if we go -- the first thing I did when we got to the village -- it was 6 o'clock in the evening -- I asked the people about my friend, Eva .</span> <span id="s1245">I didn't ask for any of the Jewish children, because there was no one left.</span> <span id="s1246">But I asked for my friend; they said, "Oh, she just died about a year ago."</span> <span id="s1247">So I was very disappointed because she the only person I could think of to ask.</span> <span id="s1248">And then I said to my husband, "The only way I can find my house if I go to the station where I used to go to school, and then walk that street down that street, I'll know where my house is."</span> <span id="s1249">And when we got there, there was this house that looked so dilapidated and all the children were playing outside, and I said to them, "Do you live in this house?"</span> <span id="s1250">And they said yes.</span> <span id="s1251">I said, "Could you ask your mother whether I could come in, I used to live here?"</span> <span id="s1252">And she said, "Well, there are three families living in this house now, " but she said, "you can go on."</span> <span id="s1253">I said, "No, go in and ask her whether I could come in."</span> <span id="s1254">And so she went in and I followed her, and she called up to her mother that somebody wants to come in and see the house.</span> <span id="s1255">The mother came to the top of the stairs, she looked down.</span> <span id="s1256">She then knocked on the door where her husband was taking a cap, and she said, "Come out, Mrs. Ebostarkova is here."</span> <span id="s1257">And I was shocked, absolutely, that she should say that after 40 years.</span> <span id="s1258">And I said, "How did you know who I was?"</span> <span id="s1259">And she said, "Well, who else could it be?"</span> <span id="s1260">So they knew that they were living in the house that belonged to my parents.</span> <span id="s1261">And I looked, I couldn't recognize one stick of anything that belonged to us.</span> <span id="s1262">And they immediately assembled their -- some of the other people in the village to come and see us.</span> <span id="s1263">That's when I got this book with the photographs.</span> <span id="s1264">And they all wanted to buy the house from me, and I said, "Well, I don't -- this is not my house.</span> <span id="s1265">I mean, I don't want to deal with it."</span> <span id="s1266">And so the next morning -- one of them invited us to spend the night and we did.</span> <span id="s1267">He was the son of a woman who used to clean the house for us.</span> <span id="s1268">And he said to me, "I remember your grandfather.</span> <span id="s1269">He used to wear this gold chain," and he pointed out and he made out as if the chain were several inches wide.</span> <span id="s1270">And he said, "We used to play together," but I couldn't remember him anymore.</span> <span id="s1271">And then he insisted on taking me the next morning to the district building to see whether we could transfer the house to him, whether they could buy the house.</span> <span id="s1272">And when we got -- I didn't want to do it, but I went with him.</span> <span id="s1273">And when we got there, this woman who was keeping the books looked up to see whether any taxes are owed on the house, and then she said to me, "If you decide to sell the house, will you sell it to me?"</span> <span id="s1274">I said, "I'm not selling anything.</span> <span id="s1275">I'm not staying."</span> <span id="s1276">In any case, at 10 o'clock, I said to my husband, "I've got to get out of this village.</span> <span id="s1277">I've got to get out of here."</span> <span id="s1278">So we took a little walk.</span> <span id="s1279">We went to the woods where I used to go.</span> <span id="s1280">That's when I saw that big grave and the monument to the people, and then we got into the car.</span> <span id="s1281">I said, "We've got to get out of here, and don't stop."</span> <span id="s1282">We got there at 6 o'clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s1283">At 10 o'clock in the morning, we were on our way out.</span> <span id="s1284">And we drove fast to Vienna, as fast as we could.</span> <span id="s1285">And we almost got shot by the border guards because my husband didn't realize that somebody was trying to stop us, because somebody was flashing a lantern.</span> <span id="s1286">He thought it was a bicyclist, and it was the border guard.</span> <span id="s1287">But I was so ill in the back seat, I was sick all the way to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1288">I was so ill on my journey home, and I said to him -- I just lay there being sick all the time.</span> <span id="s1289">I said, "Don't.</span> <span id="s1290">Just get to Vienna and get the best hotel you can.</span> <span id="s1291">I need to get into the best hotel.</span> <span id="s1292">You just get there as fast as you can."</span> <span id="s1293">So we arrived in Vienna at whatever time it was, 11 o'clock at night.</span> <span id="s1294">We went to the hotel, the best hotel he could find.</span> <span id="s1295">I went upstairs and I lay down and slept, and they went out -- my son and Peter went out to dinner.</span> <span id="s1296">And I just slept and slept.</span> <span id="s1297">Woke up the next morning and just relaxed, and then I realized that this was the best thing that ever happened to me, that I went back.</span> <span id="s1298">I made my final journey home, my return journey.</span> <span id="s1299">That's what I was waiting for all these years, to make the return journey.</span> <span id="s1300">Because I lived out of my suitcases, and I didn't realize that.</span> <span id="s1301">For all those years, even when I had -- until 1970, I lived into my suitcases.</span> <span id="s1302">And then we -- I came home, and it was the best thing that could have happened.</span> <span id="s1303">When I drove to work through Rock Creek Park, I used to work -- before that, I used to drive to work through Rock Creek Park, and I used to say to myself almost every day, "This is very pretty, but it is not home.</span> <span id="s1304">There are no snowdrops here and no wild flowers."</span> <span id="s1305">And I missed it so much.</span> <span id="s1306">And then I came back from that trip; I drove through Rock Creek Park and I said, "Well, strawberries and snowdrops are not everything."</span> <span id="s1307">And I was just -- suddenly, I realized that this is what was bothering me.</span> <span id="s1308">I just had to make the trip back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">And even though I stayed there from 6:00 in the evening until 10:00 in the morning, it did it for me.</span> <span id="s1310">And I said, "I don't want to sell the house.</span> <span id="s1311">Just take it, do whatever you like, you know.</span> <span id="s1312">I don't want to deal with the house."</span> <span id="s1313">Which I felt a little ashamed because my father put everything -- you know, he wanted us to have this, but I had to leave it behind.</span> <span id="s1314">I can't deal with it.</span> <span id="s1315">And that's when they told me about all the -- I mean, you know, nobody returned anything when my sister went back.</span> <span id="s1316">And when you think about what actually happened was that people were just greedy, and they wanted -- that was about the material things.</span> <span id="s1317">They wanted to take the things away from the people, from the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1318">That gave them the license to take things away and to even kill, okay?</span> <span id="s1319">I mean, they put people in the trains, and they didn't care what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1320">But they were able to get into their houses and take the property away, okay?</span> <span id="s1321">That's it.</span> <span id="s1322">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Do you remember your impressions when you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: I loved being in the United States.</span> <span id="s1325">I mean, I felt at home here right away.</span> <span id="s1326">I told you I felt at home, much more so than I did in England because I felt this was sort of everybody belonged.</span> <span id="s1327">And, you know, we all belonged here, just very different.</span> <span id="s1328">In England, it's different now.</span> <span id="s1329">I think it's better.</span> <span id="s1330">And I feel very much at home when I go back to England.</span> <span id="s1331">I feel very comfortable, but in those days, it was very hard for refugees.</span> <span id="s1332">But although England was, I must say, I must give credit where credit is due, they did take 10,000; whereas, in the United States, they didn't take very many children, if any.</span> <span id="s1333">Altogether they took very few refugees, whereas England on this small island, did take a lot -- I mean, there were 10,000.</span> <span id="s1334">And many of the people who took the children, many of the families were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1335">Most of the children that were assigned to families were assigned to non-Jewish families.</span> <span id="s1336">Many of the Jewish families gave money, but did not give homes, okay?</span> <span id="s1337">So -- except in the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: You came here, you got married and had a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Yes, I got married in 1950, and we have three children.</span> <span id="s1340">And I am always amazed at what my father would think if he thought that he had a journalist daughter working for the "Russian Post," a granddaughter, okay?</span> <span id="s1341">And we have three children and three grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: What do you think got you through all these kind of lonely times?</span> <span id="s1343">What made you strong?</span> <span id="s1344">You developed pretty fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1346">I think that what made us strong?</span> <span id="s1347">I think is the loving care and upbringing from home and possibly the religious -- I mean, I think that we had a wonderful childhood.</span> <span id="s1348">Very loving family.</span> <span id="s1349">We were very close, and I think it's the upbringing.</span> <span id="s1350">What else could it be?</span> <span id="s1351">I was thinking about it the other day, that we were very young.</span> <span id="s1352">There are so many kids, not us, particularly, but there were children who are younger and they got educated.</span> <span id="s1353">They did extremely well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: When you were feeling lonely or homesick, was there something you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Yes, I cried.</span> <span id="s1356">I cried, but I was also very -- what should I say?</span> <span id="s1357">I was very -- I had to sort of be strong, that's all, you know?</span> <span id="s1358">I made a real effort to overcome and deal with it.</span> <span id="s1359">I cried a lot, I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: You say that you think your religious upbringing helped you.</span> <span id="s1361">And yet you say . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Well, but there is an ethic in the way we were brought up, okay?</span> <span id="s1363">It's not only going to -- I still maintain that.</span> <span id="s1364">I live like that, I brought my children up that way.</span> <span id="s1365">They are Jewish and they know it.</span> <span id="s1366">And they are decent people; that's all I can say.</span> <span id="s1367">I mean, one doesn't have to go -- I find that all the churches in my village in all the things did not help to make these people good, you know.</span> <span id="s1368">That doesn't make people good.</span> <span id="s1369">They have to be good from inside.</span> <span id="s1370">That's what goodness is.</span> <span id="s1371">Praying, going to church, and then going to confession, and doing evil things is not the fact -- that's the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: How do you think growing up in England shaped the person you became?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Well, how?</span> <span id="s1374">It was -- growing up in England, actually, I grew up among refugees.</span> <span id="s1375">I told you, except for my guardian, I didn't know -- I don't think I knew any English people beside my guardian.</span> <span id="s1376">But I have to think.</span> <span id="s1377">Maybe in the YWCA where I lived, I met some, but we did not maintain any kind of relationships.</span> <span id="s1378">More England gave me a lot of -- did build some character.</span> <span id="s1379">I mean, they behaved so beautifully during the war.</span> <span id="s1380">They were so solidly, you know, brave, and they continued to work, even when the bombs were falling.</span> <span id="s1381">And they were just strong, steady people, and that, I think, helped a great deal.</span> <span id="s1382">I mean, it taught me a lot, I learned a lot in England.</span> <span id="s1383">And I think they are so disciplined and truthful in lines for everything and very decent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: How -- have you thought about how these extremes in your unusual childhood impacted you?</span> <span id="s1385">What sorts of long-term effects this has had on you or the way you lived, the way you raised your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: My childhood, well, it was difficult because, of course, I didn't have parents.</span> <span id="s1387">During the most crucial time of my life when I was growing up in my teens, I didn't have anyone to show me anything.</span> <span id="s1388">So I always felt a little doubt whether I never knew exactly what to do when I had a baby, or how to dress the baby.</span> <span id="s1389">And certain things, I didn't have a mother to show me.</span> <span id="s1390">I had to learn myself.</span> <span id="s1391">I just observed and I took the best out of what I saw.</span> <span id="s1392">That's all.</span> <span id="s1393">I mean, I missed a lot of that not having the guidance from my parents.</span> <span id="s1394">But also, I mean, it forced me to make some decisions about myself and how I wanted to do things.</span> <span id="s1395">And I don't know how it would have been if I had gone back home and my parents would have been there.</span> <span id="s1396">I don't know how that my life would been, it's a big question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: But you think that affected the way you raised your own children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Oh, if affected -- well, I'm sure that I -- yes, I didn't do that greatly in raising my children because I was a very anxious mother.</span> <span id="s1399">And I'm sure that my experiences definitely had an impact on my children.</span> <span id="s1400">I'm sure I damaged my children a great deal through this kind of anxiety because I worried about them a great deal.</span> <span id="s1401">I was always terrified something would happen.</span> <span id="s1402">Of course, I see only the -- I'm always fearful about things happening.</span> <span id="s1403">And I used to feel very sorry for my children when they were babies.</span> <span id="s1404">I used to stand over the crib and I used to say, "You poor little baby, you don't know you're Jewish, what you have to face in life."</span> <span id="s1405">And I felt terrible for them.</span> <span id="s1406">Maybe they saw the feelings that I felt when I didn't allow myself to feel.</span> <span id="s1407">I transmitted, I felt that they were my kids.</span> <span id="s1408">I felt very sorry for them when they were little ones, you know.</span> <span id="s1409">I said, "You don't what lies ahead, how horrible."</span> <span id="s1410">Its' so hard, but I still didn't do anything to change that.</span> <span id="s1411">But I did feel sorry, I mean, definitely my children have -- are the product of my experiences, definitely.</span> <span id="s1412">My husband's too, probably.</span> <span id="s1413">Except my husband, of course, came out with his mother and his sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Do you have certain fears or anxieties today that are . . . A: Of course.</span> <span id="s1415">Always have fears.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: . . . from that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1418">I live in fear.</span> <span id="s1419">I live in fear, but I manage -- to have a husband who is an optimist and so we have a balance, but I'm very anxious.</span> <span id="s1420">He always said that I was afraid of authority.</span> <span id="s1421">I'm afraid of police when I see a policeman, and I'm afraid of this and that.</span> <span id="s1422">And he attributes many more fears to me probably than I have, but maybe not quite enough.</span> <span id="s1423">I think I have a great deal more fears, yes.</span> <span id="s1424">But I deal with it, I mean, the best I know how.</span> <span id="s1425">I manage to hide it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Is there any other thoughts you have or anything else you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Well, I can say -- I didn't say anything about Mr. Winton, but Mr. Winton will speak for himself as the gentleman who arranged for the transports.</span> <span id="s1428">I do want to say another thing.</span> <span id="s1429">Yes, I do want to say something which is very, very important.</span> <span id="s1430">That I'll never -- that I'm very grateful to my uncle because who has an uncle like mine?</span> <span id="s1431">And I'm very, very grateful to my parents.</span> <span id="s1432">I mean, who would have thought that parents like mine who lived in a village, who have never been out of it, who would have done this, sent us out?</span> <span id="s1433">And I do not, like some people feel angry with their parents for having sent them away, I never for one moment had those feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Never.</span> <span id="s1435">And I don't think any of -- maybe my younger sister may have, but I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1436">Maybe she did feel that way, but I always felt very grateful.</span> <span id="s1437">And I am amazed, absolutely amazed, that my parents had the courage to do it because they suffered incredibly for having sent the children away.</span> <span id="s1438">My mother's letters are heartbreaking.</span> <span id="s1439">That's why I can't read them.</span> <span id="s1440">As soon as I begin to read the letters, I can't continue because she is so devastated by having sent us away.</span> <span id="s1441">But there is another good thing about it.</span> <span id="s1442">My father had a -- when I wrote to my parents in Czechoslovakia, I would say -- I was always afraid that my father would be the one who would be taken away, so I wrote to my parents and I said to them, "I want my father" -- my mother was the one who wrote the letters.</span> <span id="s1443">My father always added something; not always, but sometimes.</span> <span id="s1444">And I would say to my mother through the letters, "Be sure that my father signs his name to every letter.</span> <span id="s1445">I want to know that he's there, and don't tell me he's all right.</span> <span id="s1446">I want to see his signature on every letter."</span> <span id="s1447">And he wrote, and one of the last letters that he wrote was "I'm so glad you're not here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">I'm so glad that you're there, that we sent you away."</span> <span id="s1449">And that was the best letter that we ever had because I thought at last, because at the beginning they doubts whether they did the right thing.</span> <span id="s1450">And, of course, you know, I mean, how -- I just marvel at them.</span> <span id="s1451">That's all I can tell you.</span> <span id="s1452">Because I have my own children, and I don't know that I would ever be able to do this.</span> <span id="s1453">And that shows you that this was enormous love to do this.</span> <span id="s1454">What a sacrifice!</span> <span id="s1455">So that's what I have to add.</span> <span id="s1456">There are masses of other things that probably I have forgotten, but, you know, I could go on.</span> <span id="s1457">I did a tape -- my younger sister died a year ago, very suddenly, from cancer of the lung caused by asbestos.</span> <span id="s1458">Apparently, it had to with my father's business because he was in the asbestos -- in the roofing business.</span> <span id="s1459">I mean, building and roofing, and he did asbestos tiles for the housing.</span> <span id="s1460">Now, when my sister died, she may have had other memories that I'm sorry I didn't get to ask her, but her daughter asked me to tell the story of her mother and of our home.</span> <span id="s1461">Because her daughter wants to do a book, so I finally did, I did that for her.</span> <span id="s1462">I did a tape which is a four-hour tape.</span> <span id="s1463">The story, of course, as I went on, I remembered many things.</span> <span id="s1464">And to this moment, I still keep on remembering other things which I add to the tape, so the tape exists.</span> <span id="s1465">But I'm sure that I have forgotten or left out things, but there is only so much one can say, right?</span> <span id="s1466">Now, I'd like to show you my two sisters, if I may.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s1468">Are we going to need to stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: This picture was taken probably in 1940 or '41 and sent to us in London in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">And on the left, from the left to right, my mother; my mother's sister, Marguerite (ph); my grandmother, my step grandmother, actually; my grandfather with a moustache; and my father.</span> <span id="s1471">And they were all sent to Auschwitz in 1942.</span> <span id="s1472">This is the three of us.</span> <span id="s1473">My older sister, Josie, in the right.</span> <span id="s1474">I'm in the middle, Alice.</span> <span id="s1475">And my younger sister, Ellie, who was 10 years old, the little one on the left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: When was this taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: This was taken shortly before we came on the transport.</span> <span id="s1478">Okay?</span> <span id="s1479">This is my father's mother who came to stay with my parents, I think probably after we left sometime at the end of 1939 after Poland was occupied, I suppose.</span> <span id="s1480">After war broke out, and she came from to stay with my parents, and this is one reason why my parents could not leave, even if they wanted to.</span> <span id="s1481">Because they wouldn't desert her, and she went with them to Auschwitz in the summer 1942.</span> <span id="s1482">This is the house where we lived from 1938 until 1939, or at least we children.</span> <span id="s1483">My parents stayed down till 1942, I think.</span> <span id="s1484">This is the village of Bratislava, where I lived until I was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s1485">None of the people who -- none of my friends, none of the Jewish families survived.</span> <span id="s1486">Oh, possibly one may have survived, but none of the ones that we were very close to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: How many Jews lived in the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: I'm not sure how many, but quite a few families.</span> <span id="s1489">Maybe 20 Jewish families.</span> <span id="s1490">Okay, this is about two weeks prior to our departure from our village.</span> <span id="s1491">And I'm in the middle with a basket with my school celebrating some occasion.</span> <span id="s1492">I can't remember what it was, but this was a national costume that we were wearing, and we had a great time in the village before the war.</span> <span id="s1493">Okay, this is the synagogue which this is what it looked like in 1970 when I made my first trip back to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Is it being used as a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: It is not now.</span> <span id="s1496">It was used as grain storage.</span> <span id="s1497">Okay?</span> <span id="s1498">Now, these are my parents' grandchildren that they have never an opportunity to see, and some of the great grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1499">I think there are one or two great grandchildren missing.</span> <span id="s1500">Now, at the top, this picture there is my daughter, Ann, with her husband and my three grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1501">Now, on the left is my daughter, Kim, and in the middle, the first gentlemen is my son, Tim.</span> <span id="s1502">Then there are my older sister's two children, Vera, on the left and Michael.</span> <span id="s1503">And my younger sister's children, Helen and Cathy.</span> <span id="s1504">These are Helen's two, her children, and one of them is not here, but my parents' great grandchildren from my younger sister.</span> <span id="s1505">These are the children of my older sister, grandchildren of my older sister, Samantha and Jarael (ph).</span> <span id="s1506">And the one on the left is my granddaughter, who was already on the previous picture.</span> <span id="s1507">Is that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">End of Tape #3 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
