Herzfeld, would you give us some information as to where you were born and a little about your background as a young child growing up in Europe and whatever information you would like to give us about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">MH: I was born in 1914 in Zurich, Switzerland, and I lived there for a little more than ten years when my father decided to open a business in the free state of Danzig which today is Gdansk, where I continued with schooling there, and Business College.</span> <span id="s4">I lived there until 1936.</span> <span id="s5">In 1936 I went for a visit to Holland to my aunt and uncle, and I liked it very much, and I stayed in Holland.</span> <span id="s6">During that year I went back and forth yet, from Holland, Amsterdam to Danzig, and in 1937, December, 1937, I got married to a fellow by the name of Martin Sternfeld who was a non-practicing lawyer.</span> <span id="s7">He studied law in Germany and he was born in Germany and lived later in Berlin where he no longer could practice, continue to be a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">MS: What year of college was he in when the Nuremberg Laws came in?</span> <span id="s9">Do you have any idea when he had to stop going to school?</span> <span id="s10">Was he almost finished at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">MH: No, he was thrown out of the university much before that time.</span> <span id="s12">That was the first action really, what they did, and he did not go in Berlin to the university; he was in Königsberg, which is now Russia.</span> <span id="s13">Then his father lived near there in a small town in Germany and his father and mother and sisters, and they moved to Berlin, and I think it was in 1930.</span> <span id="s14">My father-in-law was a cantor; my husband came from an extremely religious family, and in order to try to make some money that time in Berlin, he was tutoring law students.</span> <span id="s15">Of course, the law students they were non Jews, because no Jew was a law student any longer, and of course, a Jew to tutor a Christian--that was forbidden.</span> <span id="s16">In 1936 he was warned to leave Germany immediately because one of his students had found out that my husband's brother-in-law, who was a prosecutor in Berlin at the courts in Berlin, that he was arrested.</span> <span id="s17">So my husband just took off one evening got on the train and went to Amsterdam for a visit with his sister.</span> <span id="s18">His sister was married in Amsterdam, and he remained in Amsterdam so it was very difficult, but he had got the permission to stay in Holland.</span> <span id="s19">The same happened to me; I did not want to go back anymore to Danzig, and I did not want to go back to Switzerland because my parents were supposed to come and live in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">MS: In Holland or Danzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">MH: They lived in Danzig but they were supposed to move to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">MS: Tell us a little more about your family, Mrs. Herzfeld.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">MH: My family?</span> <span id="s24">My parents were born in Upper Silesia, both of them, not in the same town, but near each other.</span> <span id="s25">Upper Silesia was once Germany and then it was Poland and back German again, but my parents came to Switzerland at a very early age and they were married in Switzerland and they met in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s26">My grandparents, my mother’s parents, lived in Switzerland then, too.</span> <span id="s27">They lived in Lugano, which is the Italian part of Switzerland.</span> <span id="s28">It’s a small town in the Italian part.</span> <span id="s29">My mother was a school teacher, and she lived then in Zurich and she got married in Zurich.</span> <span id="s30">And some of her sisters lived there too.</span> <span id="s31">We were three children, my brother, my oldest brother, and I had another brother.</span> <span id="s32">I was the youngest and the only daughter, and we lived in Zurich until my father decided in 1924--he wanted to see if he could open another factory in Germany, or rather in Danzig.</span> <span id="s33">He had some connection and I don't remember what the connections were with Danzig.</span> <span id="s34">It was a free state, and he saw it was very successful the business there.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">MS: Tell us the kind of business your Dad was involved with.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">MH: A chocolate factory.</span> <span id="s37">[laughter] Yes, my father had a chocolate factory, and the factory in Danzig was also very prosperous.</span> <span id="s38">And he stayed there for one year and my mother said if he remains that we will not remain in Zurich because as a family we have to stick together.</span> <span id="s39">So my mother and the three of us went to Danzig, and we did not really live in Danzig.</span> <span id="s40">We lived in a town which is called Zoppat [German].</span> <span id="s41">I don't know what it is called now.</span> <span id="s42">It is a big resort, a beautiful resort right on the Baltic Sea, on the bay.</span> <span id="s43">The bay was Danzig.</span> <span id="s44">We remained there, and I went to school there and in 1935, my father went back to Switzerland, and he decided that we would leave Danzig and maybe go to Switzerland that my mother wanted to go back to, or to Holland because part of her family lived in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">MS: Was this decision based on the political situation of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">MH: Yes, on the political situation.</span> <span id="s47">It was before even Hitler came into Danzig, but it was already in Germany.</span> <span id="s48">Unfortunately, my father on the way to Switzerland had a stroke, but he survived and he stayed a year in Switzerland which we went to see him, and we were all set.</span> <span id="s49">He came back to liquidate everything, and of course, then he got in when the Nazis were there.</span> <span id="s50">They took our factory; they arrested my oldest brother who was working for my father, and since he wasn't a very well man, but he had recuperated marvelous.</span> <span id="s51">He had a heart attack after they arrested my brother, and they took everything away from us, and he died.</span> <span id="s52">Then of course, the things were very bad for us because we didn't have the factory, so my...</span></p> <p><span id="s53">MS: Just let me ask you at this point, you were back in Danzig, you were leaving Danzig and the family were relocating itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">MH: No, we stayed.</span> <span id="s55">My father went back to Zurich, but we stayed because we were supposed to follow him, but he got sick unfortunately and couldn’t do much.</span> <span id="s56">And for a year he remained there, but then he came back.</span> <span id="s57">And after that, it was not very easy for my mother who was in the business, but still we had no saying anymore, because it was taken away.</span> <span id="s58">It was sold, so-called sold.</span> <span id="s59">It wasn't really sold, it was an alienizat-I-on [aryanization] program.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">MS: How did the family survive at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">MH: We had money, and we could live from it.</span> <span id="s62">And my brother got a job at the Jewish, he could not work for another firm.</span> <span id="s63">My brother is now an accountant, but at that time he was more than a bookkeeper, he was the secretary of the Jewish, of the synagogue and the whole Jewish community of that town where we lived, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s64">MS: Was this the same brother that was arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">MH: Yes, the same brother that was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">MS: Then they didn't keep him, they released him.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">MH: They released him, and my brother got the job, which was a paying job of course and it was a very good job.</span> <span id="s68">He was the secretary combined with all the smaller towns in the free state of Danzig.</span> <span id="s69">There were smaller towns around.</span> <span id="s70">He did everything there and he organized children's transfers to Israel, France and [not Israel, Palestine], to Palestine, France and England.</span> <span id="s71">And in--I went to Holland in 1936, and I got married in 1937, and my mother came with me; she stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">MS: May I ask you a question?</span> <span id="s73">You mention that your brother was affiliated with the synagogue in Danzig.</span> <span id="s74">Was your family, in a sense, an observant Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">MH: Yes, my father was the president of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s76">We didn't have a very strict religious home...</span></p> <p><span id="s77">MS: But there was an affiliation, a Jewish affiliation?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">MH: Oh, yes, in fact we had a kosher house.</span> <span id="s79">I was confirmed in the synagogue, and my brother's bar mitzvah was there, too, both of them.</span> <span id="s80">I had another brother who was a chemist and he disappeared.</span> <span id="s81">Yes, he was one of the first taken, they picked him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">MS: Was this in Gdansk?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">MH: Yes, he just disappeared, they picked him up and we don't know where.</span> <span id="s84">And my brother was left and my mother was in Holland and my brother--it's very complicated--my brother was in Danzig and he organized all those children transports and he had a girlfriend, Jewish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">MS: Do you want to give us your brother's name so that we can have it on the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">MH: My brother's name is Henry Jennings.</span> <span id="s87">He changed his name in England.</span> <span id="s88">He had a girlfriend and in August, 1939, he organized a children's transport to England.</span> <span id="s89">He took his friend, his girlfriend with him, who was at that time a young girl of sixteen or something like that, and went with him to England, with the idea to possibly stay in England or come to Holland.</span> <span id="s90">And he didn’t even have a chance because I saw him in Hook Van Holland when they came through there from Danzig you know, to go on the ship to England.</span> <span id="s91">He got into London where we had a very big family, there where he was.</span> <span id="s92">And his girlfriend was working in England in a factory, and her mother and her grandparents were still in Danzig.</span> <span id="s93">Her father had died.</span> <span id="s94">And he married her in 1940, and then enlisted right away for the British Army.</span> <span id="s95">He volunteered for the British Army because that's when he married this girl and so that she could get his pay.</span> <span id="s96">That was the idea, really.</span> <span id="s97">We had a very large family in England, very large.</span> <span id="s98">My mother comes from a large family and her brother and one of the brothers lived in England and her cousins.</span> <span id="s99">They have been in England.</span> <span id="s100">All the children were born in England from this branch.</span> <span id="s101">So that’s where my brother is now.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">MS: So therefore he remained in England and was relatively safe throughout the entire war.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">MH: But he was for five years in the army, yes in several invasions, Dunkirk, and in the Normandy, and all this, but he survived and he lives now in England and he is a grandfather by now.</span> <span id="s104">Both children are married, he has two girls and...</span></p> <p><span id="s105">MS: Well, let's continue with the story where your mother came to Amsterdam with you.</span> <span id="s106">Was your younger brother with her at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">MH: No, he was taken away in 1936.</span> <span id="s108">He had a non-Jewish girlfriend and he was caught.</span> <span id="s109">That was not allowed: an Aryan with a non-Aryan.</span> <span id="s110">Somehow, I think they belonged to a tennis club or something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">MS: How old was he at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">MH: Let me see.</span> <span id="s113">I was born in ‘14, he was born in ‘ll.</span> <span id="s114">I'm the youngest.</span> <span id="s115">He was born in 1911, and my oldest brother was born in 1909.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">MS: He must have been in his twenties when that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">MH: Yes, that’s what happened; he was taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">MS: Do you remember how?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">MH: I wasn't in Danzig; I was in Holland already.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">MS: And so at that point your father had, was still alive then, when your mother came to Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">MH: No, my mother came later after I got married.</span> <span id="s122">No, he was not alive then.</span> <span id="s123">So it was a very tough thing for my mother.</span> <span id="s124">She really tried to hold the family together, and as I said, financially, we could manage let’s say this way.</span> <span id="s125">She also worked yet a little bit.</span> <span id="s126">She tried but she couldn't either as a Jew; she also worked, but not really.</span> <span id="s127">I don't remember my mother even working, but when she came to Holland, she lived with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">MS: All right--now tell us a little bit about how you met your husband--and married.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">MH: Okay, I had met my husband already in the town that we lived, in Zoppat, in Danzig.</span> <span id="s130">I had met him there; when through a girlfriend of mine who was also Jewish, we knew each other, we went to the business college together.</span> <span id="s131">And she introduced me to him, to my first husband...</span></p> <p><span id="s132">MS: His name was...</span></p> <p><span id="s133">MH: Martin Sternfeld.</span> <span id="s134">This was in 1935 and then when I heard that he wrote to me quite often from Berlin and then I got suddenly a letter from Holland and that’s when I went to Holland.</span> <span id="s135">I went to visit to my aunt and my cousins.</span> <span id="s136">They lived in Rotterdam not in Amsterdam, but that’s why I went to Holland with the promise that I will come back, but then the situation got very bad, and I didn't want to go back because I felt much safer in Holland and I had wrote to my mother to definitely to come to Holland.</span> <span id="s137">She came, but she went back again.</span> <span id="s138">It's very difficult you know, the language and you know--say, if I picture myself now suddenly to go, it’s very difficult.</span> <span id="s139">When you were young it was a different story, you just went.</span> <span id="s140">And so when we got married, she, of course, came to our wedding, and she stayed.</span> <span id="s141">She could not stay permanently.</span> <span id="s142">Eventually, if everything would have been all right, she would have been able to, but she had her temporary visa.</span> <span id="s143">She could always extend it again because my family in Rotterdam, my cousin, my uncle had died, and my cousin in Rotterdam was the chief cantor in Rotterdam in the synagogue and he had quite some influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">MS: I was going to ask you, how did it work out with your citizenship?</span> <span id="s145">I mean, you were from another country.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">MH: Yes, I had a dual one.</span> <span id="s147">I was born in Switzerland; being born in Switzerland, you're Swiss.</span> <span id="s148">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">MS: But then when you went to settle in Holland didn't you have to apply?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">MH: Yes, I had to apply.</span> <span id="s151">But I could keep my Swiss--I didn't have a passport, I had what they call in Switzerland, a Heimatschein, that is that you were born in Switzerland, that is besides your birth certificate, and that I could live and come to Switzerland any time I want and be treated like a Swiss.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">MS: But did you have an alien status then in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">MH: Yes, more like a Swiss.</span> <span id="s154">Because I married a German national [my husband was born in Germany], he had a German passport, I automatically became--had also a German passport, but I also had my Swiss, it was a dual citizenship, which here it is not, here you have one.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">MS: Then you could remain in Amsterdam and stay as a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">MH: Yes, I could remain--sure eventually, yes because see through this lawyer who was a very influential man in Amsterdam, it would have been very simple to become a Dutch citizen.</span> <span id="s157">It would ave been very, very easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">MS: But that never happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">MH: That never happened.</span> <span id="s160">No, of course not, Hitler came in between, you know.</span> <span id="s161">He would have gone to university, to make his exam, his bar, then he could have been a lawyer and then we would have become Dutch citizens.</span> <span id="s162">You had to have a sponsor for that; you could not become a citizen without a sponsor.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">MS: And that would not have been a problem for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">MH: No, that would not have been a problem because of this Mr. Defriez who was a very well-known man.</span> <span id="s165">Unfortunately, their family didn't come back either because we got another sister, my husband's, out from Berlin, and she lived with these people, she was sort of, not the house maid, but they were very quite well-to-do people, she was in the house with the children because it was the only way she could work in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">MS: She was, I can't think of the right word for it, a nanny?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">MH: Yes, a nanny, something like this but she was taken away with the whole family, the whole family, Defriez.</span> <span id="s168">They never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">MS: So then tell us about what were the events that led up to the invasion of Holland in 1940, and how it affected you and your husband at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">MH: It started, really--we had no idea.</span> <span id="s171">We didn't know, we really believed, that Holland who had been neutral for a hundred years by that time, that Holland would be invaded, which is, of course, very narrow-minded, because when you see the geography of Holland border to the German, one border is Germany, and we were invaded May 10, 1940--May 9.</span> <span id="s172">My brother went to England with the idea, before of course, he went in August, 1939, and this was May ‘40, but we had a lot of his things in Holland, and we wanted to ship everything to England, and when we got to the post office, they didn't take packages to England, and we were so surprised.</span> <span id="s173">And when we came home, we spent the day in town, we lived outside the town in Amsterdam, and we spent the whole afternoon in town and when we came home and everything was fine, and in the middle of the night we hear shooting .</span> <span id="s174">So we turned the radio on, and we still didn't hear what was going on.</span> <span id="s175">We lived in an apartment house and our neighbors below us knocked on our door in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s176">She said, "Let's go up on the roof."</span> <span id="s177">Now, in Holland the roofs of the apartment houses are flat, really, mostly flat, and then you can just walk on there.</span> <span id="s178">We lived very close to the airport in Amsterdam, Strepol and we saw it burning.</span> <span id="s179">We saw a fire there.</span> <span id="s180">And then our neighbor's husband was in the army.</span> <span id="s181">He was registered, and had to go to the Army.</span> <span id="s182">He was called to be right away.</span> <span id="s183">During the night even he left and then we knew, and in the next day we knew again.</span> <span id="s184">And we listened again to the radio the next day and we heard that the Queen and her family left for London.</span> <span id="s185">Then we knew exactly what it is, why that happened and we went.</span> <span id="s186">In Amsterdam, we didn't see the Germans until a few days later, they marched to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s187">Now it was 1940 when the invasion.</span> <span id="s188">The first year we had pretty much everything, no ration cards, they didn’t do anything to the Jews.</span> <span id="s189">It was not right away.</span> <span id="s190">It started really the end of '40 and 1941.</span> <span id="s191">After all the stores were empty, we had by then there was very little food left because everything went to Germany.</span> <span id="s192">They took out everything, but they left the Jews pretty much alone.</span> <span id="s193">And the Jewish Council of Amsterdam came really into existence in 1937 to help the Jews from Germany to come into Holland, temporary.</span> <span id="s194">They had to have a possibility to move on, to have a visa for America, for any other country.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">MS: In other words, it was like a way-station?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">MH: Yes, that’s what it was, but they could remain.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">MS: What did they do for them?</span> <span id="s198">Did they settle them into homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">MH: No, they got settled in a camp, Westerbork, that was in the northern part of Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">MS: Which later became a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">MH: Right, it was near Groningen, near there.</span> <span id="s202">They had quite a bit land, and the Dutch government gave the land to the Jewish Council, and they built little bungalows in that camp.</span> <span id="s203">There were like bungalows, row bungalows, and each bungalow had two rooms: a bedroom, a living room, a kitchen, a little dining room and a bath, and that's where the people who came in 1938 after the Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s204">Holland opened the doors for one day and night for everybody who could prove who is Jewish or a political prisoner, and they could stay in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">MS: When you say one day and night, you mean they just opened the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">MH: Opened the border.</span> <span id="s207">They could come in.</span> <span id="s208">Of course, they checked them out, but they let them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">MS: And was it like 24 hours and then they closed it up after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">MH: They closed it up because Holland by that time, the whole of Holland—only 8 million people.</span> <span id="s211">They couldn't do much.</span> <span id="s212">But, they opened up, and then they put them in first with families, and they had like a big school in Holland which they lived and they were supported by the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">MS: Until this camp...?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">MH: Yes, that camp was really self-supporting.</span> <span id="s215">Like people came, a family got these bungalows or three fellows or three girls, if they weren't married, three or four lived in there or a family with a few children could live in there.</span> <span id="s216">And they had built this, and they had made it was a fence in there.</span> <span id="s217">They had to stay there, and they had a lot of grounds where they planted vegetables and they were pretty much self-supporting.</span> <span id="s218">They had chickens, they had everything, and yet if they needed the money came.</span> <span id="s219">They got paid every week.</span> <span id="s220">They got money every week from the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s221">The community was the Jewish council.</span> <span id="s222">They were extremely wealthy, the Jews in Amsterdam, mostly were diamond merchants.</span> <span id="s223">And they were extremely— Amsterdam, Rotterdam, all the big cities, it was a very wealthy Jewish community, and they were the ones who supported it and donations from the other Jewish families.</span> <span id="s224">Every family could take somebody, one or two people, to their house for a weekend.</span> <span id="s225">They got a pass to come out from the camp, but they had to stay in the camp and they had to try to leave Holland.</span> <span id="s226">They didn’t give them a certain date but they had to try.</span> <span id="s227">They had to prove that they had somebody somewhere, was it South America, was it North America, wherever they could go but Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">MS: And then the people who worked in the Council would do the paper work and try to make the contacts for the refugees to send them on further?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">MH: Yes, right, to get an affidavit or to get a permit to somewhere, to South America.</span> <span id="s230">Most of these people, and there were close to 400, went to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">MS: I thought from what I had read that thousands of Jewish families...</span></p> <p><span id="s232">MH: Yes, came into Holland, not thousands but quite a bit but they came before the Crystal Night, before ‘38.</span> <span id="s233">They came from ‘33 on.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">MS: Right, how were those people absorbed into the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">MH: They were as Germans, Jewish, but they could do anything.</span> <span id="s236">Most of them were—let me tell you.</span> <span id="s237">Holland was before really a country of agriculture.</span> <span id="s238">When I first came to Holland, fashions and things like this weren't so great, and the most of the German Jews who lived in the bigger cities in Germany had clothing manufacturers, designers, and also actors, the theaters and the movies was quite a few were Jewish, and they came to Holland.</span> <span id="s239">They brought their culture, and they brought the idea of the fashions, a lot of the clothing manufacturers, and they, when they could prove, some brought money along, illegal but they...</span></p> <p><span id="s240">MS: Then those that came in the very early years set up themselves into business and just melted right into the culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">MH: Yes, they could take money.</span> <span id="s242">Right into the culture.</span> <span id="s243">In fact, they contributed, not to the culture.</span> <span id="s244">To the economy, more than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Tape One, Side Two:</span></p> <p><span id="s246">MS: We were speaking about the German Jews that came early, in the early years, ‘33, ‘35, into Germany [probably meant Holland], and you say you had many friends amongst this group of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">MH: Yes, we had friends amongst them.</span> <span id="s248">Especially through my sister-in-law, who was in Holland since 1932 or ‘33, in Holland, and she knew quite a few of the people because my brother-in-law was the photographer, the number one photographer, in Amsterdam; he had a big studio.</span> <span id="s249">And that's how they knew most of the people, and that’s how we got in it too, and through this lawyer, this Mr. Def iez.</span> <span id="s250">We had met many other people too, Dutch-born, and people who came from Germany, and who had brought some, a lot of money in, and had, they came quite early, like ‘33, and had started businesses in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s251">I only speak about Amsterdam because that was the only town I lived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">MS: Well, and it was the largest...</span></p> <p><span id="s253">MH: It was the largest city, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">MS: Mrs. Herzfeld, tell us a little bit about what your husband was doing about this time of 1940, in his own life as far as work is concerned, and what happened to you after the Germans came in, and how you became a part of the committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">MH: My husband worked r this lawyer as a legal aide, or something like this, since he had not made his exam in Holland.</span> <span id="s256">And he also worked for the Jewish Council because this lawyer was on the committee, on the Board of the Jewish Council, and that's where my husband also worked, as a legal aide to these people who were, came in, and needed help from Germany, who came without money, who came later, and couldn't bring any money, and needed help.</span> <span id="s257">There were also, even if they were not in that camp in Westerbork, some who came, not--they came into Holland, maybe not illegal, but they were not citizens, and they could not work.</span> <span id="s258">So they were supported weekly, with weekly checks by the Jewish Council, and my husband, that time, was the legal aide to help them, to help them to get situated and possibly to become Dutch citizens.</span> <span id="s259">And that's what he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">MS: There was a very prominent man who was the head of that Council at the time...</span></p> <p><span id="s261">MH: Yes, it was Professor Cohen and Asscher.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">MS: Asscher, yes.</span> <span id="s263">And there was also a Mr. Visser...</span></p> <p><span id="s264">MH: Visser.</span> <span id="s265">Right, yes.</span> <span id="s266">And a Mrs. Fontaine.</span> <span id="s267">She was very, very much, very active there.</span> <span id="s268">These were the top people.</span> <span id="s269">The top people with a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">MS: Well, according to a small article that I had read in this book of the destruction of the Dutch Jews, and also in Nora Levin's book, The Holocaust, that once the Germans came in, invaded Amsterdam, that the Committee that was headed by Mr. Visser, who was also acting as attorney of quite, or a judge of...</span></p> <p><span id="s271">MH: Yes, he was quite...</span></p> <p><span id="s272">MS: They immediately, or outwardly, anyway, that they, the organization disintegrated because they wanted, they did not want to deal with the Germans in any regard, in any way whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">MH: No.</span> <span id="s274">But the Germans did business, did integrate with them.</span> <span id="s275">Not integrate, but they dictated what they have to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">MS: To the committee...</span></p> <p><span id="s277">MH: To the committee, sure.</span> <span id="s278">That was all, all checked by the Germans.</span> <span id="s279">They needed the committee, that's how they got the--I wouldn't say, that is not right.</span> <span id="s280">You probably will, you probably don't know why did the Jews go and got registered.</span> <span id="s281">Why were they registered?</span> <span id="s282">Now this is Europe.</span> <span id="s283">In Europe you have to move from one street to the next, you have to go to the police, and they make a notice of that, that you moved from one lane to the next street, or from one road to the next road, you have to, and this is in there.</span> <span id="s284">This is written in there.</span> <span id="s285">The Jewish committee had to provide the names the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">MS: Well, was there a..</span> <span id="s287">.</span> <span id="s288">?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">MH: Besides that, we were all registered with the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">MS: Well, that was, when you registered with the police, wasn’t that an edict that was handed, I mean, the Dutch government, did the Dutch government register the Jews, or did the Germans register the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">MH: The German registered the Jews, but the Dutch government, if you were a non-Jew, no matter what you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s292">MS: Oh.</span> <span id="s293">you had to be registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">MH: You had to be register.</span> <span id="s295">And that goes, that was the same in Germany, that was the same in France.</span> <span id="s296">Most of the European countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">MS: If you were not a national?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">MH: Right.</span> <span id="s299">I don't know how it’s now, in the present time, but I'm sure it’s the same.</span> <span id="s300">When you move in Europe, you have to tell the police where you are moving.</span> <span id="s301">In this country you can disappear very easily, but that you had in Europe.</span> <span id="s302">It’s not in England like that, but it is in, on the continent.</span> <span id="s303">And that’s what happened; the police had all the records.</span> <span id="s304">And you tell the religion what you are.</span> <span id="s305">And the Dutch were a very liberal country, extremely, because the Queen was certainly for the Jews.</span> <span id="s306">In fact, you would never, you could never call a Jew is a Jew.</span> <span id="s307">It was not the right word to say.</span> <span id="s308">You never talked about a Jew.</span> <span id="s309">If they talked about a Jew, somebody is a Jewish faith, they talked about in Dutch like the Israelite.</span> <span id="s310">That was by the order of the Queen.</span> <span id="s311">Of course, you know there is not a country without antisemitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">MS: Yes, which brings up the point, while you were, the years that you spent in Amsterdam, were you ever conscious of any antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">MH: No, no, none whatsoever.</span> <span id="s314">Never.</span> <span id="s315">Never.</span> <span id="s316">It was an extremely, we knew in fact, the one who went with the German, Musset [phonetic] he was a Dutch-born, he was the biggest antisemite, which came out afterwards.</span> <span id="s317">But, never.</span> <span id="s318">We lived, you know, and it goes for Europe, I'm not talking about Poland or Russia, we were not like, there was no Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s319">Yes, there was the Judenbreestrasse [phonetic] where Rembrandt lived, and all this, but that goes way back from in the 14th century, when the Jews from Portugal and Spain came to Holland.</span> <span id="s320">And, as you realize, the way I was married and the way we belonged to a synagogue, that--only knew the Sephardic way of praying, and it's all Sephardic.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">MS: Then, the main Jewish community in Amsterdam was of a Sephardic background?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">MS: Only, there was no other.</span> <span id="s323">No other.</span> <span id="s324">There was no reform congregation.</span> <span id="s325">Now they have one.</span> <span id="s326">But there was none.</span> <span id="s327">It was very, very, very strict.</span> <span id="s328">Very orthodox.</span> <span id="s329">It was the only, that's how I was married, in an orthodox fashion, with going to the mikveh and everything like that.</span> <span id="s330">But, see now, you asked me question too, if I felt anything, you know--what I have here and what my mother had in Holland, and all our things were hidden by a non-Christian friend.</span> <span id="s331">She went into our apartment and she took out whatever could be taken out.</span> <span id="s332">All the silver, all the linens, everything.</span> <span id="s333">She had eight girls in her apartment hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">MS: That, of course, that's well known that many thousands of Jews were hidden by their neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">MH: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s336">I had the chance too, but I just didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">MS: So tell us about that part of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">MH: Well, this certain friend, who was a, she had also quite some connections in Holland, her brother was one of the biggest builders in Amsterdam, and she tried to talk me into, to stay with her brother's father-in-law and mother-in-law, to be hidden.</span> <span id="s339">I tried that for one day, and it wasn't for me.</span> <span id="s340">I couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s341">It just wasn't for me.</span> <span id="s342">By then, already, I had worked for the Jewish, I also worked for the Jewish Council, but I worked already quite early for them, and my husband was around when the people from the "Saint Louis," from that ship--I was in Rotterdam when they came, and the ones who came into Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s343">I was in Amsterdam too with them, when they came from the ship, with coffee, and some of the women, the wives of a lot of the members of the Jewish Council, we were there to give them their--when they came off the "Saint Louis", too...</span></p> <p><span id="s344">MS: And they remained in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">MH: They remained in Holland, yes.</span> <span id="s346">Not all of them.</span> <span id="s347">Holland, Belgium and France and England.</span> <span id="s348">Not Belgium, Holland, France and England, I think, took them, yes.</span> <span id="s349">Of course, the ones who stayed in Holland didn't survive, not all of them.</span> <span id="s350">Some did, yes, who were on the "Saint Louis".</span> <span id="s351">And, well, I felt this was not for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">MS: Now, was your husband with you during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">MH: No.</span> <span id="s354">He was picked up in 1941-</span></p> <p><span id="s355">MS: Could you tell us a little about how that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">MH: In 1941, this was the first time a bomb exploded in a officer's villa, and this villa was...</span></p> <p><span id="s357">MS: German officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">MH: German officers.</span> <span id="s359">The villa was occupied by, it was owned, the owners were Jewish, a Jewish family, and they had to leave the big house, and they moved in, the Dutch officers, the German officers, sorry.</span> <span id="s360">And one morning, we heard that during the night, a bomb exploded, and the whole house was--no injuries at all.</span> <span id="s361">All the officers, nobody was in that house, and the house was destroyed.</span> <span id="s362">It was a three-story house, a very big house.</span> <span id="s363">And they blamed that the Jews did that.</span> <span id="s364">And their first action, they had a list from that club with every name, and they knew everybody who had a profession, and they tried to get all the intelligentsia first because they were too dangerous for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s365">And they got about also close to 400 young men of the age between 19 and 30.</span> <span id="s366">They made--a couple days afterwards.</span> <span id="s367">So I found that out from--when we first got married, we lived in a small apartment, and above us lived a family, and she was very much sort of, which is very common in Holland, they believe in reincarnation and all these things and spiritism and stars, and that was her hobby.</span> <span id="s368">And she wanted, she had called me a few days before, and she said, "Why doesn't Martin stay in town and come to us, and he will stay here, because I feel there is something going to happen," and, really, this sounds very silly really, three days later it did.</span> <span id="s369">And I was called that they are going to do something.</span> <span id="s370">Somebody called me that there is something going on.</span> <span id="s371">They are going to have action against Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">MS: In retaliation...</span></p> <p><span id="s373">MH: In retaliation for the bombing.</span> <span id="s374">And I called the office where my husband worked, and they told me he left.</span> <span id="s375">Of course, you know, he wasn't in the car, and things like this, at that time we didn’t have a car, he was somewhere on a bus or trolley car.</span> <span id="s376">And then when he got home, I saw him coming and with two SS men, and they said that he is, he has to come down to the headquarters, and I should give him a few things along.</span> <span id="s377">And I tried to bribe them.</span> <span id="s378">Of course, that was impossible.</span> <span id="s379">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s380">They said they would take me too.</span> <span id="s381">I said, "Take me."</span> <span id="s382">So they told me they didn't want me; they took him alone, and I found out that he's somewhere in Holland.</span> <span id="s383">And I tried to get there.</span> <span id="s384">It was somewhere near the University of Leiden, the big university in Holland.</span> <span id="s385">And I never got...</span></p> <p><span id="s386">MS: Was that another city that was...?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">MH: Yes, it was another city.</span> <span id="s388">And I never saw him.</span> <span id="s389">And when the Russian got into the war in 1941, and I think that was in June 1941, they liquidated that camp in Holland.</span> <span id="s390">I don’t know what kind of a camp, or if it was just a, it had about 400 young men there, and they sent them to Mauthausen, to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s391">And as I said, I got letters from Mauthausen, from my husband, three letters, which were, of course, censored, and he said that he's doing very well, and, but he thinks very often what this lady had told him, that he should come, and things like that.</span> <span id="s392">And that he has enough to eat, and he is reading a lot, because this was all censored, it was nothing.</span> <span id="s393">And then I got this certificate, September 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">MS: Which was, in effect, a death certificate?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">MH: A death certificate.</span> <span id="s396">That is a death certificate.</span> <span id="s397">It says "Sterbeurkunde", which means death certificate.</span> <span id="s398">And so did the others.</span> <span id="s399">And this was given to the Chief Rabbi of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s400">He was still around then.</span> <span id="s401">He never came back either.</span> <span id="s402">And we compared, you know, like with the parents of the young men, or the wives, we compared what we heard; we compared every letter.</span> <span id="s403">They got letters, and then everybody compared this death certificate, and it was identical the same, only was different names.</span> <span id="s404">And that was it.</span> <span id="s405">And after that, in 19, towards the end of 1941, that's when they started with the big actions against the Jews.</span> <span id="s406">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s407">MS: Did you give us, did you, I don't remember, did we put on the date, the month or so, when your husband was taken into custody, about what time of year was that, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">MH: It was in 1941, it was in June, no, it was before that, yes end of May or early June.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">MS: So that was almost a year after the...</span></p> <p><span id="s410">MH: No, no, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s411">May ‘40, we were, no, no, it was in ‘41.</span> <span id="s412">They only stayed there maybe in April ‘41, something like this.</span> <span id="s413">They invaded May ‘40, nothing happened, until ‘41.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">MS: Almost a year then?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">MH: Right, almost a year afterwards.</span> <span id="s416">Right.</span> <span id="s417">Because he was sent in June ‘41, they left Holland.</span> <span id="s418">So he was only a few months there.</span> <span id="s419">Could have been April or May.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">MS: And what were you doing during this time?</span> <span id="s421">Were you involved with the committee, with the underground at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">MH: No, at that time, not yet.</span> <span id="s423">But in--I was still at the Jewish committee, because I worked there.</span> <span id="s424">I had my card.</span> <span id="s425">And with that card, the Germans didn't pick you up right away.</span> <span id="s426">Eventually, they got everybody, no matter what.</span> <span id="s427">But at least for the time being, and I was approached by one man who also worked for the Jewish Council, and he asked me and he approached me for one reason, because he knew that I, my husband was taken away, and he said if I would like to work with him.</span> <span id="s428">And I first, I didn't think exactly what he meant.</span> <span id="s429">And then he said, "It would be very--they have a Dutch underground, and it's not, and they have sort--they have everywhere in every city, and everywhere they have people working, Jewish people, working underground.</span> <span id="s430">And if I would do that."</span> <span id="s431">And, of course, you know, I had no longer was in my apartment because then, right after that, a Jew could not have an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">MS: So then the restrictions started?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">MH: Started there.</span> <span id="s434">And in ‘41.</span> <span id="s435">Then, I like--family could have an apartment yet.</span> <span id="s436">So I moved into an apartment with a Jewish woman and her daughter; the husband was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">MS: Someone that you knew, or you were just assigned?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">MH: No, no.</span> <span id="s439">Yes, I had to look for myself.</span> <span id="s440">I had known them before.</span> <span id="s441">But then they were in the same vicinity where we lived.</span> <span id="s442">And then I was approached by this man when I lived there, and I agreed.</span> <span id="s443">And then she was, she was picked up one night, this was already in ‘41.</span> <span id="s444">She was picked up and they got me, too.</span> <span id="s445">And her daughter was somewhere with a friend, a non-Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s446">So when I got into, where they got assembled all the people, I saw this man who approached me, and he said, "You're going to be out tonight again."</span> <span id="s447">And I was back.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">MS: Then he got you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">MH: Yes, immediately.</span> <span id="s450">And I went back to that apartment, and I was there by myself.</span> <span id="s451">So, because nobody bothered me, and I just went back, and I was there.</span> <span id="s452">And the people who lived above me--there was a three-story building, was not a high-rise, the people below on the first floor, we were on the second floor--on the third floor, they knew that I was there, and they were with us.</span> <span id="s453">They were Dutch non-Jews, they were with us, certainly.</span> <span id="s454">And I found out where her daughter is, and we got, through this friend who lived in the next street, she got everything out, first from our apartment, and then also my things I had in that apartment, and also the things from this woman.</span> <span id="s455">A lot of the things.</span> <span id="s456">Not furniture, but linens and clothing and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">MS: And after the war, were you able to retrieve them?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">MH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">MS: You were able to get them back?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">MH: I got everything back.</span> <span id="s461">Everything but the groceries, which she apologized even, because we had, before we--in 1940, everybody was buying and buying things, you know, like soap and all those things, and she had them hidden, all this.</span> <span id="s462">She had eight Jewish girls, in a six-room apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">MS: Do you have any idea how she was able to physically hide these girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">MH: Yes, she did.</span> <span id="s465">They knew, you know, after 9:00, Jews weren't allowed to go in the street.</span> <span id="s466">Of course, you had to wear the star.</span> <span id="s467">If you didn't wear the star, you were all right.</span> <span id="s468">You could risk it.</span> <span id="s469">And, so then I--they also went from house to house, and even if they didn't have a list, they knocked at her door.</span> <span id="s470">Now, in these buildings, she lived, this friend of mine, she lived in a high-rise, which the high-rise was what, eight stories it was a high-rise at that time, you know, it was many years ago.</span> <span id="s471">And then she lived on the ground floor.</span> <span id="s472">And when you had the ground floor, you had a garden.</span> <span id="s473">The others had a big balcony towards the back.</span> <span id="s474">And she had a garden house, and when somebody came and she saw, everything was dark, of course, you know, they had--as everything had to be dark, no lights in the street.</span> <span id="s475">And when she saw the Nazis coming, through the back kitchen door, those eight girls went into the garden house.</span> <span id="s476">And, you know, she was a very, very charming woman, and she talked to them, and she said, "Come in, and I'm here by myself."</span> <span id="s477">and you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s478">MS: Would they come in and search the apartments?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">MH: I don't know.</span> <span id="s480">I don't think they searched it.</span> <span id="s481">They believed her.</span> <span id="s482">And that she had several times.</span> <span id="s483">Now, they--my things, and things from other Jewish girls she had.</span> <span id="s484">She had, like, see like, on top, between the living-room and the dining-room, there was a hollow space, and they had opened the wall, and in there were hollow.</span> <span id="s485">In there were all the things--the radios, the linens, the, whatever.</span> <span id="s486">My silverware was hidden there.</span> <span id="s487">Even my quilts were there, my down quilts were there.</span> <span id="s488">Everything she had.</span> <span id="s489">She grabbed whatever she could.</span> <span id="s490">And so she--these girls survived.</span> <span id="s491">And when I came back, I lived with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">MS: When you came back from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">MH: From Auschwitz, from Bergen-Belsen, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">MS: Well, that's the end of your story.</span> <span id="s495">So, where did we leave off with your particular episode, they had taken you into a school, and then you were released...</span></p> <p><span id="s496">MH: I was out the same evening, the same evening I was out.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">MS: OK.</span> <span id="s498">So tell us a little of how you functioned in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">MH: OK.</span> <span id="s500">I got in, since I had worked in the Jewish Committee, through that he got me out somehow, and since I had worked there, and I had went there pretty much every day, and then we were, I was assigned to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s501">I was assigned to bring papers.</span> <span id="s502">I was what they call that time a courier.</span> <span id="s503">I was a courier.</span> <span id="s504">And I had permission to travel to the Hague to bring papers.</span> <span id="s505">See, the Jewish Committee had to work for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s506">They did, because they had all the papers there.</span> <span id="s507">They had everything there.</span> <span id="s508">And they just came, they were, they checked it.</span> <span id="s509">So, this was my job.</span> <span id="s510">I got papers to be sent.</span> <span id="s511">And then, when the action started, and they picked up Jewish people every night by alphabet...</span></p> <p><span id="s512">MS: From lists of names?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">MH: From lists of names.</span> <span id="s514">They had them all.</span> <span id="s515">So, of course, some went underground, like Anne Frank and her sister and her parents, they went underground, and some didn't.</span> <span id="s516">Some didn't have a chance anymore.</span> <span id="s517">It's very difficult, and you have to put yourself in that suddenly.</span> <span id="s518">You live there in peace, and suddenly people go to pick you up, you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s519">And it hit the Dutch people, Dutch-born people, always lived in Holland, very hard, because they lived in a country where there was no war, freedom, very big democracy...</span></p> <p><span id="s520">MS: And no differentiation in religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">MH: No.</span> <span id="s522">Definitely not.</span> <span id="s523">And, so, it was very, very hard for these people, and that's how they got them.</span> <span id="s524">Now, they had no room anymore, where to get all the Jews from Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s525">So the ghetto, formerly ghetto, which started in the 14th century, which is called the Judenbeestrasse [phonetic] which means the Jewish wide street.</span> <span id="s526">It had a gate, they still had it.</span> <span id="s527">That's where Rembrandt lived, and that's where all the people who came through from the Spanish Inquisition in the 14th century, where they, a lot of them lived there.</span> <span id="s528">A lot of businesses, a lot of diamond dealers, and things like that.</span> <span id="s529">Painters...</span></p> <p><span id="s530">MS: It was a Jewish quarter?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">MH: It was a Jewish quarter.</span> <span id="s532">But not anymore.</span> <span id="s533">Anybody could live there.</span> <span id="s534">But it was a Jewish quarter, and they built a big Portuguese synagogue, one of the most famous...</span></p> <p><span id="s535">MS: In other words, like a section of the city...</span></p> <p><span id="s536">MH: A section of the city, and that was the Old City.</span> <span id="s537">Now, the Old City, part of it, people had moved out, and moved into where we lived, in the new Amsterdam, and we lived in the southern part of the Neve [Dutch for new] Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s538">So there was a theater in that neighborhood which was closed because all the Dutch government had decided they will restore this with the same old buildings, to have it more like--because this was from the 14th century, they wanted to restore that.</span> <span id="s539">So this theater was empty.</span> <span id="s540">Across the theater was a Jewish orphanage, and that was empty because they had replaced, put them somewhere else because they wanted to rebuild and restore the whole section.</span> <span id="s541">And this man, by the name of Suskind, [phonetic], he was the leader of this, he also is in the book, Walter Suskind.</span> <span id="s542">Walter Suskind was my boss.</span> <span id="s543">OK?</span> <span id="s544">Now, he has, he talked to me about all this, and he said, "What we are doing now?</span> <span id="s545">We are going to try to save the children from transport."</span> <span id="s546">And what we did, that theater, we were assigned by the Germans, a group of 10, two women and eight men, yes, a group of ten, two women and eight men, to live in the orphanage across the street of the theater.</span> <span id="s547">Our duty was to register the infants in the theater.</span> <span id="s548">All the Jews they picked up had to be registered.</span> <span id="s549">Our duty was to take the children away from the parents, clean them, infants mostly, clean them, and bring them back into the theater.</span> <span id="s550">In Dutch, it was called the Shauser, that is like theater, really, a showplace, something like this literally translated.</span> <span id="s551">And this Walter Suskind said to us, said to me, that we are allowed, we get ration cards, and we have all this, but we have to register.</span> <span id="s552">And I, first I said to him, "You mean we have to work for the Nazis?"</span> <span id="s553">He said to me then, "Yes, what we are doing is a mitzvah."</span> <span id="s554">And then he explained to us, he explained to everybody, about how they're going to work it.</span> <span id="s555">By then, Holland had no cigarettes, no cigars, no liquor.</span> <span id="s556">We got everything to give the Nazis, especially liquor.</span> <span id="s557">Through the Mayor of Amsterdam, he was very helpful, we got ration cards, and the idea was this: when the children came into that orphanage, we had to clean them up, we had to put fresh diapers on them, and wrap them up in blankets, and bring them over for transport.</span> <span id="s558">When they were infant...</span></p> <p><span id="s559">MS: Can I ask you a question?</span> <span id="s560">These children were taken away from...?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">MH: From the parents.</span> <span id="s562">The parents were already across the street, but the children, they had to give to one of us ten.</span> <span id="s563">One of the ten.</span> <span id="s564">They had to give them, one of them, a child, you know, or children, infants mostly, and we had to--they didn't want them to be dirty or do it; the Germans wanted them clean.</span> <span id="s565">So that's what we did.</span> <span id="s566">Now--the truck picked up those children, and they were accompanied by the driver and maybe one or two other men or women, non-Jewish, and they went into the country and delivered the children to the farmers, mostly farmers, and gave them special ration cards, which were not, were copies, were not the real ones, and they kept the children.</span> <span id="s567">And this was going every night for quite a while.</span> <span id="s568">At times, we could get a bigger child in between.</span> <span id="s569">And those children--the parents were sent away without the children.</span> <span id="s570">We did not inform the parents what we did because we were afraid that they might talk.</span> <span id="s571">And this was our duty.</span> <span id="s572">We were sitting with the Nazis there, in Register also.</span> <span id="s573">Some of us had to register, and then we brought the children over, but they believed us.</span> <span id="s574">They gave--really not believed us, but we gave them so many things.</span> <span id="s575">We gave them cigarettes, and we gave them liquor, and they were mostly, they were pretty much drunk.</span> <span id="s576">And they didn't realize that we took the children into the big hall where their parents were, they didn't realize, that there was no child, we had a different exit.</span> <span id="s577">We knew exactly the whole layout of the theatre, and we went out the other way, got back to the orphanage, and that was it.</span> <span id="s578">And there were...</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Tape Two, Side One:</span></p> <p><span id="s580">MS: OK.</span> <span id="s581">Continue with the story.</span> <span id="s582">The children were being taken out of the home.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">MH: And I said, how... [not audible] OK.</span> <span id="s584">And this is the way we continued.</span> <span id="s585">And I was also, as I said before, I was a courier, which is really to bring papers, various papers from the Jewish Council to the Hague or to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s586">One day, I found out, through Walter Suskind, that two of the boys who--they were not with us, but they belonged to the same group, two Jewish boys were caught--also worked in a different department of the underground.</span> <span id="s587">They were caught.</span> <span id="s588">And they were in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s589">Since I could go in and out of Westerbork, I was chosen to go to Westerbork with false ID cards, to stay there one night, and to try to get these two boys through the checkpoint.</span> <span id="s590">They were around the age of 19 and 20.</span> <span id="s591">And I had all the papers in a separate compartment in my briefcase.</span> <span id="s592">It was sort of a huge wallet.</span> <span id="s593">And I went to the checkpoint--the checkpoint, at the checkpoint, the Jewish prisoners were working there.</span> <span id="s594">And when I got there, I had to show my ID cards, and I was assigned to one of the bungalows where people, where the prisoners, where they had still prisoners there--the only thing--they also had barracks.</span> <span id="s595">The Germans got that camp, Westerbork, and they left the bungalows, but they built big three-story barracks, sort of wooden barracks, and they put an electrified fence around the camp.</span> <span id="s596">And they had a prison in the camp, too, besides the barracks, they had also a prison.</span> <span id="s597">And when I checked in, I showed my papers, and somehow I had those two ID cards in a tiny little compartment, and they must have gotten out, how, I don't know, and when I walked down the street in Westerbork, I wanted to make sure that I had those, that everything was OK, my ID card, my own card, and all this, and as I looked, I couldn't find the cards for those boys, the two false ID cards, without a J for those boys.</span> <span id="s598">I couldn’t find them.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">MS: You must have been terror-stricken at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">MH: I certainly was, and I went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">MS: Back to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">MH: To the checkpoint, and I talked to the fellow who was there at the desk, and I knew him quite well, and I said, "Did you see anything I left here?"</span> <span id="s603">He said.</span> <span id="s604">"No, I didn't see anything."</span> <span id="s605">And I asked him, "Who was here?"</span></p> <p><span id="s606">MS: From the time you were there to the time you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">MH: Right.</span> <span id="s608">"Who was in here?"</span> <span id="s609">He said, "Hans Totman."</span> <span id="s610">Then I knew my goose was cooked.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">MS: Who was this Hans Totman?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">MH: Hans Totman was the Assistant to the Camp Commander in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s613">He was a Jew, a journalist from Berlin.</span> <span id="s614">He was not just a--he spied for the Nazis against the Jews.</span> <span id="s615">He also was on a list of the Canadian Army when they came into Holland, and on the list of the British Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">MS: As what?</span> <span id="s617">As a wanted...</span></p> <p><span id="s618">MH: As a wanted criminal.</span> <span id="s619">And, when I knew that he was there, I walked out and I walked back to the place I was assigned to stay overnight.</span> <span id="s620">I never made it.</span> <span id="s621">Right on the street, I was picked up by two SS men, and was put into prison.</span> <span id="s622">Three weeks in solitary confinement.</span> <span id="s623">Interrogation during the night, and I was asked questions: "Who, what did I want to do?</span> <span id="s624">Whom do I want to get out of Westerbork?</span> <span id="s625">And what am I doing in Amsterdam?"</span> <span id="s626">They never got anything out from me because I figured, if I do so, that whole group, the whole Jewish underground, would have gone up in blazes.</span> <span id="s627">So, I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">MS: You [unclear] it, and were subjected to torture?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">MH: Yes, I was subjected to torture, but I felt I couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s630">And they sent me cigarettes, I was allowed to have a cigarette.</span> <span id="s631">I never smoked, and they sent me cigarettes.</span> <span id="s632">And there were messages from Walter Suskind: "We know you, and you will not talk.</span> <span id="s633">You cannot talk."</span> <span id="s634">They had it handrolled with that tobacco in there, and when you opened it up, there were messages: "We are trying to get you out.</span> <span id="s635">We are trying to do everything for you, but don't talk.</span> <span id="s636">You must not talk."</span> <span id="s637">They had that underlined and underlined.</span> <span id="s638">So after three weeks, I didn’t talk, no matter what they did.</span> <span id="s639">They had, all night long, water dripping-it was one of their punishments besides bodily punishment.</span> <span id="s640">And after three weeks, my cell door opened, and I was told that I will be transferred to a barrack.</span> <span id="s641">Then I knew that I’m going on transport, because why would they do that to me?</span> <span id="s642">They didn’t let me out.</span> <span id="s643">I was one week in the barrack, and I was told I’m going on transport.</span> <span id="s644">Not only was I told I’m going on transport, I was told that whatever clothes I have in my apartment, they have to come to Westerbork, because I need my clothes wherever I go to work camp.</span> <span id="s645">I need the clothes.</span> <span id="s646">So, I didn’t have so very much there, but I gave them the key.</span> <span id="s647">Of course, I couldn’t tell them that my girlfriend had taken out most of it, and they brought some clothes for me, and I had a suitcase, and they brought the suitcase, and that is how I had to be gone.</span> <span id="s648">I went on transport with a special escort.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">MS: Was it just you alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">MH: No, it was a regular transport.</span> <span id="s651">Oh no, they wouldn’t have wasted the money for me…</span></p> <p><span id="s652">MS: No, no.</span> <span id="s653">I thought maybe this was a plan to get you released.</span> <span id="s654">You know, I</span></p> <p><span id="s655">MH: No, it was a transport.</span> <span id="s656">And there was this man, Hans Totman, standing right at the platform.</span> <span id="s657">He wore the high boots like the Nazis, but not uniform.</span> <span id="s658">He was a Jew.</span> <span id="s659">And he said to me, "I'm sorry but you should have not worked against the German," when he saw me.</span> <span id="s660">Well, I had a special SS man with me.</span> <span id="s661">Didn't mean a darn thing.</span> <span id="s662">We were stuck into one of those cattle cars, and the journey was about three to four days.</span> <span id="s663">Once they opened up and threw some bread in, and once we could get out to have some water.</span> <span id="s664">And that was it.</span> <span id="s665">It was just standing-room-only practically.</span> <span id="s666">People died within the cars, there was no facilities, no way, no sanitary facility, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">MS: You had no idea where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">MH: We had no idea where we were going.</span> <span id="s669">So when we arrived, it was Auschwitz, and it was Birkenau.</span> <span id="s670">Birkenau was a camp, really, and Auschwitz, where you were, it was all Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s671">They had many, many camps around there, but it was all one big Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s672">But the transport and the gas ovens were in Birkenau, which was very close to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s673">And, well, when I got there, first they--you had to take all your clothes off, put it on a pile, then you had to walk in front of the SS, and then they shaved your hair completely, and then you were divided up, like left, right and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">MS: That was the selection?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">MH: That was the selection.</span> <span id="s676">I was wondering why people with children didn't go to the right side, and I was chosen to go there and to pick out some clothes, which...</span></p> <p><span id="s677">MS: To the right side?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">MH: Right, it was the right side yes.</span> <span id="s679">And there was a heap of shoes from other prisoners before, and you had to pick out, if it fit or didn't fit, and you got a--no regular clothes, you got a uniform, blue and white stripes.</span> <span id="s680">You got a dress and a jacket, and that was it.</span> <span id="s681">Then you were assigned to your barrack in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s682">And, there was also three beds on top of each other, one three-stories, they were your bunk-beds, about four to five girls in one bunk.</span> <span id="s683">And then we got--every morning, was roll call.</span> <span id="s684">And then you got your rations, which existed of a can of coffee, which was a horrible brew, and a half a slice of, a half a loaf of black bread, and then you got again a soup, potato peel soup.</span> <span id="s685">That was your ration for the day, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">MS: Were you assigned to a work or a..</span> <span id="s687">.</span> <span id="s688">?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">MH: No, we were--we did unproductive labor in the beginning when I came.</span> <span id="s690">We had to carry bricks from one end of the street to the next end of the street.</span> <span id="s691">Then I was assigned to work in the water drainage with pick and shovel.</span> <span id="s692">And then I had another assignment, they picked me out to work in the kitchen, and I thought, "Gee, I will get some more food."</span> <span id="s693">But I was only working in the prisoners' kitchen, carrying 50-pounds soup kettles with another girl.</span> <span id="s694">And we had to run with that, not walk.</span> <span id="s695">We had to run and that was our work which we had.</span> <span id="s696">We might have got a little more soup, but that was all, the same soup you got in camp, it was all.</span> <span id="s697">And one day, we were on roll call--most of it was in the morning, in the night, it was always counting, it was always roll call, and one day, an entourage of SS officers came.</span> <span id="s698">Not just the usual our, which they called the kapo, was the block Älteste [block elder].</span> <span id="s699">The woman who was in charge.</span> <span id="s700">She was also a prisoner, but she wasn't Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">MS: She was not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">MH: No.</span> <span id="s703">There was never a Jewish block Älteste, never a Jewish kapo.</span> <span id="s704">Not as far as I know.</span> <span id="s705">And so, there were a few higher ranks coming in there from the SS, and they counted, and when he got to me, he stopped and took me out, and he said to me, "Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s706">I said, "Certainly".</span> <span id="s707">I had the star.</span> <span id="s708">There I had a different star, you know, the German Jews.</span> <span id="s709">And I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s710">He said, "How come you are so light, and you have blue eyes, and you're blond?"</span> <span id="s711">I said, "Yes, I'm Jewish."</span> <span id="s712">OK, he was convinced I'm Jewish, even he saw all this.</span> <span id="s713">And he said, "Do you speak German?"</span> <span id="s714">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s715">"Can you write German?"</span> <span id="s716">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s717">"Can you do German stenography?"</span> <span id="s718">(which I didn’t), but I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s719">And he said, "OK, out," and I went onto the jeep with another girl on the jeep, and we didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s720">No idea where we were going.</span> <span id="s721">And we finally were riding in his jeep and, for the first time...</span></p> <p><span id="s722">MS: Did you go out of the camp environment?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">MH: Yes, completely out.</span> <span id="s724">And the first time, I saw away from the crematorium, and I saw green, really, green hills and a lot of fields growing vegetables, all this; so that was the camp.</span> <span id="s725">The name of the camp was Budy.</span> <span id="s726">It was also Auschwitz, but it was Budy.</span> <span id="s727">They had--they were only like selected, sort of, not selected people, we were--there were 400, or more than that, Ukrainian girls there.</span> <span id="s728">These were girls who were picked up-in Germany in factories because Germany needed--had no people to work, men and women, to work in the factories, because the men were all in the war.</span> <span id="s729">And these girls were, most of them could not write nor read.</span> <span id="s730">And they were picked--they did not ever had seen a factory; they were from the little towns, little villages, little farms in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s731">And they were runaway, because they were scared of the factory.</span> <span id="s732">So they picked them up, and they were put into that camp.</span> <span id="s733">Then there were the Jehovah Witnesses were there; they were in a separate camp, and there were doing, they were walking with the animals, with the geese, the chickens.</span> <span id="s734">They were the shepherds for all these animals they had there.</span> <span id="s735">And then they had a group of who were with us, were a group of 15 prostitutes, German prostitutes, who had went to bed with a non-Aryan, maybe a Turk, maybe, whatever they had--rather not Turkey at that time, but like an Italian or, wherever they had people from the occupied country.</span> <span id="s736">And they were with us.</span> <span id="s737">They had the privilege--most of the girls all the girls had hair, only, also a few Jewish girls had hair there.</span> <span id="s738">They didn't shave their heads.</span> <span id="s739">The others got packages; we did not.</span> <span id="s740">They had received packages from wherever they came from, from home, and we were all, we were together in that same camp.</span> <span id="s741">So I was told that I will be the secretary of this big Oberscharfuhrer – he had a big rank.</span> <span id="s742">He was the man in charge of all the agriculture which was planted in that camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s743">MS: Within Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">MH: Within Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s745">All the vegetables and potatoes and so forth were going to the Eastern front.</span> <span id="s746">They were transported to the Eastern front.</span> <span id="s747">And I was his secretary, and the other girl, she was a graphic designer before she came into Auschwitz, and she did all the designing and the plans for the planting for him.</span> <span id="s748">We were two Jewish girls working.</span> <span id="s749">Then they had a small hospital in that camp.</span> <span id="s750">Now, where we were working that was not the camp--it was his private house.</span> <span id="s751">In his private home, that was near the fence, near the freedom that was in the compound.</span> <span id="s752">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s753">MS: Did you live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">MH: No.</span> <span id="s755">No way.</span> <span id="s756">Every morning, we went there with a German guard and a shepherd, with his bayonet pointed towards us, if we would have stepped out or said anything.</span> <span id="s757">Then he had one, only the two of us in his house working, and he had a cook, who also did not live there, who was from the Ukraine, a Ukrainian girl.</span> <span id="s758">And then, they had a hospital, a small hospital.</span> <span id="s759">The doctor was Jewish, from Italy.</span> <span id="s760">They had a dentist from France, and then they had an assistant dentist from--she was from Germany.</span> <span id="s761">And then they had another Jewish girl who was working for another man nearby in the office.</span> <span id="s762">So--that's what saved my life.</span> <span id="s763">I would say that saved my life, because not that we were away from Birkenau, which was very important because we didn't have the smell everyday.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">MS: And you knew, of course, what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">MH: Of course we knew, and we didn't even care.</span> <span id="s766">We didn't care.</span> <span id="s767">So we knew that next day you didn't see somebody anymore.</span> <span id="s768">You knew they were taken to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s769">Now, to go back to that.</span> <span id="s770">I think I was extremely lucky, that's all I can say, because I had a small, wasn't called an operation, I had an ear infection while in Birkenau, and they had to open my ear, and they did not give you anesthesia, because they didn't even have anesthesia enough for their own.</span> <span id="s771">They didn't have the medicine.</span> <span id="s772">So, one of the Nazis said to me, "If you know what's good for you, you don't cry."</span> <span id="s773">One of the so-called doctors, I don’t know if he was a doctor.</span> <span id="s774">And I didn't cry.</span> <span id="s775">And I was put on a wagon with all the others who went to the crematorium, but when I got to my block, I was let out for some odd reason, and came back to my barrack.</span> <span id="s776">So I was so sure, you know, that I was never come back to the barrack because it was terrible to go to a hospital.</span> <span id="s777">You couldn't get sick.</span> <span id="s778">So then, when I got to Budy, my life has really changed.</span> <span id="s779">My life and the life of this girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">MS: How would you have spelled that word--Buddy?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">MH: Buddy?</span> <span id="s782">Buddy.</span> <span id="s783">[Correct spelling is Budy.]</span></p> <p><span id="s784">MS: And that was the name of the little camp, of the camp where the agriculture, where everything was planted.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">MS: Now let me see if I'm following you correctly, Malvina.</span> <span id="s786">When you became sick with the ear infection, was this before...</span></p> <p><span id="s787">MH: Before Budy.</span> <span id="s788">It was in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s789">That was in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">MS: I see, before you were taken out by this German...</span></p> <p><span id="s791">MH: Of course, I was one year in Budy in the winter, and that saved my life.</span> <span id="s792">Because I was inside.</span> <span id="s793">I did all his letters.</span> <span id="s794">He was a--to us he was sort of decent.</span> <span id="s795">That didn’t mean that he would kill a man who stole something, stole an onion.</span> <span id="s796">He killed one man for that, one Jew, and the man, in the camp where the men were.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">MS: Did you see any of these brutalities?</span> <span id="s798">Were you a witness to any?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">MH: Oh, we knew it.</span> <span id="s800">There was a fence in between, but we knew it.</span> <span id="s801">We got everything; we knew exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s802">Somehow we had people smuggled some notes out or things like this.</span> <span id="s803">We knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s804">But he was fairly decent to us.</span> <span id="s805">And we stole quite a bit.</span> <span id="s806">We went every night back to the camp with tomatoes, which was very necessary, and onions.</span> <span id="s807">They were our vitamins.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">MS: Then you were taking your chances, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">MH: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s810">The minute he was out of the camp, of his house, we went out, and the cook--she was also--she stole too, and she gave us things.</span> <span id="s811">We went down to the basement, and his mother had sent him jam and homemade things, and we took that all along.</span> <span id="s812">We couldn't manage every night, so we stuffed it into the--near the typewriter, and where the other girl--near her, in her drawer.</span> <span id="s813">And she always had thread and needle in her drawer.</span> <span id="s814">And one night, he told us that he got into the office because he wanted to sew a button on his uniform, and he opened the drawer, and he saw his mother's jam, and he saw, and he looked in the waste-paper basket, and we had that nicely covered, and he looked at all the fruit we had gotten, all the onions, all the tomatoes, and we couldn't take that every night.</span> <span id="s815">We took every night a little bit.</span> <span id="s816">And he--when we got into the office, the floor was full of that.</span> <span id="s817">Everything was out of the drawers laying on the floor, and he came in, and he said to us, to the girl and myself, he said to us that he is going to send us back to Birkenau, and that means that we are going to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s818">And we cried all day.</span> <span id="s819">And we told him that we give him our word of honor, and what he said, what the Jewish word of honor means, I couldn't repeat it.</span> <span id="s820">It was a very terrible four-letter word that was the Jewish word of honor would mean to him.</span> <span id="s821">And he said he will shave our heads again.</span> <span id="s822">So we cried, and he needed us because he knew that he could depend--she was excellent in her work, and I did my best.</span> <span id="s823">And he was used to us.</span> <span id="s824">And in fact, he was very unhappy with the cook because she couldn't cook very well.</span> <span id="s825">And I had my brother-in-law's sister from Holland; I had met her in Auschwitz on the street in Birkenau, and she worked in the underground in Auschwitz too in a munition factory that was underground.</span> <span id="s826">There was a munition factory...</span></p> <p><span id="s827">MS: Oh, I thought you meant the other kind of underground...</span></p> <p><span id="s828">MH: No.</span> <span id="s829">An underground factory.</span> <span id="s830">And, she wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s831">So I mentioned it to him that I know my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s832">I said it's my sister-in-law, she would like the job.</span> <span id="s833">So he asked, "Is she Jewish?"</span> <span id="s834">So I said, "Certainly."</span> <span id="s835">"I can't take her, she would poison me.”</span></p> <p><span id="s836">MS: Well, the cook he had then was a non-Jew, a Ukrainian?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">MH: Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s838">By the way, the Ukrainians were worse than the Nazis.</span> <span id="s839">They told us, if they had freedom, they would kill us.</span> <span id="s840">They would slaughter us.</span> <span id="s841">We were only six Jewish women there, in that whole camp of about 500-600 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">MS: In Budy?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">MH: In Budy, yes.</span> <span id="s844">So, he must have forgiven us, and he said, "OK."</span> <span id="s845">We said we would never do that, but then the winter came and we had no--nothing on our heads.</span> <span id="s846">We had hair then, short, but we had hair.</span> <span id="s847">So we realized that his mother had sent him material for curtain, and Vera was a great, so handy in sewing, so she made two kerchiefs for us, for each kerchiefs--it was afterwards, we had kerchiefs.</span> <span id="s848">And we just figured, well we have to, when we kept on doing things again, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">MS: He didn't catch you?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">MH: He didn't catch us, no.</span> <span id="s851">So, that's what we did, and that was partly, I say that was our survival.</span> <span id="s852">Something else was a survival, which I heard recently from this girl, I finally found her.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">MS: The girl that you worked with?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">MH: Yes, Vera was here.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">MS: Would you tell us about it, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">MH: Yes, OK.</span> <span id="s857">Well, let me tell you first, OK, I can tell you that.</span> <span id="s858">You want me to say it now, or later?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">MS: Now, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">MH: OK.</span> <span id="s861">Vera and I, we became great friends.</span> <span id="s862">And when we were liberated, in 1945, everybody had to go back to the country where you came from, regardless where you were born.</span> <span id="s863">She came from Czechoslovakia, from Prague.</span> <span id="s864">She went back; I went to Holland.</span> <span id="s865">We wrote to each other, and–in Holland.</span> <span id="s866">When I came to this country, I took her address, and she sent me pictures.</span> <span id="s867">She had gotten married--from her husband, when they got married in front of City Hall in Prague, and she sent me a few other pictures, and she was very happy.</span> <span id="s868">When I came here, I had the pictures, and I had her address, and I wanted to write.</span> <span id="s869">Then, of course, after we were married.</span> <span id="s870">And when we were married, and I said to my husband, "Look, I would like to write to Vera."</span> <span id="s871">And he said," Where does she live?"</span> <span id="s872">I said, "Czechoslovakia, I have her address."</span> <span id="s873">And he said, "You can't do that."</span> <span id="s874">because at that time, Senator McCarthy was around, and he said, "This is no good, because everybody is a Communist.</span> <span id="s875">If you do that, and that letter might get into false hand, we are in trouble, because Czechoslovakia was a Communist country."</span> <span id="s876">In 19... a year and a half ago, yes, a year and a half ago, our Rabbi organized a trip to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">MS: All right, let me interrupt you.</span> <span id="s878">I want that part of the story, but I think we're going to have to come back to it because I don't want to lose too much of the thread.</span> <span id="s879">All right, now, you were saying that you were back in, you were still in Budy, and you were still able to do a few things to help yourselves through.</span> <span id="s880">All right.</span> <span id="s881">And then what happened, How long did you stay with this officer, with Vera in this office?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">MH: One year.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">MS: One year, OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">MH: And in January, early January 1945, Auschwitz was liquidated, and we had--we knew it because we saw the Russian planes flying over Auschwitz, we--saw that.</span> <span id="s885">Not that they didn't bomb for some odd reason.</span> <span id="s886">I don't know if they didn't know what it was, but we saw the Russian planes.</span> <span id="s887">And there was an announcement in Budy, and that the whole camp of Auschwitz will be liquidated, and we are going to move west, towards the west, away from the Russian, the Russian border, Polish border; we are going.</span> <span id="s888">That was the famous march, the famous transport by foot.</span> <span id="s889">We were thousands and thousands of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">MS: And you were included in that march?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">MH: We were included in that march.</span> <span id="s892">Vera and I were given, by another SS man, who always told us that he doesn't believe that Germany will win because it's going to an end.</span> <span id="s893">It’s very bad on the Eastern front, and he told us, he is giving us each a pair of boots, because he said, "When you go with those shoes, you will not survive."</span></p> <p><span id="s894">MS: Was this the same officer that... ?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">MH: No, no, it was another one who had another office where another Jewish girl was working.</span> <span id="s896">But he came to us too because they worked sort of hand in hand, and he told us that, and he gave us each a pair of boots, regular Nazi boots, those heavy boots.</span> <span id="s897">And that's how we took off.</span> <span id="s898">Walking, we walked about three days and two nights: We walked over the River Vistula.</span> <span id="s899">It was 35, at least 35 below zero.</span> <span id="s900">A river like the Vistula, is a huge river, was frozen that we walked across, and we rested once, and the announcement was whoever steps out will be shot because we had guards with us.</span> <span id="s901">They had to walk with us, and they drove on their motorcycle next to us, and whoever went out, whoever collapsed was just killed right there and left there.</span> <span id="s902">So we finally arrived in a, in Silesia, Upper Silesia, more close to Germany, where we rested, and we got something to eat, some coffee and some bread, and then we were put in another, in one of those famous cattle cars, and we arrived in Buchenwald, the famous camp where the Commandant was a woman who made lampshades out of human skin.</span> <span id="s903">We only stayed there for a short while, not even a week.</span> <span id="s904">Without any, nothing, not doing anything.</span> <span id="s905">After that, we went again into a cattle car, and we were...</span></p> <p><span id="s906">MS: That camp also was evacuated?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">MH: After us.</span> <span id="s908">Afterwards, that camp was also evacuated.</span> <span id="s909">But when we were left, it wasn’t evacuated then.</span> <span id="s910">And then we went from there to Bergen-Belsen, and that's where we arrived, in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s911">Now, Auschwitz was bad, but Bergen-Belsen was the worst.</span> <span id="s912">Bergen-Belsen was the pits.</span> <span id="s913">The people, they were laying dead on the street.</span> <span id="s914">Nothing was done.</span> <span id="s915">We had to carry the dead and put them into a field and throw them on top of each other.</span> <span id="s916">We had typhoid, from the typhoid, [typhus come from lice] the typhoid came from lice, lice in your clothes.</span> <span id="s917">We got some clothes, and we got some things, and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s918">We had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s919">There was no work, but we did, we had to bury the--not really, we had to ‘throw away the bodies’, we just had to throw them and they burned them somewhere.</span> <span id="s920">And we stayed there from January until April--April 15, 1945.</span> <span id="s921">We were all quite sick.</span> <span id="s922">We had still typhoid, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s923">MS: You were made to work, regardless?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">MH: No, we didn't work.</span> <span id="s925">We couldn't work.</span> <span id="s926">We didn't; there was no work for us.</span> <span id="s927">There was no work.</span> <span id="s928">Was just a dying camp, you know.</span> <span id="s929">They just let you die.</span> <span id="s930">On April 15, the--I felt already a little better, and Vera felt better too, because we knew, I knew a nurse from Holland, I knew her in Amsterdam, and we were very friendly, and she was there too, and she worked in the so-called hospital, and she gave us some injection in the barrack, and that helped us.</span> <span id="s931">And so, we noticed that no guards were there; everybody had left.</span> <span id="s932">One morning we get up, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Tape Two, Side Two:</span></p> <p><span id="s934">MH: And it didn't take very long, a few hours later, we saw our guards, the German guards, the women and the Commandant coming back with white handkerchiefs.</span> <span id="s935">And waving the white handkerchiefs.</span> <span id="s936">And when we saw them, we knew something was wrong there.</span> <span id="s937">They had no weapons with them, nothing.</span> <span id="s938">And then we saw the jeep, a couple of jeeps coming in with British soldiers, and they told us that "This is it.</span> <span id="s939">We have found this camp, and you are free now."</span> <span id="s940">Of course, we couldn't run out and things like that, they had to organize first.</span> <span id="s941">First they took the Commandant, and they said .</span> <span id="s942">.</span> <span id="s943">everything came over the loudspeaker, that the camp will be burned, and they are going to transfer us to a military camp in regular brick buildings, and there we are going to stay there until we're well, and we’re going to go back to our country.</span> <span id="s944">And then they said, "Whoever would like to come to a market place, they’re hanging the Commandant and his henchmen."</span> <span id="s945">And you know, we danced around that, and we were so, you think you're not human.</span> <span id="s946">And they hanged him, they hanged about three or four, and then they took all the women guards, shaved their heads, the British did that, and they had to clean all the toilets and clean up what was laying on the street.</span> <span id="s947">They did that.</span> <span id="s948">And then they shipped them into prison camps.</span> <span id="s949">And then they had again,.</span> <span id="s950">on the loudspeaker, and they gave us so much to eat, and whatever...</span></p> <p><span id="s951">MS: But this was very bad, though for the people...</span></p> <p><span id="s952">MH: Yes, it was very bad.</span> <span id="s953">A cousin, a second cousin of my mother was there, and she died in there from eating.</span> <span id="s954">So then we left the camp, and we went to this town near Hanover.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">MS: This is where the British...</span></p> <p><span id="s956">MH: The military camp, yes, where the British took us, and we were assorted in these various houses.</span> <span id="s957">They were regular military big brick houses, and the Dutch and the Belgian were in one house, and I think the French were with us.</span> <span id="s958">And then the Italian and the Greek and, you know, they had assorted, and we had to--and they had told us that we will have to go back once we are pretty much in good shape, they will send us back to the country, like to Holland or to Belgium or to France, to wherever they could go.</span> <span id="s959">The only ones, they said, will not go out of this camp will be the German and the Polish Jews, because there's no place for them to go.</span> <span id="s960">That’s when they started with the displaced person camps.</span> <span id="s961">That’s when they came into existence.</span> <span id="s962">So, then they needed people who speak English, and I spoke English before, and I helped them, and I went, you know, announcements and translation into German...</span></p> <p><span id="s963">MS: So you went to work then for the British Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">NH: Yes.</span> <span id="s965">I went to work then, but then they noticed that people died from eating.</span> <span id="s966">So there was a new announcement, “No food anymore, just plain bouillon and crackers.”</span> <span id="s967">That's all what we got for awhile.</span> <span id="s968">They gave us chocolates’, whatever they had they gave us.</span> <span id="s969">White bread, and we hadn’t seen that, you know, and everybody grabbed it.</span> <span id="s970">And, I had a very lovely experience.</span> <span id="s971">I got to talk to one of the British soldiers, I was on a truck with him with the announcement translation from English into German, and I said, "You know, I have a brother in London."</span> <span id="s972">He said, "How old is he ?"</span> <span id="s973">And I told him, and he said, "No, he can't be in London; there is no men in London."</span> <span id="s974">And he said, "You know his name?</span> <span id="s975">Write it down."</span> <span id="s976">He said, "Look, we have the, a lot of them come through, all the combat troops come through Hanover.</span> <span id="s977">I hang it in the mess hall.</span> <span id="s978">Maybe you find him."</span> <span id="s979">It took only three days when my brother found me.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">MS: Oh.</span> <span id="s981">how amazing</span></p> <p><span id="s982">MH: And he was not allowed to come into the camp, so he must have talked to his Commander, and he let him get in for only very, very shortly.</span> <span id="s983">Because he was a combat, they didn't let him in.</span> <span id="s984">These were special troops who were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">MS: Well, was your brother being sent to a front at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">MH: Yes, he came from the front, rather, he was then sent into, he went to Belgium.</span> <span id="s987">It was already Holland, yes.</span> <span id="s988">He was still in Germany.</span> <span id="s989">When I was in Holland, he was still in Germany, and then he was transferred to Belgium, in the depot, what was it, he brought all the food, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s990">MS: Quartermaster?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">MH: Quartermaster's depot.</span> <span id="s992">He was there, yes.</span> <span id="s993">He was no longer in the fighting, no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">MS: But they only let you see him for a very short period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">MH: Very short period.</span> <span id="s996">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">MS: So what happened then?</span> <span id="s998">Did you make plans to... ?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">MH: He looked at me, and he said, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s1000">That's what he said.</span> <span id="s1001">And then we were sent to Holland.</span> <span id="s1002">My girlfriend Vera went to Czechoslovakia, and I was sent to Holland, and I came back to Holland, I couldn't go back to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1003">Nobody could go back to the town where they lived.</span> <span id="s1004">We were put in, at the German border into a school which was converted into a hospital, because we still had germs.</span> <span id="s1005">They could not let us go into the free world with our germs.</span> <span id="s1006">So we were examined like twice, three times a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">MS: It was sort of isolation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">MH: Isolation.</span> <span id="s1009">That was an isolation.</span> <span id="s1010">Special rations because Holland after the war had rations yet.</span> <span id="s1011">Special, very, very careful with food, and all this, and then we were after that, and it was April, I think, we stayed there for four weeks yet, and after this, in the isolation, yes, in that town in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1012">Of course, we were treated very human.</span> <span id="s1013">Even so, some said we are hungry, and we had only certain food, they tried very little with us, not to eat suddenly so much.</span> <span id="s1014">And then I got back to Amsterdam, and in Amsterdam, there was nobody but that one friend...</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">MS: The same woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">MH: The same woman who had my things.</span> <span id="s1017">And I..</span> <span id="s1018">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">MS: When you say there was nobody, what happened...</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">MH: Nobody in my family, yes.</span> <span id="s1021">And no one I knew, no cousins, not my family in Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s1022">They were all gone; they were taken away, the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">MS: Well, at that point, I guess you didn't know what the next step would be in trying to find someone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">MH: Right.</span> <span id="s1025">Well, they had everywhere--I found friends of my parents in the Hague, but she was married to a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s1026">So they were safe, yes, and their children, so they were safe.</span> <span id="s1027">And so then from, in Amsterdam, I wrote to my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1028">I had her address...</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">MS: This is Vera?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">MH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1031">Not Vera, that was my girlfriend who had all the things, and I lived with her.</span> <span id="s1032">I lived with her until I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">MS: How long a period of time was that, that you remained in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">MH: Holland?</span> <span id="s1035">Until 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">MS: I see.</span> <span id="s1037">For two years then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">MH: Yes, for two years I stayed yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">MS: And did you go back to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">MH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1041">That was when I worked for that, as a manufacturer's model.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">MS: I see.</span> <span id="s1043">Tell us a little about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">MH: Well, I got the job through--we knew these people, and we had met these people before, and somehow they had survived.</span> <span id="s1045">They were friends of this lawyer I had told you, and by coincident I met him on the street, and I had just shortly been back, and he said, "Well, would you want to work for us?"</span> <span id="s1046">and that's what I did.</span> <span id="s1047">I worked until I came here, yes.</span> <span id="s1048">And that's where I worked, and then I tried to find--my first trip was going to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s1049">I wanted to see if anybody was left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">MS: You went back...</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">MH: Right, and I found some of the people who worked in the underground together, and I couldn't find Walter Suskind.</span> <span id="s1052">Him I couldn't find.</span> <span id="s1053">And then I found out that he didn't come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">MS: He was also shipped out, and was also... ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">MH: Yes, he was shipped out.</span> <span id="s1056">Nobody knows where.</span> <span id="s1057">The family, he, his wife and his mother and the child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">MS: And, you were never able to locate anyone else that you worked with in the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">MH: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1060">One, we did.</span> <span id="s1061">I did locate him in Holland and we were in Holland yet together, and they went to America.</span> <span id="s1062">But we lost contact somehow, yes.</span> <span id="s1063">One fellow who was with me, he is in California somewhere.</span> <span id="s1064">I think I even have his address--I ought to, because we're going to be there.</span> <span id="s1065">Let's see if I can find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">MS: And you never, you could never get any information as to whatever happened to Martin Sternfeld, your first husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">MH: No.</span> <span id="s1068">This is all I have, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">MS: Nothing beyond that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">MH: Nothing beyond that.</span> <span id="s1071">Nothing could I find out, not what has happened to his sister, really nothing.</span> <span id="s1072">And the girl which was in Auschwitz which was my brother-in-law, is my brother-in-law's sister, she arrived.</span> <span id="s1073">We met in Holland again.</span> <span id="s1074">Her parents didn't survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">MS: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">MH: My mother, I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">MS: Because she had gone back to Danzig after spending a little time with you in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">MH: She had gone back to Danzig, yes, and I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1079">And that is the story.</span> <span id="s1080">And I came here...</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">MS: And your brother too, your youngest brother, you never...</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">MH: No, never, never know what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">MS: And when you came here, then you met your present husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">MH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">MS: Here in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">MH: In Philadelphia, yes, and we got married a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">MS: Well, when you came to America, did you need a sponsor, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">MH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1089">Friends, I have no relatives here.</span> <span id="s1090">Friends of my brother, they found out, they kept in touch with my brother during the war, and with my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s1091">And then they found out that I am in Holland, so they didn't even ask me.</span> <span id="s1092">They sent packages and they said, if I would like to, I should come here, and they sent me affidavits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">MS: And these were people that you yourself did not know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">MH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1095">I knew him, I knew the friend because they came from Russia, and they were on the way to America, and they stayed for a few years in Danzig, but he was my brother's age--my oldest brother, so seven years apart, and they went to school together.</span> <span id="s1096">And my father did a lot for them because they had no money, and he did quite a bit for the whole family.</span> <span id="s1097">And when they came--and they always wrote to us on holidays, and when they came here, and I met even the old people, the fellows are dead by now, the fellow's parents, and they said, “They never forgot what your father did for us.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">MS: I was thinking--it would seem very unusual just out of the clear blue sky that somebody would sponsor you.</span> <span id="s1099">That there had to have been a reason for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">MH: Right, that was the reason.</span> <span id="s1101">They wanted to do whatever possible, and I lived with them in Wynnefield, and they were extremely, extremely nice to me.</span> <span id="s1102">I was told that I'm not a refugee, that I'm one of them and that I live with them, and when we got married there, of course, we had a very little short wedding in the rabbi’s study.</span> <span id="s1103">But they did all this for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">MS: Tell me, after meeting your brother for the first time in Hanover, did you, and then you went back to Amsterdam, you were never able, you never made contact with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">MH: Yes, of course, in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1106">He was in Brussels.</span> <span id="s1107">He came over with all the food possible.</span> <span id="s1108">He was in the right position, he was with the Quartermaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">MS: I see.</span> <span id="s1110">But you didn't have any desire to go to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">MH: Oh yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1112">In fact, I had money from my uncle, who lived in India, to come to India, and he sent me money for the trip.</span> <span id="s1113">My brother tried to get me in from Bergen-Belsen, after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1114">He tried through the Red Cross for me to get to England.</span> <span id="s1115">But, they wouldn't let me in because I had typhoid germs.</span> <span id="s1116">And I had to go through channels.</span> <span id="s1117">It didn't work like that, that I was picked out and sent to England.</span> <span id="s1118">I had to go through channels, had to go back to Holland, and all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">MS: And then you would have had to go through on their immigration quota and all that, I would imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">MH: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">MS: Even though you had a brother in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">MH: Right.</span> <span id="s1123">Yes, I could have worked in England as a domestic or as a nurse that I could have worked.</span> <span id="s1124">And, I went to England three times from Holland during the two years, and he came to Holland, and he was still in the army.</span> <span id="s1125">He was discharged, I think, in Christmas 1945, he came back to London.</span> <span id="s1126">And, but I have been there, and all this together.</span> <span id="s1127">So that's actually my life.</span> <span id="s1128">I wanted just to tell you what happened with Vera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">MS: Yes, let's put that on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">MH: Now, as I said, we went with our Rabbi for a reason to Czechoslovakia, a very small group, because we had a little Torah which came from a small town from Czechoslovakia, and our Rabbi's quite a stickler and he couldn't find out what happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s1131">So he organized a trip.</span> <span id="s1132">I had no address of Vera, but I had found her picture, and the picture on the back said the name of the photographer and the address of the photographer.</span> <span id="s1133">And he had then, in turn--well, I took the picture along, and I figure I find out where the street is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">When we got to Czechoslovakia, we were assigned to the State Tourist Bureau, and from the State, we got a guide.</span> <span id="s1135">And I--once we got more acquainted with the guide--she lived, she didn't live with us in hotel, but she went with us wherever we were going, she told us her husband who was non-Jewish was in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1136">He fought for the free Czechs, for the underground in Czechoslovakia, and I told her about this girl, that she was born in Prague, she lives in Prague, and I showed her the street.</span> <span id="s1137">I said, "Just tell me, where is the street and the name of the photographer?"</span> <span id="s1138">She said, "Don't go there because no store is privately owned.</span> <span id="s1139">They all belong to the State.</span> <span id="s1140">Every store, every department store, every hotel, is State-owned."</span> <span id="s1141">So, our Rabbi had made contact with Jewish families in each town where we were, in Prague and in Pilsen, and he made a contact with the family in Prague through a son who lives in the United States.</span> <span id="s1142">We were invited one evening to go there, and I took the picture along.</span> <span id="s1143">And I said, "It's crazy, I don't have a name.</span> <span id="s1144">I know her as Vera, but I don't have her name."</span> <span id="s1145">So the lady of the house takes a look at the picture, and this was 1946, she said, "I know one man there.</span> <span id="s1146">She is in the middle, and I don't know her husband, I know the other man.</span> <span id="s1147">Leave me the picture, and I will find out, no matter what time it will be."</span> <span id="s1148">Three months later, I got a letter exactly what happened to Vera, exactly her whole life history since 1946.</span> <span id="s1149">She is no longer in Prague; her husband died in Prague.</span> <span id="s1150">She lives in Germany.</span> <span id="s1151">I wrote to her, yes, I was very much surprised, that I will not come to see her, but if she would come to see us--because I do not go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1152">And, so, she wrote and she was very much, she said, she only cried when she--and she came last for Rosh Hashana; she was here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">MS: She came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">MH: She came here, she stayed with us two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">MS: How wonderful</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">MH: And I just wrote a letter yesterday.</span> <span id="s1157">She wrote to us, and she is very unhappy in Germany.</span> <span id="s1158">She has two sons; her husband died in Prague.</span> <span id="s1159">They were on vacation when the Communists came to Czechoslovakia, in Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s1160">So they, they went to Vienna, stayed in Vienna, and her husband wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s1161">They had him on a list--he was somewhere connected with the entertainment business, and they somehow, he was on a list, and he went to Prague, and he was arrested.</span> <span id="s1162">He got sick there, and he died there.</span> <span id="s1163">And she stayed with the two sons.</span> <span id="s1164">They were ready to immigrate to Canada, so they were there, and she had a Czech friend who lived in Munich, and she said, “You can stay in our apartment for a few months with the children,” and what she did .</span> <span id="s1165">.</span> <span id="s1166">and that's where she is.</span> <span id="s1167">She has her own apartment now, and the sons are there.</span> <span id="s1168">One son was in Canada and came back, and she is very, very unhappy.</span> <span id="s1169">She wrote again.</span> <span id="s1170">She said she is so jealous that we have all the friends and we have a synagogue and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">MS: It seems so strange that she didn't opt to even go to Canada when she had the opportunity.</span> <span id="s1172">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">MH: I don't know, she had--well, then, she didn't have anymore, the opportunity, but now she has the opportunity, but I guess she wants to stay with her son.</span> <span id="s1174">So in her last letter she wrote that she is going to Prague again.</span> <span id="s1175">She shuttles back and forth because she is so happy there.</span> <span id="s1176">She has her friends there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">MS: It's interesting though, at least she, having had all that experience in the concentration camps, and then going after the war, having to become involved in the Communist regime, so that her life really has been a turmoil almost constantly.</span> <span id="s1178">We don't realize how fortunate we really are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">MH: Yes, and how fortunate I am, that I have my health, at least, you know.</span> <span id="s1180">I have a bum back, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1181">I have to have something wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">MS: Yes, which is one of the questions on the list.</span> <span id="s1183">Have you suffered any ailments in your life, you know... ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">MH: My ailment was not really, was my .</span> <span id="s1185">.</span> <span id="s1186">I have a very bad back, and I had, I developed a hernia, which I just had repaired, a few weeks ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">MS: And this you feel is all related to your experiences in the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">MH: When I was examined in Holland when we first got into that hospital in Holland, the doctor said to me, "Do you know that you have a hernia?"</span> <span id="s1189">And I said, "No, I didn't even notice it," because you didn't pay attention to all those things.</span> <span id="s1190">And he said, "Well, go to your doctor and have him watch it."</span> <span id="s1191">Well, my doctor was a Jewish doctor he didn't come back; so I went to another doctor.</span> <span id="s1192">He said, "Well, it's very small," and I had this all the time, and now I had it done after 37 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">MS: You finally had it corrected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">MH: Yes, and I'm very glad about that.</span> <span id="s1195">But with my back I have problems.</span> <span id="s1196">I'm under constant, pretty much--do my exercises and, that is definitely from hard labor, you know, because I was never a giant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">MS: No, you're a very small person.</span> <span id="s1198">Let me ask you this--it was very interesting that this German officer in Budy more or less was, I won't say attracted to you, but that he took an interest in you.</span> <span id="s1199">You never knew what his end was, whether he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">MH: No, I knew from one person, I had found out.</span> <span id="s1201">I have a lawyer who is here and in Germany.</span> <span id="s1202">He was the Assistant Prosecutor at the Nuremberg trial.</span> <span id="s1203">He is really from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">MS: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">MH: Dr. Kempner.</span> <span id="s1206">And he has an office in Lansdowne, and he also has, I don't know what, if he's still doing now, because by now he is much older too, and he was in Frankfurt, and he had written to me quite often besides getting my restitution and all this.</span> <span id="s1207">He had to do that because I never lived in Germany, see, that was a little difficult.</span> <span id="s1208">But, he wrote to me that they found a woman which I knew in the Hague.</span> <span id="s1209">She was a Nazi, and she was in charge of all this concentration camp business, but in the Hague.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">MS: Did they ask you to come to be a witness against her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">MH: Yes, But then I got--they asked me to come to be a witness, and I think that was in Munich or in Nuremberg, no, Munich, I think, and they had caught her, but then I got a letter, a very nice letter, from the Judge, telling me that she confessed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">MS: So there wasn't a need for you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">MH: The confessing is that she was two years in prison, and she is probably out.</span> <span id="s1214">I don't know if she is still alive, but that's what happened.</span> <span id="s1215">And, that's what the story is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">MS: Well, I want to thank you very much, Mrs. Herzfeld.</span> <span id="s1217">It was a very, very interesting conversation.</span></p></body></html>
