England was only a stop off point before America.</span> <span id="s301">Just time before getting on a boat.</span> <span id="s302">The early years in Europe I've only talked about with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q.</span> <span id="s304">You were the son of German Jews in the U.S.--How did you feel and when did your parents start talking to you about their experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">25:13</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A.</span> <span id="s307">There was never anything hidden, but not a lot dead.</span> <span id="s308">I always knew I had been born in Germany and many family members were lost.</span> <span id="s309">I never really asked for details until later on.</span> <span id="s310">I was specifically told by my parents that now we were going to be Americans.</span> <span id="s311">After arriving here we went to Chicago and I was sent to cousins while my parents were working so I could learn English.</span> <span id="s312">My parents stopped speaking German as soon as they got off the boat.</span> <span id="s313">It was as if the memories were so bitter they wanted to break off any remembrance of the past.</span> <span id="s314">The memories were never forgotten but not initially talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q.</span> <span id="s316">Did you feel any different about yourself in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A.</span> <span id="s318">In the 40s here in Chicago there were other immigrant children.</span> <span id="s319">There were 2 other boys whose parents had come from Germany in the thirties.</span> <span id="s320">We always prided ourselves that we were always the best students in the class.</span> <span id="s321">It was something I thought about - that maybe because we all had to start over again or because Jewish children in Germany couldn't go to school we were better students.</span> <span id="s322">We were always accepted, not singled out because we were Jewish (there were other Jewish kids in the school) and none of us had accents.</span> <span id="s323">I never felt different at home or school.</span> <span id="s324">I guess I brought some of what was good from the old world.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">27:55</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q. Were you ever ashamed your parents having an accent?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A. I never felt ashamed.....</span></p> <p><span id="s328">TAPE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A.</span> <span id="s330">It never bothered me that they had an accent.</span> <span id="s331">Everyone always felt welcomed at my house.</span> <span id="s332">Because my parents worked long hours the children that came to the house saw only my Grandmother.</span> <span id="s333">A lot of the social life of the family was centered around the cousins.</span> <span id="s334">I went there every day for lunch hour and after school went home.</span> <span id="s335">Then there was Hebrew school and Boy Scouts which my father was involved in.</span> <span id="s336">So, any differences never stopped me from doing anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">2:30</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q.</span> <span id="s339">Did you have non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A. Yes, one of my friends was Japanese-American.</span> <span id="s341">Other friends were through the Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s342">Most of my best friends were Jewish now that I think about it because I saw them in Hebrew school, Boy Scouts and Sunday School.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q.</span> <span id="s344">How did you feel when you heard what was going on in Germany and when the survivors started telling their stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A.</span> <span id="s346">As a child I felt detached.</span> <span id="s347">I felt I had been there and my parents had, but I had gotten out and my family was intact the way I knew it.</span> <span id="s348">Only later did I realize that I was one of those survivors.</span> <span id="s349">I didn't relate to the displaced persons from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">4:94</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q.</span> <span id="s352">When did you first relate your experiences in Europe to yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A. Probably not in any detailed way until the Holocaust film was on TV.</span> <span id="s354">Even then it was through the minds of my children and not through my experiences.</span> <span id="s355">The next morning my son asked some questions that I couldn't answer.</span> <span id="s356">They asked my parents the questions and I found out all that had happened and I could relate to what I had gone through to what had happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s357">This was just in the last few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q.</span> <span id="s359">Did you ever go back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A.</span> <span id="s361">Last summer my wife and I went to the town in which I was born.</span> <span id="s362">We had mixed feelings about what we'd find and how we'd feel.</span> <span id="s363">My mother was not supportive of my wanting to go back.</span> <span id="s364">But she wrote letters to the non-Jewish people who helped members of my family and after she heard back and then she really got into what the experience would be like.</span> <span id="s365">I tried to get some physical descriptions of what to possibly expect of the town.</span> <span id="s366">She drew me a map of where my relatives and buildings should be.</span> <span id="s367">I took that with me and called Frankfurt to talk with the daughter of the people my mother wrote to.</span> <span id="s368">They picked us up and we talked about their experiences during the war.</span> <span id="s369">Her father had hidden some people in the house and she said how she feared every night that her father might be caught.</span> <span id="s370">We went to Ghota (ph) the next day.</span> <span id="s371">I tried to think back to what it was like when I was a child and had some strange feelings.</span> <span id="s372">The town had not been bombed and things were as my mother described them.</span> <span id="s373">We had pictures of the places there and as we took pictures it seemed to be the same scene all over again.</span> <span id="s374">As we went through the town and found all my mother had described we were reliving the scenes from my childhood.</span> <span id="s375">There were some East German soldiers walking down the street and I remembered stories my mother had told me about having to salute the soldiers in the 30s and I had the feeling that this was what it was like.</span> <span id="s376">I almost had the feeling that I should not offend or alienate them and realized that this is how I must have felt.</span> <span id="s377">That was my first emotional tying together of being a survivor.</span> <span id="s378">I heard about my mother when she was a little girl and we got caught up in what happened in the town after we had left in '38.</span> <span id="s379">We were in the courtyard of my grandfather's house in which I had played as a child.</span> <span id="s380">I recognized it and we took notice of what my mother had said about it.</span> <span id="s381">There were signs of life all around and I looked up and saw a clock and a bell.</span> <span id="s382">I had never heard about them in the stories.</span> <span id="s383">We took a picture of them.</span> <span id="s384">I had kept asking our guide if things would have been there when I was there.</span> <span id="s385">I was caught up in the details.</span> <span id="s386">We eventually got back to West Germany and got a phone call from my mother I said, "Mother you never told us about the clock and the bell."</span> <span id="s387">I heard her voice crack and I realized I had told her about something she had never told me about.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">15:49</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q.</span> <span id="s390">Did you have any encounters with Germans that said I remember your family but I could not do anything to help them?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A.</span> <span id="s392">While there our contacts were with the family that had close contacts with the family.</span> <span id="s393">We saw a woman who remembered much about the family and details about the past in the 20s and 30s.</span> <span id="s394">She reflected on my aunt who had been in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s395">But we never talked to her or anyone about what they did or could have done.</span> <span id="s396">Except in each case they talked about what Mr. Grohl (ph) had done because it was so positive and in jeopardy of his own life.</span> <span id="s397">Total strangers that we talked to (they needed to be old enough to remember) turned up a lady and she remembered my grandfather and how he helped out people in the town.</span> <span id="s398">This gave us a warm feeling because this was how we remembered my grandfather.</span> <span id="s399">Everyone there had only nice things to say.</span> <span id="s400">We didn't get political.</span> <span id="s401">There was an awareness of the today in Germany.</span> <span id="s402">The husband of the woman who took us around worked in East Germany and could not associate with us because we were Westerners.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">18:42</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q.</span> <span id="s405">What would you say to the people in the future to prevent this happening again?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A. My deep feeling is that we cannot forget and cannot allow our children to not understand fully what happened - not just to the Jews of Germany but to the Jews of Europe - and everyone involved.</span> <span id="s407">We also need to remember the things that happened after the war to those that survived it.</span> <span id="s408">We need to teach Jew and non-Jew that these were real experiences.</span> <span id="s409">There needs to be education as to how it happened.</span> <span id="s410">This cannot be allowed to be forgotten - ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">USHMM Archives RG-50.031*0061 PAGE 10</span></p></body></html>
