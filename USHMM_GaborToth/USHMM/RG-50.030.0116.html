Would you tell me your name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My name is Morris Kornberg.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in January 6, 1918--in Przedborz, Poland.</span> <span id="s16">Q: Tell me about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Um, I had then my parents, they have been...uh...in business.</span> <span id="s18">I had...uh...four brothers, and two sisters.</span> <span id="s19">I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s20">My eldest brother took over the business from my parents.</span> <span id="s21">As far as I remember, this was in 1938.</span> <span id="s22">And we have been connected all the time with...uh...different kind business.</span> <span id="s23">Mostly business...my brother used to supply the factories raw material, and so forth...so forth.</span> <span id="s24">My oldest sister was married.</span> <span id="s25">She had three kids; two boys, one girl.</span> <span id="s26">The oldest girl--was at this time in '39--she was 8 years old.</span> <span id="s27">Then the other two boys must have been 5 and 3.</span> <span id="s28">And then I had one brother who left Poland in 1933.</span> <span id="s29">He went to Israel from a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s30">Then was another sister.</span> <span id="s31">She was still single.</span> <span id="s32">Then I had another brother.</span> <span id="s33">And I was the youngest in all.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Tell me about your childhood, with your brothers and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: As far as I remember of my childhood, I used... My parents were strictly Orthodox people; but we have been four brothers at home.</span> <span id="s36">'Til about 14, 15 years old, we all attended Jewish schools and never went even to a public schools; because our parents had been so religious.</span> <span id="s37">They always sent us to Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s38">Private...actually, a teacher--a private teacher.</span> <span id="s39">A Rabbi, more or less.</span> <span id="s40">And we took also, beside...uh... languages--like Polish, or other modern languages.</span> <span id="s41">What I studied was only private...private.</span> <span id="s42">And as I remember, when I was 15 years old; and then the parents let us more or less do it our own way.</span> <span id="s43">We didn't go anymore with...uh...my father, like we used to every Sabbos [NB: Shabbat] to the shtievel [Yiddish: "house" (of worship?)]</span> <span id="s44">, und so weiter [Yiddish or German: "and so forth"].</span> <span id="s45">But...uh, we...we have been allowed more or less to go our own way, in some degree.</span> <span id="s46">But we always have been understanding..., we tried to be good kids.</span> <span id="s47">Not to embarrass...uh... So I belonged to...uh...Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s48">It actually a..</span> <span id="s49">.</span> <span id="s50">a sport...um, like a sports organization; but it was a religious sport organization.</span> <span id="s51">I used to help around at home, with business.</span> <span id="s52">It was assigned to do...uh...all, uh...different things, whatever; I always helped around.</span> <span id="s53">Whatever they asked me, I always did, so forth.</span> <span id="s54">And in the evening, we used to spend in the Zionist Organization, where we...we...we learned Hebrew and once a week we had some dancing, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">More modern life.</span> <span id="s56">This went on, more or less, all my years; 'til actually the German, when they came in 1939.</span> <span id="s57">I think it was the first of...uh...September.</span> <span id="s58">The first day when they came in, right away the whole town run away.</span> <span id="s59">Because we had been afraid, actually, of Germans; and we went to the woods.</span> <span id="s60">And we had been for two, three days in the woods all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">And the time come, we went back home.</span> <span id="s62">This...the town, the little town, was about 70 percent was burned out; but our house was still standing.</span> <span id="s63">The business, everything, was still like normal.</span> <span id="s64">We tried to adjust ourselves to a normal life.</span> <span id="s65">As I can remember, right away from the beginning...uh...was like a..</span> <span id="s66">.</span> <span id="s67">a law.</span> <span id="s68">The German called a "Kommissar"--who was in charge of the little town--called us over; and he said that we all, from 13...age from 13 'til 50, will have to perform labor.</span> <span id="s69">Every day, we have to go to the...to do some work.</span> <span id="s70">So we used to go to the...the Jewish Kultursgemeinde.</span> <span id="s71">Over there, we have been assigned; like mostly cleaning, taking away old brick, cleaning up areas.</span> <span id="s72">Didn't make any different.</span> <span id="s73">But in the evening, we have been allowed to go back at home.</span> <span id="s74">Later on, they assigned me--mostly in mine age, from the city--to a Steinbruch [NB: "quarry"] We used to mine stones; those stones have been for the...for the roads.</span> <span id="s75">They built new road, and so those stones went to the roads.</span> <span id="s76">And so this was pretty heavy work, everything.</span> <span id="s77">But still, I was pretty young and healthy, and I got adjusted.</span> <span id="s78">And I..</span> <span id="s79">.</span> <span id="s80">and I did my work.</span> <span id="s81">I have the two other brothers-- because he was always in business.</span> <span id="s82">And at this time, the German government...they needed...base...steel basement materials--steel.</span> <span id="s83">My oldest brother was always in contact with big manufacturer, Jewish people, who used to have supply from all kinds steel metal.</span> <span id="s84">And if he supplied so many pounds--I don't....cannot recall the amount--you...you got a gröne binde [NB: "green band"].</span> <span id="s85">Start to wear the white and blue armband, so you got a green band.</span> <span id="s86">A green band meant that you could go outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s87">You could travel.</span> <span id="s88">You could use the trains.</span> <span id="s89">And you have...you have been restricted, but you still had a little bit freedom.</span> <span id="s90">So then my oldest brother saw that my youngest--uh, my older brother from me, the second brother-- had a gröne binde, too.</span> <span id="s91">So we didn't have to go to work every day, like the steinbruch, and do all public kind of works.</span> <span id="s92">And happened to be...our parents, they had a factory with a partner, with a gentile people.</span> <span id="s93">Poles.</span> <span id="s94">In the beginning, we didn't even wanted to go down to the factory; because it was everything under his name, more or less.</span> <span id="s95">We didn't want it to know...the Germans know that this our property, half was our property of the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Because we know it if it is Jewish property, was confiscated.</span> <span id="s97">But the owner from the prop...from the partner from the factory, our partner the owner was arrested in 1940.</span> <span id="s98">This was with the first Polish intelligent[sia] what they took away.</span> <span id="s99">They arrested him.</span> <span id="s100">Two weeks later, came a notice that he did not survive.</span> <span id="s101">The clothing came back home, and he was not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s102">And the factory was not running right with nobody to manage, so forth.</span> <span id="s103">So my brother, through...he had some friends who had contact with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s104">And for money, they could make it that it's not for myself to go to every day to work for Zwangs [NB: "compulsory"] labor to be assigned... to have my assignment; my labor should be to the factory.</span> <span id="s105">We lived already in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s106">The factory was on the other side in the town, also out the ghetto.</span> <span id="s107">So I got a I.D. card from Gestapo, that I can go.</span> <span id="s108">.</span> <span id="s109">cross every day to the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Cross ...I go outside the ghetto, and be over there.</span> <span id="s111">We came... So I were came to the factory.</span> <span id="s112">My brother used to supply raw materials, because you couldn't get it at this time raw materials from the German.</span> <span id="s113">You have to have a special permission, actually.</span> <span id="s114">But my brother had connection; and we could produce again knives, spoons, forks...whatever we manufactured over there.</span> <span id="s115">But it was a problem that the...same way, labor.</span> <span id="s116">You couldn't pay a labor[er] more than the price from before the war prices, more or less.</span> <span id="s117">And nobody wanted to work, because everything was already like black market.</span> <span id="s118">Except what you got your rations.</span> <span id="s119">Right away, Jewish people never got any rations.</span> <span id="s120">So the problem was that nobody wanted to work.</span> <span id="s121">Then my brother told me to try to tell those people who used to work in the factory that we will pay them 2, 3 times as much [as] whatever is allowed by the law.</span> <span id="s122">And he will be able to sell the merchandise to some friends, who had Jewish people stores; what he could given them a bill and he will actually get paid three times as much, too, for the merchandise.</span> <span id="s123">This went on...and I used to be always in the factory, and this went on for quite a long time.</span> <span id="s124">Apparently, over a year.</span> <span id="s125">It happened to be that one of the workers in the factory, he was some dissatisfied--not with me, but with the ...with the lady from our partner.</span> <span id="s126">And he went...he went to the Gestapo; and he said that the whole factory belongs, actually, to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">The factory belongs to us.</span> <span id="s128">Whatever we used manufactoring, we had been always afraid that something can happen this week, or next week or [the] next week.</span> <span id="s129">We used to carry away finished merchandise; and it was over there he used to carry the finished material to the railroads.</span> <span id="s130">So he lived in our village.</span> <span id="s131">He had a barn where he used to carry finished merchandise to his barn, too.</span> <span id="s132">Well, one day, I remember...it must have been like the middle of August.</span> <span id="s133">I cannot recall exactly, but...uh...more or less in August.</span> <span id="s134">It was on a Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">And I was trying in...at home they told me, "You stay.</span> <span id="s136">Don't stay home in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s137">Keep on trying to sleep over there.</span> <span id="s138">Live over there in the factory.”</span> <span id="s139">They always chased me to go out from the ghetto to be in the factory.</span> <span id="s140">This was a bridge...a bridge, you know, to cross the ghetto.</span> <span id="s141">I came on the bridge; I remember it was guarded by Gendarmerie.</span> <span id="s142">Not by Gestapo, but by Gendarmerie.</span> <span id="s143">And I knowed him; and he knowed me very well, too.</span> <span id="s144">His name was [Achtler (ph)].</span> <span id="s145">I still remember.</span> <span id="s146">Because he used to come to the factory before Christmastime, and he used to wanted to send home some knives or whatever we produce in the factory.</span> <span id="s147">And we used to give him for free.</span> <span id="s148">So he always was on very friendly terms.</span> <span id="s149">And I came to the bridge to cross the ghetto.</span> <span id="s150">He says, uh, "Ausweis.”</span> <span id="s151">And I knowed right away that something is not right, because I know him and he knowed me.</span> <span id="s152">And when he asked me this; and I laughed, and I took out my Ausweis and I gave it to him.</span> <span id="s153">And he tore up my Ausweis.</span> <span id="s154">And he said, "Du zist...du bist selbig scheiss Jude wie jede andere.</span> <span id="s155">Wenn die Mal probies das ghetto [geschitten (ph)], dann ein Kugel in dem Kopf."</span> <span id="s156">And it means that he will shot me.</span> <span id="s157">And I went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Will you tell us what that meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: This meant that...uh...that I am exactly like any other dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s160">I am the same, and I don't have any right to cross the ghetto.</span> <span id="s161">And if I am going to try to go over the bridge to cross the ghetto, I will be shot.</span> <span id="s162">I turned back and went home; and I told them.</span> <span id="s163">My...My oldest brother was always travelling; but this...this day he was home.</span> <span id="s164">It was on a Saturday.</span> <span id="s165">And when I told them, my parents...everybody got very upset.</span> <span id="s166">And my oldest brother said to my father and to me, he said, "Don't worry, Moishe.</span> <span id="s167">We find a way that...that ...that the Gendarmerie will not have any...anything to do with you.”</span> <span id="s168">Although at this time, actually, they had already conflicts with the Russians.</span> <span id="s169">Was in '41.</span> <span id="s170">And...and they... they started.</span> <span id="s171">They wanted to take over the factory.</span> <span id="s172">The SS wanted to take over the factory to build barracks, that they can send those barracks to Russia for their soldiers.</span> <span id="s173">And if the factory will belong under SS...uh...supervision, so nobody would have any right to touch me.</span> <span id="s174">"You will be over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">1 Translation from the German: "You are the self-same shitty Jew as any other.</span> <span id="s176">When the mark tries [to sneak out of] the ghetto, then a shot in the head."</span> <span id="s177">You will do your work, whatever they assign you to do it.”</span> <span id="s178">OK.</span> <span id="s179">This was all.</span> <span id="s180">So we waited...Monday, Tuesday.</span> <span id="s181">On Tuesday, came a Polish policeman.</span> <span id="s182">They had been together with the Gendarmerie, but they didn't have no arms.</span> <span id="s183">And he came over, he came to our house where we lived in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s184">And he said...uh, to me, "Mr. Kornberg," he says, "You are...you are asked to come to the Gendarmerie over there for questioning.”</span> <span id="s185">And right away my parents looked at me, and very upset and everything.</span> <span id="s186">And I said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s187">I be alright.</span> <span id="s188">I be back.”</span> <span id="s189">I came down to Gendarme...to Gendarmerie...because in our...it was a small town.</span> <span id="s190">We didn't have any SS in the town.</span> <span id="s191">But once a month, came from Radom came Gestapo and SS, if they have any cases to take care, or whatever.</span> <span id="s192">And I was called in.</span> <span id="s193">It was a very high SS.</span> <span id="s194">And he had about 10, 12 pages; and he keeps on asking me, "Are you working...you work in the factory?"</span> <span id="s195">I said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s196">And he said, "You have double books.”</span> <span id="s197">We had to have double books, because the original what we paid them.</span> <span id="s198">One set books what we original paid; one set books for the German government, to show it what we had been allowed to pay them.</span> <span id="s199">And he kept on asking me again questions, with finished merchandised and where it's hidden in the barn, and so forth.</span> <span id="s200">And I know it... saw it right away that he knows more what is going on than I even myself knowed it.</span> <span id="s201">Right away, he called in a kapo Gestapo--or SS...I don't know--and they start to beat me.</span> <span id="s202">And they beat me so bad, so hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">And I was constantly on the floor.</span> <span id="s204">And he was an elderly SS, the man.</span> <span id="s205">So I was always on the floor; and I went one time in and start to kiss his boot.</span> <span id="s206">I said, "Please, shot me.</span> <span id="s207">Please.”</span> <span id="s208">He said, "You will be shot, anyway.</span> <span id="s209">You don't have to worry about this.</span> <span id="s210">But first we get the whole truth out from you.”</span> <span id="s211">And I kept passing out from beating.</span> <span id="s212">So they took me down.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Outside the building was...uh...a pump; because it was not inside...uh...was not water inside the building.</span> <span id="s214">You have to go outside, if you wanted water.</span> <span id="s215">They put my head behind the pump.</span> <span id="s216">They pumped water; and as soon I came back, they took me in again to beatings and beatings and beatings.</span> <span id="s217">And my back was completely black, everything.</span> <span id="s218">The whole body, practically.</span> <span id="s219">And they took me...it was a small prison, a small town.</span> <span id="s220">They called this...not a regular prison.</span> <span id="s221">They called it a "koza" [Pol: "lock-up" or "clink"].</span> <span id="s222">And I was sitting over there.</span> <span id="s223">And the guy who was in charge, a Pole...Polak who was charge over this.</span> <span id="s224">He knowed me.</span> <span id="s225">He knowed the family.</span> <span id="s226">He knowed everybody.</span> <span id="s227">So he came over in secret, and he telled me, "Whatever you want it, you just tell me.</span> <span id="s228">And I get in contact with your family, and you'll get it.”</span> <span id="s229">And he said, "You want write something home?"</span> <span id="s230">So, yes, I remembered one thing; and I wrote it home.</span> <span id="s231">And I know it that everybody was still home--my brothers, and whole family.</span> <span id="s232">And I told them... One thing I didn't told them, that I was beaten so bad.</span> <span id="s233">But I said, "Please, one favor I want it from you.</span> <span id="s234">Just forget about me.”</span> <span id="s235">(Crying) The next day they sent me to Ko_skie.</span> <span id="s236">Ko_skie... this was the next town about 30 miles from Przedborz; and over there, it was a larger town.</span> <span id="s237">It was already a regular prison.</span> <span id="s238">And they put me in prison.</span> <span id="s239">I came over there.</span> <span id="s240">They...first they took me to the...uh...Gestapo, to....uh... I was only afraid for beating again; and I said do anything.</span> <span id="s241">But I nev..</span> <span id="s242">.</span> <span id="s243">I was not beaten anymore.</span> <span id="s244">And I was put in normal prison.</span> <span id="s245">I came in the prison.</span> <span id="s246">It was something.</span> <span id="s247">You know, that when you come in...a newcomer comes in, everybody makes fun, or whatever.</span> <span id="s248">And they saw me--those old prisoners actually, mostly Poles.</span> <span id="s249">Gentile.</span> <span id="s250">And when they saw me, I could hardly walk already.</span> <span id="s251">And I didn't know what to say, what not to say.</span> <span id="s252">So they stopped joking, and they came talking to me more less serious.</span> <span id="s253">And they asked me what is happened, why I am here.</span> <span id="s254">I told them, more or less.</span> <span id="s255">So they start, in some degree, respecting me a little bit.</span> <span id="s256">They didn't...normally a newcomer comes in, get beat up in a prison, so forth.</span> <span id="s257">They didn't beat me, nothing.</span> <span id="s258">And in fact, every day normally they...you supposed--because it was not toilets equipped over there.</span> <span id="s259">You...we had...we had a large can, whatever.</span> <span id="s260">Whatever your normal thing you had to do, you did in the can.</span> <span id="s261">In the morning, had to be carried out and cleaned; scraped the floors, and everything.</span> <span id="s262">So they even pushed me away.</span> <span id="s263">They told me I don't have to do this.</span> <span id="s264">And I was over there for 4 weeks.</span> <span id="s265">I remember one time they brought, into the same prison, three butchers.</span> <span id="s266">They caught them butchering, or whatever.</span> <span id="s267">And they have been very...they had been in prison almost like religious.</span> <span id="s268">They constantly prayed and prayed.</span> <span id="s269">One morning, they called them out; and I could hear--the other already told me--and I could hear shoot... shooting.</span> <span id="s270">And the other told me, "Here, they are shotting over here.</span> <span id="s271">Bullets.</span> <span id="s272">You know, rifles.”</span> <span id="s273">They got shot over there.</span> <span id="s274">Well, I was the only...again the only Jew over there in this prison.</span> <span id="s275">And the owner from our partner--the woman-- she was arrested, too, when I was arrested.</span> <span id="s276">And she was in the same jail in Ko_skie.</span> <span id="s277">And, apparently, when she was released she could scream in; you know, to call my name.</span> <span id="s278">It must have been that woman quarters was not far away.</span> <span id="s279">And she the same way called my name; and I said, "Yes!"</span> <span id="s280">And she told me she is Frau Wiczitska, Mrs. Wiczitska.</span> <span id="s281">She says that she is free, she goes home; and she knows that I will be free, too.</span> <span id="s282">Just waiting for a high official from the SS to sign mine papers for freedom to go home.</span> <span id="s283">Now everybody came over from the jail; they told me to go see their relatives, and this and this.</span> <span id="s284">To tell greetings, or this and this.</span> <span id="s285">And I was sure 100 percent that I go tomorrow.</span> <span id="s286">I will be released.</span> <span id="s287">But the next morning, was called off by names.</span> <span id="s288">My name was also called off; and I came out.</span> <span id="s289">I didn't know it what is, if to be released or not released.</span> <span id="s290">They took us all in a truck.</span> <span id="s291">They drove us...uh...I believe nach [Yidd or Ger: "to"] Kielce or nach Radom.A bigger city.</span> <span id="s292">And from all prisons from the whole area.</span> <span id="s293">They took all prisoners out from the prisons.</span> <span id="s294">We came the city where we have been.</span> <span id="s295">I don't know exactly this.</span> <span id="s296">I just mention Radom or the Kielce.</span> <span id="s297">They sent us out on a market, on the street where the market was.</span> <span id="s298">I know it that was quite...come more trucks, more trucks;

because we had to go in to take a lamp.</span> <span id="s538">You have always to go in to take a lamp.</span> <span id="s539">You had a coal mine lamp.</span> <span id="s540">Mine coal mine lamp was 118.</span> <span id="s541">I still remember.</span> <span id="s542">You said that your number is 118.</span> <span id="s543">They gave you the number.</span> <span id="s544">You have been responsible, 'cause you had to bring back the lamp.</span> <span id="s545">The lamp was very heavy.</span> <span id="s546">You could hardly drag it.</span> <span id="s547">But you have to bring it back.</span> <span id="s548">If you didn't brought it back, they finish you off.</span> <span id="s549">It means that you had sabotaged.</span> <span id="s550">And who gave out those lamps, was a kapo ...Poles, gentiles, who work over there.</span> <span id="s551">And very young kids--maybe 16, 17 year-old kids.</span> <span id="s552">And then came French...who spoke only French, who spoke only Yugoslav, who spoke only uh Czech.</span> <span id="s553">And they told them their number.</span> <span id="s554">They didn't know it.</span> <span id="s555">And they just laughed and said, "You should take longer, actually.”</span> <span id="s556">And meanwhile, the SS got rough; and beat us up, roughed us up, kicked us up.</span> <span id="s557">Because they had been mad.</span> <span id="s558">They didn't want to stay.</span> <span id="s559">And one was a..</span> <span id="s560">.</span> <span id="s561">uh...inmate.</span> <span id="s562">He was a Reichsdeutsche, a German.</span> <span id="s563">And he couldn't see it anymore, you know, to going down...down in the mine, and to work in the mine and be...beaten up so bad and kicked so bad.</span> <span id="s564">And so he came over to me.</span> <span id="s565">I was in the same block with him.</span> <span id="s566">He was more or less like a Kapo, responsible for the shift--for the night shift.</span> <span id="s567">And he came over to me.</span> <span id="s568">I..</span> <span id="s569">.</span> <span id="s570">I was not sleeping, probably, wherever he was slept in the same block.</span> <span id="s571">And he said, "You speak Polish, no?"</span> <span id="s572">I said, "Sure.”</span> <span id="s573">He says, "Maybe, you know, when you see his number, you're gonna used to the names and you can tell those boys in Polish the number.</span> <span id="s574">It will get used, that they will go a little bit faster.”</span> <span id="s575">I told him, "I can try.”</span> <span id="s576">And at this time, I was young.</span> <span id="s577">And had a very good memory, too, I remember.</span> <span id="s578">And they tried out with me, what it used to take three quarters of an hour or an hour.</span> <span id="s579">In the beginning, it was a little bit hard for me.</span> <span id="s580">But I still speeded up in half, and so forth.</span> <span id="s581">And everyday was always the same faces and the same numbers--the Häftling numbers.</span> <span id="s582">I got used to it that actually I looked at the face or at this number, and I knowed the coal mine mine number already.</span> <span id="s583">And I ask...</span></p> <p><span id="s584">And I used to cut this down to about...in no time--to a half hour, 15 minutes--practically impossible.</span> <span id="s585">And I got to be famous over there for this.</span> <span id="s586">And the SS...and they know it.</span> <span id="s587">And they start the same way to talk to me, being nice.</span> <span id="s588">I didn't have to march anymore; work like I wanted.</span> <span id="s589">And once in awhile they used to even to bring me a sandwich, even.</span> <span id="s590">To get me...</span></p> <p><span id="s591">You know, that nobody sees it, I should hide it.</span> <span id="s592">And this went on; and I did my job, whatever I could.</span> <span id="s593">And I was pleased that the beating stopped a little bit.</span> <span id="s594">But in the coal mine...in the camp, started to worse and worse and worse.</span> <span id="s595">And they used to get it the same way.</span> <span id="s596">Every month, they used to get in another transport actually.</span> <span id="s597">So they didn't need it any more people.</span> <span id="s598">They didn't care.</span> <span id="s599">So every month...month, it was a selection.</span> <span id="s600">Uh, a high SS doctor came-- officer--came from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s601">We had to go through in the evening without clothing, everything.</span> <span id="s602">And as soon somebody saw it is undernourished, so forth, he put him in the side;

With two rifles.</span> <span id="s895">And they come over to me, and they say with rifles, "Get up.”</span> <span id="s896">And I said--this must be that two, three days that we actually we didn't have nothing to eat and nothing to drink.</span> <span id="s897">But period, nothing.</span> <span id="s898">And when I fall asleep over there and he said with the rifle to get up, I tried to get up.</span> <span id="s899">I tried to stay on my legs.</span> <span id="s900">I fall back down.</span> <span id="s901">He say they gonna shot me.</span> <span id="s902">I said, "What's wrong with this?"</span> <span id="s903">To shoot you was like you give a kid...uh...a candy!</span> <span id="s904">But they didn't shot me.</span> <span id="s905">And I tried again and again.</span> <span id="s906">And so they didn't have no food whatever.</span> <span id="s907">So one talked to the other one, and talked it over; and they went into.</span> <span id="s908">.</span> <span id="s909">uh.</span> <span id="s910">.</span> <span id="s911">a private home somewhere--was not far away--and one came with two carrots, raw carrots.</span> <span id="s912">And he gave me the two carrots.</span> <span id="s913">I ate those two carrots; and I could walk.</span> <span id="s914">Stand on my feet, and walk like any normal person.</span> <span id="s915">I still don't believe myself, even, this.</span> <span id="s916">They took us back to the camp, to make it short.</span> <span id="s917">So they came the Lagerführer, a high SS man.</span> <span id="s918">He says, "Why did you run away?"</span> <span id="s919">All of us, we...we told him, "We didn't run away.</span> <span id="s920">We just wanted to beg for food and come back.”</span> <span id="s921">And he...he does...does it like that (gesturing), and...he says, "You think I am not hungry?!"</span> <span id="s922">Something like this.</span> <span id="s923">And he says, "7 o'clock, you get shot.”</span> <span id="s924">Again, do me a favor!</span> <span id="s925">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">8 Volkssturm (People's Militia) was organized in October 1944 and made up largely of boys and older men, men between the ages of 16 and 60 who had not otherwise been called up to serve in other units of the German Armed Forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">But...uh...the guards, they know...they help...they got their rations 6 o'clock.</span> <span id="s928">And they didn't care anymore.</span> <span id="s929">So they run for their rations.</span> <span id="s930">They know it if they don't go for their rations, they will not have it.</span> <span id="s931">So they let us alone.</span> <span id="s932">They run for their rations; and we run to the wagons.</span> <span id="s933">And the other guys, we told them we are set up to be shot at 7 o'clock.</span> <span id="s934">And they think when we go on the wagons, they will not know who it was, or whatever.</span> <span id="s935">And the guy who was in charge--for each wagon, was a guard in charge--he said, "No.”</span> <span id="s936">He got all the people.</span> <span id="s937">He doesn't need anymore.</span> <span id="s938">He count them, always, in the evening.</span> <span id="s939">But they sat on each other, to hide them.</span> <span id="s940">He said, "No, we need them.”</span> <span id="s941">So they pulled us in the wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">That's all.</span> <span id="s943">A day, two, later... One time, uh...we saw planes coming.</span> <span id="s944">When the planes are coming was the same way like...like the Messiah come.</span> <span id="s945">We had the nice face like normal people--smiling, bright smiling.</span> <span id="s946">And here the guards, the SS and those lot, they keep on looking; and they really, they bombed the wagons...the wagons.</span> <span id="s947">And there, they first they run away--those guards.</span> <span id="s948">And we had to run away; although we had been legal, actually.</span> <span id="s949">No, we could run away.</span> <span id="s950">We hanged around in the woods here and there.</span> <span id="s951">And then they come again.</span> <span id="s952">They start to gather us and bring us back.</span> <span id="s953">And, uh, they brought us back.</span> <span id="s954">I remember...I don't remember what town it was.</span> <span id="s955">A little German town.</span> <span id="s956">I know it was in the front a restaurant, in the back was a large backyard.</span> <span id="s957">They brought us over there.</span> <span id="s958">And it's meant like: somebody goes here, somebody here, somebody here, somebody here.</span> <span id="s959">And sure enough, we saw it.</span> <span id="s960">One side, actually--took us to the other side, not where I was--they shot them like nothing.</span> <span id="s961">Everybody just...you didn't hear even a scream, not a..</span> <span id="s962">.</span> <span id="s963">Like nothing happened.</span> <span id="s964">You just saw them lying dead, all of them.</span> <span id="s965">They put us on wagons again.</span> <span id="s966">No, they marched us.</span> <span id="s967">Meant that we have to walk.</span> <span id="s968">But on the way, so long we have been marching.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">You...they allowed you to march.</span> <span id="s970">You didn't get no food, no nothing; but they...you could march.</span> <span id="s971">But if you couldn't march anymore, whatever...shot you.</span> <span id="s972">So both sides of the road been full with dead bodies.</span> <span id="s973">We didn't realize, but later we hear they keep on shooting.</span> <span id="s974">So we realized.</span> <span id="s975">The beginning, we didn't know why it was so many dead bodies.</span> <span id="s976">We realized what had happened.</span> <span id="s977">In Tröglitz was 4, 5 thousand people alive--maybe.</span> <span id="s978">But when we came back over there to our...again to the Sammelpunkt [German: "collecting place"], where they gathered us all together, maybe was 200.</span> <span id="s979">I don't know.</span> <span id="s980">It's hard to tell.</span> <span id="s981">It was not too many.</span> <span id="s982">All other have been in the...in the side of the ditches.</span> <span id="s983">And this, I believe, was Leitmeritz [NB: Litom ice].</span> <span id="s984">Leitmeritz: the same way, no floor.</span> <span id="s985">You have a barrack, and they had everything terrible.</span> <span id="s986">Uh, but...uh... they didn't beat you, nothing.</span> <span id="s987">They...they said, "The morning, you're gonna get coffee.”</span> <span id="s988">We didn't hear anymore about bread, even; but "You gonna get coffee.”</span> <span id="s989">And we carried around always a rusted can, you know.</span> <span id="s990">And we couldn't practically sleep the whole night.</span> <span id="s991">We waited already to get something a little bit warm in our mouth.</span> <span id="s992">True enough, early in the morning, they said we get the coffee.</span> <span id="s993">Everybody runs, didn't took no chances to wait.</span> <span id="s994">Everybody wanted to be first.</span> <span id="s995">And we got over there.</span> <span id="s996">And I got the coffee, whatever; and I dranked it down quick.</span> <span id="s997">Then they tell us, "All you...you gonna be taken to Theresienstadt [NB: Terezín].</span> <span id="s998">This is a sanitorium.</span> <span id="s999">It's not anymore a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1000">You're gonna be treated like people.</span> <span id="s1001">Oh, you don't know how lucky you all are!"</span> <span id="s1002">You know.</span> <span id="s1003">But...uh...after I drank, suddenly I got diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1004">I got diarrhea, and I 9 Subcamp of Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s1005">Located in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">couldn't stay on my legs anymore.</span> <span id="s1007">But I had two good friends, what I had been with them together in Auschwitz--[Yankin (ph)] and another.</span> <span id="s1008">They say, "Mietek, [Three or four Yiddish sentences follow, which are undeciferable].”</span> <span id="s1009">Theresienstadt...we saw it, more or less.</span> <span id="s1010">We saw it like people; because we didn't look like people.</span> <span id="s1011">This is the truth.</span> <span id="s1012">We didn't look...when they looked at us, they got scared.</span> <span id="s1013">They run.</span> <span id="s1014">They run away.</span> <span id="s1015">And here, if they pass by like with food supplies what they cared to give out for the people, those people attacked.</span> <span id="s1016">I mean, I couldn't...I couldn't walk... They attacked, and they grabbed whatever they could.</span> <span id="s1017">So we...we even looked like a wild, wild animals.</span> <span id="s1018">I'm not talking about humans at all.</span> <span id="s1019">When we came in, I was in very bad shape.</span> <span id="s1020">And we was in the block, suddenly.</span> <span id="s1021">And they start a little bit...they said, "You'll get a little bit food.”</span> <span id="s1022">We got a little bit food, here and there.</span> <span id="s1023">They kept us waiting.</span> <span id="s1024">They start to disinfect...disinfection us... You know, all kind woman came.</span> <span id="s1025">They shaved us all the way, everywhere.</span> <span id="s1026">And they gave us, more or less, clothes...new clothing.</span> <span id="s1027">I mean, clean clothing.</span> <span id="s1028">Because ours was terrible.</span> <span id="s1029">Because we never changed.</span> <span id="s1030">I was over there [NB: in Tröglitz] over 3 months.</span> <span id="s1031">We never had a different shirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Whatever we got in the beginning, this...this...we had it all the time on.</span> <span id="s1033">And so they more or less disinfect us a little bit.</span> <span id="s1034">And it's... But people kept on dying and dying and dying, if you eat something.</span> <span id="s1035">But I didn't cared.</span> <span id="s1036">I kept on...kept on eating and eating; and I kept on feeling better and better.</span> <span id="s1037">And I felt, actually, that I start to get a little bit more to myself...to be myself.</span> <span id="s1038">And for some reason, always they picked me...they picked me.</span> <span id="s1039">They needed over there to keep an eye to give out the supply ...food supply, what it came from the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1040">From Switzerland, from Sweden.</span> <span id="s1041">That I should help over there giving it out.</span> <span id="s1042">Alright, I came over there.</span> <span id="s1043">And over there was from the best breads, from the best butters, from the best.</span> <span id="s1044">.</span> <span id="s1045">uh.</span> <span id="s1046">.</span> <span id="s1047">sausages.</span> <span id="s1048">You name it.</span> <span id="s1049">Over there was...was it, over there.</span> <span id="s1050">Only thing you...if you could eat it.</span> <span id="s1051">And who could eat it, everybody really got real ...like normal; strong back.</span> <span id="s1052">And for some reason, I had to go in the same way; count always the people in the blocks, where we supplied them with food.</span> <span id="s1053">And I don't know what it happened.</span> <span id="s1054">Suddenly, I lost mine appetite.</span> <span id="s1055">I couldn't eat anymore.</span> <span id="s1056">And they put me over there, like in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1057">Was no doctors, no taking care.</span> <span id="s1058">You just laid.</span> <span id="s1059">You wait until you drop dead, because everyday whatever they put in over there is very seldom somebody walked out from it.</span> <span id="s1060">And I was over there, didn't had no treatment.</span> <span id="s1061">No, I didn't know what it was 'til today.</span> <span id="s1062">But I know one thing.</span> <span id="s1063">Whenever I could have the best food and eating, was my...my mouth was locked up--like with a lock.I used to take, along a park, Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1064">They still had parks.</span> <span id="s1065">And I said, "I go in fresh air, sit on a bench.</span> <span id="s1066">Maybe I'll be able [to eat].”</span> <span id="s1067">Nothing helped.</span> <span id="s1068">I was over there maybe a week, laying around.</span> <span id="s1069">And I still don't know--I had a chance to walk out to over there, and I could walk already.</span> <span id="s1070">My appetite start to come little by little.</span> <span id="s1071">I..</span> <span id="s1072">.</span> <span id="s1073">I know I never fight for my life, actually.</span> <span id="s1074">In fact, I was upset why I am alive.</span> <span id="s1075">It was much more better people than me.</span> <span id="s1076">(Long pause - crying).</span> <span id="s1077">Yeah, then...then I was tried to go to Poland back.</span> <span id="s1078">I thought for a few or maybe I found a brother or something.</span> <span id="s1079">I had still brothers, two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Somebody.</span> <span id="s1081">And I was in Radomsko--this is about 20 miles from Przedborz--and I tried to go in.</span> <span id="s1082">On the way, I recognized one who used to work in the factory for us.</span> <span id="s1083">And I called his name.</span> <span id="s1084">And I said, "[Piogotski (ph)]!"</span> <span id="s1085">This was his name.</span> <span id="s1086">So he came...he passed by with 10 This would seem to suggest Tetanus--also known as "Lockjaw."</span> <span id="s1087">horses with a carriage, with a wagon.</span> <span id="s1088">And he said--the first thing what he asked me, "You still _ywy [Pol]?!"</span> <span id="s1089">That means, "You are...are you alive?!"</span> <span id="s1090">Like I shouldn't live over there.</span> <span id="s1091">And then he told me about Przedborz, it was 12 people.</span> <span id="s1092">They had been, more or less, like unterwald Jewish people, you know.</span> <span id="s1093">You know people, who didn't bother... didn't care.</span> <span id="s1094">They just...you know, they have been...were hidden among Poles, didn't say they're Jews.</span> <span id="s1095">They survived.</span> <span id="s1096">They used to live in a one Jewish home over there in Przedborz.</span> <span id="s1097">And one night, the Poles came...the AK--Armia Krajowa.</span> <span id="s1098">It's a Polish extreme radical organization.</span> <span id="s1099">They killed all 12.</span> <span id="s1100">They put up sacks on their heads, and with axes.</span> <span id="s1101">So he told me, "It's not too safe for you to go back home.”</span> <span id="s1102">A woman saw I had the conversation and I start to cry.</span> <span id="s1103">And I told...uh...to this [Piogotski (ph)], I told him in Polish...I told him, "You know that I didn't go to Auschwitz as a Jew.”</span> <span id="s1104">It was not... It was true.</span> <span id="s1105">Because I was involved, I listened always, you know, to BBC.</span> <span id="s1106">This was everything... When the SS men, they examined--the Gendarmerie, you know--this was all written in.</span> <span id="s1107">And I told him, "I went to Auschwitz...uh, like...as a Pole!</span> <span id="s1108">And now I cannot go back?"</span> <span id="s1109">And I start to cry, and I practically spit on him.</span> <span id="s1110">So the woman came out, and she said... And I told her what's happen; and she said, "Please, do me a favor.</span> <span id="s1111">If you want go, go to a big city.</span> <span id="s1112">Go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1113">Go to _ód_--Litzmannstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">But you cannot go to Przedborz.”</span> <span id="s1115">So in the morning ...and she took me in, in her house, and I slept the night; and the morning, I went back to the train.</span> <span id="s1116">And I went back to Prague, to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1117">When I came to Czechoslovakia, I met other friends who survived in Auschwitz; and they went home to...to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1118">They told me, "Come.</span> <span id="s1119">Come along.”</span> <span id="s1120">They know it I don't have nobody.</span> <span id="s1121">They said, "Why don't you come along...come with us to Belgium?"</span> <span id="s1122">I said, "Okay.”</span> <span id="s1123">So they told me...they gave me a few hints--cities.</span> <span id="s1124">They says, "When the Consul ask you, you tell them, you know, this and this and this.”</span> <span id="s1125">And I come to the Consul, whatever.</span> <span id="s1126">He asks me other questions [than] what they told me.</span> <span id="s1127">So he said, "You are not from Belgium.”</span> <span id="s1128">So, no, I didn't pass.</span> <span id="s1129">I couldn't go.</span> <span id="s1130">So they told me, "Go to a sanitorium over there," where they have been.</span> <span id="s1131">He says, "Over there, they treat you real, real good.</span> <span id="s1132">And real nice.”</span> <span id="s1133">Then he gave me the address, and I went over there to the sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1134">They told me, "Don't say you are from Poland.”</span> <span id="s1135">They say, "If you're from Poland...” They have...uh, skirmishes--the Polish army with the Czech army--at this time.</span> <span id="s1136">Must have been in...in May '45.</span> <span id="s1137">And so I said, "Okay.”</span> <span id="s1138">I came to the sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1139">They asked me, "From where you are?"</span> <span id="s1140">And I told them I am from Hannover, in Germany.</span> <span id="s1141">And they took me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">And the Czech people, it's unbelievable how decent and good people.</span> <span id="s1143">I never saw it, and I couldn't believe it, how they treat me.</span> <span id="s1144">Finally, a doctor examined me; and he told me that mine heart is enlarged.</span> <span id="s1145">This comes from hunger.</span> <span id="s1146">He told me not to walk steps, this and this.</span> <span id="s1147">And I ask him...I ask him, "Is this forever?"</span> <span id="s1148">He said, "No.</span> <span id="s1149">It's not to say.</span> <span id="s1150">If you in normal conditions, maybe it goes back to normal.”</span> <span id="s1151">But this was the first time I was examined.</span> <span id="s1152">I was over there for about 4 weeks.</span> <span id="s1153">And I look... I couldn't recognize myself.</span> <span id="s1154">Used...Mrs. Beneš one time came to see us.</span> <span id="s1155">Young girls used to come.</span> <span id="s1156">And we still have been our head shaved.</span> <span id="s1157">We didn't look...we looked half-human.</span> <span id="s1158">They used to say how beautiful we are.</span> <span id="s1159">It's unbelievable how decent, good people they are.</span> <span id="s1160">(Crying) Okay, this was actually in there, I used to go out already in Prague.</span> <span id="s1161">And I always...I didn't care to be on the...the Russian side.</span> <span id="s1162">And we used to hear always...used to come in the other occupation to the American side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">And they used to say that, you know, that they're treated real nice.</span> <span id="s1164">The Army take care, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1165">And I..</span> <span id="s1166">.</span> <span id="s1167">I just didn't like to see Russian soldiers, to be honest.</span> <span id="s1168">So I went to an organization where they send you home from wherever you are.</span> <span id="s1169">So I went to this organization, said I want to... I told them I want to go back home; because Hannover, I think, was under the British, even.</span> <span id="s1170">And they said, "Oh, to Hannover, they have only 1 month a transport.</span> <span id="s1171">You would have to wait 2, 3 more weeks.”</span> <span id="s1172">Then was over there a German.</span> <span id="s1173">And he says he drives his car to Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s1174">He drives to Stuttgart;
