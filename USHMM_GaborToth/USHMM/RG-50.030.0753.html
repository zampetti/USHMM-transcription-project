So, professor, I would like to start with some basic questions: where were you born, and – and where were you raised?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Well, I was born in a little village, which changed hands a number of times.</span> <span id="s14">It was called Poliana Kobyletska.</span> <span id="s15">Poliana, p-o-l-y-n, koba, k-o-b – koba, b-e-l-e-c-k-y, that’s how I spell it.</span> <span id="s16">At that time, when I was born, it was Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s17">Then for a while after the war, it was Russia.</span> <span id="s18">Now it’s Ukraine.</span> <span id="s19">But my father got there because – which is interesting – all of a sudden – that’s what people told me, a wonder rabbi appeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: A wonder rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s22">Supposedly he performed miracles.</span> <span id="s23">He knew a person, the ba – sickness, which is always the platform for wonder people, you know, to heal, to – and my f – and he needed somebody to set up his – his sel – activities, and my father was chosen, and therefore he moved to – he – he settled in Poliana, in Ponya(ph), and he moved there.</span> <span id="s24">And of course, I was there, I was born there.</span> <span id="s25">I tell it because all of a sudden, two or three years later, he ceased performing miracles, and the whole thing evaporated, and there was no – there was no reason for my grandfather – for my father any more to stay there, and we moved away from there, we moved to a bigger city called Houst(ph) or Hist(ph), Houst(ph).</span> <span id="s26">May I also tell you, I think it’s interesting, you – you’ll decide what you want do with this story.</span> <span id="s27">After this he became paralyzed, and nobody even know where – what happened then.</span> <span id="s28">The whole thing, the whole – there were only 50 families, Jewish families in – in that village, and if he left, th –</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Was his whole body paralyzed?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Whole bo-body, th – we need – and people didn’t – didn’t hear from him, I didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s31">And then, a few month before deportation, in ’44, I got a message he appeared, reappeared.</span> <span id="s32">Must have been in an institution the meantime, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s33">He reappeared, and asked to be – he wants to see me.</span> <span id="s34">I was come pa – I was [indecipherable] outside my narrow – he must have heard, he wants to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: So you were about 15 or 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Fifteen or 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: And you had not seen your father for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: No, I – my father, we – we do – I’ll come to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: I – I just want that – you don’t have to mention, but it’s interesting.</span> <span id="s41">I – he came to see me, he want to come and see me, in a wheelchair, of course.</span> <span id="s42">As soon as he opened the door, he burst out into tears loudly, and he couldn’t speak.</span> <span id="s43">Tried to break into – hold a conversation, to engage in something, and didn’t come out.</span> <span id="s44">So much so that said goodbye, and we left.</span> <span id="s45">Few month later, there were – we were – the deportation to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s46">I’m always asking myself, what was the – the – the cause for that – what shall I say?</span> <span id="s47">Thunder, kind of flood of tears that came out?</span> <span id="s48">Could it be that I reminded him of the years when he had power, and that caused that?</span> <span id="s49">Or, he still had some power, and he knew about the deportation.</span> <span id="s50">He knew I had [indecipherable] time.</span> <span id="s51">In any case, a few month later – later, of course he was deported, and he was – so, let me go back.</span> <span id="s52">My father left, went back to Houst(ph), and we lived in Houst(ph) two or three years, and then my mother and father broke up, and the age four or five – I was born in ’27 – the age of four or five, we – Mother left Father, and we went to Sighet, where my grandfather lived.</span> <span id="s53">It was in Sighet that I was brought up, and I lived there with grandfather.</span> <span id="s54">Finally they were divorced.</span> <span id="s55">Til Mengele separated grandfather from me, you know, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Tell me a little bit about your grandfather, because he really became the father in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Right, he is the – the – I do say, I say it in the book.</span> <span id="s58">There are two people who had the influence.</span> <span id="s59">One was the grandfather, who was a gr – great Talmud scholar, but old-fashioned, if I may use the word [indecipherable] the old-fashioned, but the – who – who – who taught themself [indecipherable] at night, he used to give a – a lesson [indecipherable] Talmud.</span> <span id="s60">And – and he brought me up, that’s the male figure that I know.</span> <span id="s61">He was very poor, he could hardly support me and my mom, my mother and another sister.</span> <span id="s62">But he was then a great influence, that he taught me how to learn on a simple, elementary level.</span> <span id="s63">And he was a shochet, he was a Belzer shochet, with uniform, with a kapoto(ph), you know what’s a kapoto(ph) and [indecipherable] so from secular knowledge, or secular activity, he had no idea, there was no – it’s no – he didn’t – you can’t even see he rejected it because he had no dealings, or that.</span> <span id="s64">So I was brought up, and of course, along these lines.</span> <span id="s65">And then people asked – even today asked me how – where it comes from.</span> <span id="s66">I can’t answer the question.</span> <span id="s67">Since I remember, even when I was five or six years, and lived under the influence of grandfather, I wanted to study secular knowledge.</span> <span id="s68">I wanted to have secular knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Did you go to – did you go to a secular school at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: That’s what they – people asking me, where did that come.</span> <span id="s73">Maybe you will see what you could do with that.</span> <span id="s74">When I was a chi – five, six years even, and I used to pray, daven, and I said the prayer [indecipherable] God give us in our heart, understanding, to understand you and so on.</span> <span id="s75">I remember I used to look at the window, signifying outside knowledge as well, not only religious knowledge.</span> <span id="s76">Where I got that – that urge, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s77">That really, after the war, after the liberation, that was the reason I didn’t go to Israel.</span> <span id="s78">I wanted – was afraid I wouldn’t be able to study there, I didn’t know, secular knowledge, so I went to the United States where the – so – so I had the – but then I was – so grandfather had the enormous influence, other than some ideas.</span> <span id="s79">I was never a shochet, never believed in the [indecipherable], even though grandfather used to tell miracles, and the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s80">And then, of course, that lasted til – til ’44, and then ’44, the other person that had the influence on me, was Professor Saul Lieberman, who was the great – the great Talmud scholars.</span> <span id="s81">And then eventually I adopted the more scientific, or the more critical approach – could tell you I – to the study of Talmud, which I now write, teach, preach.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: So you mentioned that you were considered a child prodigy in the – in the town where you grew up.</span> <span id="s83">Can you remember at all how you – when you first realized that might have a calling in this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes, I remember exactly.</span> <span id="s85">When I felt that the first time – when others felt that, how old was I?</span> <span id="s86">Was I seven?</span> <span id="s87">Around there, give or take.</span> <span id="s88">I used to go every Friday with grandfather to take a bath.</span> <span id="s89">We had no pi – we didn’t had hot water in the house, we had to warm it up [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s90">So once a week, Friday, as you could imagine, we went, and there was ambatya(ph), a bath.</span> <span id="s91">We had to pay for it, and grand – but the – I was allowed for the two of us, he and me to use the same – the same bath.</span> <span id="s92">One day – one week – one Friday – be th-there was a seat there, I remember, and there were two – what’s the English word for ambatya(ph)?</span> <span id="s93">What is it called, the one that – it escapes me.</span> <span id="s94">The one that you have inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: A bath.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: A bath, but what is it called, skatabietel(ph) in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Not a sauna, or a steambath?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: No, no, no, no, the container.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Oh, oh, a – a tub?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: A tu – that’s a tub, there’s a name, the tub, the ba-bathtub.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Bathtub, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yeah, the bathtub is good enough.</span> <span id="s103">I remember the bathtub in there was two, kind of place to sit, and I – we got up on the bathtub, and I tell grandfather, I remember, I could tell you the name of all generation, the name of the generations, since the time of Adam, the first person, til King David.</span> <span id="s104">[indecipherable] And I gave him the list, I still remember it.</span> <span id="s105">And that –</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: T-Tell me – right, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: And so much so that afterwards, people in the street used to tell the story, and they used to ask me, and [indecipherable] which is the –</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: So they would come up to you and ask you questions, try to test you.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yeah [indecipherable] wha-what – what’s the te – what’s the 21st [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s110">I have an interesting story I will tell though.</span> <span id="s111">I was – later on I learned Talmud, at the age of nine, 10, I knew 200 pages [indecipherable] by heart.</span> <span id="s112">And I came to a city, it’s called Vishiva, my late wife came from there.</span> <span id="s113">And a man by the name of Lefkowich(ph), Bartka(ph) Lefkowich(ph) I think it was.</span> <span id="s114">Yakabowich(ph).</span> <span id="s115">Yakabowich(ph) told me, I’ll give you – tell me the 25th rovo(ph), the name of the sage who’s mentioned [indecipherable], and I’ll give you 25 lei.</span> <span id="s116">For a poor – for me, that was considerable money.</span> <span id="s117">So I told him.</span> <span id="s118">And I was stretching out my hand to get money.</span> <span id="s119">He turns to me, he says, how do I know that you are right?</span> <span id="s120">I remember it to this day, over here, I – I have – that was taken back, that he – he has such a [indecipherable] question.</span> <span id="s121">He – I – but I wanted the money, and he was willing to give, so I told him, if I’ll tell you the 10, the 15, the 20th and the 25th, would you give me the money?</span> <span id="s122">No, don’t want.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Can you – I don’t want to forget your mother.</span> <span id="s124">Can you tell me a little bit about your mother, and – cause she also raised you, obviously, and you –</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Lately – lately, I was thinking about that.</span> <span id="s126">Interesting.</span> <span id="s127">She was bitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Bitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Bitter, yeah, because of the divorce, and she was an elegant woman, and – but life wasn’t elegant, life didn’t treat her too well.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: And what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Fayga(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Fayga(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Our ten – two weeks ago, less than two weeks, it was 70 years that she and grandfather and my sister and Aunt Ani(ph) arrived at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s134">And really I was thinking, trying even to remember, I remembered that she would kiss me and passionately – I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s135">She was suffering.</span> <span id="s136">She had the daughter who was paralyzed.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: My sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Laysha(ph) was her name.</span> <span id="s143">She died afterwards a natural death, but that, of course, made life much more miserable.</span> <span id="s144">She was relatively intelligent, she had a Hungarian [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s145">She had ambition, she was a – which were never realized.</span> <span id="s146">So, she was religious.</span> <span id="s147">So finally she was claimed by the crematoria, when she came.</span> <span id="s148">That was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s149">And then I was together with the aunt, she had a sister.</span> <span id="s150">The problem was that when we came to grandfather, we were four people; grandfather and the three children.</span> <span id="s151">I had a sister, and I’m one – the sick sister, and myself, and she and the mother, we were four people.</span> <span id="s152">Grandfather, with difficulty, could support us, which made – cal – created tension.</span> <span id="s153">We had really no full job.</span> <span id="s154">So we ca – we – we – we came to gr-gr-grand-mother, she had to [indecipherable] in the – the – the kitchen, they have, of course, and the – the household, and so on.</span> <span id="s155">But she was always – always a sense of bitterness.</span> <span id="s156">But the problem was when we came the grandfather, in addition to the poverty, he had two still unmarried daughters.</span> <span id="s157">And in those time, marriageable – to marriage, to get dowry, was not an easy – one easy thing.</span> <span id="s158">And the – and that, of course, added tension to the house, which I [indecipherable] occasionally used to shout at me, then the other – I was convinced that they were against me.</span> <span id="s159">And then finally one got married, and faced a tragedy; husband died within two or three years.</span> <span id="s160">But the other daughter came with me, though shu – she must have been about in the late 20s, you could imagine those days, probably [indecipherable] to explain, you’ll understand.</span> <span id="s161">I thought she’s against me, and there is nothing I could do.</span> <span id="s162">But I knew that if you make a Mi Shebeirach, you know what a Mi Shebeirach is?</span> <span id="s163">When you read the Torah, if you want ask for health, or for anything, you read – you make – ask for a special blessing while the Torah, the scroll is on the table, that has special – so as a child, eight or nine, I thought that will work negatively too.</span> <span id="s164">If I’ll make a anti Mi Shebeirach against it, she will – something.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: It’s like a curse or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Something left.</span> <span id="s167">I didn’t realize that when we arrived at Auschwitz 70 years ago, and they opened up the cars, and they shouted [speaks German] I apparently was near the door, and I jumped out from among the first one on the – I heard the shouting after me in Yiddish [speaks Yiddish].</span> <span id="s168">The Torah that you so much worked on – worked on it – on there, should offend you – protect you.</span> <span id="s169">And I contribute – and it did protect.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: That’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s171">So she – she – you – you realized that she – she loved you.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: She realized that time that she loved me.</span> <span id="s173">In the Torah that you so much worked on – n-not so that I’d worked, that – that there’s – there’s so much willing to renounce, conveniences [indecipherable] convenience in order to achieve it, protect.</span> <span id="s174">She was – she didn’t go to the crematoria, she went to a labor camp, and she died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Can you – I – I wonder if it’s possible if you could just take a – a couple minutes to tell us a little bit about what life was like in the town where you grew up.</span> <span id="s176">Just – it’s a very – it’s interesting, because you’re a connection to a – to a – hundreds of years of history that have been lost to many of us.</span> <span id="s177">But – and it was – and that was destroyed, you know, in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: The – the city?</span> <span id="s179">The city –</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: What was life like there, when you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: The city was almost 10,000 Jews, mainly Hassidim.</span> <span id="s182">There were non-religious Jews too, but I didn’t know them, I found out after the war.</span> <span id="s183">Some of the youth were communists, like in other places.</span> <span id="s184">Religious.</span> <span id="s185">But I wa – I think I’m making a – a truthful statement; when I came to Sighet when I was 40 years old, so that could be ’31 – ’32.</span> <span id="s186">There may have been seven – several hundred young people with payos.</span> <span id="s187">When I left Sighet in ’44, there were less than 50.</span> <span id="s188">So this secularization [indecipherable] or the communization had enormous impact.</span> <span id="s189">The Jews were generally poor, all Hassidim of certain Rebbes, engaged in quarrel, in [indecipherable] as there is always between the Rebbes.</span> <span id="s190">And little – none – no connection with the non-Jews.</span> <span id="s191">I – we – the language we spoke, and didn’t even know it, was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s192">I mean, I know Yiddish, how to go buy – buy in the – in the shop.</span> <span id="s193">But I didn’t know [indecipherable] the Yiddish, I didn’t even know that there is some Germans in Yiddish, I eventually found out that the German’s in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s194">After the war I felt a kind of [indecipherable] a kind of poetic urge to write down, jot down, but I know no language, only Yiddish.</span> <span id="s195">So I jotted down in Yiddish, and I was embarrassed to show.</span> <span id="s196">But not long ago, I took it out, and they’re translating it to French.</span> <span id="s197">So I don’t know Yiddish, but not literally, I guess.</span> <span id="s198">And although in my time there was already compuls – education was compulsory.</span> <span id="s199">But since I was born in the Czechoslovakian side, and I lived in Sighet, Romania, Mother denied me.</span> <span id="s200">Every year before scrips – school, the – an official came and asked, well is – are there children of school age, Mother could deny.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s202">This is a Romanian official, or Hungarian official?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: A Romanian official.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Romanian official, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: But after the da – ma – the Hungarian came in, she couldn’t deny.</span> <span id="s206">She was afraid to deny me because that would be [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s207">So she burst out, she acknowledged, she confessed that she have.</span> <span id="s208">And then became [indecipherable] I was already almost [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s209">So with [indecipherable] with connections, they let me do private – there were the four question – the four classes.</span> <span id="s210">So I think I did officially made the four classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: How did – how did the Jews largely support themselves ak – you know, in – in Sighet?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Likely to?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: How did – how did – how did the family, the Jewish families support themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Depend.</span> <span id="s215">There were a few stor – a few rich Jews.</span> <span id="s216">I don’t know, one of them was the richest, name was Mandolovich(ph), he had a textile store.</span> <span id="s217">Not educated, but rich.</span> <span id="s218">But most of them were poor.</span> <span id="s219">Par – really poverty where e – bread was a looked after item, seek – seek after item.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: What did you typically have for dinner, for instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Well, when things worked, we did have chicken – we did have meat, no, chicken was a – we used to buy – go to the – to the place where butcher, where they sold meat, and buy a cheap meat, and we used to eat soup.</span> <span id="s222">That was the – practically every day.</span> <span id="s223">Shabbas, we needed more, because they had a tradition Shabbas ma-mahali(ph), Shabbas foods, Shabbas – and it was a problem that we had to [indecipherable] it up.</span> <span id="s224">But we ate enough, I nevertheless was not hungry, didn’t go around town.</span> <span id="s225">But I couldn’t afford eat the kind of food I wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: I wanted to ask you what – about one other resident of the town.</span> <span id="s227">I think it’s fair to say you were probably the second most famous person to come from Sighet, but I understand you were also friends with Elie Wiesel.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yeah, we went to chayder together, very clo – he himself wrote somewhere that the closest people have is his wife and Halivni.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Can you tell a – can you remember a little bit about what he was like when he was a boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Sure, I could tell you about it.</span> <span id="s231">He was a kind of sickly child, didn’t always come to chayder.</span> <span id="s232">And he look – sit near the window and looked up at the window [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s233">But he was bright, you could see he was bright.</span> <span id="s234">I sat near the Rebbe.</span> <span id="s235">He was a kind of [indecipherable] he sat at the window.</span> <span id="s236">He did go to school, so he knew Romanian.</span> <span id="s237">And from the Romanian, so close to French, that’s why after the war, he picked up French as his language.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: We – he was not on the same transport with you to Auschwitz, was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Th – not the sa – but the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: He – he – I wa – his father was a policeman, he was no – in the ghetto, wasn’t always negative.</span> <span id="s242">And that’s why he was left to the last transport.</span> <span id="s243">I had nobody, I was the first [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s244">We – I went Monday and he went thurs – Thursday, I think, or next Sunday.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s246">Let me ask you, in the town where you were raised, was their much knowledge of the events in the outside world?</span> <span id="s247">What was happening in –</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Very – very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: – what was happening in Germany with the Nazis –</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Very – very little.</span> <span id="s251">We did know there were a few pe – one or two person who came back Brest-Litovsk.</span> <span id="s252">The Hungarians, in ’43, or ’44, before the general deportation, deported some people who were – were not citizens of – and they brought them on the Polish side, Brest-Litovsk, where the Germans shot them and that.</span> <span id="s253">One ot – including my father, came back.</span> <span id="s254">I don’t know, he smuggled the way back.</span> <span id="s255">And they told of this.</span> <span id="s256">But that only – they wasn’t supposed to speak about it, so only a few days ago la – only single out individual, you know, and that.</span> <span id="s257">But the idea was, I still remember it, tha-that that wouldn’t happen in – in Hungary, Horthy was the – the – worl – one – wa – law and order, and he will protect, and so –</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: So there was no discussion that you remember about trying to leave, or to –</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: No, not in my circle.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: – or sense of foreboding.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Obviously there were some clever people who had inside, who had – who had the opportunity.</span> <span id="s262">I had no opportu – we had no opportunity to go anywhere.</span> <span id="s263">We didn’t have the money to pay for the – for the transportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: So in March of 1944, the Germans occupied</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: In [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: – and do you remember anything about when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: We – yes, we all do – in the morning, we had no radio, but the neighbor had a radio, and came in [indecipherable] and told us that the German occupied it.</span> <span id="s268">But I didn’t know the significance.</span> <span id="s269">But th-the soon the Germans occupied, then beginning the ghetto, and [indecipherable] in between and they were moving, and the results, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: So the Germans occupied Sighet, and – and they created the ghetto.</span> <span id="s271">Can you tell us anything about when you were – how you were forced to leave your house, or just any, any of the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yeah, I didn’t a ba – to me it meant my house had a small apartment that we lived, and I was – I was not so inconvenient, I remember [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s273">We were moved to the shlangengasta(ph), the place, with another family, in a one – two room.</span> <span id="s274">I was still continuing to study, I was diligent, I studied, I remember.</span> <span id="s275">And – and it wasn’t so – and even the ghetto I was – where we went to oyber-yaddish(ph), another section of town.</span> <span id="s276">I wasn’t so inconvenient.</span> <span id="s277">I did – I didn’t go out to the street [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s278">There was something to eat.</span> <span id="s279">[indecipherable] inconvenient.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Was it the German SS, or was it the Hungarian police that –</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: The Hungarian police.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: So the Germans were not –</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: You did hardly see a soul.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Hardly see them, mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s286">And I was like – people thought the ghetto – we were only af – two or three weeks in the ghetto, four weeks.</span> <span id="s287">Four weeks.</span> <span id="s288">So I was not so – I didn’t have such a luxurious life, wasn’t so inconvenient.</span> <span id="s289">And as long as they let me do wa – do what I did before, I – it was only when the – they took us away, led – took a – an-and turned us in the synagogue, Mozeikatorah(ph), and from there, they took us.</span> <span id="s290">Again, the Hungarians took, and they put out to the train.</span> <span id="s291">There wasn’t Germans there.</span> <span id="s292">The Germans le – my contact with the Germans was th – in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s294">So you didn’t really come into contact with the Germans until Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s296">I hardly even saw them, although they were around.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s298">Did – let me ask you a couple other questions about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s299">Wa – it sounds as if it was – it was not like in Warsaw, say, where they set up a – a fence, or anything, it was just –</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: No, not in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s301">At least my – I don’t know what people, even include maybe [indecipherable] father, who was an ins – who’s an insider to the admin – leading, I will tell you.</span> <span id="s302">I had no connection.</span> <span id="s303">I was – I had two rooms, then I had one room, I mean, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Did you live with another family?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yes, I live with a – with a relative, another family.</span> <span id="s306">So I –</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: And you could come and go, it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: As long.</span> <span id="s309">Not well.</span> <span id="s310">I couldn’t come and go, I couldn’t go leave the ghetto.</span> <span id="s311">But I could go out to the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Ah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: But it was so crowded.</span> <span id="s314">We live – I’d shared th-the same room, with the – I don’t remember now – no, I don’t think anybody slept with me in the bed.</span> <span id="s315">I still had a bed of my own.</span> <span id="s316">Maybe on the floor, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Do you remember much about the day in which the Hungarian police liquidated the – the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Very much, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: T-Tell me a little bit about that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Well, they came into the shul.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: They told you to come to – to th – they told you to come –</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Then they kept us for a day in the shul.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Couldn’t move from there, and shouting.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Did they give you any food to eat, or water to drink?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s327">There was something there, or we brought from we had – no, we didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s328">We had enough food even on the train, the people.</span> <span id="s329">What did they do with the food they left behind?</span> <span id="s330">I remember – what I think is that when we – told us to leave the ghetto, and we were – we were ord – form in a line, in – in the outside, before they took out to the shul.</span> <span id="s331">And that time, then I remembered – I realized that this is serious business.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Did they tell you what they were going to do with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: They didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: They didn’t tell them.</span> <span id="s336">We didn’t know even on the train where we are going.</span> <span id="s337">The only time we got – we knew we wer – we heard the story about working, we thought maybe the Germans will take us for work, and grandfather used to say to us that, you will – I will help – you will work for me.</span> <span id="s338">I mean, I – the only time we – we – we got suspicious was on Kashu(ph).</span> <span id="s339">There’s this big city Kashu.</span> <span id="s340">And I didn’t know, but the people – when we moved in our direction, with the train, the Kashu people [indecipherable] moving towards Poland, not towards Germany, and then we became scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: All right, but at that time, do you have any sense of a –</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: My father went to work, but – but – but the – the trains were horrible.</span> <span id="s343">I mean, you could imagine, was – they were crowded, there were no facilities for the doing – and – and there was some kind of disciplines.</span> <span id="s344">But this – we had thought this until we go to work.</span> <span id="s345">Once you wor-wor – go to work, it difficult.</span> <span id="s346">Every – every work what – but when we moved to Poland, to that direction, people were – who knew, realized that they take to Poland, then became panic.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: So there were people on the train that knew about the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: No, no gas chambers, they knew they lead to Poland and that – they – they – they thought that we would have gone to Germany, we probably would work.</span> <span id="s349">If we went to Poland, there is no order.</span> <span id="s350">There is no –</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: They thought they might – that you would – you would be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Tha – and to – to Poland that wa – was a bad omen.</span> <span id="s353">A-All the – all the [indecipherable] almost kill them, because some people know – heard from people who returned.</span> <span id="s354">We knew the Russians, that they were there.</span> <span id="s355">But I personally was not too much involved with these predictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Were you on the same – in the same car with your family, with your grandfather and mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: So you – you were there with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: I’m telling you, til – til I jumped off the car, and – and then – I mentioned that on the book, that I jumped off the car, and we [indecipherable] we were the ramp.</span> <span id="s360">You don’t know what [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s361">And passed by Mother, Mother reached me then, and she saw grandfather from a distance.</span> <span id="s362">So Mother says, don’t leave the maltan(ph) zeyan(ph), the old grandfather, alone.</span> <span id="s363">So I ran towards – I went towards him and I held onto his hand, and I was almost – soon after, I was standing before Mengele.</span> <span id="s364">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: How did you – how did you know that it was Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I didn’t know Mengele, but it was an SS, the discipline you couldn’t miss.</span> <span id="s367">And he had – he grabbed grandfather by the collar.</span> <span id="s368">And then there was the [indecipherable] the one who – who on the way met me, he says [speaks Yiddish].</span> <span id="s369">Let us hold on and go together.</span> <span id="s370">And as soon as he said, he was – and we were down before Mengele, that was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s371">So grandfather he sent on the death side.</span> <span id="s372">The [indecipherable] was a young man in the 30s, he probably would have send him on this side.</span> <span id="s373">But he told him something, I couldn’t hear.</span> <span id="s374">I assume he may have seen all his important [indecipherable], including the president going in that side all together.</span> <span id="s375">So he pushed him in that side, and that’s the – and then he turns to me and says, und du?</span> <span id="s376">And he had the – had the – a piece of, what is it?</span> <span id="s377">A piece of – made out of wood, a kind of – he hit me with that.</span> <span id="s378">You know, what’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: A stick?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Well, let’s say – not a regular stick.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: A whip?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: A whip –</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: – let’s say, a whip out of wood.</span> <span id="s385">And he hit me, and – and I went to the other side, and that – that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Did you see pictures of Mengele after the war and you realized that was the person that you had – in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Ah, I was too – too – too –</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Too dark?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: – afraid, and – during the – I couldn’t make a detective.</span> <span id="s390">But once you see it – I didn’t look in his face.</span> <span id="s391">So – and then we – I was in Auschwitz only a few days.</span> <span id="s392">I was told afterwards, I had – couldn’t even verify that, that when a transport came – and we’re talking primarily Hungarian trans – when a transport came, the tho – to Auschwitz I’m talking, the authorities contact places in Germany, asking them whether they need – whether they need workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: That I understood.</span> <span id="s395">But I didn’t know – I don’t know whether it’s true, I heard it afterwards, that if – it happened a few times.</span> <span id="s396">No – there na – there was no place that were looking for workers.</span> <span id="s397">And since transports with Hungarian Jews came one after another, they killed those transport.</span> <span id="s398">They don’t know what to do with them.</span> <span id="s399">I don’t whether that is true.</span> <span id="s400">So, not all transports went before Mengele.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Did you have a si – did you have a chance before you left, you know, before your grandfather went to the right, and you to the left, did you have a chance on the train, or anytime t-to talk with your grandfather?</span> <span id="s402">Did he give you any words of advice?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: No, no, I couldn’t te – the only thing, he thought, as I told you, that we’d be working, and he’s too old, he was 80.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: So he wanted you to work for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: He want us.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Us, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: I and my sister to work for him.</span> <span id="s408">Otherwise we were sitting dumbfounded, we didn’t – didn’t talk in there.</span> <span id="s409">There’s a [indecipherable] stench when people had no place where to go.</span> <span id="s410">There’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: I know you were only in Auschwitz for a few days, but do you remember anything about the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Not much.</span> <span id="s413">I wasn’t – I wasn’t spread out.</span> <span id="s414">Certainly I didn’t know the surroundings.</span> <span id="s415">I do know that we went out, there were some – we were discussing, wondering, pondering whether – whether we could eat treyf as – as if there is something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: What did you decide, it was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: I decided it’s okay, although there was one person who did said he will not eat, but didn’t survive, I don’t know what – that’s any connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Did – so you were – and there was no other selection while you were there at Auschwitz, you just – they just took you to this work camp –</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s420">Oh, were this – and then a few days, probably less than a week, a few days, we were told to go to the train, and we were taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: And so you never had a number.</span> <span id="s422">Did they shave your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: No number.</span> <span id="s424">I was ne – never – had no episode in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: So they took you to Gross-Rosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: And – to the sub-camp there, Wolfsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yeah, to the sub – Wolfsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: And that was really where you spent most of your time in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yeah, in the camp, that there we spent from ?</span> <span id="s431">which is what?</span> <span id="s432">What – what’s the secular month?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Of ma – June?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: May.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: May.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yeah, May, til February, practically, on the way travel.</span> <span id="s437">There is a different – I – before I – the few years, not the two or three years before deportation, I used to learn with the rabbi in the local [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s438">Not the chief rabbi, but the te – all intents and purposes, he was the chief, but he was the Dayan, which is [indecipherable] I learned – that’s where I got ordained, with him [indecipherable] that we covered a great part of the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: You were 15 when you were ordained, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yeah, well, sic –16 –</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Sixteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: – and a half.</span> <span id="s443">[indecipherable] Then, at the very end, when things became so bad, we decided that we are going to learn the – the [indecipherable] chapter 25, that deals with women who husbands were lost.</span> <span id="s444">They idea was, you probably heard the Germans, and then so on, we should know after that, wha-what to find out in case women will have problems, we should know the laws, and shall know –</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: So he wa – he had a foreboding of – of bad things to come –</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: He was – that was an omen in his mind of bad things to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yeah, was a forebo – no, but he did not have foreboding.</span> <span id="s449">And the things – it was a – usually, after the war, and so on, there’s always problems of – of agunot(ph) [coughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Do you need some water?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: I don’t know what all beca – th-that – maybe the air conditioner is thirsty.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s453">Would you like some orange juice?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Will that help?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: May – it might.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Th-The throat?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: I think it will help with the throat.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: I don’t have a cup.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Okay, do you – do you –</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: I’ll – I’ll drink from that cup.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Okay [break] the tape again.</span> <span id="s462">Just take a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Good juice.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: So where were we?</span> <span id="s465">Can you – can you –</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: So – s-so we were – he told us to prepare to – when I was in Wolfsberg and ca – I saw – took upon myself, on mostly two transports from Sighet, to keep a – also a memory to who – who died, so that I could afterwards be a witness for the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s467">But after the war it turned out that women fared worse, because with children, Mengele send them straight, he did not check whether they’re – whether they’re th-the – able to work or not.</span> <span id="s468">So I st – to this day know who was the first victim, but he never – and he didn’t – he didn’t, of course, survive, and neither did his wife, survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: What did you – what did you do in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Well, depends.</span> <span id="s471">That I – I think that there was very, very crucial and lam – to the survival, how do you tell.</span> <span id="s472">I was interested purely in – in survival.</span> <span id="s473">So much so, I think I mentioned in the book, in the memoirs, but that’s worth me mentioning again.</span> <span id="s474">There was, in my neighborhood in Sighet, there was another family, by the name of Dupe(ph).</span> <span id="s475">Their son – they had a son on my age, a little old – a little o-older, a year, who went to the gymnasium, was over there, who went to school, which I hadn't.</span> <span id="s476">Who did exercise at school, at [indecipherable] who was robust, and so on.</span> <span id="s477">I was pale.</span> <span id="s478">What did they expect, I sat all day long and was in the – in the synagogue [indecipherable] closed doors, what – closed windows.</span> <span id="s479">I remember when I – we came to Wolfsberg, he was sitting there, and we went to work.</span> <span id="s480">He uses the muscles, so to speak, at the beginning.</span> <span id="s481">We were shoveling, and – and he looks at me, and he couldn’t resist, and said, what will happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: You said what will happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: No, he ask me, he was robust –</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: – and he was able to work.</span> <span id="s486">And he sometimes even got in some extra piece, for the extra – or bread, for the work.</span> <span id="s487">My policy was not to work, not to strain myself [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s488">He said –</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: You do the minimal, to make sure you survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Oh yeah, just when the SS looked, I looked – I – this – my shovel moved.</span> <span id="s491">He said [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s492">How would you survive like this?</span> <span id="s493">Well, sometimes later – we were already neighbors there, which is the other [indecipherable], his father was with him.</span> <span id="s494">Can never forget that.</span> <span id="s495">One day the father tells me – we were sitting – standing near each other.</span> <span id="s496">Look at Ossie(ph) – Oscar was his name.</span> <span id="s497">He was already what we call the Muselmann.</span> <span id="s498">You don’t know that expression.</span> <span id="s499">A Muselmann – I don’t know where the exactly what the etymology is, was someone who you know he’ll die within 24 hours.</span> <span id="s500">Malnutrition.</span> <span id="s501">Then the father told me – he was our neighbor [indecipherable] those were his words.</span> <span id="s502">You will survive.</span> <span id="s503">Was the second time he told me.</span> <span id="s504">You will survive.</span> <span id="s505">See what happened to Ossie(ph).</span> <span id="s506">You will come home, tell my cousin – he named him – what happened here.</span> <span id="s507">And exactly next morning, Ossie(ph) was already dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Cause he had exerted himself so much, that he was so weak?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: I think the exertion, without the nu – without compensa – without nu-nutrition, and other things, health things.</span> <span id="s510">He didn’t make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: What was the nature of the work, what was going on in the camp?</span> <span id="s512">What was the –</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Oh, the different camps had different the work, more different.</span> <span id="s514">I was working with the shovel.</span> <span id="s515">We dug.</span> <span id="s516">The – the – the bi – the – the work was usually, at least in my case – the Germans built tunnels for int – to – to – they dig tunnels to build factor – ammunitional factories against – against bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: I see, to do the work – so they – so they would not be destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: So we did – we would – well, I describe in detail, if you want the details –</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: – it’s simple [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s521">We went in then, the particular place and made a hole, dig a big hole.</span> <span id="s522">And then hole was dynamited, and then we came again.</span> <span id="s523">We mean the Jews, the workers, came with the cheela(ph), with a wagon, and took out – and took out th-the – the debris, whatever it is, so there was room.</span> <span id="s524">And – and then we went further, and so.</span> <span id="s525">We weren’t allowed to use the dynamite.</span> <span id="s526">In my case [indecipherable] was Italian s-soldiers, war prisoners, who did the bombing.</span> <span id="s527">I have a whole story you read, about the battle, and so –</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: I want to come back – I want to come to that, I think it’s an interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: But – but I – I wanted to ask you, in general, did you continue to study Talmud, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: No, I-I couldn’t, I didn’t have – there were not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: But I remember that you had me – you remem –</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: I – after – I mentioned that –</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: – after I was settled down, so to speak –</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: – I had those – th-the – that made the holes, and I had a – so to speak, a fixed job.</span> <span id="s538">On the way, I could begin thinking.</span> <span id="s539">Til then, my job was to look at the SS, in order that he doesn’t ca-catch me not working.</span> <span id="s540">You know, when we came to camp, we had to make sure we had to have a place to sleep, and everything is there.</span> <span id="s541">So I had no – no time to –</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Did you have any kind of – did you co – were you able to continue any kind of religious practice in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Yes, did you – did you mark the Shabbat [indecipherable] did you mark any high holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Well – well – well, we know it’s Shabbat religious, and the – the problem was Pesach [indecipherable] Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s546">You know about the davening, you know, the bletl.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I know with the davening that they allowed us Kol Nidre.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: They allowed you Kol Nidre?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yes, but otherwise, we were working.</span> <span id="s551">So there was about – like almost none.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Te-Te-Tell me the story about the bletl.</span> <span id="s553">I know it’s in your book, but I think I’d like to – I’d like to record the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Well, to record the story, it’s – it’s – there was a – start from the very beginning.</span> <span id="s555">The – technically, we had off every second Sunday, but we did not – but they did not really realized it.</span> <span id="s556">The al – the SS always found an excuse.</span> <span id="s557">Supposedly we are volunteering.</span> <span id="s558">But the – nevertheless, it happened a few sunda – a few hours where we could sit and – and do nothing, the SS didn’t bother us.</span> <span id="s559">So there was the ca – the – th-the – the ca – the people that worked, it’s called – it was called Ackerman(ph) who do the drilling, and who had th – they had kapo, also the name of Weiss.</span> <span id="s560">And when we were sitting that do – that Sunday, or that – we sort of – supposedly free Sunday, he was [indecipherable] and we talked, I remembered what we learned in si – the [indecipherable] of sha – Sh-Shabbat, because the people knew it from the book, from the prayer book and so on.</span> <span id="s561">And I was sort of a leader.</span> <span id="s562">He saw that, and sort of decided that he’ll take me in in his company.</span> <span id="s563">Ackerman(ph), who was doing the – it was a very difficult company, and therefore, while the others worked 12 hours and na – they worked only 10.</span> <span id="s564">And the occasion, sometimes they even got cigarettes from the company, from – so when I got cigarettes, I sold it for bread.</span> <span id="s565">So, the idea was why – why would they take me to a company which worked so ha – was more difficult than the others?</span> <span id="s566">Because those drillers, you know, that made the hole, had to be sharpened.</span> <span id="s567">And they didn’t want that to be bring to a fire, to a schmidder(ph) – to a smith.</span> <span id="s568">They wa – they didn’t want to do it in the ca – in the – in the – in the tunnel itself, fire, so it was outside.</span> <span id="s569">So somebody had to bring those dri-driller to the schmi – where they sharpened, and bring it back, two or three times, or more times during a – a night, let’s say.</span> <span id="s570">So, if I – and usually chose the youngest – I was the youngest – to do that work.</span> <span id="s571">That mean that was much easier, and I also – the person also got the benefits, because the company did not notice.</span> <span id="s572">So, he took me in – into that – in his company, and I had those privilege.</span> <span id="s573">So, during my – at night, when we worked at night, I used to do four or five times, going through from a – from the – the place of work, inside the hotel, pending – every day it got larger and larger, to the outside where they were sharpened, and bring it back, and so on.</span> <span id="s574">That’s why I said before, I walked with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s575">I had to be very careful, because when the other people took out the – the stones, the – the – the pla – the – where the dynamite exploded, they had then a ca – a little cheela(ph) they called, a ca – a little [indecipherable] car – cars, so – and there was hardly any room for a car or for a human being, had to – there were cases where people [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s576">So, on the way, there was, in a crossroad, there was a German, who was not a German, was a toad.</span> <span id="s577">That means – toad mean one of Volksdeutsche, with that – deutsche was really his mother tongue, you could s – you could recognize.</span> <span id="s578">If he was a Volksdeutsche from Poland, he spo – if he spoke German, it was on the Polish accent.</span> <span id="s579">So we knew –</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: He was a Pole.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: He was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: He was – but he was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: But was born in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: What?</span> <span id="s588">Volksdeutsche –</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: – it’s called.</span> <span id="s591">And I used to – because some night, I met him a few times.</span> <span id="s592">I had to lift up my mütze, my hat at that procedure.</span> <span id="s593">One night I walked, and that time I’m beginning to – I even discuss – I remember what I was thinking about.</span> <span id="s594">I described that too, some [indecipherable] interesting [indecipherable] Talmudic question.</span> <span id="s595">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s596">And I saw them, they used to eat the in – in between, and in the night too, but I saw he had his – his food is on a ripped and a sh – page of Shulchan Aruch, I remember [indecipherable] Pesach [indecipherable] and the – the laws of Pesach, and I remembered even the – the particular law, whether you could do it through an agency, an agent and I – I – I [indecipherable] and I fell to his feet, and I asked him to give me the bletl.</span> <span id="s597">It was – it was saturated from fat, but he took out the – the [indecipherable] whatever.</span> <span id="s598">[indecipherable] and then he gave it to me, and I brought it to camp.</span> <span id="s599">But then, as I said, there was a danger that the Germans were – you couldn’t carry anything, contraband.</span> <span id="s600">So a Jew by the name of fines – Finkelstein, I think he was from Martasalka(ph), that’s a particular community, he carried it on his – on his body.</span> <span id="s601">When we came back to camp first, we used to – if there’s a free Sunday, we could il – use it.</span> <span id="s602">But month later when we went to Eb-Ebensee, you know the eb –</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: And there it was a total different.</span> <span id="s605">There was a vernichtungslager, extermination camp.</span> <span id="s606">And I saw him from a distance, and I asked them, motioned them what’s happened, and they knocked on the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s607">And then I was told two or three hours later he collapsed, and he was taken to the camp – to the mislaifa(ph), and he was burned together with the bletl.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: He was – he was in the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: I’m sorry, he was – I – I didn’t hear what you said, he –</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: He was – I was told –</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: – he collapsed, and then they tooked him to the crema-crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: To the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: And they burned them.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: And – with the bletl.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: With the bletl.</span> <span id="s618">Which [indecipherable] tells you [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s619">That bletl, the Torah, has value only if there is a Mr. Finkelstein.</span> <span id="s620">No Mr. Finkelstein, no bletl.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: You know, one thing that was interesting was that – that I – that I was curious about from your memoir, is that a number of the – of the – of the kapos seemed to be interested in you, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: A member?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: The – the – the – the – the kapos.</span> <span id="s624">The –</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Kapos, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: – yes.</span> <span id="s627">The-They were – they seemed interested in you, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: That’s – I – I can’t explain that.</span> <span id="s629">And there is – just a minute – and there is a story, which I don’t – I don’t mention it, I didn’t know, and I think I’m use this opportunity to mention.</span> <span id="s630">I – one day already in bo – in – still in Wolfsberg, one day a rumor had it tha-that they taking kid – children – kids my age to peel potatoes.</span> <span id="s631">You don’t know what that meant.</span> <span id="s632">First it meant warm.</span> <span id="s633">Usually you’re in the kitchen, you peel potatoes.</span> <span id="s634">Secondly you have what – you have food.</span> <span id="s635">It’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s636">You could throw it in the yidda(ph), you could throw it in the ovens.</span> <span id="s637">So, it was one of the most desired jobs.</span> <span id="s638">So I smuggled my – not smuggled, I joined them.</span> <span id="s639">I went and sat down where they were supposed to meet.</span> <span id="s640">The assistant, the vice-director, a short fellow, he had [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s641">You could imagine, if he had – had that position in camp, he was not a – a [indecipherable] he was not – he was known a certain ruth – ruthle –</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Ruthlessness.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: – ruthlessness.</span> <span id="s644">He took me out.</span> <span id="s645">I – the second time I went, I smuggled them again.</span> <span id="s646">Because I ne – I d – I don’t – I didn’t think yi – I ever met him, I ever knew – I met him, of course, I saw him every day, but not the kind – face to face kind of meeting.</span> <span id="s647">And he took me out a second time.</span> <span id="s648">So I saw it’s useless.</span> <span id="s649">Then it turned out that they were – they weren’t taken to peel potatoes, they were to be killed.</span> <span id="s650">Now, I didn’t write in the memoir because I didn’t – and I don’t know today either, what – why.</span> <span id="s651">Why would this man, who was basically cruel and inconsiderate, why would he take out?</span> <span id="s652">Why did he even know me?</span> <span id="s653">The only explanation I have is that the one who – they only took somebody take care of their needs, household needs, other need, took care of his house, and cooked, and so on, was from Sighet.</span> <span id="s654">And he thi – even I think even told me that, that he once pointed out, pointed me out to him, told him I was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: I’m sorry, this was a person who helped – who worked for him, and was also from Sighet?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Yeah – no – he one of all th-the refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Yes, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Who – who too – who th – this kapo had the hou – had the room, a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: So this fellow from Sighet took care of his needs.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: He told me, I think, I think, that he once pointed out – told him, point at me, that I’m [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: I know – probably, you know, that.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: So, he saved you.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: He may have – could it be?</span> <span id="s667">I can’t believe it to this – could it be that this man, despite his [indecipherable] that the learning of Talmud should continue?</span> <span id="s668">That’s staggering.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Did he tell you why he was taking you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: He just said go.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: No, he doesn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s673">He never said [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: He just said go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: That – there was another one that I mentioned, by the name of Lefkovich(ph), who told me he was a – a kapo, was once a ghetto shochet, they said, that used to ask me to quote him erotic sections from the Talmud.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Erotic?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Erotic, I said erotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Yes, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Erotic, yeah.</span> <span id="s680">And he gave a piece of bread, or something.</span> <span id="s681">That, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: You were transferred to Ebensee.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Ebensee, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: February 1945, and you s – and you write in the book, but you don’t really talk much about it, that it was a long trip.</span> <span id="s685">It took maybe –</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Yeah, a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: – a month or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Did you – did you walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Oh no, no, no, we couldn’t walk, it’s a different coun – we rode on a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: On a train.</span> <span id="s692">But the train went slow?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: The train went slow, stopped place, and one place [indecipherable] that we have to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Did they give you food?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s696">You could see people before and after, you could notice that their body –</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: So you didn’t lose any – you didn’t – you didn’t eat on that train.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s699">Something we must have been [indecipherable] I don’t remem – four weeks.</span> <span id="s700">Cause we came from sla – to Silesia but just in a – in a freight car.</span> <span id="s701">And whenever there was a need, we were sidetracked.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: But that was a extermination camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: You could imagine I was in block 24, and people, he continued coming, but the number of people were the same.</span> <span id="s706">That’s where it happens [indecipherable] I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Did you – was there a selection that you were involved in at all at Ebensee?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: They did not a selection, people died natural.</span> <span id="s709">A lot of that, you saw it on the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s711">Did you have to do any work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: On the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: No, no, no, when you got to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Oh, oh, very – oh-oh, oh-oh.</span> <span id="s715">The – the work was more difficult, other than – than there, other than in Wolfsberg.</span> <span id="s716">And then I had the problem – I think I say that the – I said – Hitler committed suicide May sixth – is it – am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: I think – I think that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: I think it’s around there.</span> <span id="s719">I – and May four, I was so desperate, I was [indecipherable] there, in Ebensee, I had to work, I couldn’t play games, watching when he looks.</span> <span id="s720">There was a small company, they were – on the whole ca – the colony had only 20 or twe – or four – or 25 people, so the kapo could see exactly what’s happening.</span> <span id="s721">And we had to work, and dig things and – and I think I mentioned, I was working at the cement – mixing cement, which meant that I couldn’t stop for a minute, cause if I stop the whole work, there will be no cement [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s722">Besides, I mean, it’s a – it’s – the – this kapo was an – an anti-Semite of the highest order and edition.</span> <span id="s723">I don’t know what – was he an German?</span> <span id="s724">He may have been a German, because we usually carried something on the [indecipherable] line, the first letter of nationality.</span> <span id="s725">I carried a J, Jude.</span> <span id="s726">He claimed afterwards that he thought it’s Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s727">And he – and he find out that I’m a Jew, he want to kill me.</span> <span id="s728">And he handed over to a – to a kapo, the day after – the day, or maybe even a day after, who are – I think was also a Yugoslav, who already know that Hitler committed suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Did you and the other – okay, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: So he te – he – he turned [indecipherable] give me 25 l-lashes.</span> <span id="s731">Which would have been – which would – that would have been fatal.</span> <span id="s732">The kapo says [indecipherable] Hitler’s – says shout.</span> <span id="s733">We’re not doing – he didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s734">And I shout, and that’s how I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: I see, so you prou – you pre – you pretended.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Pretend.</span> <span id="s737">Shout.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: And you worked with the kapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: No, no, pretend that you’re getting –</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: – lashes.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: And that’s how I survived.</span> <span id="s744">[indecipherable] explicitness.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Did the – did you and the other workers in the camp have any sense that the war was coming to an end?</span> <span id="s746">What was going on outside?</span> <span id="s747">You had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: We just hoped that everything was come to an end, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s750">So how did – do you remember liberation day?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yeah, do I re – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Tell me about that day, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Well, let me before tell you something for I want to tell you, then we conclude.</span> <span id="s754">The fact – I go back to Mr. Dob, d-o-b, that I’ll survive, that happened second time.</span> <span id="s755">The hundred – the first time happened in Ungvár.</span> <span id="s756">Ungvár is a city – you ever heard of Ungvár?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Uza – Uzhhorod [indecipherable] big Jewish – at that time was a big Jewish city.</span> <span id="s759">That’s a good way of ending that.</span> <span id="s760">The – I came there in ’42 – ’42?</span> <span id="s761">Forty-two, ’42 – ’43 – ’42.</span> <span id="s762">Came there, and there was a – a Jew, whose name I [indecipherable] Hershel(ph) Friedman(ph), tells me ya – he tested me, asked me questions, you know.</span> <span id="s763">Says, you will survive the war, I quote.</span> <span id="s764">I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s765">Here is a d’var Torah, which I want you to remember.</span> <span id="s766">And he gave me the d’var Torah, which I still remember.</span> <span id="s767">And that’s the way – he didn’t survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: What was the d’var Torah about, that he – that he gave you?</span> <span id="s769">A: Oh, I could tell – I – I describe it in the memoirs –</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: – in great detail.</span> <span id="s772">I mention it, but then I don’t mention that maybe this part.</span> <span id="s773">I felt obligated – I met his ga – his son in camp, and I want to give the d’var Torah, but the son didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s774">After the war, every Shabbas, I told the child – I used to repeat it when the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s775">And finally here in il – here in Israel, I found some of his grandchildren, and I told them, here is the d’var Torah, you carry the responsibility to remember.</span> <span id="s776">If you want I could tell you the d’var Torah, but it’s in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s778">Well, t-tell me about the – the liberation of – of what – what – what you remember.</span> <span id="s779">Was it – was it the British that –</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Well, I – let m – le-let me tell you that everybody asked, who liberated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: They don’t ask the other cl – more cr-crucial – crucial question, what did you do after that?</span> <span id="s783">The Americans were there, they gave us chocolate, they left next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: And the guards ran away?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: The guards had to go away, or someone would kill them, of course.</span> <span id="s786">The guards left even before the Americans came.</span> <span id="s787">They knew the Americans are in the vicinity.</span> <span id="s788">So, we stayed there, and we had diarrhea, I had diarrhea very, very severely.</span> <span id="s789">And – and there [indecipherable] we had – but we were on our own.</span> <span id="s790">We had no money, we had no documents.</span> <span id="s791">I have now, I just put that – framed it, the document from the UNRRA, asking governments to let us across, to let u – let us through.</span> <span id="s792">And then I went home, the few days, nobody there.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Tell me, did an – the na – no one came to the camp to give you food or take care of anyone, they just – you were there on your own?</span> <span id="s794">A: We – for a while went out of the city to get food.</span> <span id="s795">And then there was some – must have been about – there was – some left for – the Americans may have left, I don’t know, I’m not familiar.</span> <span id="s796">I could tell you I left soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: And you went to Sighet to see if ya –</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: To Sighet.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: – to see if any of your family had survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Yeah, and I –</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: How did you get to Sighet?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: With that document.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s804">But did you – was there a train, or a –</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: With both, with the train, mainly – mainly the train.</span> <span id="s806">I remember times when I traveled on the roof, which was dangerous, in case it gets to a tunnel.</span> <span id="s807">And then I realized within – less than a few – a few days, 10 days, I went back.</span> <span id="s808">Then I – then I had a friend in j – in Budapest, and I stayed in Budapest almost a half a year.</span> <span id="s809">He was the – the man that was a student, learned [indecipherable] learned with grandfather, my gr – and he kept me [indecipherable] for half a year.</span> <span id="s810">And there I began plans to come to America, learned English.</span> <span id="s811">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: So, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: – I went to a DP camp, in order to go there – from there to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: And did – I think I remember in your memoir that five of your grandfather’s children – grandchildren, survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Less than five.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Less than five.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: From 62 – four survived.</span> <span id="s818">Two are intermarry, that is, are not his natural children.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: I have no connection with them, I don’t know whether they’re alive.</span> <span id="s821">Of the natural ones, were three.</span> <span id="s822">Three.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Who were the other two besides yourself that survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Well, I don’t know what – one died [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: – awe stricken, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: My daughter is fortunate because her grandparents are all here.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Yeah, she doesn’t have to – is she – what’s – is she dealing in school with the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s830">In – she’s in – she’s in ninth grade now, but in – in seventh and eighth grade they – they deal with the Holocaust, and actually –</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: What school is she going?</span> <span id="s832">Here?</span> <span id="s833">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Here –</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: The same school as the –</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: No, no, no, no, she goes now – [break] Ready?</span> <span id="s837">All right.</span> <span id="s838">So a-actually, I did want to ask you about what happened after the – you left the camps.</span> <span id="s839">And, first of all, I – I know you talk about this a little bit, but I would like to put it on the table.</span> <span id="s840">Why do you take the name Halivni?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Well, to – two reasons.</span> <span id="s842">One, I – I’m – the semi-objective reason, if you want to call that objective, and Weiss being – there was an SS commander of Treblinka, by the name of Weiss.</span> <span id="s843">And then I encountered a person – SS by the name of Weiss.</span> <span id="s844">So I decided that’s a good reason for – for dropping that name Weiss.</span> <span id="s845">But – but I couldn’t do that because grandfather was very close to me.</span> <span id="s846">On the other hand, Weiss [indecipherable] father’s name was Weiderman(ph).</span> <span id="s847">So We-Weiss, I make him forget [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s848">So by using a biblical word, it’s not a name in the Bible.</span> <span id="s849">Yes, it is a name, sorry, it is a name.</span> <span id="s850">But Halivni [indecipherable] Halivni.</span> <span id="s851">So I used to use it both names, in the book says both name.</span> <span id="s852">But now that I went to Israel, in Israel I don’t use both names, only Halivni.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: You know, you’re reminding me something I wanted to ask you about your father, because we talked about him at the beginning of the interview.</span> <span id="s854">I wa – I remembered a story that I wonder if you have more details about, because I found it so interesting, that when he was being transported to Auschwitz, he managed to send you a letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Yeah, he send out the second time.</span> <span id="s856">First he was imported as a known citizen, and he came back the part.</span> <span id="s857">And then he was sending a letter.</span> <span id="s858">He’d apparently dropped the letter in the train, I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: This is on the second time he was going – on his way to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Yeah, on to Auschwitz, yes, yes, he arrived in Auschwitz –</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: – must have.</span> <span id="s863">And – and – and I still received a letter in the ghetto, even before me.</span> <span id="s864">The story is that he died on the way, was in Warsaw ghetto, they were brought to – to clean out the ghetto, and so – and then the way to au – to Da-Dachau – ach – ach – Dachau, there he died.</span> <span id="s865">Story is he stepped off the wrong way, I don’t know what he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Do you remember what was in the letter to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Just a simple – a postcard.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Just telling that he is – he didn’t tell me where he send it, that he is well, he is well.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Why did you make the decision to come to America?</span> <span id="s871">A: Because that’s what I said before, I wanted so much to study, circular knowledge, circular [indecipherable] and I was afraid not having any relative, anybody, that I wouldn’t be able to do it in Israel.</span> <span id="s872">I didn’t know about the war, but I probably would have gone out to be a soldier.</span> <span id="s873">In America, the American Jews will be, I know from iga – I got money.</span> <span id="s874">I was – I must be – tell you this story.</span> <span id="s875">I – when I was nine, 10 – nine, I knew 200 pages of Talmud [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s876">I still remember a good part of it, that time, I think.</span> <span id="s877">And we got those – thousand lei.</span> <span id="s878">You know what the lei is the – th-the wa – is the – is the currency of – of Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Ah.</span> <span id="s880">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: The money came from a fellow, Forrenstein(ph) in Boston, who was philanthropic.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Forrenstein(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Ye-Yeah, Forrenstein(ph).</span> <span id="s884">He gave the money, and I was delighted.</span> <span id="s885">I met a few – a few month ago [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s886">Somebody – a young man who came over to do – introduced himself –</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: In Israel.</span> <span id="s888">To you.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: In Israel.</span> <span id="s890">Introduced himself as Forrenstein(ph) from Boston.</span> <span id="s891">So I ask him, what Forrenstein(ph)?</span> <span id="s892">He says, the one who gave you money.</span> <span id="s893">So it – I thi – was delighted that the family remembers – or some members of the family remember that he – that he gave me the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Was your – was your trip – was your passage to America, was it arranged by a Jewish social service agency?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: I don’t know exactly what ha – what happened was, I went back to the DP camp, and from there –</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Where was the DP camp, in –</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: In – the last DP camp was Prien(ph) on Prienzay(ph), not wal – not far from – what city is it called?</span> <span id="s898">Come back to me.</span> <span id="s899">A German city.</span> <span id="s900">Hanno – not Hanover, Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s901">Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s902">There they se – they collected the – the children that [indecipherable] the story.</span> <span id="s903">They collected the chi – the children that came to America, that were coming to America.</span> <span id="s904">The – that big advantage was that these children still needed a quota as far as I know, but they had priority.</span> <span id="s905">So – so went back.</span> <span id="s906">I went back to that – before to that camp.</span> <span id="s907">I was in Windsheim in a camp, and then I went to – to the [indecipherable] and from there I went to America.</span> <span id="s908">Who paid for it?</span> <span id="s909">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s910">I – not long ago, in Israel, I tried to go to the Joint and fi – I assume was with the Joint.</span> <span id="s911">And – and I tr-trying to know who sponsored my trip.</span> <span id="s912">We couldn’t get an exact who paid for it.</span> <span id="s913">There must have been some Jewish money.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s915">And can you just say a few words about your first few years in America, and na – na – I know you talk about it your book in great detail, we don’t need to go in that great detail, but just tell – tell us a little bit –</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: I was in the yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: You were in the yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: That is now the yeshiva, and going still, at the age of 18, I was then – I going to public sc – to the elementary school, I had no school.</span> <span

dormitory.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: In a dormitory.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s924">It’s interesting, I must tell you.</span> <span id="s925">I don’t know whether you want to include it.</span> <span id="s926">I – when I lived in the dormitory, I used to listen to music, listen to classical music; I got some records.</span> <span id="s927">One of them – one among the music was Lalo’s Symphonie Espagnole.</span> <span id="s928">That’s a fe – well known, Lalo.</span> <span id="s929">I liked the Lalo.</span> <span id="s930">The door usually was open, and students also heard al – wanted the door open, so they listen to it too.</span> <span id="s931">Two years ago, three years ago – it was three years ago, in Jerusalem, I got a call from somebody, he says, do you remember?</span> <span id="s932">And it was 60 years before or more, and we played the Lalo?</span> <span id="s933">[indecipherable] in Jerusalem is playing Lalo.</span> <span id="s934">You want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Where did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Oh, thought I mentioned that.</span> <span id="s937">She was the granddaughter of the Vishivavov(ph), who was well-known – there’s a two volume, three volume book now, about his life.</span> <span id="s938">And I went, as a [indecipherable] I went to – to him – to – in ’30 fi – ’38.</span> <span id="s939">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: In 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: And then he passed [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s944">And – and – and the story I heard later from my mother-in-law, that they heard there was some other [indecipherable] and they only looked through the – through the cracks of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Zipporah looked through the cracks too.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Cracks to see me there.</span> <span id="s947">But she said after I left, her gra – the father-in-law said [speaks foreign language] Zipporah.</span> <span id="s948">Whether that’s true or not.</span> <span id="s949">But then we met.</span> <span id="s950">She came to America, and we met in Brooklyn College.</span> <span id="s951">She’s also graduated Brooklyn College.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s953">That was what, 1950 –</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: I graduate in ’50 – ’52.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: And then I went further.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Over the years, were you able to learn the fate of other family members?</span> <span id="s958">Were you – were you able to learn the fate of your other family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: I – to this day I don’t know.</span> <span id="s960">I don’t know my sister – my sister.</span> <span id="s961">I heard from fro – from a chaplain who in America told me, and I assume – I have some documents with the li – camps they were.</span> <span id="s962">They send me in with the – but my sister – the chaplain told me that he was in Bergen-Belsen after the war, and then there was a hospital with people there, and he met a woman who was already dilu – diluted – not diluted.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Delusional?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: What?</span> <span id="s965">Not delusional, but she was not well.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: And she told him that she had a brother who was a [indecipherable] and so on.</span> <span id="s968">And he thinks that fits me.</span> <span id="s969">If that is the case, then she died after the war, though.</span> <span id="s970">Mother died in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: With grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Gra – with grandfather.</span> <span id="s973">And Father died, as I mentioned before, on the way to Dachau.</span> <span id="s974">That’s what I heard from people.</span> <span id="s975">And the aunt, I have her – her name appears on a list of camps, but it doesn’t say when she died.</span> <span id="s976">Or does it?</span> <span id="s977">I have at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: I have a couple more, sort of larger questions, which I just will acknowledge.</span> <span id="s979">We’re going to only be able to skirt the surface, but I would like to – I’d like you to consider them.</span> <span id="s980">First of all, I’m wondering just about you being very open today about your experiences during the Holocaust, but did you have trouble talking about that after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: I didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s982">I didn’t talk after the war.</span> <span id="s983">I didn’t talk after the war.</span> <span id="s984">But neither – neither did I have people ask, I mean, I – I didn’t – it was no – talking or not talking would not playing a role in my life.</span> <span id="s985">I didn’t talk cause I was busy with –</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: With Talmud.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: – other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: But I do – people claim that my scholarship is that – somebody wrote an article – my scholarship is influenced by [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s990">That this – that I’m critical of – in learning, which means you cri – critical in learning means that you interpret differently than –</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: It comes from the connection that you have no trust in human beings, that you basically think human beings are corrupt.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Do you think that’s an accurate analysis?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: What could I know?</span> <span id="s995">In other words, you – a person who’s more trustworthy, will not look for new interpretation.</span> <span id="s996">That’s – that’s that –</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Yeah, that’s the theory.</span> <span id="s998">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: I assume that the theory goes – a man who [indecipherable] new interpretation, who has 10 volumes almost now, with different interpretations.</span> <span id="s1000">One who was not only is not the [indecipherable] only, but the particular case [indecipherable] that consideration about.</span> <span id="s1001">So – though – so that maybe I’m – if that is the case, then it – then that should be more investigated, more study with the inner connection.</span> <span id="s1002">Of course, whenever somebody comes up with a new idea, not that – that something new happened, but a n – a new idea of the things that already happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: There should be a reason why he’s dissatisfied with the old.</span> <span id="s1005">And therefore that may – that may fit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: When did you change your – when did you start talking, and why did you start talking about the Holocaust again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: I don’t – I don’t think it is – it was a sort of a break.</span> <span id="s1008">More that in the beginning I just – there was no ca – I was too busy with something else.</span> <span id="s1009">[indecipherable] going to school, living alone, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Did your children have a lot of questions for you when they were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: No, no, they were – since my wife was also – she was a Holocaust scholar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: She wrote – so it was a – in the house –</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: – so to speak all that time, was nothing that – not what happened to some people that they’re all of a sudden – practically all of a sudden begin to talk, and then talk aba – and then some of them couldn’t stop talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: No, there wasn’t this here, there was – gradually I had more an opportunity.</span> <span id="s1018">So I didn’t – didn’t – the – the – I think, I’m not correct on a -- Fortunoff(ph), you know, the – the – had – gave money for the college people to talk, as that – they had then [indecipherable] and they had the – made something, a party, or a – and they asked me to talk, so I ta – they didn’t ask me talk about my talking, but to talk about th – the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1019">So I realized that that time, more than before, how much that is a problem, that it needs to be encouraged.</span> <span id="s1020">The – but personally, I always read, and I still avidly, wherever I could, read about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: I’m wondering if you could explain – this is something you’ve written about, I know, in great detail, but I’m wondering if you could explain for a more general audience, that is going to be watching this, answer this question.</span> <span id="s1022">How did the – how did the Holocaust affect your – your faith in God, and your own religious beliefs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Oh, well that – you assume it did affect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: If it didn’t, then that’s a – that’s an answer too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: The – then – then that is [indecipherable] answer.</span> <span id="s1026">I think I told you that when I – I mentioned the book, when I came to the States, I met the late Moshe Myzels(ph).</span> <span id="s1027">You remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: He was the – he was the editor of [indecipherable] Hebrew magazine.</span> <span id="s1030">He asked me, are you religious now, you know?</span> <span id="s1031">I will still repeat.</span> <span id="s1032">I said yes, religious.</span> <span id="s1033">Were you religious before the war?</span> <span id="s1034">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1035">Said yes.</span> <span id="s1036">He says, I understand that people religious before, are religious after.</span> <span id="s1037">They’re religious before, religious aft – the people that don’t – that remain the same way, they either no [indecipherable] nothing happened?</span> <span id="s1038">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1039">No, of course it’s modified, but I never broke with the religion.</span> <span id="s1040">Although my religion is proba – I mean, it’s not the same way, I would say, as Sighet, I mean, even as grandfather.</span> <span id="s1041">The learning is certainly not, and that’s so – but that could have a na – could have happened anyhow, even without the Holocaust, just going to college, learning secular the boo – reading secular books and so on.</span> <span id="s1042">So it’s not to – to the Holocaust particularly.</span> <span id="s1043">The – I don’t ever, ever kind of angry – I not remember being angry at somebody, at something for the Holocaust, even though my – now I have this book on [indecipherable] Holocaust, and I mi – if I only finish.</span> <span id="s1044">I may write more on that topic, I haven’t finished that.</span> <span id="s1045">I was probably influenced a great deal, but that may even be subconscious, you know, the whole –</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: You know, I was really interested in something that you wrote in your book, that I wil – that I wanted to just ask you about, cause you wrote the book maybe 20 years ago, and you wrote about – you made a statement that the Holocaust should be treated as an event without explanation.</span> <span id="s1047">That – that you increase the suffering of the victims, and the survivors by asking –</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: – how or why this event could have happened.</span> <span id="s1050">And I’m wondering if – if that is a statement you still believe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Well, yes and no, as everything is a yes and no answer.</span> <span id="s1052">That was a – that’s in the memoirs.</span> <span id="s1053">That was a sort of a protest against those – and I am still firmly against it, who considered the Holocaust the result of sin.</span> <span id="s1054">That, I think is unforgiveable for the – the survivors, for the sufferer, and u – and unforgiveable for the truth, objective truth.</span> <span id="s1055">If you say that it is sin, that means it was coming to them.</span> <span id="s1056">I often quote, and I th – the – the – the mishna(ph), and [indecipherable] says that, if the court executed somebody, the family of the convict, family of the – should come to the court, to the judges, and say [speaks foreign language].</span> <span id="s1057">We have nothing against our hearts on you.</span> <span id="s1058">In other words, justice, it was coming.</span> <span id="s1059">We almost have to g-go – come Hitler and say we have nothing [indecipherable] it’s because of sin.</span> <span id="s1060">So that I reject, full-hearted.</span> <span id="s1061">So although not as successful for a substitute, we don’t have something that I could substitute.</span> <span id="s1062">So, the idea is, leave it.</span> <span id="s1063">Leave it as it is.</span> <span id="s1064">That’s why [indecipherable] without a reason.</span> <span id="s1065">Because any reason will ultimately – whether, you know, the Rabbi of [indecipherable], who se – by the way, I was close to him, I was close to him.</span> <span id="s1066">The Rabbi [indecipherable] thought the Zionist is the sin.</span> <span id="s1067">And some people are bor – rabbis in Israel thought the – the anti-Zionists.</span> <span id="s1068">We must say, I do insist that the Holocaust is a metaphysical.</span> <span id="s1069">Certainly it’s not because they were – some Jews were communists, or some Jews were capitalists.</span> <span id="s1070">Or the way they say – said that in the New Testament, that when Jesus was crucified, the – th-the Jewish leaders had made that blood [indecipherable] on them and on their children, 2,000 years ago.</span> <span id="s1071">But my problem at the moment is to make it metaphysical, in a way that human beings are not the cause.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: That I am working on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Well, let – let me follow up in this way, you know, Elie Wiesel [break] – they just have a technical problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: And they’re just – and they’re just fixing – they’re just fixing that, and then they’ll keep going.</span> <span id="s1077">We’re just about five minutes away.</span> <span id="s1078">Are you ready?</span> <span id="s1079">Oh, okay, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1080">So, what I wanted to ask you is, do you think there’s anything – cause Wiesel has talked about – you know, one of the reasons he wanted this museum to be formed, was he wanted to, obviously have a permanent memorial to the victims, but also to remind people about what can happen in the future.</span> <span id="s1081">And so my question to you is, the Holocaust was a unique event in human history, but do you think there is something to learn from that episode that might help us prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future?</span> <span id="s1082">Maybe not on the same level, but the same kind – genocides have existed –</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: That was the topic that Yad Vashem asked me to talk about here a year ago, or two years ago.</span> <span id="s1084">What’s the most effective way of preserving the – the – Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1085">I’m not – and I’m saying this with great caution should be misunderstood, then.</span> <span id="s1086">I’m not sure that – that we could be sure that there will be no other Holocaust, since, as I said before, I think it’s a metaphysical.</span> <span id="s1087">Has something to do with free will.</span> <span id="s1088">Man is created in a manner at least that – that he could do – God would not interfere – will punish him, but He will not interfere with this evildoing.</span> <span id="s1089">So, to ask, which is the basic question for a religious person, why God did not intervene in our time, when intervened in – intervened in the time of Haman.</span> <span id="s1090">The idea that something moved in the cosmological sphere, that caw – that God did not intervene.</span> <span id="s1091">He intervened at that time, did not intervene.</span> <span id="s1092">So, we cannot be – I think sometimes even Netanyahu or the others, it was naïve to think that an Israeli, the Israeli power, military, could prevent Hitler.</span> <span id="s1093">Whoever remens – remembers the power of the German army – now we have this Normandy, just what is it, 70 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: You – you really thinks that Israel could have prevented the German army?</span> <span id="s1096">So we are – I don’t know, I am still working find out what is sort of – but it is our relationship to God, Jews, as I still believe was the chosen people, but they are chosen because God gave the Torah.</span> <span id="s1097">And giving the Torah is a sort of intervene – intervention in a u – in a person’s life.</span> <span id="s1098">God intervened – asked – intervenes in our life by telling us what to do, what not to do.</span> <span id="s1099">And therefore, He may intervene in our favor.</span> <span id="s1100">When we are not following this part, sort of the bargain, the other part is not – it’s quite complicated.</span> <span id="s1101">It’s not that simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: What role do you think the Holocaust should play in Jewish collective conscience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: In the Jewish collective –</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: In the Jewish collective consciousness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Well, that we are a unique people.</span> <span id="s1106">I know Rwanda, I know the other thing, but not at that size, and that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1107">Our relationship to God, and therefore our relationship to the world is o – the way religion claimed all along, although not – religion may claim your details [indecipherable] that we have a particular relationship, and we should find out, particularly what – the channel by which it moves.</span> <span id="s1108">And that may be the only way we’ll prevent.</span> <span id="s1109">Look I am – I’m troubled and – and – and – and puzzled.</span> <span id="s1110">During the war, I’m tal – when I say war, I mean the second World War –</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: – of course.</span> <span id="s1113">Sweden, Denmark was good for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1114">I give you no examples, you know, save Jews, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1115">Today, they not so good to Israel, which is a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1116">What happened in those 70 years, sort of, 60 sort of?</span> <span id="s1117">Did they – if th – there is some basic built-in relationship that we have, with the worl – with God, and with the world, and so on.</span> <span id="s1118">And that sort of moves around.</span> <span id="s1119">And therefore I – I mentioned that in the – in the article on the prayer in the camp, you know, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: The Jews prayer, the ba – God has the – intervene – intervened on behalf of the Jews is almost done th – because of He’s giving the Torah [speaks foreign language] the two are connected.</span> <span id="s1122">[indecipherable] the – involves responsibility as well as – as co – as singling out, and so on.</span> <span id="s1123">Now, God will intervene on our behalf, apparently if we have – we – we are in debt, a certain – and maintaining a certain [indecipherable] for certain relationship.</span> <span id="s1124">That is a very delicate balance.</span> <span id="s1125">When that relationship is disturbed, God may not intervene.</span> <span id="s1126">I don’t know, I don’t have the picture, I mean [indecipherable] clearly, but that’s the direction I’m thinking.</span> <span id="s1127">I cannot accept sin as the cause.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Let me ask you one final question if I may, which is; do you have any personal way of commemorating the Holocaust, or of remembering your family members who died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: That’s an interesting question.</span> <span id="s1130">It’s a difficult question.</span> <span id="s1131">What do – you can ask me what do you do during the Holocaust day.</span> <span id="s1132">Almost feel – I mean thank – I mean obviously, thank for the survival.</span> <span id="s1133">There is no – I mean, there must be a reason, there is [indecipherable] a reason, but not a known reason at all why I survived and – and Dupe(ph), who was stronger and fatter, the – Mother used to come home from – from their home, visiting them, always that argument, why are you so – why are you so pale?</span> <span id="s1134">Why, why pale?</span> <span id="s1135">I was sitting [indecipherable] in the closed doors, and he was doing sports, and why I survived?</span> <span id="s1136">So, does that entail a special obligation, a special tha – usually that – that leads, or should lead to more learning, but that’s individual, and – and that’s usu – the [indecipherable] having accomplished something.</span> <span id="s1137">To leave for posterity something in learning, that’s what, that others did not say it, did not have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Do you have anything else you want to say, that I’ve missed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Well, I – I thought about the Holocaust, I think that’s – I am – just was saying, still reading.</span> <span id="s1140">Let me ta – leave at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Leave at that, since you asked.</span> <span id="s1143">No things, no – no stories that I have.</span> <span id="s1144">My – I came across the following story not long ago.</span> <span id="s1145">A woman who had children, with cha – a child, came to the ramp, you know – you know, in the – she apparently had presence of mind, and she realized what’s – at least that there is a – she handed over the child to her mother, or mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1146">I came across this, I don’t vouch for its veracity.</span> <span id="s1147">An SS saw that and came over and gave her moussat(ph).</span> <span id="s1148">So, how do you leave a child.</span> <span id="s1149">Don’t you see what’s going on there?</span> <span id="s1150">How do you leave the child like this?</span> <span id="s1151">She took back the child, and of course Mengele send her to the other side.</span> <span id="s1152">The cru – the – the corruption, using the moral stance in order to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: The cruelty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: The cruelty of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1155">The other story I just told to my grandchild, who went to Auschwitz just a few weeks ago, with some stories.</span> <span id="s1156">The – they asked the – you know, there was a, how did they get the gas?</span> <span id="s1157">Not inside, because they couldn’t – from outside, there was a little window.</span> <span id="s1158">So they interviewed, I think in a German ta – TV, asking them, how – when did – did they know to open up the – the window, have the gas in there?</span> <span id="s1159">He said, I put my ear to the window.</span> <span id="s1160">If I didn’t hear shmizel(ph) at all, I know I could open the window.</span> <span id="s1161">And I told this story to chile – my grandchild told me – told the story to his children, they all burst out shmizel(ph).</span> <span id="s1162">Think we could leave it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1164">Professor Halivni, thank you very much for your time.</span> <span id="s1165">It’s been a great privilege.</span> <span id="s1166">This concludes the interview with David Halivni, taped on June 13th, 2014.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Okay, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">PAGE 20 Interview with David
