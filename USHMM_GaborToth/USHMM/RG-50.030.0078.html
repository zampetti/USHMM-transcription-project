My two older sisters were not in the house at the time, because they secured a job in one of the brick factories in town.</span> <span id="s40">And they were working on the night shift.</span> <span id="s41">Therefore they were kept over.</span> <span id="s42">Nobody was let out of the factories in Starachowice for the selection.</span> <span id="s43">Only people</span></p> <p><span id="s44">1 Anna Wilson 2 Everybody out (German) who remained in the houses were chased out.</span> <span id="s45">I remember that I was a very, very skinny kid, and tall, but very slim.</span> <span id="s46">And my mother made me – she made me heavier, and she put breasts on me out of some rags, and she gave me rouge to make me look older and more mature.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">And I remember we did put on more clothing then necessary, even though that was – that was October, and it was still rather warm.</span> <span id="s48">Because we really didn't know where we were going.</span> <span id="s49">And when we came – we were driven, there were already a lot of auxiliary German police, and the Latvians – who were helping out, and the Ukrainians – who were helping out at that particular time of the round up.</span> <span id="s50">And I do remember seeing horrible things on the way to the market place where the selection was to take place.</span> <span id="s51">They would grab children, and smash them against walls.</span> <span id="s52">And people who couldn't move fast enough were beaten mercilessly.</span> <span id="s53">And when we finally reached the market place where the selection was to begin, my mother noticed a lady who was an older lady, who was – she was very friendly with.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">And she was sort of helping her out.</span> <span id="s55">The lady's name was Kazimierska, Mrs. Kazimierska.</span> <span id="s56">And she was elderly, and couldn't walk too well, and mother took her by the arm and stood with her.</span> <span id="s57">My father of course was pointed to the group where the men were.</span> <span id="s58">And I was pointed – I was near my mother.</span> <span id="s59">But mother was pointed with Mrs. Kazimierska in this other group, and I was pointed in another group.</span> <span id="s60">Obviously, I had no idea who was in which group.</span> <span id="s61">Soon enough we were put in a formation, and made to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">05:06:00 And we walked -- I was of course walking with the women.</span> <span id="s63">And we came to a camp called Strzelnica, that was within the premises of the Starachowice area, where the Nazis were establishing a work camp for slave labor.</span> <span id="s64">Because in that town there was a munitions factory run by the Germans for which they needed forced labor.</span> <span id="s65">When we arrived in Strzelnica, in that camp Strzelnica I soon discovered that mother was not there.</span> <span id="s66">Only father was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Because we were grouped men and women separately.</span> <span id="s68">I had no idea where my two sisters were, but I did know that if they are "gainfully," quote unquote, "occupied", they would be saved.</span> <span id="s69">Well, we subsequently found out – and when I mean subsequently, I mean many years later after the war – that the selection that took place in Starachowice was destined for Treblinka, and that is where my mother perished.</span> <span id="s70">Very soon my two sisters were sent to another camp within the Starachowice area, and that camp was called Majówka.</span> <span id="s71">And now, the Nazis were running two separate camps.</span> <span id="s72">One was Majówka, and one was Strzelnica.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Most people were employed in the munitions factory.</span> <span id="s74">The highest echelon of the camp were the Germans, and everybody else taking care of us were the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s75">They were the guards, they were the people who conducted the convoys going to work, and from work.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">And they were brutal, absolutely brutal.</span> <span id="s77">Well, I don't quite remember how long the camp Strzelnica existed.</span> <span id="s78">I do know that the typhus – a terrible typhus epidemic broke out, that I had typhus.</span> <span id="s79">But I do remember subsequently these two camps were joined.</span> <span id="s80">And this is where I got reunited with my two sisters and my father.</span> <span id="s81">And from that point on, until late in July of 1944, where the entire single Majówka camp was resettled in a smaller camp which was adjacent to a railroad track.</span> <span id="s82">We were together, meaning the women, on the women's side, but we were able to see our father.</span> <span id="s83">And personally, I was terribly dependent on my sisters, because I absolutely and truly had no initiative and I had no idea of how to behave in those circumstances, or what to behave.</span> <span id="s84">I truly gave myself up to their care, and they became my surrogate mother in really more than one way.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">05:09:00 From that last camp, which did not really last too long, we were loaded on to the trains that were brought there and shipped to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s86">We arrived in Auschwitz on that railroad station in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s87">It was either the end of July, or very early August of 1944.</span> <span id="s88">As we were being unloaded we realized when we stood on the platform, our train was adjacent to the men's train in which my father was.</span> <span id="s89">And we still saw our father on that railroad platform and he saw us.</span> <span id="s90">And that was as I said, probably the beginning of August.</span> <span id="s91">We never saw our father again after that.</span> <span id="s92">And we found out after the war from people – we never saw our father again after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">05:10:00</span></p> <p><span id="s94">[Pause in proceedings]</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Can you go back a couple sentences?</span> <span id="s96">You got off the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: We got off the train, and our wagon happened to be adjacent to the wagon in which the men traveled.</span> <span id="s98">So, when we were discharged from the train onto the platform, we did notice our father in that group of men who descended from the adjacent train, and that was the last time we saw our father.</span> <span id="s99">He was taken into Auschwitz with the men, we went with the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">And after the war we found out that father totally lost his – you have to answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Just wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: It's all in a days work.</span> <span id="s103">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s104">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s105">05:16:00</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s107">Let's just go from what you learned about your father after the war.</span> <span id="s108">What happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: You remember the tapes of the apple?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: You know the most amazing thing to me is, I am very particular about cleanliness of food.</span> <span id="s112">I don't even eat in restaurants, unless I come in and smell the place, and look it over.</span> <span id="s113">And of course the apple, that was the apple – I hadn't seen an apple I'm sure for a few years.</span> <span id="s114">And this was the absolute find.</span> <span id="s115">And I always say to myself, “How was it that I ate that core, that leftover core without thinking: Who ate it?</span> <span id="s116">Who threw it away?</span> <span id="s117">Who spat on it?</span> <span id="s118">What dog made on it?”</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: It’s called “starvation.”</span> <span id="s120">A: Yes, well— [Pause in proceedings] 06:01:00</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: The job for which we were picked was in Brzezinka within the confines of Auschwitz in a self-contained unit called EffektenkammerThat unit consisted of a warehouse, which kept in very specifically assigned bags, numbered bags, the personal belongings of the political prisoners – non-Jewish, political prisoners – who were imprisoned in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s122">We were to guard it with our lives almost, because there wasn't ever anything to be missed, or mislaid.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">There was to be no pin transferred from one place to another.</span> <span id="s124">Those were bags that were hung up on racks with numbers.</span> <span id="s125">And whenever a political prisoner perished, his personal belongings were packed in a box.</span> <span id="s126">We were taught how to package it, and mail it out.</span> <span id="s127">This job was absolutely a godsend.</span> <span id="s128">In the first place, we were a totally self contained unit, separated from everything else by barbed wire.</span> <span id="s129">We lived indoors and worked indoors.</span> <span id="s130">We did not have to go to the marshes anymore.</span> <span id="s131">We had a kitchen that cooked whatever meager provisions there were, but at least it wasn't the same kind of starvation diet that was prevailing at the camp proper.</span> <span id="s132">And the unit was run basically by Polish women, Christian women.</span> <span id="s133">And apparently the 30 women who were dismissed from this job, who were replaced, because there was some contact with them and the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s134">So actually, somebody's misfortune turned out to be our great, great fortune, because for the duration of the stay in Auschwitz – we're now talking about November or December, very bitter cold – we were spared going to the marshes and standing in the cold water.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">06:03:00 And meanwhile of course, January rolled around, and Auschwitz was being evacuated, and we with it.</span> <span id="s136">Luckily enough, we were dressed not in rags, but we had clothing on us that could keep us warm.</span> <span id="s137">And we were then driven on a march toward trains, that were somewhere.</span> <span id="s138">There were stations somewhere, but I really don't know.</span> <span id="s139">Because at that point much as I was trying to be very independent, not to be a burden to my sisters, I always knew they were really looking out for my benefit.</span> <span id="s140">But right here, I just could not overcome my physical person.</span> <span id="s141">Meaning we were marched without stopping, and without sleeping, in the snow.</span> <span id="s142">And I completely and totally separated myself in sleep, from the reality, the prevailing reality, the march.</span> <span id="s143">And my sisters to this day tell me, and I know it for a fact, I never would 3 Personal effects chamber (German); warehouse for confiscated belongings of prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">have survived if they had not pulled me through that march.</span> <span id="s145">I think that lasted for almost a week.</span> <span id="s146">It was day and night.</span> <span id="s147">And I remembered the hallucination, that is the only thing that I really remember.</span> <span id="s148">There was a white road, and there were trees on both ends, both sides of the road.</span> <span id="s149">And it seemed to me like I was in an enclosure, because it was white and dark.</span> <span id="s150">And that I was in some kind of an enclosure, that was a total fantasy.</span> <span id="s151">But I actually lived that fantasy.</span> <span id="s152">And as a matter of fact, after a number of hours – I don't know how many – when we stopped, everybody was told to relieve themselves right where they stood.</span> <span id="s153">And my sisters told me to relieve myself, and I absolutely couldn't.</span> <span id="s154">Because you see I was in that other reality.</span> <span id="s155">And it just did not – did not yet match up with my physical person.</span> <span id="s156">So, that what actually happened was, as Chris my sister told me, I slept through that march.</span> <span id="s157">And we would just fall by the wayside, and stop at barns or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s158">Anyway, we finally reached that particular station, or whatever it was, a siding, I couldn't tell.</span> <span id="s159">But the trains that we were loaded on were cattle trains, but they were open.</span> <span id="s160">I forgot the name, I think they are called coal trains, you know.</span> <span id="s161">And they were sort of benches on them or on the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">[Telephone rings] [Technical conversation] 06:06:00</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: And Chris was telling me it was like an overnight type of stop, and they found me.</span> <span id="s164">And that I remembered.</span> <span id="s165">Well, the march from Auschwitz in the middle of January or thereabouts, going west, which was the evacuation of Auschwitz was a horrendous experience for me personally, I fell asleep during it.</span> <span id="s166">And I survived only because I was pulled by my two sisters, who insisted that I walk.</span> <span id="s167">That I sit down when we're told to sit down.</span> <span id="s168">Who directed my physical motions as needed.</span> <span id="s169">Just so that I would make it through.</span> <span id="s170">And actually I do remember the hallucinations that I had at that time, where reality was – the present reality was fiction, and my imaginary reality was the reality according to what which I acted.</span> <span id="s171">Be that as it may, that was a horrendously difficult trip because of the winter snow.</span> <span id="s172">They were killing people right along the way if you did not march in line, if you sat down for a minute.</span> <span id="s173">People just falling like flies.</span> <span id="s174">And we finally made it, whether it was to a railroad siding or a station, I don't know.</span> <span id="s175">But there were these cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: You got hit once, right?</span> <span id="s177">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: I got hit once during the march when we were for the night somewhere or other, they were – we were chased into a huge barn, and everybody was supposed to get in and sleep.</span> <span id="s180">At any rate, I didn't move fast enough, and I was hit right on the face – whether it was with the butt of the rifle, or with a shoe, or whatever it was – and I fell down, since I was asleep anyhow.</span> <span id="s181">I just fell down, and I never moved.</span> <span id="s182">And the next thing when I woke up, and the commotion started, I found myself at the very edge of that big enclosure where as everybody else was inside.</span> <span id="s183">And I realized that I'm alone.</span> <span id="s184">And I had the presence of mind to pick myself up and stand at the door, and see who was exiting.</span> <span id="s185">And I found my two sisters that way.</span> <span id="s186">And of course I imagined that perhaps my hallucinations lessened because of that short sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">However, we did make it to that string of open cars in which we were seated.</span> <span id="s188">And the fortunate thing that happened was, the snow started falling.</span> <span id="s189">And because the car was open, we were covered with the snow.</span> <span id="s190">And you know, in every misfortune, there is a good fortune.</span> <span id="s191">While it was cold, we were huddled with a mass of humanity, with women obviously.</span> <span id="s192">But we had moisture to drink.</span> <span id="s193">We would scrape the snow off the faces, and off the coats, and off the clothes, and eat it.</span> <span id="s194">And Chris even reminded me, that we took with us a bit of sugar from our last station in Auschwitz and we mixed the sugar together with the snow, and that sustained us until we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">06:09:22 We did not know where we were going.</span> <span id="s196">The train pulled up, we were all covered with snow, and there was this big sign that said Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s197">We never heard of it, at least I didn't.</span> <span id="s198">We were unloaded right there on to the snow.</span> <span id="s199">Not the platform, but it was sort of a snow area, and there was no place to go.</span> <span id="s200">And we were told to stay there right on the snow.</span> <span id="s201">Apparently by that time, all the other camps were being emptied, and people were being collected inside Germany.</span> <span id="s202">And Ravensbrück completely overflowing with humanity, for which they had no place for all these people that were coming in.</span> <span id="s203">So, we were held in that area which must have been some kind of grassy knoll, but this was now covered with snow.</span> <span id="s204">And I do remember when we were finally taken into a tent, when we left, the whole white area was covered with feces and urine of course, because we sat there and people had to relieve themselves.</span> <span id="s205">And we came into a huge tent with free standing – free standing bunks to stay on.</span> <span id="s206">It was absolutely the worst, most disorganized of all the German camps that we have seen up to that point, because there was just too impossible to accommodate all that humanity.</span> <span id="s207">Life in Ravensbrück was absolute hell.</span> <span id="s208">There was no work to go to, there was just counting in and out, counting and sitting around, and being squashed by people.</span> <span id="s209">Finally, they said that there might be transports going out.</span> <span id="s210">And as I said before, I had very little to do with my own survival.</span> <span id="s211">But my sisters decided that whatever happened, “If there is a transport, we've got to get on it.</span> <span id="s212">Wherever it's going it doesn't matter, because nothing could be worse than this particular situation, which is beyond description.”</span> <span id="s213">And so, these trucks came up, and we got loaded on.</span> <span id="s214">And I don't remember how long we drove, but I guess it was quite a number of hours because when we arrived we were unloaded in another camp, and that name of the place was Retzow.</span> <span id="s215">And that was a totally empty camp.</span> <span id="s216">There was nobody there, and they took, I don't remember how many, it was not as big as Auschwitz or Ravensbrück, it was a small camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">06:12:00 And because we were among the first to alight from the trucks we were lined up and we were given jobs.</span> <span id="s218">And the SS women who were supervising that camp, these camp women had their own lodgings there.</span> <span id="s219">We were lucky enough, I got a job as a maid for one of the SS women to clean her room.</span> <span id="s220">My sister from Canada, Anna, was assigned to an office, to clean an office.</span> <span id="s221">And Chris, I forgot what kind of job she got.</span> <span id="s222">But she reminded me of it.</span> <span id="s223">That the woman for whom I cleaned her place – this German woman – took a liking to me.</span> <span id="s224">And she decided she was going to be good to me, and leave me the crust of her bread on a piece of paper because she wouldn't come near.</span> <span id="s225">She kept leaving it on the table, and the crust of her bread on a piece of paper, because she wouldn't come near.</span> <span id="s226">And she kept leaving it on the table the crust of bread and going.</span> <span id="s227">And one day she asked me if I'm getting the crust of bread.</span> <span id="s228">And I said, “Yes, but I'm sharing it with my sister because she doesn't have a good job and could she get a job indoors?”</span> <span id="s229">And Chris was assigned to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s230">And subsequently, because they were so unwilling to be mixing in with prisoners, they housed us underneath the office, so that we would not be mixed with the population of the camp, however big or small it was, for the reason that we wouldn't be bringing lice, or whatever, we would be clean to serve them.</span> <span id="s231">And this is now April.</span> <span id="s232">And I distinctly remember that I found out that President Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s233">Truly, I just knew that President Roosevelt was some great, wonderful president somewhere in America.</span> <span id="s234">But somehow one of the prisoners heard on a radio or whatever it was, that president Roosevelt died, so I think he died in early April.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Soon after, the bombing started, the allies were bombing that Retzow camp, because this camp was basically located near some kind of an airfield, or Air Force whatever.</span> <span id="s236">And the women who were brought after us in the trucks that followed were assigned to digging ditches for anti-aircraft, you see.</span> <span id="s237">And so it happened that the bombs were falling ever more thicker, and all of a sudden we were told to pack up for the German women, because we were going to leave this camp.</span> <span id="s238">Not knowing which way or however.</span> <span id="s239">But we had to line up again.</span> <span id="s240">Again in formation, except that this time those of us who worked as maids had to carry the belongings of the SS women, because they were also evacuating.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">06:15:00 And I remember distinctly, we walked not very long, until we got to a big highway.</span> <span id="s242">And there was this most incredible thing.</span> <span id="s243">First of all we were handed rations of food from the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s244">It was – we don't know how, there was Swedish Red Cross was handing out rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">And these German women were grabbing all the cigarettes, and grabbed all the cigarettes and packed them in their own bags.</span> <span id="s246">But we had rations.</span> <span id="s247">I remember distinctly my first sardines came in a can in those rations.</span> <span id="s248">As soon as we found ourself on the main highway, there was a totally new – a new situation for which we were not prepared.</span> <span id="s249">Because we really did not know the progress of the war.</span> <span id="s250">We were in the eye of the storm, but we never knew what was happening, of who was winning or losing the war, or how the war was progressing.</span> <span id="s251">We just knew the misery of people dying constantly.</span> <span id="s252">And we finally knew that President Roosevelt had died, but was neither here nor there.</span> <span id="s253">Because that did not reflect on our personal reality.</span> <span id="s254">We found ourself on that highway, which had civilians, it had cows, it had horses, it had German tanks, it had soldiers in uniform, out of formation.</span> <span id="s255">It had soldiers in uniform in formation.</span> <span id="s256">It had – it had Polish Christian workers who were working forced labor on German farms during the war, who were also mixed into this mix.</span> <span id="s257">And us walking with painted, heavily painted white “X's”.</span> <span id="s258">It was a white enamel type paint that they painted our clothes.</span> <span id="s259">An “X” in the front, and an “X” in the back, right through my coat.</span> <span id="s260">In fact, I had the coat after the war.</span> <span id="s261">And when we came back to Poland, I had it redone.</span> <span id="s262">It was fantastic material, but it had that horrible cross.</span> <span id="s263">But anyhow–</span></p> <p><span id="s264">06:17:00</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: What was the cross for?</span> <span id="s266">Was it to identify you as– A: As a prisoner, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">[Technical conversation] 06:17:22</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Did you get anything to eat in Ravensbrück?</span> <span id="s269">Was there food there?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Oh, practically nothing.</span> <span id="s271">Practically nothing, because it was totally disorganized, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">You didn't eat in Auschwitz, but you had that water, or watery coffee, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: You Just told me – I'm sorry, you were saying in Auschwitz at least what?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Well, in Auschwitz though the food was meager, less than meager, it was doled out with a system.</span> <span id="s275">In other words, whatever watery coffee you got in the morning, it was there at all times.</span> <span id="s276">And the same whatever, horrible stuff they gave you that was soup.</span> <span id="s277">It was not soup, it was sand and some piece of turnip for a caldron of soup.</span> <span id="s278">That was at least what you expected to get, and you got.</span> <span id="s279">In Ravensbrück, because of the total inhuman influx of people for which they were not prepared, or perhaps they didn't want to plan, or as I said, I did not know the realities of the war to account for that.</span> <span id="s280">It was just total hell, disorganized hell.</span> <span id="s281">This is why we really volunteered for that trip to Retzow, which we didn't know where they was taking us.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Every selection was another selection.</span> <span id="s283">Every transport could have, as I said, ended in death.</span> <span id="s284">But we were desperate enough, and not so much my plans, but my sisters', they made the plans, and they decided “better out than in for staying.”</span> <span id="s285">So when we went to Retzow, we had these indoor jobs, and we didn't freeze anymore.</span> <span id="s286">And we sort of recouped our strength to the point again, where we are able to withstand whatever horror was going to come our way.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">And when we were driven onto the road when the camp – the bombing increased, Allied bombs increased.</span> <span id="s288">And of course maybe someday I'll tell you the reaction to bombing of people in our unit, where different people reacting to bombing all of the time.</span> <span id="s289">One was washing herself all the time.</span> <span id="s290">One was rubbing her hands.</span> <span id="s291">Anyhow – but that is another story.</span> <span id="s292">That is sort of like a vignette that probably –.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: No, tell us the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: It's very interesting, because we lived under where we worked, where we served the German women.</span> <span id="s295">We lived under this barrack in sort of like a cellar.</span> <span id="s296">And every time the bombs started falling, and we somehow had a feeling that things are going to end very soon.</span> <span id="s297">And some people, some of the women were petrified, they won't make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">06:20:00 One of them had an obsessive – completely obsessive kind of a behavior.</span> <span id="s299">She would grab a bucket of water, and she kept washing herself.</span> <span id="s300">It was absolutely unbelievable.</span> <span id="s301">And whatever made her do it, and of course some people sat in corners and prayed, and some people sang.</span> <span id="s302">Some people were singing songs.</span> <span id="s303">Some people were having hysterics, because the bombs were so very, very near.</span> <span id="s304">And I guess we were affected by it, never thinking that the Germans were probably more scared than we were, because we had by now gone through living hell, and this was just one more thing that was in the scheme of things, wasn't such a tremendous – you know, it's not a tremendous problem.</span> <span id="s305">It was only bombs, you know, from which you die either way.</span> <span id="s306">It isn't starvation, or death, or all this dirt and being eaten by lice and bedbugs.</span> <span id="s307">This is not the same category.</span> <span id="s308">And indeed – they were indeed scared, because very, very soon after we were evacuated, and found ourselves on the road.</span> <span id="s309">Before that as I mentioned, we were given Swedish Red Cross rations, and we found ourselves on the road with all that population, with the mix of humanity, of cars, and cattle, and horses, and tanks, and Germans, and Poles, and workers, and POWs, and us being marked with a white enamel cross on our clothes.</span> <span id="s310">Not a cross, it was an “X” rather on both ends.</span> <span id="s311">Well, at one point the roads were so packed, that the women who were guarding us said we have to sit down, because there is no way to move.</span> <span id="s312">We sat at the roadside.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">06:22:00 And meanwhile, they got over to the side to talk with other SS women who were guarding other groups.</span> <span id="s314">And one of the women, of the girls who served as a maid as I did, who carried the rucksack for the German women said, "Hey, I speak German very well.”</span> <span id="s315">She was blonde.</span> <span id="s316">I think she must have been 20 or 21.</span> <span id="s317">A mature girl.</span> <span id="s318">She said, "After all I am blonde, and I speak German very well.</span> <span id="s319">Why couldn't I impersonate her?"</span> <span id="s320">And the group around her, we were 12 of us around her including her, decided, “Yes, in this madness of this mix, how could you tell, except that we had our clothes that was marked?”</span> <span id="s321">You see, if we were just in regular clothes, we could have mixed as the population, the civilian population.</span> <span id="s322">And she took out from the German woman's bag her cape.</span> <span id="s323">And they used to wear like a garrison cap, you know, one of those German hats.</span> <span id="s324">She put that on, and she said, "You know what we're going to do, we're going to detach ourself.</span> <span id="s325">I will be your guard.</span> <span id="s326">If we're found out, I will say we just got lost in this melee, and I was trying to protect these prisoners, and we just got stuff mixed up.”</span> <span id="s327">And we slowly slid down like it was like an embankment, 12 of us with this Halina.</span> <span id="s328">Her name was Halina.</span> <span id="s329">I have no idea what her last name was.</span> <span id="s330">Perhaps I knew and forgot, but her name was Halina.</span> <span id="s331">She was a Polish Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s332">There were Russian girls, and Polish girls, because this was really such along way out of Auschwitz, and out of all these selections, that the group was extremely mixed.</span> <span id="s333">Anyhow, we slid down that embankment, and went into the field.</span> <span id="s334">And anyway, the night came, so we decided to stay over and see what happened.</span> <span id="s335">Anyhow, next morning we got up, and we saw some men working in the fields nearby.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">06:24:00 And we were going that way, not knowing which way, east, west, south, or north.</span> <span id="s337">It was just away from that road that was now still choked up with all that, and we didn't know where it was going, or what was happening.</span> <span id="s338">These men in the field were – excuse me, Polish POWs, Christians who were working on the German farms.</span> <span id="s339">And as soon as we got to them, they discovered that we speak Polish very well, and some of us were Polish Christians, and Polish Jews, and there was a mixture.</span> <span id="s340">And they said, “You know, there's a house, sort of like a little villa up there.</span> <span id="s341">You go there, and tell this woman – there's a German woman, a servant – that we sent you and she had to feed you.”</span> <span id="s342">And we came in, and sure enough the house was deserted by the owners.</span> <span id="s343">But there was this old woman, I don't know how old she was, but there was this woman – German servant – and she fed us.</span> <span id="s344">And we were just absolutely beside ourself with the surprise of it all.</span> <span id="s345">And it was this miracle.</span> <span id="s346">Of course we didn't know what danger faced us.</span> <span id="s347">Because we didn't know whether the war ended.</span> <span id="s348">This is now the end of April.</span> <span id="s349">We did not know, this is end of April, 1945.</span> <span id="s350">Because we were in Retzow about two months.</span> <span id="s351">So, coming out of Auschwitz in January, into Ravensbrück for two weeks, into Retzow you see.</span> <span id="s352">So, we are in Ravensbrück about two weeks, and Retzow for about two months, because now it was the end of April 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: '45?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Yes, 1945.</span> <span id="s355">Excuse me, 1945.</span> <span id="s356">We had no idea what was really happening, except all of a sudden we noticed Russian uniforms around, and Russian tanks.</span> <span id="s357">And not in any victorious fashion as you would imagine sometime, “How am I going to be liberated?</span> <span id="s358">Will there be flags flying?”</span> <span id="s359">It wasn't anything like that.</span> <span id="s360">It was the melee of things, and people, and then these Russians.</span> <span id="s361">And the following day, or maybe two days later, they came up to that farm – that was rather really like a villa, it wasn't an ordinary farm – and they said, “Oh, well that's great.</span> <span id="s362">Here's these women, and they speak Russian, and they speak Polish.”</span> <span id="s363">And they said, “We're going to be coming back in two days, you're going to work for us.”</span> <span id="s364">Meanwhile, the word got around they were raping the women.</span> <span id="s365">The Russians girls told us.</span> <span id="s366">And as soon as they left, we packed up and we left.</span> <span id="s367">We left that so called “paradise.”</span> <span id="s368">We were finding out now that the war was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s369">But things were very disorderly, and nobody knew which end was up, and which way was – which way you should head.</span> <span id="s370">We sort of traveled with some of the original 12 women but we scattered, because not everyone had the same idea.</span> <span id="s371">We knew that our parents did not survive, but my mother came from a very large family.</span> <span id="s372">There were nine children, meaning with families – nine families.</span> <span id="s373">And there was my father's big family, and we were hoping we could get back to Poland as fast as we can.</span> <span id="s374">We would at least be able to find people who survived, because my grandmother did not live in our hometown you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">06:27:22 So that we decided to go to Poland.</span> <span id="s376">So, that the march started again, because we were way inside Germany.</span> <span id="s377">I think rather very near Hamburg is where Retzow was.</span> <span id="s378">Northern Germany, the area generally known as Mecklenburg.</span> <span id="s379">So that we had to make our way from Mecklenburg back east to Poland.</span> <span id="s380">So we walked as far as a place that was than called in Germany, Schneidemühl, now it's called as Pila, it was in Poland, now it's in Polish territory.</span> <span id="s381">So, we were finally able to board a train that was going east.</span> <span id="s382">We got on the train.</span> <span id="s383">Two stations later we were bumped off the train, because soldiers were coming, and they had preference.</span> <span id="s384">So by the time we got to the Polish town of Bydgoszcz, we must have been in and out of trains, waiting to be off one, and on one.</span> <span id="s385">And of course we had no idea where we were going.</span> <span id="s386">But as long as we were going east, it was in the direction of home.</span> <span id="s387">And we were planning on getting back, and see what was happening.</span> <span id="s388">Soon, very soon, on one of the trains when we were finally seated on a train, a gentlemen in uniform came over and he heard us speak Polish.</span> <span id="s389">Whether he was a Polish Jew or Russian Jew, I don't know.</span> <span id="s390">But he was Jewish, in uniform.</span> <span id="s391">He said, “I overheard you talk, and say you're going back to Poland.</span> <span id="s392">I must tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s393">Where do you come from?”</span> <span id="s394">We said “Starachowice.”</span> <span id="s395">He said, “You must not go to back to any small town.</span> <span id="s396">You will not survive if you do that.</span> <span id="s397">What you have to do is go to any big city.</span> <span id="s398">You go to Warsaw, you go to Krakow, or you go to Lódz.”</span> <span id="s399">And we said, “How we going to go to these places where we don't really know the place, and we certainly don't know who is going to be there?”</span> <span id="s400">He said, “This you must do.”</span> <span id="s401">But he said he had a sister that…</span></p> <p><span id="s402">[Technical conversation] 07:01:19</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Did any of you ask the man?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Well, the man told us that it's dangerous.</span> <span id="s405">The situation is unsettled.</span> <span id="s406">This is now early May, 1945.</span> <span id="s407">The war was officially over.</span> <span id="s408">But things were in great flux because the armies were moving east and west, west and east.</span> <span id="s409">And the population shifts during the war as you know, were such that there was just masses of humanity going from hither to yon and back.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Because people were resettled, and uprooted, and whatever else.</span> <span id="s411">So, he said that would be one thing.</span> <span id="s412">Another thing, that small towns if you come back, and you might have been a person of means, and had property, that might get in your way.</span> <span id="s413">Because you would be suspected of coming to claim your property.</span> <span id="s414">If it was real property, or houses, or whatever.</span> <span id="s415">And we said, “What are we going to do?</span> <span id="s416">We don't know anybody.”</span> <span id="s417">He said “No, you will go to Lódz.</span> <span id="s418">If you want to go to Lódz, my sister lives there.”</span> <span id="s419">He said he had a sister, and he's going to give us her address.</span> <span id="s420">But basically now, the three big centers had Jewish organizations registering people.</span> <span id="s421">And it was most important for us to put our name in those registries, and go there and find out -- day after day -- to find out who else signed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Because that was the way – you see the Red Cross was handling some of it.</span> <span id="s423">But the masses of uprooted humanity was such that the Jewish Agencyset out its own – its own well bureau, its own office to register the returning Jews from the camps.</span> <span id="s424">We got to the sister's house.</span> <span id="s425">Sure enough, it was in the evening, her house was packed.</span> <span id="s426">People were there like herrings, laid out on the floor.</span> <span id="s427">Because whoever came back ended up there, and we stayed in that apartment on the stairwell.</span> <span id="s428">I remember, even Chris reminded me of it too.</span> <span id="s429">We talked about it, we laughed, because that was a real great welcome.</span> <span id="s430">We had absolutely no idea where we were.</span> <span id="s431">And it was packed, but people said “Welcome, stay.”</span> <span id="s432">And they pointed us in the right direction, the Jewish Agency.</span> <span id="s433">I think it was the Joint Distribution Committee, or whatever, the Jewish Agency, or international agency.</span> <span id="s434">We signed up, and we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Everyday we were given rations, and you know, provisions to sustain ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">07:04:00 And whether we found it on our own, or they somehow assigned to us a hovel, that was the most incredible place.</span> <span id="s437">It was nothing, but it was a roof over our heads.</span> <span id="s438">The walls were falling in, and it was horrendous.</span> <span id="s439">However, we were very lucky to discover that Uncle Alexander survived.</span> <span id="s440">Uncle Alexander was my father's brother.</span> <span id="s441">We came from Starachowice, and he came from Radom.</span> <span id="s442">His name was Alexander Laks.</span> <span id="s443">And Uncle Alexander came to Lódz at the same time we did.</span> <span id="s444">So, we were reunited with uncle Alexander, and we formed a household.</span> <span id="s445">And soon enough Chana came to Lódz, and she joined us, and she was part of the household.</span> <span id="s446">She became the fourth sister, Chana Tencer, so we formed this provisional household.</span> <span id="s447">And we did not discover – we did not find anybody else coming back however, until Alexander's wife survived in Sweden.</span> <span id="s448">She was taken by the Swedish Red Cross out of one of these camps, because she was also in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s449">So Uncle Alexander stayed with us, and went back to Radom.</span> <span id="s450">He had property and he was able to secure some funds, and we lived with him, and started struggling, and finding jobs and such.</span> <span id="s451">Subsequently in Lódz, I went to school.</span> <span id="s452">My sisters went to work.</span> <span id="s453">They also went to – paid a visit to Starachowice and came back very quickly, because they were threatened also that they were going to be killed if they stayed around.</span> <span id="s454">So, that really was the end of our connection to Starachowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">We stayed in Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Your Uncle Alexander was the only one of the nine brothers and sisters - 07:06:00</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: No.</span> <span id="s458">Mother's family was not Laks, mother's family was Tenenblum(ph).</span> <span id="s459">My mother's family was a larger family.</span> <span id="s460">Uncle Alexander was my father's brother, and my father had two other sisters about whom we didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s461">One of the daughters of the sister survived in 4 Jewish Agency for Palestine; branch of the World Zionist Organization whose aim is to assist and encourage Jews to foster development and settlement of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">5 American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee; Jewish American relief organization founded in 1914.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Israel, her name is Andzia.</span> <span id="s464">But my mother had a very big family and nobody survived.</span> <span id="s465">And we did find out later she lived in Ostrowiec.</span> <span id="s466">And we found out from people that lived in Ostrowiec, that she taken when Ostrowiec was being cleared of Jews.</span> <span id="s467">And my mother's youngest sister, the pharmacist who worked in Lomza.</span> <span id="s468">Right before the war she got in a pharmacy a job in Lomza after she graduated from the University.</span> <span id="s469">We never heard of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Nobody heard of her, because Lomza was northeast, and that was somehow annexed to Russia.</span> <span id="s471">And then the Germans came, and the Russians came, and it was back and forth.</span> <span id="s472">And Lomza also had these Jews shipped out to Belzec, I think.</span> <span id="s473">But we don't know whether this younger sister of my mothers ever survived the selection.</span> <span id="s474">So, Uncle Alexander in our life at that point was the only surviving relative.</span> <span id="s475">When my sisters went back, as I said, to Starachowice they were threatened, and something terrible already had happened in town that same night when they were there.</span> <span id="s476">Two women with children who returned from Auschwitz, six and eight year old children, and two women – they were killed in Starachowice that same night my sister came.</span> <span id="s477">And of course I did not go.</span> <span id="s478">I stayed with Uncle Alexander in Lódz.</span> <span id="s479">And they went.</span> <span id="s480">Of course they did not come back with anything except for some personal gifts that my mother's very dear, dear friend who kept a few mementos, who never even thought she should take things, you know, to hide for us.</span> <span id="s481">My two sisters went to her house, and she smuggled them out in the last minute onto the train to get out.</span> <span id="s482">So that was the end of our going back.</span> <span id="s483">You know, you can't go home again, in more ways than one.</span> <span id="s484">And that was certainly brought home to us at that point, and we stayed on in Lódz, and we eventually went to Berlin, and ended up in the United States.</span> <span id="s485">But again, I would like to add at this point, that I have mentioned it before.</span> <span id="s486">Not that I was a coward as a child.</span> <span id="s487">But I had nothing to do with my own survival you see.</span> <span id="s488">It was either chance, or it was my mother's wonderful wishes for her children to survive.</span> <span id="s489">Or whether it was my sisters' efforts to keep us going, or whether it was the support we gave each other.</span> <span id="s490">However it was I survived, it was it was none of my doing.</span> <span id="s491">It was the, the merest chance.</span> <span id="s492">And the most miraculous thing of that, having survived all of that, I sort of made peace with my background in the sense that I have learned going through life that people have other horrible life experiences, people who have never suffered in camps.</span> <span id="s493">And because I was able to make a life for myself, and still be educated in this country, and still be a child in this country, because I still went to summer camp here, I went to high school.</span> <span id="s494">I went to college.</span> <span id="s495">I graduated from, from college.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">07:10:00 I was working.</span> <span id="s497">I was taught Polish at the University.</span> <span id="s498">I married an, an American.</span> <span id="s499">I have a wonderful husband.</span> <span id="s500">We've been married for 38 years, and we have two grown sons.</span> <span id="s501">The house was never oriented around anything that was part of my past, in the sense that I still have very close ties to my friends.</span> <span id="s502">And always my dearest friends are the oldest friends from these times.</span> <span id="s503">I've never denied the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s504">I have never ever removed my numbers, though I was absolutely almost forced to remove it by some people I knew.</span> <span id="s505">And he was a plastic surgeon.</span> <span id="s506">In fact my first job in America was as a governess, for a family who went in the country for – and he was a plastic surgeon, and he kept telling me, “I will not charge you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s507">6 Andzia Ptasznik Of course those were my childhood days, and really, I was absolutely green about everything.</span> <span id="s508">And he said, “I won't charge you.</span> <span id="s509">I will do a beautiful job for you, and I remove your numbers.”</span> <span id="s510">And I said, “Absolutely not, because that is like brown eyes, is a part of my person, so is this number.</span> <span id="s511">It is an indelible thing.”</span> <span id="s512">I live with it.</span> <span id="s513">I don't regret not having removed it.</span> <span id="s514">I cannot say I'm proud of how I survived, or what I survived.</span> <span id="s515">It was just part of a life, but perhaps I was young enough to still catch that little bit of – because my youth was lost in Poland you see.</span> <span id="s516">And because I was able to recapture some of that childhood in America, it somehow made me feel that this is really the life that counts, even though I lost my parents.</span> <span id="s517">You know, and it was a terrible loss.</span> <span id="s518">So that I don't dwell on it.</span> <span id="s519">I talk about it freely as you could see.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">07:12:00 Not that I've rationalized it.</span> <span id="s521">I've just analyzed it, and said that, “If you are going to go through life once, and if you are going to live with your daily cares and your daily expectations, why dwell on something that was too horrible to even ever recount?</span> <span id="s522">Because most of it sounds likes fiction anyhow.”</span> <span id="s523">You know that after the war, I had a double set of teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: How do you mean you had a double set of teeth?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: My baby teeth never fell out – and I still had -and my new teeth came in.</span> <span id="s526">Because I was undernourished, and my development wasn't – I was a starved child after the war, after all was said and done.</span> <span id="s527">I was tall, but skinny, totally underdeveloped.</span> <span id="s528">Totally flat, like a board.</span> <span id="s529">And two rows of teeth.</span> <span id="s530">And when I went to a dentist in Berlin, he sat me down in the chair, and he pulled 12 teeth with his hand.</span> <span id="s531">You know, one by one.</span> <span id="s532">Because they were really ready to come out.</span> <span id="s533">But you know, they were – my physical person, so to say, hadn't yet caught up.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: You were 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s536">I had baby teeth.</span> <span id="s537">And 12 teeth in one setting.</span> <span id="s538">And it wasn't even pulling with anything but his bare hand.</span> <span id="s539">But of course that's another story.</span> <span id="s540">And than of course everything changed.</span> <span id="s541">And I have been back to Poland twice.</span> <span id="s542">Once with my husband on a tour, and another one on an interpreting job.</span> <span id="s543">And I find that I can face it rationally, and think about it rationally.</span> <span id="s544">And realize how it fits in the scheme of things of a human life, and I've made peace with it so to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: You can rationalize?</span> <span id="s546">A: Can I rationalize?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: You can rationalize?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I can, because this is also the nature of your mentality.</span> <span id="s549">I am by nature optimistic and outgoing.</span> <span id="s550">So, that it would not be true to my type to be spending my life regretting what happened, or what didn't happen, or what I went through, or I didn't.</span> <span id="s551">I certainly learned a lot from the experiences, even though they're too horrible to recount.</span> <span id="s552">Because human kindness in all that horror was also a very great part of my survival.</span> <span id="s553">There were people who were always taking pity on me, and I don't know why.</span> <span id="s554">It was not only my sisters, but also the goodness of other people helped me through.</span> <span id="s555">You know, people would give me a potato, or something.</span> <span id="s556">I don't know if I was such a sorry sight, or whatever.</span> <span id="s557">But I survived thanks to human kindness, and the real great help of my two sisters.</span> <span id="s558">Is there anything else that you would like me to elaborate on?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: And you're not angry?</span> <span id="s560">You're not angry about your parents, how they died?</span> <span id="s561">A: Well, I am not just angry how my parents died.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: And how a whole culture died?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: I am angry what happened to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s564">What horror happened, what unspeakable horror that could not even be described.</span> <span id="s565">That could not even be comprehended.</span> <span id="s566">That genocide on that scale, that is most unprecedented.</span> <span id="s567">My parents were dearest to me indeed, but the thousands and thousands of others.</span> <span id="s568">My big extended family they were tremendous family, and they were such lovely people, and they were such educated people.</span> <span id="s569">And I grieve for my parents, indeed I did.</span> <span id="s570">And I was wonderful – terribly attached to my parents.</span> <span id="s571">I was the youngest, and rather spoiled, and was very attached to my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">07:16:00 But as you read history, and study the whole – the whole scene that has unfolded in the second war that was never even contemplated, or one step from the next, was the more horrible step from the next.</span> <span id="s573">And you never knew who the horror came from, or where the goodness came from, you see.</span> <span id="s574">And yet, the other people were not treated the way we were.</span> <span id="s575">You see, when I always think of those pillows airing in the windows, where there was real normal life, when we were at the edge of total destruction.</span> <span id="s576">And the fact that you had to witness the most animalistic traits of human nature that you would never suspect people displayed.</span> <span id="s577">Because anybody, there were people who felt that they could trample you to death if they could grab that one leftover potato, you see.</span> <span id="s578">That was on the one hand.</span> <span id="s579">You saw the basest nature of the human person at its worst, and than you also saw the most wonderful qualities of people; of devotion, and people who shielded you, who cared about you, and who consoled you.</span> <span id="s580">And after all, I was a child and I needed a lot of consolation, and a lot of good deeds to push me through, aside from my sisters, who weren’t in such wonderful shape themselves to do it, but they did it.</span> <span id="s581">When you assess the – it was a trauma.</span> <span id="s582">But when you assess the whole problem, the whole experience of a huma– of 6,000,000 people you see, and than you fit yourself, that one single person who was really a child into that framework, it boggles the mind, you see.</span> <span id="s583">Therefore, if I chose to contemplate or live that past, I probably would have been a burden forever after.</span> <span id="s584">And my only and one desire after we were liberated was to never ever be a burden to anybody.</span> <span id="s585">That was one thing, because I realized then I was an orphan.</span> <span id="s586">And although I was pulled through by my sisters, of course it didn't happen, because when Miles married Chris, I became another – a charge of his you see.</span> <span id="s587">So, even though I was really always being considered a child, when I came to America I came with a children’s group, with Miles and Chris, but as a child.</span> <span id="s588">All this is fine.</span> <span id="s589">But you see again having that optimistic nature, I felt that grieving over my own past would not get any me anywhere.</span> <span id="s590">Beside, I had not lived.</span> <span id="s591">I had not lived.</span> <span id="s592">When I was given a chance to live in America, to go to high school, to go to college.</span> <span id="s593">Having that wonderful experience to go out of town in college, it was – I just fell in with it.</span> <span id="s594">This was just the most wonderful thing I could ever dream about.</span> <span id="s595">I guess – am I angry?</span> <span id="s596">I can't tell you whether I'm angry.</span> <span id="s597">I grieve about it, and I think about it.</span> <span id="s598">But it can't be brought back.</span> <span id="s599">But I hope it's going to be forever remembered, and prevented from happening again.</span> <span id="s600">So that is my only hope.</span> <span id="s601">If our experience could teach the world anything at all about human nature, and about how people can be – how people can actually – the bestiality of one man to another, if people could just learn that, than my experience was worth it.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">07:20:00 To have survived to show the world how such a thing could happen, so that it does not happen again.</span> <span id="s603">Because if we don't learn from this particular experience, it will probably happen again.</span> <span id="s604">It's something to work on, not just to think about.</span> <span id="s605">You know, to work on for a better world.</span> <span id="s606">But at this point it doesn't look like it, but who knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s609">[Technical conversation] [Interviewee

07:30:14</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: So there were two incidents that you remember particularly clearly about Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s615">Those were during that particular march from the camp proper to the marshes, where we were to clear the marshes and the underbrush alongside the river.</span> <span id="s616">And because that was a rather lengthy march, in formation with guards guarding us, we did pass quite a number private dwellings along the way, because we were basically outside of camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Whereas, whether these dwellings were for Germans who were taking care of the camp, whether these were Polish people who occupied it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s618">However, they really were private homes and on one of the marches I notices pillows airing in the windows.</span> <span id="s619">And that really was a very painful moment, because in normal conditions in Poland everybody was airing pillows.</span> <span id="s620">That was just the thing to do if you lived normal life.</span> <span id="s621">And it brought to mind, that here we were in this situation -- having been separated from our parents, forever probably, and being left alone, not knowing of our future, working under most horrendous conditions -- and here are people who are still living a normal life, airing their pillows, even in such close proximity to the camp where all these horrible things are happening.</span> <span id="s622">And somehow or other, that particular scene reminded my mind, because you know how you sometimes remain with a picture in your mind, well that was the observation that struck me at that time and remained for me ever after.</span> <span id="s623">And a similar incident, from that particular walk -- march rather, from the camp proper to the marshes and back, which we did everyday while we were working on that, on that job -- is that one day, whether we were going or coming back I don’t remember, but I did notice an eaten apple of a core on the ground as we were passing.</span> <span id="s624">I bent down and picked it up and quickly ate it.</span> <span id="s625">And I was myself amazed that I have done it.</span> <span id="s626">That I was – the hunger that overpowered the even second thought, “Should I pick up this core?”</span> <span id="s627">Because after all it was on the road and it could have been thrown away by some sick person, and it could have been the, the – god only knows, dogs could have been over it and whatever.</span> <span id="s628">It absolutely never entered my mind.</span> <span id="s629">There was this little bit of apple left on the core and this is what I grabbed and ate.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">07:33:16 And I have very often come back to that, to that – apple core picture, that picture you know, even in this day when you are always concerned about hygiene and “under what circumstances would you do such and such, and not do such and such?”</span> <span id="s631">Well that is the answer; I did it without any second thought and that was of course probably the only apple I’ve tasted in more than two years at that point and that was – there was at least the taste of the apple of the real thing, of that real life that of course I was separate from.</span> <span id="s632">So these two incidents remain very clearly in my mind from this particular work detail in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Many times when I go back to these specific memories, to these specific pictures in my mind I always wonder “Living a world of plenty in America where things are discarded constantly and I go back to that episode of that core of an apple, of what that could do to a starving person – where of course in hindsight and looking from another perspective in a totally different age I look at it now I am really most impressed of how life can change your approach to things.</span> <span id="s635">How life can absolutely move you into another dimension to make you aware of values of certain things even such as an eaten apple core, which of course today you would not ever consider anything but garbage.</span> <span id="s636">Because people though away more things that are not garbage in today’s society that we ever dreamt of.</span></p>
