what I was liberated from.</span> <span id="s4">So I really think that this tape should start, me telling you that I’m a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s5">I lived through the Holocaust from the age of 13 to 17, the ghetto, Shoriley (ph) Toovania (ph), concentration camp Shtoodruff (ph), several labor camps and went on a death march.</span> <span id="s6">At the end of the death march in the middle of February of 1945, we were put in a barn.</span> <span id="s7">We were at that point out of the thousand women, about six or seven hundred left.</span> <span id="s8">As soon as the Nazis, the SS and Gestapo that were guarding us brought us to the barn, they pushed us in there, I remember it was very, very crowded.</span> <span id="s9">There was nothing but straw on the ground.</span> <span id="s10">They ordered about 50 women out, ordered them to dig two giant long holes.</span> <span id="s11">We really thought that they were going to line us up and shoot us.</span> <span id="s12">At that point, we felt the death was welcome to us.</span> <span id="s13">We were tired of all this business but they had different plans for us.</span> <span id="s14">On one hole they put sticks on, they served, it served as a bathroom.</span> <span id="s15">The other hole, we found out soon enough, that that would be a grave.</span> <span id="s16">The SS and the Gestapo knew that we are going to die in that barn.</span> <span id="s17">No food was allocated to us already from the government, from the German government.</span> <span id="s18">Whatever the people from the village gave, some day a potato, some day a crust of bread, somedays we didn’t get any.</span> <span id="s19">We started to die in that barn.</span> <span id="s20">Epidemic of typhoid, dysentery, hunger.</span> <span id="s21">Every morning the guards ordered the little bit healthier women to take out the dead and dress them naked cause the clothes you can recycle and dump the body in the hole.</span> <span id="s22">My dear friend, what my eyes saw, in those three weeks that I was in the barn, it’s very hard to tell, to share, to describe.</span> <span id="s23">Many times I feel I don’t want to talk about it anymore but we are sitting, this tape is for history, to learn the truth.</span> <span id="s24">Every day that I walked from the barn to the so-called bathroom, it wasn’t anymore a hole, it was a mountain of skeletons covered with skin.</span> <span id="s25">Now through the Holocaust I was a little girl but I pray to God, I prayed please God let me live through a day.</span> <span id="s26">I prayed to God, please God let me live through a night.</span> <span id="s27">Maybe I’ll be free.</span> <span id="s28">But in that barn I started to pray to be dead, to be on top of this mountain.</span> <span id="s29">I was tired of living.</span> <span id="s30">All through the Holocaust we used to say, “Let’s resist the Nazis, let’s live a extra day, they want us dead.”</span> <span id="s31">But in that point, I was really tired of resisting.</span> <span id="s32">But God’s will was different.</span> <span id="s33">Marched in, we were liberated by the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s34">Now you ask me about liberation.</span> <span id="s35">My dear friend, I have a problem with the word liberation.</span> <span id="s36">Did any army come to liberate us?</span> <span id="s37">Did any country send soldiers, said, don’t worry about anything, just free those people?</span> <span id="s38">They fought the war, they found us there.</span> <span id="s39">We were found.</span> <span id="s40">Yes we were freed but we were found.</span> <span id="s41">Now I want to tell you of that day of liberation.</span> <span id="s42">That morning, when the women that were supposed to take out the dead, took out the dead, undressed them, threw them on them pile of dead bodies, they came back into the barn and they told us that they don’t see the guards.</span> <span id="s43">They said, “The guards are not here.”</span> <span id="s44">Some women started to say, “Let’s run to the village.”</span> <span id="s45">The village was, was within sight.</span> <span id="s46">We could see maybe one mile away.</span> <span id="s47">We women start say, “How can we run?</span> <span id="s48">We cannot even walk.”</span> <span id="s49">Somebody else said, “The guards may be hiding behind the barn.</span> <span id="s50">They just wait for us to start running and they’ll have an excuse to shoot us.”</span> <span id="s51">So all day long we sat in that barn, not knowing that the guards had run away.</span> <span id="s52">They escaped.</span> <span id="s53">You see we did not know whether the war was ending, where the positions of the armies were.</span> <span id="s54">We didn’t even know that there were Allied forces.</span> <span id="s55">We didn’t know a thing.</span> <span id="s56">In the evening, it was dark already, I remember it well, we heard footsteps of boots.</span> <span id="s57">Now up to this day when I hear boots marching, even on the beautiful parade, I get nervous because footsteps of boots reminded us of SS and Gestapo and selections so there we heard these footsteps and we said, “Oh, the henchmen are back.”</span> <span id="s58">But we heard Russian language.</span> <span id="s59">Russian language, Russian soldiers, dear ladies, we didn’t know you were here, we were, we are fighting the war, we found already a few other camps.</span> <span id="s60">We cannot stay with you.</span> <span id="s61">We leave two, three people.</span> <span id="s62">Tomorrow there medics will come and help you.</span> <span id="s63">So all through the night we still stayed in that barn, naturally we were free.</span> <span id="s64">Now what happened in that barn the night of liberation?</span> <span id="s65">Some people applauded with their hands.</span> <span id="s66">They could hardly move them.</span> <span id="s67">Some people jumped up for joy.</span> <span id="s68">Some people started to talk where they will go, what will they do.</span> <span id="s69">I personally cried.</span> <span id="s70">I cried so hard and it is now 50 years after liberation.</span> <span id="s71">And for 50 years, I’m trying to analyze, why did I cry?</span> <span id="s72">Did I cry for my family that was dead?</span> <span id="s73">At that point, I didn’t know if anyone was alive because in that barn I was alone.</span> <span id="s74">No one of my family.</span> <span id="s75">Did I cry for, because I didn’t know what was happening?</span> <span id="s76">Did I cry for joy?</span> <span id="s77">But I came to a conclusion that I cried because I felt sorry for myself.</span> <span id="s78">I thought where am I going?</span> <span id="s79">There’s no telephone to pick up and tell I’m coming home.</span> <span id="s80">There’s no home, no family and sincerely, many kind people say, “Nesse, you talk about the Holocaust and we don’t see tears from you.”</span> <span id="s81">I really cried that time the last time.</span> <span id="s82">So once in a while, I have a little tear in my eye.</span> <span id="s83">I learned to laugh and to love.</span> <span id="s84">But I never cry.</span> <span id="s85">So that was this night, the __________ day of liberation.</span> <span id="s86">The following day, when the Russians came, they explained to us that the village does not have a hospital.</span> <span id="s87">They have a little hotel.</span> <span id="s88">They are going to convert this little, it’s a inn, not even a hotel.</span> <span id="s89">They are going to convert it into a hospital.</span> <span id="s90">They are going to try to take the little healthier women and bring them to the village, put ‘em in the little homes.</span> <span id="s91">Some homes were already empty.</span> <span id="s92">The Germans had run away being afraid for the Russians.</span> <span id="s93">Some, in some homes there were still some Germans that stayed.</span> <span id="s94">I know they spoke German, it was a German area.</span> <span id="s95">Pomerania, mostly, Polish German, border but this little village was mostly German.</span> <span id="s96">They, so the Russians the next day came with little carts, whatever they could take from the villagers, a horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s97">I personally was carried by a Russian soldier, on his arms, and he carried me to the village.</span> <span id="s98">I was nothing but skin and bones.</span> <span id="s99">And he brought me to the village, he put me in the kitchen of that little room, on a straw sack and he said that eventually somebody will come and help me and give me food.</span> <span id="s100">A little bit later, they brought another woman that they put next to me on the straw sack.</span> <span id="s101">This woman, I’m really sorry that I cannot remember her name.</span> <span id="s102">She was a teacher in one of the religious Yovna (ph) schools and I knew her from before the war because I had friends that went to that school.</span> <span id="s103">And when I saw her I was so glad that she was there next to me on that straw sack.</span> <span id="s104">At least I felt I had someone from home.</span> <span id="s105">And the Russian soldiers every day came for a few days, they delivered a little bit food for us.</span> <span id="s106">Also, some Jewish women that were a little bit stronger started to cook a little bit, get from the villagers some food or just take it from them and started to cook a little bit.</span> <span id="s107">After I was there one day or two days, I really don’t remember, one day, one of the women that were a little stronger walked in and just said to me, “What are you doing here with a dead person?”</span> <span id="s108">I didn’t realize that the woman next to me was dead.</span> <span id="s109">They carried her out and I wanted to really go out and go out like, see where they’re burying her or whatever.</span> <span id="s110">But I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s111">So I thought let me look out and see how the free world looks.</span> <span id="s112">Cause I hadn’t seen the free world.</span> <span id="s113">Could hardly get up.</span> <span id="s114">And there was a windowpane, it was already towards evening.</span> <span id="s115">And I looked through that windowpane to see how is freedom?</span> <span id="s116">What’s outside?</span> <span id="s117">And what I saw was a monster.</span> <span id="s118">A reflection of a monster in that windowpane.</span> <span id="s119">A person, eyes sunken in, really a skeleton covered with skin.</span> <span id="s120">That’s what I saw.</span> <span id="s121">Like you see children for Halloween how they have these masks and I turned around to see who was behind me and there was no one there.</span> <span id="s122">And this is when I realized how I looked.</span> <span id="s123">How I looked.</span> <span id="s124">I did not really imagine that I looked that way.</span> <span id="s125">Okay.</span> <span id="s126">After a few days being in that house, one, a truck or a car, a truck, I believe it was a truck that came and picked us up and took us to that makeshift hospital.</span> <span id="s127">What I remember of that coming to the hospital, I remember them shaving my head, shaving my private parts wherever hair is, washing me with some kind of a disinfectant because I remember a burn of a, where they shaved.</span> <span id="s128">And then I didn’t remember anything else.</span> <span id="s129">Not a thing.</span> <span id="s130">Next thing I remember, opening my eyes and seeing a man with a white coat on and talking to me in Russian, explaining to me that he is a doctor, that I shouldn’t worry, I’m in a hospital and he would love to know my name.</span> <span id="s131">Because they did not have time to register me when I became unconscious.</span> <span id="s132">According to what they told me I was three days unconscious with high fever of typhus and typhoid, those two different diseases.</span> <span id="s133">And him telling me that the most thing that he’s worried about is that my toes were frozen and he just hopes that they wouldn’t have to be amputated.</span> <span id="s134">And as I started to tell him my age, people from down the row, it was like a big ward with many beds, somebody else tells __________ “Oh, Nesa __________ that’s you!</span> <span id="s135">We didn’t know who this was.</span> <span id="s136">Everybody asked do you know this person?”</span> <span id="s137">And there were a few people from my hometown that I knew and I really felt already more comfortable about it.</span> <span id="s138">So I was gettin’ a little better.</span> <span id="s139">People started to leave from the hospital and then I was transferred to another smaller room.</span> <span id="s140">The main thing, the treatment was on my legs.</span> <span id="s141">And I don’t even remember if I ever said that, if I gave this testimony or not but I really feel I should tell it now.</span> <span id="s142">I decided that I don’t want to live.</span> <span id="s143">After all this that I went through, the stupidity of me, not wanting to live was, now when I think back of it, it was crazy.</span> <span id="s144">I heard and saw some people were united with the, right there in that hospital there was a mother and a daughter and here I was all by myself.</span> <span id="s145">I thought what do you need to live for?</span> <span id="s146">So I decided to do a hunger strike and every time they brought a little food, I just threw it out or gave it to the lady next to me.</span> <span id="s147">And she was, I thought of that, I’m terrible but now I think of her as wonderful, she told on me.</span> <span id="s148">So they wouldn’t walk out from the room until I finished the food.</span> <span id="s149">And I really recovered pretty good.</span> <span id="s150">My, what was at that point, I still had, you see at the very end on the death march I was beaten up severely.</span> <span id="s151">And I still had my face swollen.</span> <span id="s152">My toes had kind of, the, the, a big layer that was frozen of the skin just peeled off, like, like you see a snake change his skin?</span> <span id="s153">That’s how this came off.</span> <span id="s154">And my temperature went down and I gained a little bit weight so, they kept me there because I was alone for a while.</span> <span id="s155">And then one day they told me I have to go down to the office.</span> <span id="s156">The office was like a little room.</span> <span id="s157">And when I came down there, they said to me, “We are going to close this hospital and you can go now.</span> <span id="s158">We feel you’re in good shape.</span> <span id="s159">You can go.”</span> <span id="s160">And I said to them, “Where should I go?”</span> <span id="s161">They said, “Well, you want to go up, where are you from?”</span> <span id="s162">I said, “I’m from Lithuania but I don’t have a home.</span> <span id="s163">I don’t have a family, I don’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s164">I don’t know where I should go.</span> <span id="s165">I’m 17 years old.</span> <span id="s166">I don’t know what to do.”</span> <span id="s167">So they asked the lady that was next to me where she was from and she happened to be from Lithuania and because I was just 17, I was a minor.</span> <span id="s168">I was assigned to her.</span> <span id="s169">I became her ward.</span> <span id="s170">We had one document that stated her name and my name, my last name and saying that she’s in charge because I’m a minor.</span> <span id="s171">And that’s how we left Freenuv (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Do you have her name?</span> <span id="s173">Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: I don’t, I remember her first name, Hannah, but I don’t think I ever knew her last name.</span> <span id="s175">I don’t think I ever knew it.</span> <span id="s176">She was very kind.</span> <span id="s177">She was very nice.</span> <span id="s178">She was more like a sister to me than a stranger.</span> <span id="s179">So we left, with the idea to go to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s180">She had left a child for safe, safekeeping with a Lithuanian family.</span> <span id="s181">She was from Kaunas and she really thought that maybe her child is alive.</span> <span id="s182">She wants to go back.</span> <span id="s183">Now I wanted to go to Lithuania because the last thing that we said to each other when we came to the concentration camp, that is my brother and my mom before we were separated, if we survive this hell, we have to make a meeting point, back home in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s184">So okay.</span> <span id="s185">So this I had back in my mind.</span> <span id="s186">And I thought after all, we had a home, we had a business, we left belongings with non-Jewish people for safekeeping.</span> <span id="s187">Maybe I’ll find it.</span> <span id="s188">So that was my plan.</span> <span id="s189">So there we go.</span> <span id="s190">You couldn’t go to the railroad station, say I want to buy a ticket to go to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s191">Didn’t work that way.</span> <span id="s192">See you are very young, I don’t know if you understand that.</span> <span id="s193">That first it, it wasn’t even, the war hadn’t even ended yet, so a military trucks were going east and they were going west and they were going south.</span> <span id="s194">Trains were going back and forth.</span> <span id="s195">The Russians were looting Germany and taking machinery back to Russia.</span> <span id="s196">So you hitchhiked.</span> <span id="s197">You hitchhiked on a train, on a freight train.</span> <span id="s198">You stood there, you told them you want to go little bit east, they took you.</span> <span id="s199">They said, “You want to go up to this and this little town, we’ll take you.”</span> <span id="s200">Then you have to wait for a next train and it took weeks until you got at least somewhere.</span> <span id="s201">And this is the way we arrived in the city of Lodz, Poland.</span> <span id="s202">When we arrived in Lodz, Poland, like through the grapevine while we were traveling people were telling us that in Lodz, Poland, there is already shelters.</span> <span id="s203">Christian relief, Red Cross, Jewish relief, Hiyas (ph), the Join (ph), some kind of Jewish agencies helping out refugees.</span> <span id="s204">All of a sudden we were called refugees.</span> <span id="s205">So, we were very glad to arrive in Lodz.</span> <span id="s206">When we came there, there was a big shelter on __________ 66.</span> <span id="s207">I remember that address and we, when we came in there was a very big room, we signed in, we were assigned where to go to sleep and in that room on the walls, there were big billboards.</span> <span id="s208">Posters like, and it was divided by country and divided each country more or less by city.</span> <span id="s209">And you, if let’s say if you were from Kaunas, Kaunas and surrounding __________ and surround Siauliai, that’s in Lithuania was called and surrounding.</span> <span id="s210">So I saw quite a few names there and I wrote down my name.</span> <span id="s211">That was in case somebody of your family comes.</span> <span id="s212">That’s how you got connected.</span> <span id="s213">You see when I tell it to people, they cannot understand why would you want to write your name on a posterboard but this was the way you found each other.</span> <span id="s214">Your name and where you are staying, whether you are continuing, whether you are in Lodz, wherever.</span> <span id="s215">And that particular, that shelter was, there was a big courtyard with many houses on, see in Europe, some people don’t understand that especially in the large cities, they used to have a whole courtyard maybe six, seven buildings.</span> <span id="s216">And you had to go in through a gate and it was closed for the night.</span> <span id="s217">And so we were assigned in that same courtyard, a place.</span> <span id="s218">Now all that night I thought to myself, why didn’t I write down my name within eyesight.</span> <span id="s219">I wrote it down kind of low in the poster, nobody’s going to bend down and look for my name.</span> <span id="s220">I was 17, I wasn’t too bright.</span> <span id="s221">And I could hardly wait for the next day to go back and put my name with eye level on that thing.</span> <span id="s222">I said, “I’ll put it on again, that’s alright, nobody’s going to say why do you have it twice.”</span> <span id="s223">And, as I was writing my name, Nesa Galperin, that was my name __________ N,E,S,A G,A,L,P,E,R,I,N. Galperin.</span> <span id="s224">And a woman said to me, “What Galperin, are you from Siauliai?”</span> <span id="s225">She was standing right next to me.</span> <span id="s226">And why did she ask that way?</span> <span id="s227">Just if you come of European background, you can understand, they usually said, “I am Galperin, the, the doctor Galperin, the lawyer Galperin, the shoemaker.”</span> <span id="s228">My parents had a dairy business, I said, “I am Galperin from the dairy business from the __________, from the dairy business.”</span> <span id="s229">And the woman looked at me and she said, “No, Nesa, that’s you, you look so terrible, I would never recognize you.”</span> <span id="s230">And, and she said that.</span> <span id="s231">I thought to myself, isn’t she crazy?</span> <span id="s232">Everybody looks terrible.</span> <span id="s233">And when I looked at her, I recognized the lady.</span> <span id="s234">She was a very nice lady.</span> <span id="s235">But before the war, everybody called her the, the __________, the person that is not all there.</span> <span id="s236">She had some mental problems.</span> <span id="s237">And next thing out of that woman’s mouth was, “Oh, I was with your mother in the camp.</span> <span id="s238">She’s in this and this shelter in this and this village.”</span> <span id="s239">And I said, “You were with my mother.</span> <span id="s240">My mother was taken to Galepf (ph) in Shtoodruff (ph).”</span> <span id="s241">She said, “Yes but then there was another selection and they took the people in the sixties away to the left,” and asked, she was maybe in her thirties and my mother was in the forty, she said, “They took us again and send us to labor.”</span> <span id="s242">Now as young as I was, I thought can I believe a crazy woman?</span> <span id="s243">Always people said the crazy so and so.</span> <span id="s244">So I didn’t know but I thought, I said, “Well, maybe I should check it out.”</span> <span id="s245">So I go up to the lady, to this Hannah, who is my, whose ward I am and I said to her, “We have to go back to the German border.”</span> <span id="s246">She looked at me, she says, “Child you’re crazy.</span> <span id="s247">Nobody goes back, everybody goes forward.”</span> <span id="s248">I said, “But somebody told me that my mother is there, near the German border.”</span> <span id="s249">She said, “I love you but how can I go with you to your mother?</span> <span id="s250">I want to go to my own child.”</span> <span id="s251">I said, “But you have to go with me, you have the document.”</span> <span id="s252">So she took the piece of paper, she tore it to pieces, she said to me, “Go over to the desk, tell them you’re 18 years old.</span> <span id="s253">And you’ll have your own document.”</span> <span id="s254">So I went over to the desk.</span> <span id="s255">I told them I’m 18 years old.</span> <span id="s256">I need a, a document.</span> <span id="s257">They gave me the document.</span> <span id="s258">Now everybody’s traveling one way, I’m traveling the other.</span> <span id="s259">Everybody’s going east, I’m going west.</span> <span id="s260">Some Russian soldier felt sorry for me, gave me his coat.</span> <span id="s261">And it was May already.</span> <span id="s262">I remember being on one of the trains and hearing a lot of shooting and thinking that we are being bombed but that was the celebration of VE Day and I arrived at that village.</span> <span id="s263">Got to the village, found the shelter, walk in there and I see women from my hometown and I recognize them, some woman that had bakery, another one that had a dry goods store, another one that had, that sold buttons and thread and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s264">And I look at with my eyes and they say, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s265">And I say again, “I’m Galperin from the dairy business.”</span> <span id="s266">“Oh, Nesa, your mom heard that you were alive and she heard that you were in Lodz and she went there to look for you.”</span> <span id="s267">So you can see, this isn’t just my story, how we survivors went looking for families back and forth, back and forth, hearing rumors, trying to find each other.</span> <span id="s268">It took me about maybe another two weeks or three weeks to get back to Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Nesse, tell me what you remember of your feelings when it was then confirmed that your mother was alive and you could trust these reports?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Oh, my, it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s271">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s272">I just thought in my heart that maybe I was kind to, to some older person.</span> <span id="s273">When you are 17 and you think of somebody 46 or 47, it’s old.</span> <span id="s274">I just thought maybe God helped to my prayers.</span> <span id="s275">Maybe God paid me back because I was kind to some older ladies in the camps.</span> <span id="s276">And it, you, it just undescribable, undescribable, that I felt so grateful, so grateful.</span> <span id="s277">And those remember asking me was their child with me.</span> <span id="s278">And unfortunately there wasn’t.</span> <span id="s279">I was with some people not even from my town, just a few from my hometown were with me in my camp.</span> <span id="s280">And when I came to Lodz back, yeah, we human beings are really wonderful, a wonderful thing on the earth.</span> <span id="s281">When we came, when I came back to Lodz even out of the survivors there was a welcoming committee at the time.</span> <span id="s282">I came down in the three weeks that I wasn’t there or four weeks, such a difference.</span> <span id="s283">I didn’t have to ask where is the shelter.</span> <span id="s284">There were women saying already, “Where you from?</span> <span id="s285">I’m going to help you, there’s a shelter.”</span> <span id="s286">And a woman with red hair, I don’t remember her name, came over, she said, “Nesa.”</span> <span id="s287">I said, “How do you know me?”</span> <span id="s288">She says, “Ooh, I know, you were here, you went back, I’ll take you to your mother.”</span> <span id="s289">And I just went with her.</span> <span id="s290">I figured even if she takes me to any mother, I’ll just go.</span> <span id="s291">And I don’t know how I walked up three or four floors because as I told you my feet were so raw, I could hardly walk.</span> <span id="s292">I shuffled my feet and there I came up and the only thing I remember of that reunion is this woman knocked on the door and said, “Frau Galperin, Mrs. Galperin, I brought you your daughter.”</span> <span id="s293">And she left.</span> <span id="s294">She didn’t even wait.</span> <span id="s295">And the door opened up and there wasn’t any electricity, it was a candle burning, and there was my mother.</span> <span id="s296">She looked like my mother and she didn’t run to grab me and hug me.</span> <span id="s297">She looked at me and I couldn’t understand, why this cold reception.</span> <span id="s298">And she said to me, “Okay, take off your junk.”</span> <span id="s299">I had, my face was wrapped because this was still swollen and a hole in there draining parts and no hair, I still had that little hair and that was wrapped with a rag.</span> <span id="s300">With that big . . . [end of side 1 of tape 1] My mother said to me, “Take off your, your junk, your wrappings, your __________ like was saying, just take them off.”</span> <span id="s301">So as I started to unwrap, there, there, the scarf and took off the coat.</span> <span id="s302">And you see when I was a little child I had a tracheotomy.</span> <span id="s303">I had measles and I had some infection and when my mother saw this little thing here on my neck, on my actually, right here in the middle of my neck, she grabbed me.</span> <span id="s304">She said, “My child, I didn’t recognize you.”</span> <span id="s305">You see she looked the same because she was 46, you don’t change that much.</span> <span id="s306">But me as a little girl growing up and looking different and, and all this, being so skinny and so ill.</span> <span id="s307">Now for weeks and weeks I didn’t go down those steps cause I couldn’t walk them down and I always wondered how did I ever go up those steps.</span> <span id="s308">Now we were very fortunate to find each other.</span> <span id="s309">There we were, a mother and a daughter, not too many survivors at that point had already someone of their family.</span> <span id="s310">Some did but not too many, especially a mother.</span> <span id="s311">Forty-six was considered old, not too many at that age survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s312">Now we stayed in Lodz not knowing what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Nesse can I go back and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Because it’s so moving, I imagine that what had kept you going was your, your wish to survive, to be with your mother and brother?</span> <span id="s316">And I imagine it kept your mother going, the hope to be there for you.</span> <span id="s317">And I, I just wonder, did you hold each other?</span> <span id="s318">Would you, would you sleep soundly holding onto each other at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: When, you see all through the Holocaust, it’s true the hope helped.</span> <span id="s320">But to very sincere with you, there was no formula for surviving.</span> <span id="s321">Many times people will say to me, “Oh, Nesse, you’re a strong lady, that’s why you survived the Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s322">I was a little child.</span> <span id="s323">I wasn’t, and somebody will say, “You must have been intelligent.”</span> <span id="s324">Now how intelligent was it?</span> <span id="s325">I was just a kid.</span> <span id="s326">It, I survived maybe by the grace of God, maybe by sheer luck, maybe by the kindness of women that held my hand and did give me hope or gave them their own bite of bread.</span> <span id="s327">Or maybe women that took straw and wrapped my body so I would keep warm.</span> <span id="s328">I didn’t understand that straw is a insulation.</span> <span id="s329">I really don’t know what made me survive.</span> <span id="s330">I really don’t know what made my mother survive.</span> <span id="s331">My mother always, when she died 27 years ago here in the United States, she alway, at that time people didn’t take oral history.</span> <span id="s332">I wished they would have had her oral history.</span> <span id="s333">She was telling me how many times, even from the labor camp, she was selected to go back to the concentration camp to be killed.</span> <span id="s334">And by some miracle she was left or she was overlooked or they decided that she can still work.</span> <span id="s335">At one point she said to me, “They told another woman to take off the shoes and give it to her and the woman went there and she, she, she was still alive.”</span> <span id="s336">So we don’t know how but when we were reunited, we became really like one person.</span> <span id="s337">We, I didn’t even want my mother to leave that room.</span> <span id="s338">She used to have to go down to bring up some food or get in that shelter some food or, or food stamps or whatever we, like little nut foods, there was a little ticket to go to get the food.</span> <span id="s339">I was always afraid that if she leaves me that I won’t see her again.</span> <span id="s340">And from the day of liberation, no from the day of reunion with my mother, ‘til the day she died, we were not separated.</span> <span id="s341">She chose not, never to marry again, she lived with us, with my husband and I until the day she died.</span> <span id="s342">And I cherished her, everybody knows I respected her.</span> <span id="s343">I cherished her and the day she died, I thanked God for giving me a gift of so many years after the Holocaust to have a mother.</span> <span id="s344">Many people thought I was crazy at her funeral.</span> <span id="s345">You see now I have a tear when I think of my mom.</span> <span id="s346">But at her funeral, I stood there when the casket was being lowered and I said, people didn’t want me to watch how they lower the casket.</span> <span id="s347">They said you’re supposed to stay aside.</span> <span id="s348">I said, “No, I have to stay here because I was blessed as a survivor of the Holocaust to have a mother survive and die by a disease.”</span> <span id="s349">I know where she was laid, I know I’ll put the stone over her grave, I know I’ll be able to come and visit her which I do very often.</span> <span id="s350">I go constantly for my father.</span> <span id="s351">I don’t even know where his ashes are.</span> <span id="s352">So you ask me that question.</span> <span id="s353">We were inseparable and I was lucky that my husband Jack just adored my mother.</span> <span id="s354">He really was, he lost his whole family.</span> <span id="s355">He cannot even listen to me speak about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s356">And he was very kind and glad to have her and we cherished her.</span> <span id="s357">Anyway, to continue what happened afterwards.</span> <span id="s358">So one day, my mother comes upstairs after going to look get some food or some clothing, I don’t remember and she tells me that she ran into a gentleman that was with the Soviet Army by the name of Tabreeshock (ph).</span> <span id="s359">My father’s younger sister, her married name was Tabreeshock (ph).</span> <span id="s360">This gentleman told my mother that he stationed in Lodz and his cousin who was my uncle by marriage and my aunt, my father’s sister succeeded to escape from Vilna, just as the, before the Germans marched in to the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s361">That they have returned back to Vilna and they hope as Polish citizens to, they had, there was a certain law, that you were allowed to live __________, Vilner (ph), that’s we Jewish people call __________, if you’re a Polish citizen you were allowed to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s362">And most people did not want to stay in the Soviet Union cause it was Communism and most Jewish people had the dream at that time to, to go to Israel or to come to America.</span> <span id="s363">So he told us that he knows that in a very short time, he doesn’t know it’ll take a week or two weeks or three weeks that his cousin and, and, he’s, my aunt who’s, he’s cousin to by marriage are going to try to come to Lodz.</span> <span id="s364">We shouldn’t go nowhere, we’ll be reunited.</span> <span id="s365">So we were anticipating every day are they coming, are they coming?</span> <span id="s366">My mother went always to check if their name is on the board and finally they arrive.</span> <span id="s367">They arrive in Lodz, my uncle, my aunt.</span> <span id="s368">They had a boy that was twelve years old.</span> <span id="s369">My uncle’s best friend, he’s my, his best friend’s brother and the brother’s best friend, so there are three single men with my uncle and my aunt and that little boy.</span> <span id="s370">So we are already a family unit.</span> <span id="s371">Here we are surrounded with my aunt and my uncle and, and a few guys that are there and we are all looking, where should we go?</span> <span id="s372">Where should we go.</span> <span id="s373">We get already messages that the men were liberated from Dachau.</span> <span id="s374">We hear already that the men that were taken to Shtoodruff (ph) that came with us from Siauliai were taken to Dachau and the __________ camps of Dachau.</span> <span id="s375">So we are waiting to hear maybe someone of the men survived.</span> <span id="s376">Eventually come a few gentlemen that were liberated from Dachau that are from my hometown.</span> <span id="s377">What they did, they decided to send out a few people to come to Poland, see if, and tell the women don’t go back to the Soviet Union, don’t go to Communism.</span> <span id="s378">Try to come to the American Zone.</span> <span id="s379">So and so they came with list telling who survived.</span> <span id="s380">On that list was my brother’s name.</span> <span id="s381">And we knew this, one of this gentleman and he said you, to my mother, “Your son said if I find you, try every which way to come to the American Zone.”</span> <span id="s382">Why was the aim to go to the American Zone?</span> <span id="s383">My mother had a sister that lived in Washington, D.C. And if we would be in the American Zone, we would be able to come to America.</span> <span id="s384">So here we are, all this group of people, not knowing what to do.</span> <span id="s385">So one day, my mother says to me, “You know, Nesa, we two women alone, we couldn’t do all this traveling.”</span> <span id="s386">We couldn’t, you still had to go a little bit across the border, there was no really regulations about the border.</span> <span id="s387">But still you have to take a chance, you had to take a truck, you had to walk.</span> <span id="s388">She says, “We two women alone couldn’t really manage all of this.</span> <span id="s389">One of us have to get married.”</span> <span id="s390">And I looked at my mother and I thought she has me.</span> <span id="s391">Why does she want to get married?</span> <span id="s392">But the next thing out of my mother’s mouth was, “My child, I had a wonderful husband.</span> <span id="s393">He was killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s394">But you, it’s true you’re very young.</span> <span id="s395">Maybe you should get married.”</span> <span id="s396">So I looked at her, I said, “Where do I get a husband?”</span> <span id="s397">And she said, “Look at those guys, three guys, single guys.</span> <span id="s398">The friend of the uncle’s, his brother and his friend.”</span> <span id="s399">Well I looked at the three guys and I said, “Well this one is too old.</span> <span id="s400">This one is too short and maybe this one.”</span> <span id="s401">So my mother said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s402">Now I don’t know how Jack and I got married, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s403">We, we just talked that it would be a good idea and I never kissed him before or anything and we went and we did a document that I’m his wife.</span> <span id="s404">And so, we were already like a, a threesome, a family.</span> <span id="s405">But I really didn’t, legally, I was his wife but for all practical services we were not husband and wife until later on we had the religious wedding.</span> <span id="s406">So here we are, trying to find out how can we get to the American Zone.</span> <span id="s407">So everybody says not a big deal.</span> <span id="s408">There is a, the Jewish agent, he’s helping out people to go across the border.</span> <span id="s409">Once you get into Berlin, Berlin had four zones: The Russian Zone, the French Zone, the English Zone, the American Zone.</span> <span id="s410">So to go to the Russian Zone was no problem because we were in the same place.</span> <span id="s411">And we didn’t have any luggage, we didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s412">So we took a walk and we were in the American Zone.</span> <span id="s413">And when we registered there in the camp and eventually through the Jewish Agency, people came and helped you to go to wherever you had family.</span> <span id="s414">And my brother was already at that point in a displaced person camp called Feldafing.</span> <span id="s415">And in October of 1945, we arrived in the displaced person camp.</span> <span id="s416">At that point, we had separated from the rest of the people because we were privileged to go to Feldafing because my brother was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Would you tell me the name of this brother and which one . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: It was [talkover].</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: That’s my oldest brother, Yurhaskel (ph) and he was liberated in one of the __________ camps of Dachau and from those camps they were all put in the Feldafing Displaced Person Camp.</span> <span id="s421">When we arrived, they were already, I think they were liberated in May, maybe I don’t know exactly whether May or June that displaced camp was formed, but when we arrived in October, it was pretty much organized.</span> <span id="s422">Now my aunt and my uncle, they were assigned to another displaced person camp ‘cause Feldafing was pretty crowded at that point.</span> <span id="s423">But if you had family you were allowed to go and be reunited so this is why we came to Feldafing.</span> <span id="s424">And we, we registered in the, as soon as we came.</span> <span id="s425">You have to register every, within the little town, police.</span> <span id="s426">It’s funny because I still have the, found the little document where I registered that I came there.</span> <span id="s427">And that’s how we wound up in the displaced person camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: And tell me about the reunion with your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: The reunion with my brother was different than with my mother.</span> <span id="s430">Because, because of us knowing that he was alive and because of him knowing that we were alive.</span> <span id="s431">And because of him trying to make arrangements for us to get us permission to come.</span> <span id="s432">Although we didn’t see each other, but by knowing that we were alive, it wasn’t like when I walked in and there was my mother.</span> <span id="s433">Naturally it was very emotional but not like you got surprised, you see somebody, you didn’t know they were alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Do you remember what you felt and how he looked?</span> <span id="s435">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: He, at that point, he looked a little, pretty good.</span> <span id="s437">He didn’t look so bad because don’t forget from May ‘til October, we all, I looked already better, my hair had grown and, and we looked already entirely different.</span> <span id="s438">And he was married in the ghetto and his wife, who was with me in, in the labor camp, and we were separated after liberation, she was there already.</span> <span id="s439">She had come already there.</span> <span id="s440">So we found him already with his wife and it was just so wonderful.</span> <span id="s441">In that villa, it was called Villa Valbearta (ph), those villas were used actually for SS men, for their entertainment, it was like a country club.</span> <span id="s442">Feldafing had golf courses and, and all this beautiful things for the SS and the Gestapo to come and enjoy themselves and that thing was turned into the displaced person camp.</span> <span id="s443">For the plain (ph) soldiers, they had these barracks and that’s where originally the survivors were put in, in those barracks.</span> <span id="s444">But if the family started to come, they assigned those buildings, those villas they called it villas.</span> <span id="s445">So now that villa that we were in, maybe one family lived before or one SS man with his wife or a commandant or whatever.</span> <span id="s446">And here we were, downstairs in one room lived a woman with her, with her husband that she married right after the war two, another room, two, I’m trying to think, we were like five families, five different groups, units that lived in that one house.</span> <span id="s447">They called it a villa.</span> <span id="s448">It was a house like my house.</span> <span id="s449">And we were assigned the kitchen.</span> <span id="s450">Now don’t forget, I wasn’t really sleeping with Jack.</span> <span id="s451">He, to me he wasn’t, he was a husband on paper but we hadn’t had a __________ a religious wedding.</span> <span id="s452">There I slept with my mother in one bed and then there this other bed that poor Jack had to sleep.</span> <span id="s453">And then they started to plan our religious wedding.</span> <span id="s454">And after a few months, we were married.</span> <span id="s455">And . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: And it was at Feldafing.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: In Feldafing and there wasn’t a big to-do there, we went to the rabbi and it was my brother, __________ and my sister-in-law and my mom and Jack and I and my sister-in-law kept on saying to me, “You have to be very serious when you get married.</span> <span id="s458">Especially in our tradition, you have to go around the, the groom seven times.”</span> <span id="s459">And she said to me, “Would be nice if you put on a pair of shoes with heels so you look a little taller.”</span> <span id="s460">I don’t know who gave us those, those heels but I hadn’t worn heels before.</span> <span id="s461">And when I was walking around Jack, I couldn’t stop laughing.</span> <span id="s462">I was laughing and laughing, laughing, and everybody said, “That stupid kid.</span> <span id="s463">She’s gettin’ married, look at her, such a stupid girl.”</span> <span id="s464">So that was in Feldafing.</span> <span id="s465">And we lived actually in that kitchen, we just switched beds.</span> <span id="s466">Jack hopped into my bed, my mother got his bed.</span> <span id="s467">We stayed there for a year, in that kitchen, until my oldest daughter was born.</span> <span id="s468">She was born in March of 1947 and when we, when she was born in ’47, some of the people had already documents to immigrate somewhere.</span> <span id="s469">Some people went on illegal immigration to Israel.</span> <span id="s470">And so we, the, the camp had already little bit more space so we were assigned in another villa, was called Villa Gowlitz (ph) a room.</span> <span id="s471">But still we shared that room with my mom and Jack and I and my youngest daughter, my oldest daughter.</span> <span id="s472">And the life in the displaced person camp, it was organized living.</span> <span id="s473">Some people think well you were free and you were free.</span> <span id="s474">I remember there was a curfew when we first came to the camp.</span> <span id="s475">In later years, not.</span> <span id="s476">But when we first came to the displaced person camp, is was a curfew.</span> <span id="s477">You were not allowed to go in town whenever you wanted.</span> <span id="s478">Yes it was no gate, it was not fenced but you were told that after, I don’t remember, ten o’clock or eleven or whatever, don’t remember anymore, you were not allowed to walk around.</span> <span id="s479">Also, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s480">Can you imagine us victims, I don’t call us survivor, we were victims that survived by miracle, walking among murderers?</span> <span id="s481">You see now if I would come to Germany, it’s a new generation, new people.</span> <span id="s482">Young people that will not dare, it’s a new life, a new government.</span> <span id="s483">But don’t forget, right in 1945 and ’46, the Nazis were there.</span> <span id="s484">You could see it on their faces, men that just put on, changed their coat, that’s all.</span> <span id="s485">Their feelings they still had.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Nesse were there individuals there, that you knew had been sort of perpetrators talkover?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Well not that I knew personally [talkover] yes, others would know.</span> <span id="s488">And, and then they started to talk about having trials for, they started to talk about later on what came about, the Nuremburg Trials, but in the, for the time being all those people were walking around free.</span> <span id="s489">Maybe the main, main 20 leaders, I don’t know exactly how many were taken to the jail right away.</span> <span id="s490">Let’s say a few hundred.</span> <span id="s491">But thousands and thousands that killed human beings were walking around free.</span> <span id="s492">They just said they obeyed orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s494">I understand that was one of the hardest things in the camps for the [talkover] survivors [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yes, it was difficult because you walked, you went in to register in the police office and there you thought that the German man that you thought maybe he was a guard in a camp somewhere.</span> <span id="s496">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s497">It was, maybe it was a innocent man that maybe stayed at __________ and minded his own business, was, closed his eyes to what was happening around there.</span> <span id="s498">Now is that innocent?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s500">Even then you’d, that would be hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s502">But when you walk around each, there were cases of still there were anti-Semitic incidents and even if, if someone said something to you without meaning anything, you as a victim thought well, he wants to kill you again.</span> <span id="s503">It was very difficult to live so many years in, in, in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: How long was it before the organization and the running of Feldafing was placed in the hands of the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Well I tell you, when I came in October, it was pretty much in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s506">It was guided by the Unruh (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Yeah, you, would you explain what Unruh (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s509">United Nation Relief Organization.</span> <span id="s510">And so it was guided.</span> <span id="s511">They had a person that was in charge.</span> <span id="s512">But more or less they let the Jewish community, there was a person that was like president of the camp, people that were in charge of, of the food, distribution of food, there were, at the very beginning, there were two kitchens.</span> <span id="s513">Public kitchens.</span> <span id="s514">One was kosher and one was not.</span> <span id="s515">Now when we came, because my brother knew somebody, my husband got the job in the kosher kitchen.</span> <span id="s516">So when you, you had the job, you were better off, you got, at that time was everything rationed.</span> <span id="s517">You got your ration card, you went and that’s when they gave you food.</span> <span id="s518">So at the beginning, you really had to go to that kitchen to get your food.</span> <span id="s519">After while, they kind of gave you the food and you could cook it in your little room or in your little kitchen, wherever.</span> <span id="s520">But at the beginning, you just had to go to those kitchens.</span> <span id="s521">Also, packages started to come from the United States, from the Red Cross or whatever, there was a, a warehouse for clothing.</span> <span id="s522">Like we give now for the poor and they come.</span> <span id="s523">I was watching the other day how the children came and when got their toys and how happy they were.</span> <span id="s524">And it reminded me how I went to the warehouse and I picked a pair of shoes and I picked a dress and there I had already two dresses.</span> <span id="s525">So all this somebody, people don’t realize, they think you were free from the camps and you picked up your life.</span> <span id="s526">It didn’t work that way.</span> <span id="s527">It didn’t work that way.</span> <span id="s528">Few of the people had the wisdom to try to go back to school.</span> <span id="s529">I really maybe, maybe I got married a little too quick, maybe if I would have gone to school before I got married, maybe my mother’s idea wasn’t the best one.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Tell me more about the, how quickly most people married and how unusual is it for your marriage has lasted and been very happy but did that, were most of the marriages [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Let me tell you, right after liberation and in the displaced person camp, everybody got married.</span> <span id="s532">I, I don’t to say everybody, most of the people.</span> <span id="s533">Everybody would be everybody, everybody.</span> <span id="s534">When women were alone, if the, if the guy could buy them a pair of shoes, they were willing to get married.</span> <span id="s535">You were alone, you were not, the men started the little bit, Trades (ph) started a little bit black market business.</span> <span id="s536">There was something that you could do but what could women do?</span> <span id="s537">So most people were getting married, also, also, it was very much encouraged by the community.</span> <span id="s538">Let’s rebuild our nation.</span> <span id="s539">Let’s have children.</span> <span id="s540">For every child that died, let’s have another child.</span> <span id="s541">And within a year, that’s all you saw, is baby carriages.</span> <span id="s542">When I was pregnant, every woman was pregnant.</span> <span id="s543">Every woman in the displaced person camp was pregnant.</span> <span id="s544">You talk to survivors and they’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s545">I’m 47, my child was born.</span> <span id="s546">And everyone that you will take interview they will have a child born 47, or 48 or 49.</span> <span id="s547">This was not just in spite of the Nazis wanted us dead.</span> <span id="s548">Let’s rebuild our people.</span> <span id="s549">So people got married, not necessarily before, because they fell in love.</span> <span id="s550">I don’t say, not everyone, some fell in love, young people, but most because they needed each other.</span> <span id="s551">Mostly because they needed each other.</span> <span id="s552">I tell you the truth and I sit with Jack and we talk many times.</span> <span id="s553">He says to me, “I gave you a kiss, why do you say I never gave you a kiss before we got married?”</span> <span id="s554">But maybe gave me a peck on the cheek.</span> <span id="s555">I’m talking what we see now, a kiss.</span> <span id="s556">We were not in love when we got married.</span> <span id="s557">We needed each other.</span> <span id="s558">But among survivors, you don’t see divorces.</span> <span id="s559">You don’t hear about divorces.</span> <span id="s560">Very seldom you will talk to a survivor that divorced.</span> <span id="s561">We needed, we raised our children and I tell you, Jack and I, I don’t think there was a prettier love between two people that got married without love.</span> <span id="s562">And that’s the truth.</span> <span id="s563">The truth we cared for each other, we, we raised beautiful children, we worked hard because we were not professional people . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s564">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Going back to that time in the barn when the Russians came in and liberated you, why you think you gave up then?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Well actually I, I gave up when I was already in the hospital getting better.</span> <span id="s568">When I, I didn’t give up all through that.</span> <span id="s569">I, I lived day by day saying I’ll resist the Germans, I will live.</span> <span id="s570">And then once I started to get a little better, and, and healing myself, I was gettin’ ready to give up.</span> <span id="s571">That’s the most stupid thing that I could have done.</span> <span id="s572">But don’t forget I was just 17 years old.</span> <span id="s573">Now when I look back at it, if I would have succeeded to starve myself and die, who would I have helped?</span> <span id="s574">I would have helped the Nazis.</span> <span id="s575">After the fact, they would have had one more human being dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: But when you think about it, why do you think you were giving up?</span> <span id="s577">Do you think [talkover] breaking point?</span> <span id="s578">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: I was at the breaking point or I was sorry and I thought what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s580">What do I need to live for?</span> <span id="s581">I don’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s582">I was a child.</span> <span id="s583">The reasoning for that was really no reasoning.</span> <span id="s584">When I think back about it, I think it’s the most stupid thing that I thought to do.</span> <span id="s585">But when you’re young, sometime you, you not happy with a girlfriend or you’re not happy with a boyfriend, you going to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s586">As I told you before, I go out to speak to children about my life in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s587">And I just don’t go out to speak so they will learn the horrors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s588">I go out so they would understand how precious life is, how you can help each other, how you don’t join a gang or, or a group that you will be sorry about.</span> <span id="s589">And many times they ask me about this suicide.</span> <span id="s590">And I tell them, I never tell them that I one time thought of doing that, I always tell them if you do suicide, who do you help?</span> <span id="s591">Yourself?</span> <span id="s592">You help your enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: We’re resuming with the interview with Nesse Godin on December the 14th, 1995.</span> <span id="s594">Nesse Godin, yeah, my name is Margaret West.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: And, so, we were talking about the displaced person camp, how it was.</span> <span id="s596">Now you ask me about my brothers.</span> <span id="s597">Now as I told you before, I’ll just briefly go through.</span> <span id="s598">On my other testimony and videotape, I speak a little bit maybe about it.</span> <span id="s599">But my father was taken with the children selection on November 5th of 1943, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s600">Somebody corrected me now and they said that nobody was killed in Auschwitz, they were killed in Beerkano (ph).</span> <span id="s601">But this is after the fact, people decipher it and they tell you.</span> <span id="s602">But when we were told, we were just told they were taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s603">So before all the information that was available that we have now, it was just said to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s604">So he was taken to Auschwitz or whatever, Beerkano (ph) where the gas chambers and the crematorias were and he was killed.</span> <span id="s605">My mom as I told you survived the same type of camp as I did.</span> <span id="s606">My older brother, Yerhuskel (ph) survived Dachau concentration camp.</span> <span id="s607">Now my brother who is older than me five years but I always refer to him as my younger brother because there was the older.</span> <span id="s608">His name is Manasha (ph) Galperin.</span> <span id="s609">His experience was entirely different.</span> <span id="s610">When we were being deported to the concentration camp, when we were being taken to the railroad stations, all of a sudden we were there, my mom and my brother and myself and two uncles and a aunt and my brother Manasha (ph).</span> <span id="s611">And all of a sudden we didn’t see him.</span> <span id="s612">And my poor mom cried, she said, “Oh, that delinquent, he must have done something and the SS men must have killed him,” or whatever.</span> <span id="s613">You see when he was a young boy, he always got into trouble.</span> <span id="s614">I don’t mean trouble like we say now, stealing or dope or whatever.</span> <span id="s615">He always, if he rode his bike, he held onto a truck and that’s how he rode his bike.</span> <span id="s616">He was always daring and doing things and he had all kinds of friends and, that my mother didn’t approve in the younger days.</span> <span id="s617">So he had a Lithuanian friend that always told him, if things get very bad, he’s going to help you.</span> <span id="s618">Young guy.</span> <span id="s619">And this guy always said to him, “Manasha (ph), don’t come to our house cause my parents may not approve of that.”</span> <span id="s620">But my brother knew his house, he knew the, the little forest next to it, a little woods there, he say, “You know that smokehouse that we have there?</span> <span id="s621">You sneak in there and when I will hear that the ghetto is being deported, I’m going to look and to see if you are in that smokehouse.</span> <span id="s622">I’m going to put out food for you.</span> <span id="s623">But if they catch you there, don’t you ever tell that I let you in.”</span> <span id="s624">And this is what happen.</span> <span id="s625">That day before we were really being taken, this young man found out that we were being deported.</span> <span id="s626">And my brother says that somehow, he did send word to him, that he’s ready for him to come.</span> <span id="s627">So he just somehow snuck away.</span> <span id="s628">We were walking, he snuck away, they didn’t see him and he was in that forest.</span> <span id="s629">About three weeks later, the Soviets took over this area, the outskirts of Siauliai and my brother was free.</span> <span id="s630">So this is how he was liberated in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s631">Now his story was entirely different because after a few years, 1946 or ’47 maybe ’47, I don’t know exactly when, he was called by the NKBG.</span> <span id="s632">And they told him that they know that the mother and the brother and the sister were liberated from the camps.</span> <span id="s633">And how come we did not come back to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s634">We must be Zionists.</span> <span id="s635">And if we are Zionist, we are against Communism.</span> <span id="s636">So he was sent to Siberia for 15 year.</span> <span id="s637">Now after being there all this time, when Stalin died, some people, you know how when somebody that the government gives you amnesty?</span> <span id="s638">So after being nine years in Siberia in the gulags, he was given an amnesty and was let go.</span> <span id="s639">And because of our own involvement in the United States and the involvement of the Israeli government on behalf of Soviet Jewry, he was let go and he came to Israel.</span> <span id="s640">He lived there for 20 years.</span> <span id="s641">Then two of his children married Americans and now, as we talk, he lives in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s642">I have tried many a times for him to give testimony but he says he just cannot do it.</span> <span id="s643">He says his blood pressure goes up too high.</span> <span id="s644">So you see, we are two people of one family.</span> <span id="s645">I feel that this testimony is very important, to remember the dead but most of all to teach the living what hatred and indifference can do.</span> <span id="s646">God bless him, he’s lovely, he’s great, I love him, but he wouldn’t talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s647">Not even to me.</span> <span id="s648">I wanted to go with a tape recorder, take his story, he doesn’t want to bring it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: What, what, what do you know about his time in Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Well, I, what I know about his time in Siberia, he tells wonderful stories sometime, when he’s in the mood of talking.</span> <span id="s651">But he always says that if you share a piece of bread, sometimes it saves your life.</span> <span id="s652">And when I say yeah, people shared bread with me and maybe this saved my life, he said, no and he went in and told me a story what happened to him.</span> <span id="s653">When he was taken from Lithuania, from Siauliai, to go on the train to be taken to Siberia, his wife gave him a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s654">While he was sitting on the train, there was a man, a Russian man sitting next to him.</span> <span id="s655">The Russian man said to him, my brother is a big man, he was always very big and he was bald at a very young age.</span> <span id="s656">He said that this Russian man said to him, “Dyadya (ph), uncle, would you share some bread with me?”</span> <span id="s657">So my brother as he was taught by my mom, he took the loaf of bread, he broke it in half, handed it to this stranger.</span> <span id="s658">This stranger couldn’t get over that my brother would give him a half a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s659">After while, they were talking and he said to him, “You are a remarkable man,” this stranger tells to my brother.</span> <span id="s660">“You don’t know me, you gave me, I asked you for a piece of bread, you gave me half of your bread.</span> <span id="s661">You don’t even know where you’re going.”</span> <span id="s662">So my brother says, “Well, wherever we’re going, we going.</span> <span id="s663">Whatever will happen will happen to both of us.”</span> <span id="s664">He says, “I’m going tell you something.</span> <span id="s665">When you get up tomorrow morning and you don’t see me here, don’t be surprised.</span> <span id="s666">But when you arrive in the gulags, if somebody asks you for your name, you tell them that you are Uncle Misha.”</span> <span id="s667">My brother’s name was Manasha (ph), in the Russian, Misha.</span> <span id="s668">Dyadya (ph) Misha.</span> <span id="s669">So my brother just didn’t pay attention, said this crazy man what is he telling me.</span> <span id="s670">That’s all.</span> <span id="s671">So at night, he was sleeping, he wakes up, the man is not there.</span> <span id="s672">My brother thought, did he have a dream?</span> <span id="s673">He looks at his bread, half a bread is gone.</span> <span id="s674">So he must have given it to somebody, and, okay.</span> <span id="s675">He said, well, maybe the man, maybe the NKBG put up a man, you know how you start to think.</span> <span id="s676">Well, he arrives in those gulags and in Siberia wherever he was there, I don’t know, and then he stands there and you register, register you and they ask him, “What’s your name?”</span> <span id="s677">He says, “Manasha (ph) Galperin.”</span> <span id="s678">The man said to him, “Do you have another name?”</span> <span id="s679">My brother said, “No, I don’t have another name.”</span> <span id="s680">He says, “In Russian they call me Misha.”</span> <span id="s681">He says, “Dyadya (ph) Misha?”</span> <span id="s682">He’s, he figures what can he lose, he will say.</span> <span id="s683">He say, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s684">He say, “Well you are assigned to go to work in the infirmary.”</span> <span id="s685">You see, in Russia, this underworld, even in the jails, even in the gulags, they had at that time there, how do you say, underground.</span> <span id="s686">This man was one of this Russian Mafia or underworld or something.</span> <span id="s687">So because of this half a bread, my brother say, always says, he says he wouldn’t have survived the conditions there if he would have had to go to in the mines or, or do other work.</span> <span id="s688">But because he had this, this, so he says, it pays to share your bread.</span> <span id="s689">And I tell young people now too, I said you always think you don’t have much but if you have a quarter, give a dime to somebody.</span> <span id="s690">You never know when it’ll come back.</span> <span id="s691">So it was interesting.</span> <span id="s692">I wish sometime that he would really give testimony but he, he says he cannot do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Nesse, I wonder if you’d go back and talk first of all briefly about the circumstances of your father being taken.</span> <span id="s694">But then when did your mother give up hope of his being alive?</span> <span id="s695">I think it was, don’t think she knew for sure what had happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Well I tell you.</span> <span id="s697">The children selection, as I speak in detail on my videotape which I’m sure you heard that, my father was taken on that selection and when they were taken away, the people on the railroads, the people that worked on the railroads, our Jewish community council, the, the, whatever, the Unruh (ph) or whatever you call them, they tried very hard to find out from different sources where were they taken to.</span> <span id="s698">And at that time, we knew that they were taken towards Poland.</span> <span id="s699">We did not know, every individual did not know exactly about gas chambers and, and crematorias but now after all these years, I understand that maybe our leadership knew already, that there were such things, such camps.</span> <span id="s700">But they were afraid to tell to the everyday person what was happening in those camps.</span> <span id="s701">So there were rumors that they were taken to another camp in Poland, with no name.</span> <span id="s702">We didn’t know Auschwitz, or no Auschwitz or whatever.</span> <span id="s703">What I remember at that time after the children selection after my father was taken, the mood in the ghetto was terrible.</span> <span id="s704">People started to believe in astrology, in astronomy.</span> <span id="s705">People sat in their houses and made seances, holding their hands and sitting at the table and saying to the table, if the children is, are alive, move three times, or move one time.</span> <span id="s706">And people really believed that those tables were moving.</span> <span id="s707">All kinds of stupid, started to believing cards, in laying out cards.</span> <span id="s708">I think this was all to have a flicker of hope, to not to give up.</span> <span id="s709">My dear friend, when you take a thousand children, among them infants that couldn’t live one day without being taken care of, pushing them in, later on when I was taken in those trains, and I was already at that time 16 years old, I was thinking about how did those children live even to arrive?</span> <span id="s710">Somewhere.</span> <span id="s711">But after we were liberated, after I came back to Feldafing, people, and had already documentation that this transport was taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s712">It was wishful thinking when, when I was reunited with my mom, we still hoped, we still thought that maybe they’re alive.</span> <span id="s713">Maybe they’ll be reunited.</span> <span id="s714">But when we arrived in Feldafing and I remember that first high (ph) holidays that we were in Feldafing and it was decided to say prayer for the dead, for those children.</span> <span id="s715">At that time it was already, hope was given up.</span> <span id="s716">I myself, for many years, I used to have a dream.</span> <span id="s717">I used to dream that I’m coming to some remote place and there is my father.</span> <span id="s718">And I used to say, “Papa, where have you been?</span> <span id="s719">We’ve been looking for you.”</span> <span id="s720">But I don’t have the dream anymore.</span> <span id="s721">Years ago I stopped dreaming that and I really thought that was my wishful dream.</span> <span id="s722">I was hoping that one day I will find him.</span> <span id="s723">Now I gave up a long time ago to find him alive because we knew that they were all killed.</span> <span id="s724">But even, I don’t know how many years ago when the Red Cross came up, that they found a documentation, they have in Baltimore some research and all that, and I wrote a letter to them saying that my father was taken on the fifth of November of 1943 with the selection.</span> <span id="s725">It has been proved that they were taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s726">They were not even given numbers.</span> <span id="s727">What I am looking for is how many days did this transport travel.</span> <span id="s728">Why was I looking for it?</span> <span id="s729">Because I light a candle on the day that my father was taken.</span> <span id="s730">He was still alive.</span> <span id="s731">I thought maybe if I would know four days later, three days later, know, one letter I’ve gotten back from the Red Cross saying they cannot find my father.</span> <span id="s732">And after calling them back and telling them and explaining that I know you cannot find him, he’s dead, just I need that information.</span> <span id="s733">They never found that information.</span> <span id="s734">Now I think that the museum got some new information, some archives in the former Soviet Union because Auschwitz was liberated.</span> <span id="s735">So one day I’m going to upstairs and look and see if there is new information on that.</span> <span id="s736">So I light a candle on the day that my father was taken and I let it burn for a whole week, thinking, is that the right day, that, when he died, within my tradition, Jewish tradition, to light a candle.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: And your brother, you mentioned that your brother lost his hair early.</span> <span id="s738">[talkover] He looks like your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: He was, he was, he was really very, very young when he lost his hair.</span> <span id="s740">And my father used to shave his head and so does my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: I saw the photo of your father at 47.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Now we are talking about Feldafing.</span> <span id="s743">You see when you talk to a survivor, we wander away to another space, to another place, to another happening, but that’s okay because it’s, since we are sitting in my house we have this privilege of going back and remembering of things that are important for history.</span> <span id="s744">Going back to Feldafing, now, the way as I told you Feldafing was organized, it was overseen by the Unruh (ph) and ran a little bit by the own Jewish community.</span> <span id="s745">At the beginning you had, as I said, you had to go to the main kitchens to get your food, later on you received your, your rations whatever was assigned to you and I’m sure it was enough calories for you to, to live on.</span> <span id="s746">I remember we got rations of peanut butter and peanut butter and peanut butter since, since the displaced person camp, I really never liked peanut butter.</span> <span id="s747">And dried condensed milk.</span> <span id="s748">And it was wonderful but it was still rationed.</span> <span id="s749">Eventually, people started to get little jobs like my husband got the job in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s750">My brother was working for the, well the clothing distribution and food distribution.</span> <span id="s751">At one time he was like a judge in the camp because if there were disputes among ourselves, among, in the Jewish community, it was taken care of by our own people.</span> <span id="s752">We had our own police that made sure that everything is taken care of properly.</span> <span id="s753">People started to work outside of the camp.</span> <span id="s754">After a few years, the people started, some people started little businesses, some shoemaker started to make shoes, some tailor started to make clothing.</span> <span id="s755">Some people started to barter, it became a barter system.</span> <span id="s756">Now we ourselves, as soon as my aunt found out that we were alive, we remembered her address, she lived on Sherman and Euclid (ph) Streets in Washington, D.C.</span> <span id="s757">They had a tiny little grocery story, it was called Sal’s (ph) Market.</span> <span id="s758">In those days, you didn’t have zip codes, you didn’t have to write the zip code.</span> <span id="s759">We wrote a letter, Sal’s (ph) Market, Sherman and Euclid (ph) Streets, Washington, D.C. My aunt got, she went to some relatives that had more money.</span> <span id="s760">You had to give a security so otherwise you couldn’t bring a family.</span> <span id="s761">You have to show that the family is, can take care of the people that they are going to bring.</span> <span id="s762">So she had, we had some distant cousins, some of them were car dealer, some of them at liquor store and they all signed that we would be taken care of for the family.</span> <span id="s763">But although those documents were done here, we could not leave Germany.</span> <span id="s764">Because we were from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s765">The United States had a quota system.</span> <span id="s766">I’m saying it very carefully because at one time people said, Nesse didn’t have a quarter, that’s why she didn’t come to United States.</span> <span id="s767">Quota system was x amount of people were allowed to come from each country to the United States.</span> <span id="s768">That was in effect for many years.</span> <span id="s769">Now there was no more Lithuania, Lithuania was absorbed by the Russians, by the Soviet Union, but still, we the displaced persons had to come on this quota.</span> <span id="s770">So, assuming, if they let in a hundred people of Lithuanian descent to the United States, we had to wait our turn.</span> <span id="s771">So while we were in the displaced person camp, Jack and I had two children there, in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: In what years?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: My oldest daughter Panina (ph) was born in 1947, Ed was born 1949.</span> <span id="s774">Now as I started to tell you, people started to have little businesses, raise a little money.</span> <span id="s775">Now my aunt started to send us packages, packages of clothing and packages of cigarettes, coffee.</span> <span id="s776">The German people were very anxious to have chocolate and cigarettes and coffee.</span> <span id="s777">So there was a barter system.</span> <span id="s778">Let’s say if I wanted to have a sewing machine so I could sew something, I gave the man so many cigarettes and he gave me the old sewing machine.</span> <span id="s779">Or if I wanted some bed linens, if I gave him this coffee, he gave, that was a barter system.</span> <span id="s780">People don’t understand that, how at the beginning you didn’t even need money.</span> <span id="s781">We didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s782">You started to barter things and once later, people started to have jobs and little businesses in the displaced person camp.</span> <span id="s783">After a while, schools were set up for younger children.</span> <span id="s784">Now we didn’t have at the beginning, children per se because there were no children from the camps but as people started to come like my aunt came from the occupied Russia, she had a twelve year old, he needed schooling.</span> <span id="s785">So there were children, so they had to have the schooling.</span> <span id="s786">Also, vocational schools were set up.</span> <span id="s787">I myself went to a vocational school to learn how to sew.</span> <span id="s788">Because people said when you come to America, it’s very good to know how to sew.</span> <span id="s789">People went to learn languages.</span> <span id="s790">I went to learn English.</span> <span id="s791">At one time I went and I took a course in bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s792">People said if you go to America, it’s very good to be a bookkeeper but they didn’t tell me that you need, need, need a certified accounting degree.</span> <span id="s793">So peoples resumed a little bit a life and started to earn a little money.</span> <span id="s794">By the time, I would say maybe 1947, ’48, people had already little money.</span> <span id="s795">People started to work, some people started to work in Jewish agencies for the American government.</span> <span id="s796">I don’t know really of anybody that really worked for any German per se company.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Nesse, do you know how different Feldafing was in these years from the other camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s799">I understand that I talk to many people that they were run pretty much the same because the Unruh (ph) was in charge of it.</span> <span id="s800">The only thing was in some places you, you were in more __________ barracks.</span> <span id="s801">Here at the beginning we just had the barracks, then they gave us those villas so all of a sudden we had like a bigger camp.</span> <span id="s802">Within the camp, some Zionist organizations were organized.</span> <span id="s803">I remember Ben Gur Yon (ph) coming to Israel, to, from Israel to Feldafing and I remember the whole camp was decorated with paper.</span> <span id="s804">With tissue paper.</span> <span id="s805">Now I did not know, I just found out by watching the tape of the liberators, a testimony of a person that was in charge of the camp telling how the Jews in the displaced person camp decorated with toilet paper, the whole camp.</span> <span id="s806">Now at that time, I didn’t know what, they just took this toilet paper, twisted it and it became like decorations.</span> <span id="s807">We, we started within our own camp to have a little theater group, lectures, that we, the younger people were encouraged to go.</span> <span id="s808">Now as I said, I got, I got married very young.</span> <span id="s809">And I had to, I had my children, I had to take care of them.</span> <span id="s810">And because I had my mom, I could attend some of those lectures and go to some of those classes.</span> <span id="s811">But some of my own friends had the opportunity and they went back to school right away and got their college degrees in Germany.</span> <span id="s812">I have a friend who became a nurse.</span> <span id="s813">Now in the five years that I was personally in the displaced person camp, until we got our permission to come to the United States, I worked as a secretary in between the camp at one time but most of all I did some alterations for people because I learned how to sew.</span> <span id="s814">So I redid a hem or, or as I told you I was so lucky that I had that sewing machine that I bartered for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s815">So I was a big maha (ph).</span> <span id="s816">And that’s really, we did not have much at all.</span> <span id="s817">We came to the United States without a penny in our pocket.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Tell me how that waiting would go.</span> <span id="s819">Would you be, would you be getting notification [talkover] every six months to say [talkover] maybe, maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: The notification was like this.</span> <span id="s821">You, they, you got the letter that all your papers are here . . .[end of side 1 or tape 2] Okay.</span> <span id="s822">Now you know that we were all sick people.</span> <span id="s823">Now I had right after liberation, in Munich, I had this surgery on my face and I tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s824">For a little while, I had forgotten why I had that, that thing or maybe I wanted to forget it.</span> <span id="s825">And they kept on saying that I have tuberculosis of the glands.</span> <span id="s826">Wasn’t tuberculosis of the glands, it was I was beaten up.</span> <span id="s827">But I just didn’t want to think about it or talk about, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s828">So now if I had tuberculosis of the glands, they had to check me for a year so I wouldn’t bring tuberculosis to the United States.</span> <span id="s829">So we were postponed for another year.</span> <span id="s830">They found always an excuse why you shouldn’t come.</span> <span id="s831">I remember my mom went for her examination and she was so nervous she couldn’t urinate at that time.</span> <span id="s832">So they, they wrote down that she had trouble with her bladder.</span> <span id="s833">My mom says you know how you go to the doctor sometime, you cannot give a sample?</span> <span id="s834">For, for the test?</span> <span id="s835">Little things.</span> <span id="s836">Then finally, finally already we were, we got our quota, we are ready to go.</span> <span id="s837">I was pregnant with my son.</span> <span id="s838">They wouldn’t let me go because I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s839">They said I have to wait until he was born, until he was a year old.</span> <span id="s840">And constantly postponing and postponing and people were frustrated.</span> <span id="s841">People wanted to go anywhere.</span> <span id="s842">They didn’t care where, who, what, who would let ‘em in.</span> <span id="s843">Yes, we personally really wanted to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s844">Cause my mom, four of her brothers and sister, two brothers and two sisters were killed in the Holocaust with their families and she had that one sister.</span> <span id="s845">She really wanted to come to be with her sister.</span> <span id="s846">This is, and with me, I was so young.</span> <span id="s847">My mother was the boss.</span> <span id="s848">Like she told me to get married, she told me I have to go to America.</span> <span id="s849">My brother, he felt that after suffering for so many years, we should have our own country.</span> <span id="s850">He is a Zionist, he lives in Israel and he, although it meant separation again from the rest of the family, he chose to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s851">And I remember his saying, he said, “We are free people.</span> <span id="s852">If God will help us, we’ll be able to see each other.</span> <span id="s853">We’ll be able to visit each other.”</span> <span id="s854">And the truth is that Jack and I, that’s the only vacations we take.</span> <span id="s855">Every few years, we go to visit them in Israel.</span> <span id="s856">It’s easier for us financially to do that than for them from Israel.</span> <span id="s857">They were here a few times but mostly we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Tell me about the hopes of most of the people in Feldafing.</span> <span id="s859">Would you have been unusual in hoping to come, planning to come to America?</span> <span id="s860">Would most people hope to go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Well, I tell you.</span> <span id="s862">There was differences of opinion.</span> <span id="s863">I cannot say to you that everybody was patriotic, wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s864">I myself as, as a young woman of 18, 19, 20, I was afraid of war.</span> <span id="s865">I didn’t want to go to a place where there was war.</span> <span id="s866">I wanted to go to a place and I thought of America, I, we thought, gee in America, all the people, black and white and Jews and non-Jews live together.</span> <span id="s867">What I have learned about America even in the displaced person camp; the country of freedom, the songs of freedom, where no slavery and no this and no that.</span> <span id="s868">I came here I was a little bit disappointed to find all this and even now, even within last week when I see among our own ranks in the military, prejudice, white supremacist, Nazi __________, but to me, America at that time was the country where I thought I could live my life and my children as Jews, free.</span> <span id="s869">And I still think that this is the best country in the world.</span> <span id="s870">As I say, at the very beginning, at the very beginning they, it was like again , like a jail.</span> <span id="s871">We had the curfew, we were not allowed to do this and that and the other.</span> <span id="s872">There was, okay, there was American people that were in charge and even German police of the city.</span> <span id="s873">Even German, like when I came, why couldn’t I register in the camp?</span> <span id="s874">I had to go to the German police to register that I am there.</span> <span id="s875">And that was traumatic.</span> <span id="s876">So even this still had to go through the German authority.</span> <span id="s877">I don’t know, maybe they meant well.</span> <span id="s878">They meant well whoever was in charge.</span> <span id="s879">Maybe they thought it’s, that’s a good way to do it.</span> <span id="s880">But until really it was given over more to the Jewish people to run their own, their own little camp how you say, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s881">It was difficult.</span> <span id="s882">I know, I used to even in 1947, when I went with the baby carriage into the little town out of, the camp was a little bit away from the little town.</span> <span id="s883">I don’t know if you have a picture of Feldafing, well that’s small, small little town, not a big town.</span> <span id="s884">And I think I had a feeling at that time at the beginning that like the German people looked and said, what is she doing here with a baby carriage?</span> <span id="s885">She belongs somewhere else.</span> <span id="s886">And many times we heard that.</span> <span id="s887">We heard the people say, although we understood German very well, what are they doing here?</span> <span id="s888">They belong in the camp.</span> <span id="s889">But later on, later on things really changed.</span> <span id="s890">There were young people that grew up that were children or teenagers and were more compassionate.</span> <span id="s891">There were people that we met, my mom by saying we, my mom and I, especially there was one lady, we called her oma (ph), grandma, that suffered from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s892">She was a German lady.</span> <span id="s893">Her husband was a postmaster before the war, before the Nazis took over.</span> <span id="s894">And he was put in jail and she was left with two children, two teenagers.</span> <span id="s895">And one day she just came, somehow, she saw my mother and she walked over and she said, “Lady, I’m a German lady that suffered from the Nazis and if you would just let me come and clean your house and help you, I would be grateful if you would just give me a little wood or a little food,” and we befriended that lady and we just loved her and so.</span> <span id="s896">There were different relationship, different people but in later years, Feldafing was not a uncomfortable place to be in, not a uncomfortable place to be in.</span> <span id="s897">It was like I said, a Jewish police, a Jewish little like a government and if you needed a extra coat or something there was like a, people that received packages, were not given as much as the ones that were, the social system was a little more righteous at that point.</span> <span id="s898">But I, I am, as, as a person that lived there for five years and talking to other survivors that were in Lunzberg (ph) or in Fairenweld (ph) or in Hightenhime (ph) or in different, it was pretty much the same.</span> <span id="s899">It was pretty much the same.</span> <span id="s900">People at the beginning, naturally having to be on ration and so forth and later on, people, people that were a little bit older that knew how to open a little business, they actually let the people started to sell equipment for a tailor, let’s say a thread and zippers and buttons.</span> <span id="s901">They went somewhere and bought a little bit, came back to the camp and, and sold it to the tailors and raised a little money, so small little businesses I would say the type like the years ago, the pushcart peddler.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: I was interested in knowing, I assume that nobody had, when they came to Feldafing, had any family possessions but would you have had between you any sort of momentos?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: We had nothing.</span> <span id="s904">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s905">Because we were taken from home.</span> <span id="s906">We were taken to Shtoodruff (ph), we were stripped naked, we were not successful to bring anything, anything of our own through.</span> <span id="s907">Some people that went back to Poland, let’s say if I would have been from Lodz, originally, maybe when I came back if I would have gone to my old house, maybe I would have found something.</span> <span id="s908">Also don’t forget, many people came back to Poland and went to the little villages and were killed because of that possession.</span> <span id="s909">The people that moved into those Jewish homes were afraid not to give away the stuff, they were afraid that they would be prosecuted because they lived there.</span> <span id="s910">They killed them.</span> <span id="s911">So some people succeeded to bring something back.</span> <span id="s912">We had nothing, nothing from home.</span> <span id="s913">But I am still very lucky, cause you saw pictures of my family from home.</span> <span id="s914">Now how do I have them?</span> <span id="s915">Before the war, my mom sent constantly pictures to her sister in the United States.</span> <span id="s916">My mom had two aunts, my grandfather, her father’s two sisters and their families lived the United States.</span> <span id="s917">And constantly how you send, they were in touch.</span> <span id="s918">They sent pictures.</span> <span id="s919">So every picture that you saw on a tape or later if we have a chance I’ll show them to you there on display, my family room.</span> <span id="s920">Those are pictures that were sent before second world war to the United States.</span> <span id="s921">So from home, nothing.</span> <span id="s922">What you see my house is everything that’s acquired after, given us a gift from somebody and the pictures from my mother’s sister, Loddyjoffee (ph) that brought us here.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Nesse, tell me more about at Feldafing, the rebuilding of lives but especially in the community, you mentioned the theater, but reviving songs. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Music, stories . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: And that would probably well, [talkover] raising children then.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Yeah this is very important because we, we also, I don’t know if it was in Feldafing, I think it was out of Munich, a new Jewish newspaper was printed.</span> <span id="s929">And there is cultural little events, our own Jewish community started to feel that we have to bring from, we started to bring from one displaced person camp to another, our, our stars, our, our little singers and dancers and, and, and people that survived that were actors in Poland.</span> <span id="s930">They started to bring old movies that were made years ago, Yiddish movies for us to see and to learn about.</span> <span id="s931">Eventually they started to bring operas for people that should get, like me, I never knew what an opera was.</span> <span id="s932">To learn that there is such thing as operas.</span> <span id="s933">People that were poets started to write songs and poems about the lives in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s934">Also people that remembered the songs that were born in the ghettos, in the camps, they were documented.</span> <span id="s935">Some of the people were not even alive anymore that wrote those songs but some were.</span> <span id="s936">So all these be, started to be documented.</span> <span id="s937">They started to do books on, memorial books from their communities.</span> <span id="s938">They got like we are sitting now, at that time we didn’t have tape recorders, everything had to be done on the typewriter or longhand or whoever knew shorthand to put, start to take testimonies of people.</span> <span id="s939">They started to look for witnesses that could stand up at those trials and say I was there, this is, this what happened.</span> <span id="s940">They, we had right away Jewish doctors that participated right away in Feldafing in the hospital with helping people.</span> <span id="s941">My children were delivered by Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s942">The people in their professions that people that were loyal so, businessmen started somehow to, to participate in that field in the community.</span> <span id="s943">In five years, you could see the difference in the people.</span> <span id="s944">When we left Feldafing, it was already a different community.</span> <span id="s945">It wasn’t just a victim community, it was already a survivors’ community.</span> <span id="s946">That’s the difference.</span> <span id="s947">And, I don’t know why there was no, not too much documentation cause you would think that the United Nations Relief would have all this papers on it, really.</span> <span id="s948">Being there I can just tell you of I, S, A, I don’t want to use the word inmate, inmate is maybe to strong, as I cannot use the word citizen because I was not, I was a displaced person in that camp.</span> <span id="s949">So __________ but really logistics you would have to go back to documentation that is a people that documented those things.</span> <span id="s950">__________ if you would ask me how much calories we received a day, I wouldn’t know what to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Tell me what it was like, I imagine that when your two children were born in Feldafing, that it would be tremendously emotional for you, for your husband, for your mother, [talkover] what do you remember of that, that sort of joys of having . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Well, I tell you.</span> <span id="s953">When my oldest daughter was born, my mother was so happy.</span> <span id="s954">Although she was a girl, she could hardly wait to name her after my father.</span> <span id="s955">We name after the dead in Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s956">And although I’m sure she knew that eventually I would have another child, there may be a boy, she could hardly wait to have that name.</span> <span id="s957">And it was like a rebirth, rebirth, not just rebirth to the individuals, it was a rebirth to the community.</span> <span id="s958">Every child that was born, it was not just your joy but the whole house, like five, six families were excited about that.</span> <span id="s959">Now when our son was born, that was really very, very special because Jack is the only survivor of his family.</span> <span id="s960">He cannot even stand to listen to me talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s961">But can you imagine there was a Godin?</span> <span id="s962">He stood there and he just say, “Godin, Godin, Godin.”</span> <span id="s963">That’s all he was saying.</span> <span id="s964">That’s all he was saying.</span> <span id="s965">He didn’t even and Ed is named after his father.</span> <span id="s966">His name is Edward Isaac, Edward after my grandfather, my mom’s father, who died a natural death before the war and after Jack’s father.</span> <span id="s967">My oldest daughter is named after his mother too, my father and his mother.</span> <span id="s968">We always tried to give ‘em two names so people would, all those people would be remembered.</span> <span id="s969">And that’s all I really remember and I’ll tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s970">Even when our grandson Gabe was born, our son’s son, Jack, that’s second time in his life that I saw him, so emotional that that name Godin will continue.</span> <span id="s971">When the, I was __________, I say, “Look at, look at him, he’s so cute, such a cute baby!”</span> <span id="s972">__________, he said, “Godin, Godin, Godin,” that’s all he said.</span> <span id="s973">So it really, you cannot describe those feelings.</span> <span id="s974">You really cannot describe those feelings because something happens in a family.</span> <span id="s975">Even in our own community here when we had this last spring were this poor people were killed.</span> <span id="s976">And I always says that this woman had a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s977">The husband and the children killed in one day.</span> <span id="s978">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s979">Masses of families destroyed and you all grieve together and no counseling.</span> <span id="s980">So each child that was born, each thing good that happened was like a miracle, like a miracle.</span> <span id="s981">If somebody got married, you didn’t have brothers and sisters to invite, you invited your, your, your neighbors that were your adopted brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s982">Up to this day, we have friends that we lived in the displaced person camp together.</span> <span id="s983">They were strangers but they were our family.</span> <span id="s984">I just went to Cleveland to see a lady that lived under us.</span> <span id="s985">We, our room was over hers and unfortunately she never had children.</span> <span id="s986">When I went to see her now, she has diabetes, she had a leg amputated and that’s all she was talking, she was saying, “That’s all I remember is Eddie running around upstairs with his little feet,” so.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: He was her child too.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Yeah, her child too.</span> <span id="s989">And she said, “I remember my husband used to come for lunch and runned, run quickly and bring your daughter down so she could have the chicken soup.”</span> <span id="s990">See her husband drove a car.</span> <span id="s991">And he was like a chauffeur for somebody and the people used to give them a little extra and they could afford already to make chicken soup and we didn’t.</span> <span id="s992">So she used to say, “Remember how Highmand (ph) used to come and take Nina (ph) to eat a chicken soup and the noodles with her hand,” so even now all those years later, my daughter’s now 48 years old, she, she, this lady remembers that.</span> <span id="s993">So it was not just your own family happening.</span> <span id="s994">It was all this joy was together.</span> <span id="s995">Together the sorrow and together the joy.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: How would the early years be with children cause I imagine you would be so thrilled to have them?</span> <span id="s997">But would that make you very protective?</span> <span id="s998">[talkover] Would you have, what you had suffered, would that leave you with sort of psychological scars?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Well I tell you.</span> <span id="s1000">I spoke to some survivors and they said to me, “How could you have a child after all that that happened?</span> <span id="s1001">Weren’t you afraid that somebody will come and kill them?”</span> <span id="s1002">I didn’t and I don’t know why I didn’t think so.</span> <span id="s1003">Maybe, I never thought that way.</span> <span id="s1004">I was overprotective to my children, I’m still overprotective.</span> <span id="s1005">Now you, you, it may be stupid to say on the tape but I’ll say it.</span> <span id="s1006">You see this stupid crocodile there?</span> <span id="s1007">I always, when my kids go away on the beautiful vacation, I say watch out for the crocodiles.</span> <span id="s1008">And my daughter in law who’s a new daughter in law, she’s lovely woman, to, my son was married and divorced and remarried and she said, “There’s no crocodiles where we are going.”</span> <span id="s1009">And I said to her, “It’s not really the crocodiles, it’s the memories.</span> <span id="s1010">It’s the experience in life that I went through.</span> <span id="s1011">It’s the fears and anxieties and I call them crocodiles.”</span> <span id="s1012">So she came back and brought me a crocodile there, so, this is very normal.</span> <span id="s1013">If you experience something, whether a dog bites you or a disease, you’re scared of it.</span> <span id="s1014">You’re scared of it.</span> <span id="s1015">And we survivors are all overprotective of, for our children.</span> <span id="s1016">Always thinking something will happen.</span> <span id="s1017">Don’t go here, don’t go there and in reverse, our children are super kids.</span> <span id="s1018">They always are afraid to do wrong because they don’t want to hurt the parents.</span> <span id="s1019">When I was very young and talk with my son, he always said, “I never wanted you to cry, mom.</span> <span id="s1020">I always thought if I’ll be bad and you will cry, I will hurt you and you were hurt so much.”</span> <span id="s1021">The most of the survivors are overprotective of the children and in turn, the children are super achievers because they want to do good to their parents because they suffered so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: Tell me about the Hebrew schools that were started in Feldafing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Now in Feldafing they tried very hard to have different schools for the children.</span> <span id="s1024">As I said at the beginning, before we had children children, I mean tiny babies, when the, some families that were in hiding, or had the opportunity to escape to the Soviet Union, they came back with children.</span> <span id="s1025">Among Holocaust survivors, there were no children unless you had a child in hiding and you picked it up.</span> <span id="s1026">So they started schools.</span> <span id="s1027">In the barracks there was no schoolhouse, in the barracks, in one of the barracks and they had, there were some teachers from, that were teachers from before the war that started to teach those children.</span> <span id="s1028">Not just a Hebrew school, the math and the language and history and they, they had some rabbis or rabbinical students that taught them prayers, and taught them, it, it was from scratch.</span> <span id="s1029">You had a few kids of different ages, maybe you had two, three kids that were nine years old and five kids that were twelve years old.</span> <span id="s1030">So it was really difficult.</span> <span id="s1031">Then as we were, when my oldest daughter was three years old, two and a half years old, she went to kindergarten.</span> <span id="s1032">They started from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1033">So then you had this type of school.</span> <span id="s1034">Then you had schools like for me.</span> <span id="s1035">Kids that went at the age of 13 into the camps, okay, I got married but I still wanted to go to school.</span> <span id="s1036">So my mom was with my daughter when she was already born and I went like to a night school like we have here night school to catch up for what I did not have opportunity because of the war.</span> <span id="s1037">We had a vocational school.</span> <span id="s1038">Also in one of the barracks, men were learning locksmith, they were learning car mechanic, mostly women were learning sewing.</span> <span id="s1039">Mostly sewing because everybody said wherever you go, sewing will be useful.</span> <span id="s1040">There were courses, I remember even taking a course how to make brassieres.</span> <span id="s1041">Cause in Europe you made brassieres to order.</span> <span id="s1042">There was no such thing you went in bought already brassiere.</span> <span id="s1043">So I was learning, I think I still have upstairs the books of where I learned how to take.</span> <span id="s1044">So there was very much really organized, even a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1045">We didn’t have a synagogue per se.</span> <span id="s1046">We used one of those holes or one of those barracks as a synagogue where we came on the holiday to pray.</span> <span id="s1047">Now let’s say Passover came.</span> <span id="s1048">Well did we, could we order from the bakery marker (ph)?</span> <span id="s1049">It had to be done right there.</span> <span id="s1050">Everything was like make right there.</span> <span id="s1051">They decided okay, we have this place, we have the oven, we’ll make a mattriss (ph).</span> <span id="s1052">It was, everything was like new, like, like a beginning, like starting.</span> <span id="s1053">It’s not that you moved in in a town where you can convert and say, okay, we going to that school.</span> <span id="s1054">And it was, I think, I think, that in the short time that we were in those displaced person camps, a lot of wonderful things were done.</span> <span id="s1055">The only thing unfortunately that I feel that was not done is to give us counseling.</span> <span id="s1056">There was no such thing as counseling.</span> <span id="s1057">But I really don’t know when this counseling really came into effect where people really started to believe that counseling is a good idea after you live through a trauma.</span> <span id="s1058">Maybe in those days they didn’t believe in that.</span> <span id="s1059">I really feel that’s the only thing that we should have had.</span> <span id="s1060">After traumatic lives like this, is some type of counseling and that was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Would there by any kind of sharing that would, would one person sort of pour out to another, maybe as you were sewing or [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Yes, well this is very true.</span> <span id="s1063">As much as many of us felt we didn’t want to talk about it, many times we said oh let’s not talk about it, this is a terrible thing to talk about, but every time we got together, whether we came to visit each other and have a cup of tea together, or we walked, took a little walk together, we started to compare our sufferings.</span> <span id="s1064">Where were you, what did you do and in a way, that was like a counseling because you poured out and you found out, gee, I wasn’t the only one, there was others and others and others.</span> <span id="s1065">Even when we came to the United States because people, survivors did not have family.</span> <span id="s1066">Okay, I had my aunt, my uncle, some cousins but. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">End of tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: December the 14th, 1975 and I’m Margaret West.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: As I said, even when we came to the United States and we, I mean we the survivors, even me, I’m talking personally, I wanted to, I wanted to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1071">Why did I want to talk about it?</span> <span id="s1072">As I always say in the most horrible times during the Holocaust, we used to sit and talk to each other, the women, hungry, cold, all the women used to say, please don’t forget us.</span> <span id="s1073">If you survive younger girl, tell the world of what happened.</span> <span id="s1074">And I kind as a young girl felt that I have to fulfill this promise.</span> <span id="s1075">So always wanted, always said, “Those women asked me to talk about it.”</span> <span id="s1076">But when I came to the United States, even my aunt who loved me, who helped me, my cousins that were dear to me, they always said, you suffered enough, don’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1077">So who did we, we talk to about it?</span> <span id="s1078">Survivors to each other!</span> <span id="s1079">We started to, because we didn’t have families, in, I was fortunate to have my mom, she became like in our Washington area, the mom of everybody.</span> <span id="s1080">Five, six couples, survivors coming to our house on the Sabbath, having a little lunch, what did we talk about?</span> <span id="s1081">The Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1082">Comparing each other’s suffering, telling how it was, talking about how by miracle we survived this selection and that selection and in a way, I think this was really beneficial to us.</span> <span id="s1083">Many times we say enough already talking Holocaust but I think that this was good.</span> <span id="s1084">At least we talked it out, we didn’t keep it inside.</span> <span id="s1085">Now many times, people will say to me, as you know I go out to speak to many, many schools and people will say, well it must become easier as you talk about it.</span> <span id="s1086">But this is not true.</span> <span id="s1087">When I first started to talk about it, it was easier because I unloaded my, what I had in my memory, in my feelings.</span> <span id="s1088">But then as time goes on, maybe it’s time to leave it to,to rest.</span> <span id="s1089">At this point it’s like awakening wound, reopening wounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: In your testimony you again and again show the compassional kindness that was going on among Jewish people despite their suffering and, wonder if you’d comment on, on that.</span> <span id="s1091">To survive meant that you had to toughen yourself up and at the same time there with that sort of compassion.</span> <span id="s1092">In your testimony you talk and give many instances, I think of your mother saying, this was when you were in the ghetto, don’t go out after we get back from work because . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Others have lost their [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Yes, you, you remember it well.</span> <span id="s1096">Well I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s1097">You’re saying toughen yourself up, you had no choice.</span> <span id="s1098">You became really not tough but you became numb.</span> <span id="s1099">You become numb, not tough.</span> <span id="s1100">You cannot be tough.</span> <span id="s1101">I never, if I would have been tough I could have looked the SS men in the eyes, never looked ‘em in the eyes.</span> <span id="s1102">You became numb.</span> <span id="s1103">You just hope that you live that day and you go through.</span> <span id="s1104">But I tell you.</span> <span id="s1105">I really feel, my personal feeling that it was of compassion of all the women than me.</span> <span id="s1106">Jewish women that I’m maybe here.</span> <span id="s1107">Never forget, never forget a woman that, her name was Mrs. Fivish (ph).</span> <span id="s1108">I remember her name.</span> <span id="s1109">She was from my hometown.</span> <span id="s1110">She used to call me over and say, “Nesa, come over.</span> <span id="s1111">I’ll wrap your body in straw.”</span> <span id="s1112">And first I thought what she crazy, why would she want to wrap me in straw.</span> <span id="s1113">I didn’t understand that this is insulation, that that will keep me warm.</span> <span id="s1114">Now did she save my life?</span> <span id="s1115">Another time, I used to like to leave a little piece of bread for the next morning and so I tore off a little piece of blanket, I wrapped it in the little bite of bread.</span> <span id="s1116">The whole bread was like one slice and if I ate three-fourths of it, there was just one bite really of bread left over.</span> <span id="s1117">And I wrapped it in that little cloth and put it in the straw under my head.</span> <span id="s1118">The next morning the bread wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1119">And I cried.</span> <span id="s1120">I was a little girl, I cried.</span> <span id="s1121">I cried, I was hungry.</span> <span id="s1122">Another lady, “Little girl, why you crying?”</span> <span id="s1123">“Oh, I put my bread in the piece of cloth and maybe a mouse came and, and ate it.”</span> <span id="s1124">And she, I remember her saying, “Child, no mouse ate your bread.</span> <span id="s1125">People around us are hungry.</span> <span id="s1126">Give me your little bread, I’ll put it in my bosom and I will save it for you.”</span> <span id="s1127">And you see, I had no bosom, it would have fallen through.</span> <span id="s1128">So she, every morning, she could’ve eaten up that bread, she, she gave me, I used to go over and say, “Lady,” I even forgot her name now.</span> <span id="s1129">I’m sure I knew her name at that time.</span> <span id="s1130">And I used to say, “Would you hold my little bread?”</span> <span id="s1131">And the next morning she, “Here child, here’s your little bread.”</span> <span id="s1132">She could’ve swallowed it.</span> <span id="s1133">She was hungry too.</span> <span id="s1134">Now did she help me?</span> <span id="s1135">When I was beaten up so severely on the death march, if it wouldn’t be for women that held me under my arms and that’s all I heard ‘em say, “Walk.</span> <span id="s1136">Don’t give up, walk.”</span> <span id="s1137">I really think that there was a lot of compassion, a lot of help, a lot of moral support among the inmates in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1138">We always say oh, this one was bad, that one was bad, here there were bad people too but most of the people were there for each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: What, when you mentioned, I mean their bosoms, I was thinking of, for the first time the fact that during these years you would’ve been maturing and sort of started to have periods or perhaps not because you would be so badly nourished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: I never had my period.</span> <span id="s1141">I got into the ghetto, was 13, I hadn’t gotten my period yet.</span> <span id="s1142">And at that time, my mother always said she got her period a little later when she was like 14 or whatever.</span> <span id="s1143">But then in the ghetto the, because of malnutrition, I never had a period until after liberation.</span> <span id="s1144">I tell you truth, I had one period and then I became pregnant so it was a miracle that I had even a baby.</span> <span id="s1145">So, many times I talk to, when I came to the United States, my gynecologist, talking about that and they said if somebody’s anorexic they don’t have their period.</span> <span id="s1146">So we were starved.</span> <span id="s1147">We were starved.</span> <span id="s1148">There is a myth that, I don’t know if it’s a myth, maybe it’s the truth, that something was put in our food so we wouldn’t have our periods.</span> <span id="s1149">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1150">I didn’t see a document on it.</span> <span id="s1151">Could be.</span> <span id="s1152">I know the men had like the same thing like men in the army get.</span> <span id="s1153">A certain thing, I don’t know what’s called that’s put in in the food, they shouldn’t have any sexual urges.</span> <span id="s1154">But for us women, somebody said that there was something put in the food.</span> <span id="s1155">But I think it’s just malnutrition that most women didn’t have their period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: I wonder next if you’d talk a bit more about leaving Feldafing for the United States.</span> <span id="s1157">I know how long you had to wait, but tell me about the events as you presumably had a final letter to say . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Okay, that, the final thing came that, the, as I mentioned before, we had already finally the documents and I was pregnant with my son so again we had to wait until he was a year old.</span> <span id="s1159">So after he was a year old, well a year went by.</span> <span id="s1160">We had to go again to the medical examination cause no, they wouldn’t let in any sick people in the United State.</span> <span id="s1161">So we had to go to the medical examination and then we were taken to Bremen where this, where the ports are but we were outside of Bremen in a place, I don’t remember anymore what the name of the place was: Weeldflecken (ph) or something like this.</span> <span id="s1162">It was like a camp where you stayed three or four weeks, it’s like a quarantine thing to make sure that you are in good health.</span> <span id="s1163">In that particular place they, you have to go out to take certain lessons about how you’re going to be on the boat and a little bit about American, like a little Americanization thing.</span> <span id="s1164">And there we were already, thanks God, all of us together: my mom, my husband, myself and the two kids.</span> <span id="s1165">Three and a half years old and one year old.</span> <span id="s1166">And after the few weeks that we had to be there, we were put on a Army boat.</span> <span id="s1167">It was called the SS Blatchford (ph).</span> <span id="s1168">It was a General Blatchford (ph) boat called the Army boat.</span> <span id="s1169">Now I was assigned with the two children to be in a cabin.</span> <span id="s1170">Women that had children were in a cabin.</span> <span id="s1171">Listen to that and you will understand, was that a right thing to do or a wrong thing to do?</span> <span id="s1172">My husband was separated, put into the hole in the boat.</span> <span id="s1173">Now my mom, because she was a single person and at that time she was 52 years old, she was assigned somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1174">So to us, it was traumatic to be separation.</span> <span id="s1175">Whoever made this arrangement didn’t think of it.</span> <span id="s1176">Here we are going to America and children separate, mother separate, husband separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: And big distances, I mean this . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Well, I . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Couldn’t pop in on each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1181">We even had to eat in a different mess hall.</span> <span id="s1182">The, we couldn’t even be together.</span> <span id="s1183">Now I tell you, it was a long journey.</span> <span id="s1184">I don’t know, two weeks or whatever we traveled on the ocean, I don’t remember even how long.</span> <span id="s1185">It was such a storm.</span> <span id="s1186">One night I remember my mom coming up to me in the cabin and she laid down next to me, she said, “My child, if we die in this ocean, let’s at least be together.”</span> <span id="s1187">She said, “I don’t care if they’re going to throw me out, if they’re going to put me in a jail, I’m going to lay right here with you, with the children in the cabin.”</span> <span id="s1188">So I, as I thought, years later, we were excited to go to the United States but why wasn’t there a little compassion?</span> <span id="s1189">Those people were separated from their families.</span> <span id="s1190">Why separate ‘em again?</span> <span id="s1191">Poor Jack.</span> <span id="s1192">He was laying there seasick.</span> <span id="s1193">He was terrible seasick.</span> <span id="s1194">We thought they’re going to throw him into the water, that’s how sick he was.</span> <span id="s1195">He was by himself.</span> <span id="s1196">Wouldn’t have been easier for us to be together?</span> <span id="s1197">So that was the journey.</span> <span id="s1198">We arrived in New York.</span> <span id="s1199">Now when we came you didn’t go to Ellis Island, that was no more.</span> <span id="s1200">You arrive there and you had to wait for your documents to be processed.</span> <span id="s1201">Now if you had family, then the family was allowed to go into that room and my aunt and my cousin came from Washington, all the way, to New York to wait for us and that was the most exciting thing that ever happened to us.</span> <span id="s1202">Cause here the dream came true.</span> <span id="s1203">The, the family, at least one person of a aunt and a cousin, for five years we didn’t know what that meant.</span> <span id="s1204">And we slept over one night in New York with some distant relatives and the next day we were in the car traveling to Washington.</span> <span id="s1205">I like to tell you this because it may sound stupid to anybody but it’s a experience of newcomers.</span> <span id="s1206">We are traveling in the car from New York to Washington, they didn’t have the turnpike at that time.</span> <span id="s1207">You had to go on a ferry across the Delaware.</span> <span id="s1208">Now I don’t know anything about the ferry, we are in the car, my cousin drives the car, he turns to me, he says, “Are you hungry?”</span> <span id="s1209">I said, “Yeah.”</span> <span id="s1210">He says, “I’ll get you some food.”</span> <span id="s1211">He opens the door, he goes out of the, the car and he comes back with some food.</span> <span id="s1212">I couldn’t understand how we are moving and, and he’s bringing food in the car.</span> <span id="s1213">I didn’t realize that we were on a ferry and the ferry was moving.</span> <span id="s1214">Little things that you have an experience or something that you could never forget.</span> <span id="s1215">And we were, we came to the United States, we came to live for a few weeks with my aunt and my uncle and my cousins into their house.</span> <span id="s1216">My aunt and my uncle were very kind.</span> <span id="s1217">They had rented an apartment for us the year before thinking that we were coming but because we were not allowed to come until Ed was a year old, they had subrented it and it took two more weeks for us to be able to go to that apartment.</span> <span id="s1218">So we stayed in their small house, they were very kind, they were very supportive, they were very sweet but they didn’t want to hear anything about a Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Because my aunt said she had enough pain losing two sisters and two brothers and she doesn’t to diminish the joy of having a sister, a niece and her family.</span> <span id="s1221">Now she was right too, but, again, people come to us, survivors and they will say, “How come you didn’t talk about your experiences?”</span> <span id="s1222">Many of us were willing to talk but no one would listen.</span> <span id="s1223">So after being there for two weeks, we came into our own apartment.</span> <span id="s1224">Our apartment was at 529 LaMont (ph) Street in Washington, D.C., a one bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s1225">We were my mom, my husband, myself and the two children.</span> <span id="s1226">We had a bed in the bedroom and a crib that someone had given to us for Ed cause he was a baby.</span> <span id="s1227">My mom and my daughter Panina (ph) was three and half years old, slept in the living room on a couch.</span> <span id="s1228">W were so glad to have two rooms and a kitchen and a bathroom inside of the, cause in the displaced person camp we still had to go to bathroom, we shared with other people a bathroom, so this was really something special.</span> <span id="s1229">And we just couldn’t count enough our blessings, to be here but then reality came.</span> <span id="s1230">Reality came that we are in a new country without professions, without money.</span> <span id="s1231">We couldn’t sit there although in the paper it said that my aunt is going to support us but we couldn’t expect them to support us and we started to hunt for jobs.</span> <span id="s1232">We were really not skilled although I learned a little bit at sewing, I didn’t know, I didn’t know how to make a dress.</span> <span id="s1233">Maybe I knew how to sew a hem.</span> <span id="s1234">Poor Jack, he was involved in the, in the displaced person camp working in that kitchen, managing that kitchen.</span> <span id="s1235">But what would he do here?</span> <span id="s1236">He knew less English than I knew cause he was working already in the displaced person camp while I was going a little bit to school.</span> <span id="s1237">So this was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1238">Lucky my aunt and my uncle knew some people that had a glass business and they gave Jack a job to carry crates of glass, carry them out of the truck into the warehouse, from the warehouse into the truck, labor work.</span> <span id="s1239">Natural when we say now 75 cents an hour, it may seem very little but that was minimum wage at that time, 1950, ’51.</span> <span id="s1240">We will came here the end of ’50, ’51.</span> <span id="s1241">And with me, because my mother was with us and she could take care of the children, I could go to work.</span> <span id="s1242">So through talking to some neighbors in that building, I was asked to come for an interview in a place on Connecticut Avenue.</span> <span id="s1243">It was called the King Needlework Services.</span> <span id="s1244">And to, the lady was very kind, very compassionate, her name was Mrs. King and she really did not worry too much that I didn’t know how to sew.</span> <span id="s1245">She was willing to give me a job.</span> <span id="s1246">And that’s how we started to earn our living.</span> <span id="s1247">And continue our life in the United States bit by bit with the hope that we can give to our children a better life than we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: How did you feel that you were accepted here?</span> <span id="s1249">Was that also difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: I tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s1251">I had no problem about that.</span> <span id="s1252">I did not feel inferior because I was a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s1253">I personally did not have this problem.</span> <span id="s1254">I was so glad to live in the United States.</span> <span id="s1255">If my cousins didn’t invite me to go with them to the movies, it didn’t bother me cause I, if I could spend the 50 cents or whatever the movie was at that time, I don’t, I just went.</span> <span id="s1256">And we made our own friends.</span> <span id="s1257">We, as I said, we reached out, survivors to each other.</span> <span id="s1258">And we formed little groups and eventually we saw that we couldn’t meet in houses anymore so we decided to make a little bigger group and meet in some kind of community center or whatever and this is how our present Holocaust survivors group, Jewish Holocaust Survivors of Greater Washington was created.</span> <span id="s1259">From the little groups that met in people’s houses, that played a little bingo together and shared Holocaust memories among ourselves, that’s how organizations were created.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: How much of a gulf do you feel there is between Holocaust survivors and others?</span> <span id="s1261">I would think that you, being victims in a sense and you can never therefore be like other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: I say it many a times.</span> <span id="s1263">When I go out to talk to a woman’s organization and I stand there and I tell them from my heart and my soul: I get up in the morning, I put on my makeup, I put on my nice suit, I come to talk to them.</span> <span id="s1264">I want to look like them.</span> <span id="s1265">I want to be like them.</span> <span id="s1266">I’m American but I’m different.</span> <span id="s1267">I’m a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s1268">My dear friends, my dear, dear young lady, what we went through we can never forget.</span> <span id="s1269">We can never forget.</span> <span id="s1270">Until I die, I will not forget this children selection.</span> <span id="s1271">Until I die, I cannot forget the cry of their mothers for them.</span> <span id="s1272">I will never, never forget that smell in Shtoodruff (ph) where they say was just a small crematoria.</span> <span id="s1273">People say to me Shtoodruff (ph) just had a small crematoria.</span> <span id="s1274">Tens of thousands of human beings, even before Jews were taken, euthanasia was practiced in Shtoodruff (ph).</span> <span id="s1275">If people would do research, they would know.</span> <span id="s1276">Could never, never forget those years.</span> <span id="s1277">And again, I’ll never forget what the ladies ask me.</span> <span id="s1278">To remember them.</span> <span id="s1279">To tell the world of what happened.</span> <span id="s1280">This is why I told you yes when you called me if you can come to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: When the Museum was open too, I think, it was with the idea that this testimony be there for the world, forever.</span> <span id="s1282">But it also seems so important as a, as a, as a healing place for those whose lives have been, who’ve suffered, who’ve been victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: I tell you, this United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, I don’t call it a museum.</span> <span id="s1284">I call it the most wonderful institution of learning for humanity.</span> <span id="s1285">Yes it is difficult for us survivors to come there, to help out, to open our wounds again and again but those wounds were never really closed.</span> <span id="s1286">They never really closed.</span> <span id="s1287">The only wonderful thing is when I come there and I say when I am dead, generations to come will learn what really happened.</span> <span id="s1288">Generations will come, learn, understand and my promise to the dead people will be fulfilled.</span> <span id="s1289">But this is not enough.</span> <span id="s1290">I think by being there so much and what I see and what I hear from the visitors that come, when they walk out those doors from the museum, they are different people.</span> <span id="s1291">They will be a little more compassionate.</span> <span id="s1292">I hope they will look at each other and not see colors and not see religions and not see where I came from, from this country or from that country, they will see another human being that they will respect and honor and through this, I hope, we can make our own lives richer.</span> <span id="s1293">We can make our beautiful country that we live in, the United States of America, better.</span> <span id="s1294">And we as examples to the world, that humanity should live together.</span> <span id="s1295">We were not created to be exactly alike.</span> <span id="s1296">Whether, whether evolution or God, I happen to be a, a believer, I, if God wanted us to look alike he would clone us exactly.</span> <span id="s1297">He made us different, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Nesse, tell me about your three children and really too about the ways in which your experiences have had an impact on your role as a parent, and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1300">Well I’m going to tell you.</span> <span id="s1301">I always said and I considered myself one of the survivors that’s open, talking to my children.</span> <span id="s1302">When I saw a book that said survivors’ children and they said they were neurotic and they were this and they were that, I was annoyed.</span> <span id="s1303">But the truth is that we survivors were always overprotective to our children because of the experiences that we went through.</span> <span id="s1304">Now I always thought you, my kids were not affected in the Holocaust but my son has said, __________ , told me when he was a little boy, he was afraid that the Nazis will come for him.</span> <span id="s1305">When I, actually didn’t tell me that, I saw it written up in the paper, when he gave a interview to somebody.</span> <span id="s1306">And I came to him, he said, “Yeah and I was afraid to tell you.”</span> <span id="s1307">So as adjusted our family is and as we are very different.</span> <span id="s1308">Now we were both protective.</span> <span id="s1309">Because we suffered, we wanted our children to have more.</span> <span id="s1310">We, Jack and I were never in business, we were always working people.</span> <span id="s1311">We, I don’t want to say it, but we sacrificed ourself so our children would have college educations but in turn they did their share.</span> <span id="s1312">They made sure that they are achievers, maybe little overachievers because as we chatted during lunch, I said that kids didn’t want us to suffer no more.</span> <span id="s1313">My kids always said, “Ma, we don’t want you to cry because you cried enough.”</span> <span id="s1314">So we can proudly say, we have two daughters that are teachers, our son a engineer and now thanks God we have five wonderful grandchildren and we do have the most wonderful children in law.</span> <span id="s1315">That respect us, that support the work that we do and this is very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Are there ways in which, that the children you think have, are there other ways in which they’ve been affected by your experiences?</span> <span id="s1317">I was just thinking of how all the activities of every day for you, are affected by your experiences.</span> <span id="s1318">The, the plentiful availability of food.</span> <span id="s1319">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Well, I tell you, naturally, when you are with, with food, if, every day’s affected, every day’s affect.</span> <span id="s1321">I started to tell you before, I go to a beautiful restaurant, I go to the salad bar, there’s a line.</span> <span id="s1322">I stand with my plate for food and all of a sudden I get the chill.</span> <span id="s1323">Why do I get the chill?</span> <span id="s1324">It reminds me of standing in line for food.</span> <span id="s1325">Many times I will come back to the table with a empty plate.</span> <span id="s1326">And whoever I’m there, they will say, “Didn’t you take any salad?”</span> <span id="s1327">I say, “No I’ll go later for it.”</span> <span id="s1328">Who would understand that?</span> <span id="s1329">Who would understand that?</span> <span id="s1330">There, yesterday was cold, I was going in the morning to the museum, my day to volunteer.</span> <span id="s1331">Jack said to me, “Don’t forget your scarf.”</span> <span id="s1332">And for that instant I thought of the cold weather without a scarf, without gloves, without a coat, without __________.</span> <span id="s1333">How can you not be affected?</span> <span id="s1334">Naturally if you were affected, it goes over to your children.</span> <span id="s1335">If my children left food on the plate, unconsciously I said, “Oh the kids in the Holocaust would’ve really been happy to have that.”</span> <span id="s1336">Or saying, “Please don’t waste food, there’s hungry children in the world.”</span> <span id="s1337">So it does carry over without even thinking about it, you influence your children, your, when my grandchildren was little, I was sitting and watching “The Wizard of Oz”, beautiful show, right?</span> <span id="s1338">Beautiful show.</span> <span id="s1339">And I was sitting there enjoying, having a good time and there all of a sudden, was the scarescrow, how did I pronounce it right?</span> <span id="s1340">The guy that has the straw in him around?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">[end of side 1 of tape 3] And there the scarescrow with the straw and there reminded me of the days when I was wrapped in straw.</span> <span id="s1342">So there’s really not a day goes by that we are not affected by that Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: What about nightmares?</span> <span id="s1344">And I wondered too, does, does your husband Jack [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: We both have nightmares.</span> <span id="s1346">We gotten used to those nightmares.</span> <span id="s1347">If we have a night without nightmares, it’s very unusual.</span> <span id="s1348">The difference is, when at first I used to have those nightmares, was always with the hope that I’m finding my father, that I’m finding a relative.</span> <span id="s1349">Then those nightmares went away.</span> <span id="s1350">Then I was running from the Germans as a child, and as I get older, it’s terrible to say, sometime I dream that my children are being taken, or my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1351">In your mind, all this get jumbled up and you hear of really many Holocaust survivors that are getting old and all this, like if they have dementia or something, all this comes mumble-jumble and they have this terrible times.</span> <span id="s1352">You cannot erase that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: How did your mother do?</span> <span id="s1354">I mean would she [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Well don’t forget when my mother died, she was just two years older than I am.</span> <span id="s1356">Not even two years.</span> <span id="s1357">I’ll be 68 in March, she was 69 and a half when she had the brain hemorrage and she died.</span> <span id="s1358">She was not really sick, she wasn’t a sick person.</span> <span id="s1359">We just, something happened and she had that brain hemorrhage and she, in three days she was dead.</span> <span id="s1360">So she also always dreamed and, about her son that she didn’t, by the way my mother never got to see my brother, the one that was in Russia.</span> <span id="s1361">Never got to see him.</span> <span id="s1362">After she died, like a week later, we had a letter that he was let go and he would be coming to Israel.</span> <span id="s1363">She never lived to know that he would be free again.</span> <span id="s1364">Too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: That would be . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: That’s I always, always regretted, I said, I wished that letter would have come just one week earlier so she would have died knowing that he was free again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: I’m jumping around again but I was, I wondered if you had, if you would have had that, the bowl and spoon that I’m told that many people found it hard to give up carrying that with them, after liberation I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: Well I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1369">People don’t realize what that bowl and spoon meant.</span> <span id="s1370">That was your lifeline.</span> <span id="s1371">If many a times, if a soldier wanted to play around, he took and shot a bullet through your, through your bowl.</span> <span id="s1372">When you go to the museum and see holes in those bowls, you think oh those are old bowls.</span> <span id="s1373">If you look carefully many of them have precise holes where a bullet went through.</span> <span id="s1374">How did you eat?</span> <span id="s1375">You couldn’t throw this away and go get another bowl.</span> <span id="s1376">They didn’t, you couldn’t say, excuse me my bowl has a hole.</span> <span id="s1377">No such thing.</span> <span id="s1378">So that became your lifeline.</span> <span id="s1379">We watched that spoon and that bowl like, like, like the most precious thing in the world.</span> <span id="s1380">But as I told you, when I was taken to that hospital, everything, I don’t have anything, anything, anything, to show, or to share from that time.</span> <span id="s1381">See some people that were a little older maybe had the wisdom to save something.</span> <span id="s1382">Or even in the hospital to say, can I have back my bowl?</span> <span id="s1383">But I didn’t understand to say that.</span> <span id="s1384">So I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1385">I know some people that went back on a visit to Auschwitz, just in, ten years ago, five years ago and they were able to purchase there, they have like gift shops there where you can purchase things.</span> <span id="s1386">Just like a memorabilia, so they, they did that.</span> <span id="s1387">But like I have, I’m sure you heard my testimony about the money with the cat with the __________ document.</span> <span id="s1388">And I have a stupid little cat sittin’ there on my, on top of my china closet and many time people walk in, how come you have that stupid little cat sittin’ there?</span> <span id="s1389">But that is a symbol of my life.</span> <span id="s1390">But I did not have the wisdom at that time to save anything, so I didn’t, but I can understand that people didn’t want to give up that bowl and that, that spoon.</span> <span id="s1391">Honey if you gave up that, that spoon you could still manage without a spoon but that bowl, that food for, the dish for food, you were dead if you didn’t have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: You talked earlier about being numbed rather than being toughened and I suppose the, clinging to your bowl and spoon as a survival thing would be something that would be the natural thing to do and also I was thinking of how, in many other ways I’m sure, just as when you were in the barn and the guards had gone, you would be too close to death, too numbed to immediately realize what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Exactly, you, you really didn’t know what was happening to you from one minute to the other.</span> <span id="s1394">You didn’t know, even all through the ghetto, the, the traveling to the, the deportation, the concentration camp, the labor camp.</span> <span id="s1395">You never knew what, what was going to happen next.</span> <span id="s1396">Whether there, you went to work, you came back, you went to sleep, next day you could be dead.</span> <span id="s1397">They could kill you, they could take you to selection.</span> <span id="s1398">You, unpredictable.</span> <span id="s1399">And you just don’t know.</span> <span id="s1400">It’s like I say, I prayed, I prayed every night to live through the night and every day to live through the day.</span> <span id="s1401">You never knew.</span> <span id="s1402">Some people say why didn’t you run away?</span> <span id="s1403">To run away you need a place to run to.</span> <span id="s1404">My brother was lucky he had that friend to run to.</span> <span id="s1405">Nobody wanted me, I tried to run and, and, and people that tried to run many times, the neighbor said, here goes the Jew, shoot him.</span> <span id="s1406">Why did they do that?</span> <span id="s1407">So you become numb and you just pray to live through and if you have the, the, well it’s, it’s the animal in us that wants to live, survival.</span> <span id="s1408">This is the bottom line.</span> <span id="s1409">The bottom line, nobody wants to be dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Right and in fact, you were forced to live at an animal level.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: You, you spoke in your testimony about at least in the ghetto being fortunate in having plenty of water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1414">[talkover] We could bathe . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: In the ghetto we were, we, on the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s1417">There were wells, nobody could close the well there but in, I, I think I was a year without I took a bath.</span> <span id="s1418">Almost a year without taking a bath.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Can you imagine that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Well we, you, tell me what that would be like.</span> <span id="s1422">I mean your [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Well at the beginning, [talkover], you’re infested with lice all over.</span> <span id="s1424">You itch.</span> <span id="s1425">People are sitting there picking, like you see the monkeys in the tree picking from, from their bodies.</span> <span id="s1426">If you were with one of your family, maybe they were picking it out of your head like the monkeys sat there and pick.</span> <span id="s1427">If not, you sat and you picked your own.</span> <span id="s1428">You got infected from that.</span> <span id="s1429">That’s how we had this, those one typhoids, I don’t know which one, typhoid or typhus that comes from the lice.</span> <span id="s1430">It’s a infection like.</span> <span id="s1431">It, it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1432">I cannot believe now sometime I close my eyes and I think, I hope that was a dream.</span> <span id="s1433">Cannot, you cannot believe what things we went through.</span> <span id="s1434">I, I don’t remember if my originally testimony, you, you listened to that.</span> <span id="s1435">We were on the death march and we were sitting there so hungry, so hungry, so thirsty.</span> <span id="s1436">Women were eating a little bit snow, then all of a sudden I saw women were running to something in the snow so I ran too.</span> <span id="s1437">I didn’t even know what I was running for and that, there was some blobs in the snow and everybody grabbed a piece and I grabbed a piece and then we, so women were washing it in the snow, so I washed it in the snow.</span> <span id="s1438">What was inside?</span> <span id="s1439">It was manure for cow.</span> <span id="s1440">And when a cow eats, they, she doesn’t digest the grain.</span> <span id="s1441">So when they had straw, there was a little grain and the women said, “This is nourishment.</span> <span id="s1442">Let’s open those little grains, wash them in the snow and eat ‘em.”</span> <span id="s1443">And we ate ‘em.</span> <span id="s1444">Now if somebody on the outside would have looked on to us, they would say look at those animals!</span> <span id="s1445">Look what they’re doing!</span> <span id="s1446">But I think we did the most wonderful thing that there is to do in humanity.</span> <span id="s1447">God says if you save one life, it’s like you would have saved the whole world?</span> <span id="s1448">We saved our lives.</span> <span id="s1449">We did the most precious thing that there is although it looked terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Just as you would go for a couple of years, would it be without any water, without any bathing [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: In my case was about a year.</span> <span id="s1452">Because not even quite a year, from June til March.</span> <span id="s1453">Because when we came to Shtoodruff (ph) to the concentration camp, we had that bath.</span> <span id="s1454">And then we didn’t a bath no more until I had the disinfectant poured on me after liberation so let’s say eight, ten months, yeah?</span> <span id="s1455">Ten months without a bath.</span> <span id="s1456">They gave us a little black coffee, sometime we washed our hair with it.</span> <span id="s1457">Cause in my camp, they didn’t cut our hair when we came to Shtoodruff.</span> <span id="s1458">They would have done us a favor if they would’ve cut our hair.</span> <span id="s1459">But they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1460">So there you were head a hair, no scissor to chop it off and that’s a place where the, the, the first thing you get infected.</span> <span id="s1461">It, it was just terrible and the same little dress.</span> <span id="s1462">The only good thing which was a bad thing, we were in, in those, in those tents that everything was so cold that I think some of those lice died for the cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Tell me about your boots because as you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Yeah, about the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: Told your story . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: It seemed to me that . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: Yeah, I, I don’t know if I ever told that story [talkover] but when we came [talkover] how important they were.</span> <span id="s1469">When we came to Shtoodruff (ph) and we went through that shower so-called, and we stood outside for a long time naked and then we were given a dress, a pair of underpants, a pair of shoe.</span> <span id="s1470">They just threw it to us.</span> <span id="s1471">They didn’t say what size or whatever.</span> <span id="s1472">Somehow, usually as a rule, you didn’t get your own, any of your own clothing because they figured if you get something of your own maybe you have something sewn in or hidden but somehow our group of women got the same shoes.</span> <span id="s1473">How do I know that we got the same shoe?</span> <span id="s1474">I was, in my, what I was handed was a pair of like oxfords, like a woman’s pair of oxford.</span> <span id="s1475">Big, nice oxford.</span> <span id="s1476">I came wearing boots.</span> <span id="s1477">Why did I came with the boots?</span> <span id="s1478">Because there was a gold coin sewn into the boots and as we were being deported and we were not allowed to take along too much, my mother said, “Put on the boots.”</span> <span id="s1479">So you, so there, I see a woman, already we were settled in the camp.</span> <span id="s1480">After a few days went by and we were already in the barracks, I see a woman outside carrying my boots and she’s barefoot.</span> <span id="s1481">And I am carrying a pair of shoes that were very big on me.</span> <span id="s1482">And I’m barefoot.</span> <span id="s1483">I say oh, would I love to get my boots back.</span> <span id="s1484">But I figured if I’ll go and tell her it’s my boots, she’ll suspect that I have something in there so I didn’t say a thing I just kept on being around her.</span> <span id="s1485">She came over, she says, “Little girl, do me a favor.</span> <span id="s1486">Let’s exchange.</span> <span id="s1487">You have a little foot, those boots maybe will fit you.”</span> <span id="s1488">And I was smart, I said, “Who wants boots in the summer?”</span> <span id="s1489">She said, “Please, your shoes may fit me.</span> <span id="s1490">You don’t want an old lady to go around without, without shoes.”</span> <span id="s1491">And I exchanged with her.</span> <span id="s1492">And this is how I got my boots.</span> <span id="s1493">Now I put on those boots and I never took them off.</span> <span id="s1494">I kept them on my feet because of that stupid gold coin.</span> <span id="s1495">I was afraid somebody will steal my boots and I have this gold coin.</span> <span id="s1496">Now as I mentioned before, I was with my sister in law who was not really yet my sister in law, in the camp at that time together and she knew about this gold coin.</span> <span id="s1497">And I kept on asking her, she was seven years older than me, I said, “Laina (ph) what do you think?</span> <span id="s1498">Maybe we should exchange this, this gold coin and get some bread.”</span> <span id="s1499">And she said, “Let’s wait.</span> <span id="s1500">Times may become tougher.</span> <span id="s1501">Times may become tougher.”</span> <span id="s1502">Now I was liberated in, with those boots because when time became tougher, no one had extra bread to exchange for a coin.</span> <span id="s1503">So after I was taken to that so-called hospital, they had to actually cut off, cut up the boots to take off from my feet because my feet were frozen and almost like stuck to those boots.</span> <span id="s1504">Never saw that coin again.</span> <span id="s1505">And those boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Nesse, I wondered to what extent in the, during the war when you were wandering, you might say without your mother, do you remember getting strength from thinking about your old family life?</span> <span id="s1507">And I wondered to what extent that loving family, your mother was very charitable, I wondered to what extent that was sort of feeding your spirit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Not just thinking about your family but thinking about all this that there was.</span> <span id="s1509">I remember in those worst of times, this lady that, that wrapped my body in straw, this Mrs. Fivish (ph).</span> <span id="s1510">She used to sit down and say, “Let’s reminisce.</span> <span id="s1511">Let’s think of home.</span> <span id="s1512">Let’s think of our families.</span> <span id="s1513">Let’s think of the Sabbath and the candles,” and some women used say, “What you talking all this nonsense!”</span> <span id="s1514">She used to say, “If we don’t, if we stop thinking of what we had, we’ll lose everything.”</span> <span id="s1515">She was a very wise woman.</span> <span id="s1516">She, she’s, survived the Holocaust and I never saw her but she had __________ she was also in Russia and in Israel, she was very wise woman.</span> <span id="s1517">And she used to say, she always said, “Let’s dream, let’s hope.</span> <span id="s1518">If we give that up, then we don’t have anything left.”</span> <span id="s1519">And I think she was very smart by giving us younger people something to hope for.</span> <span id="s1520">She encouraged us all the time, she used to say, “Think of the good times, think of your mother, think of all that,” and this was really like a therapy.</span> <span id="s1521">Because even now when we live in time of counseling and therapy and people always tell you, if you have a problem, think of something wonderful.</span> <span id="s1522">I know, I had to have some surgery on my ankle, years ago, and the doctor said to me, “Think of flowers when you go to, when I put you to sleep so you’ll have a pleasant dream.”</span> <span id="s1523">So even in worse times, you need that hope.</span> <span id="s1524">You need that, something precious to hold onto, that you want it back and you hope for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Would you ever sing together or pray together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Yeah, oh, sing together all the time.</span> <span id="s1527">In the worst of time, we used to sit and, and, some people just say, “You crazy, you’re singing again.”</span> <span id="s1528">The, this lady, or this we used to say, “Well, let, let’s sing a little something of hope.</span> <span id="s1529">Let’s make a little prayer of something.”</span> <span id="s1530">Somebody else say, “Ah, what you praying, what you praying, nobody listens to you, you had all this.”</span> <span id="s1531">But we believed.</span> <span id="s1532">I believed.</span> <span id="s1533">I always thought that, when I was a little girl, I remember learning psalms, psalms that most people, today in Christian religions follow psalms and there is a psalm, I think it’s 112 or whatever, it says, and God created the heavens for heavenly bodies and the earth for, for the people on earth.</span> <span id="s1534">And I always used to think, the people on earth are bad but God will come with the heavenly bodies and stop those bad people from doing bad things.</span> <span id="s1535">I always hoped.</span> <span id="s1536">I really did.</span> <span id="s1537">I hoped until I saw those mountain of dead bodies at the very end.</span> <span id="s1538">All through I, I always thought, we’ll be free.</span> <span id="s1539">This will end.</span> <span id="s1540">This will end.</span> <span id="s1541">It cannot be forever.</span> <span id="s1542">So we used to sit and hope and pray.</span> <span id="s1543">I remember a, that year in the labor camp on Yom Kippur, you know Yom Kippur is our holiest of holidays and who knew it was Yom Kippur?</span> <span id="s1544">We didn’t even know it was, one lady said, “You know it’s Yom Kippur tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s1545">And people say how do you know?</span> <span id="s1546">She said she made some markers or whatever.</span> <span id="s1547">So we believe it’s Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1548">Now we were hungry, we were not eating anyway.</span> <span id="s1549">You had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1550">They said, “Let’s pray.”</span> <span id="s1551">Now nobody knew the prayers were Yom Kippur so people started to make prayers.</span> <span id="s1552">A prayer on bread, a prayer, any kind of prayer that they could think of, thank you God for the bread, thank you God for this, they, nobody really knew the Yom Kippur prayer.</span> <span id="s1553">But we prayed.</span> <span id="s1554">Never, never forget it and I remember people saying, don’t tell the Germans that’s Yom Kippur because every time when we had a holiday, they always came to kill people.</span> <span id="s1555">So we were very afraid they shouldn’t know it was Yom Kippur.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: Is there any song that you particularly remember?</span> <span id="s1557">I wondered if there’s anything you, do you sing?</span> <span id="s1558">Do you want to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Well I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s1560">I’m a very poor singer.</span> <span id="s1561">I love to sing and we have a song that, it’s called the Partisan Song that was created in one of the ghettos.</span> <span id="s1562">That it says, never say you’re going the last road.</span> <span id="s1563">It’s true that the clouds are covering the blue days but there will come a day to say we are here.</span> <span id="s1564">We are here.</span> <span id="s1565">Muzainundoor (ph).</span> <span id="s1566">Muzainundoor (ph).</span> <span id="s1567">Means we are here.</span> <span id="s1568">You, ask me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: What, what was a day like in Feldafing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Well it, in, a day in Feldafing, when we first came, as I said, we were very restricted.</span> <span id="s1571">We were not allowed to go out to the city, just a certain time.</span> <span id="s1572">We were not allowed to go take her, buy a, well we didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s1573">Maybe if we would’ve had money we could take, buy a ticket and go to town, to Munich.</span> <span id="s1574">At the beginning was not.</span> <span id="s1575">But later on, your life became pretty much good life.</span> <span id="s1576">You had your child, you had your mother, you had a husband, you okay, you didn’t have an apartment, you didn’t have, you couldn’t go into the store and shop or like we do now, three pair o’ shoes in one month.</span> <span id="s1577">But your life was pretty much scheduled.</span> <span id="s1578">The only thing that really was bad, you still didn’t know where you are.</span> <span id="s1579">You were a displaced person.</span> <span id="s1580">You were praying to belong to some country, somewhere, like with us.</span> <span id="s1581">We went for checkups, we thought we are leaving, no.</span> <span id="s1582">Again, our hope was up.</span> <span id="s1583">We think, we thought we were going.</span> <span id="s1584">No.</span> <span id="s1585">So all this was the uncertainty.</span> <span id="s1586">The uncertainty was going to, are you ever going to be able to leave the displaced person?</span> <span id="s1587">This hung over you.</span> <span id="s1588">But otherwise, human beings, young people fell in love.</span> <span id="s1589">People had children.</span> <span id="s1590">People I’m sure died.</span> <span id="s1591">People were born, people had weddings.</span> <span id="s1592">It, it became a pretty so-called in parentheses normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: It, it occurs to me that one of the things you wouldn’t have much of would be privacy.</span> <span id="s1594">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: No privacy, no, not really no privacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: But you know in fact, I would think that your mother became Jack’s mother too in a strange way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Oh, she, people, oh, everybody thought it was his mother.</span> <span id="s1598">Because we naturally asked, when I found her she was precious, but then if she started to tell me how to raise my kids or what to do, you open your mouth sometime.</span> <span id="s1599">And then you’re sorry but Jack, never opened his mouth to my mother.</span> <span id="s1600">Ma, ma, ma, ma, that’s all to, to respect, she, well naturally you didn’t have the privacy for husband and wife, but you see we managed to have two kids with my mother living with us in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1602">But there would be countless adjustments like that and things . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Yeah, naturally, naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: In your last months in Feldafing, the, the numbers of displaced persons there must have been dwindling.</span> <span id="s1605">Would you, would you have been there as others were leaving for new lives in Israel or Australia or Britain?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: I want to tell you, it was dwindling and it was not dwindling.</span> <span id="s1607">Because some other smaller camps were being eliminated so they brought from different, I forgot now from which camps, they brought people.</span> <span id="s1608">They resettled them to, to Feldafing.</span> <span id="s1609">Now this even this resettlement for Holocaust survivors is easy to go from one displaced person camp to another?</span> <span id="s1610">It was also tough.</span> <span id="s1611">Instead of taking a thousand people and shipping them off to the United States, did they have to ship them to another displaced person camp?</span> <span id="s1612">I, I’ve always thought of that.</span> <span id="s1613">I always thought, is United States so little that they don’t have room to take and there wasn’t many Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1614">But people were leaving, you were a little bit jealous when you saw people leaving.</span> <span id="s1615">Then you heard people were going to Israel on illegal immigration and some of them didn’t succeed and came back and there were different times even in the five years after the war, after the war ended.</span> <span id="s1616">It was different experiences.</span> <span id="s1617">But I’m really surprised that there isn’t more documentation on Feldafing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: How much, in your community there at Feldafing, how much discussion or how much frustration would there be because you’d suffered so much and still the world was not opening its arms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: That’s all people talked in Feldafing is when do we go, where do we go?</span> <span id="s1620">What country, maybe opportunity country and some people were looking.</span> <span id="s1621">We didn’t have money to pay off, some people said well, maybe if we would have money, we would hire a German lawyer or an American lawyer.</span> <span id="s1622">Somebody used to say well, somebody in the, in the United States consulate maybe could help you.</span> <span id="s1623">You tried to find somebody, somewhere that could help you.</span> <span id="s1624">That’s all people talked about: how to leave.</span> <span id="s1625">Nobody wanted to stay forever in displaced person camps.</span> <span id="s1626">This what I say many times when I hear that people that suffered want to keep on staying at the same spot.</span> <span id="s1627">I say that we Holocaust survivors did not want to say, stay in the same spot.</span> <span id="s1628">We wanted out of it.</span> <span id="s1629">Out of the displaced person camp, most of us.</span> <span id="s1630">Yes we have our memories, yes we’re not going to forget it.</span> <span id="s1631">But we went forward.</span> <span id="s1632">We went forward with our lives.</span> <span id="s1633">We had children, we made sure our children are educated.</span> <span id="s1634">We put a good name for ourselves in our communities, in our countries right where we are.</span> <span id="s1635">Wherever we are.</span> <span id="s1636">I don’t think you find among Holocaust survivors, people in jail.</span> <span id="s1637">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1638">I may be wrong but I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: How typical do you think you are in, despite what you suffered, being able it seems to move forward and to sort of focus on the joys in life?</span> <span id="s1640">Would, would it, would this experience have destroyed many people who’d be so, so hurt, have such a chip on their shoulder that they couldn’t move forward?</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: Unfortunately, unfortunately there are many survivors that cannot move forward.</span> <span id="s1642">And I understand, I understand it.</span> <span id="s1643">I tell you why, assuming, I would have been already 25 years old, I would have been married.</span> <span id="s1644">I would have had two, three children.</span> <span id="s1645">My husband, my children would have been killed and I had to start life all over again.</span> <span id="s1646">I don’t know if I would be like I am now.</span> <span id="s1647">I was part of my parents’ family.</span> <span id="s1648">I was lucky to have my mother survive the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1649">Through four years I was suffering one year all by myself, was lucky enough to have two brothers, I just had two brother, and both, they suffered but they survived.</span> <span id="s1650">So I always think that I cannot judge the people that cannot pick up their life and, and I have a friend.</span> <span id="s1651">She was lucky to find her husband but she had two children that were killed in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1652">She had a new child after the war, wonderful child, very devoted but that woman didn’t even dance at her own daughter’s wedding.</span> <span id="s1653">Cause she promised herself when her children were killed that she’ll never dance again.</span> <span id="s1654">So it, at her own daughter’s wedding, she didn’t dance.</span> <span id="s1655">Now can you blame her?</span> <span id="s1656">Can you say she’s, something wrong with her?</span> <span id="s1657">No.</span> <span id="s1658">Yes there are many survivors like me that, most of us, I think, without counseling, we picked ourselves up, we found a spot in the community.</span> <span id="s1659">We chose to use our suffering to teach others a little more love, a little more compassion, a little more understanding.</span> <span id="s1660">We’re not throwing our memories, we keeping them.</span> <span id="s1661">We using them for a purpose.</span> <span id="s1662">For a purpose to remember the dead within our Jewish tradition and to teach the young, teach the young what can happen if we allow hatred in our hearts.</span> <span id="s1663">And this is . . .</span></p> <p><span
