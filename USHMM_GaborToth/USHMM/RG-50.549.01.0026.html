And hardly got to know my father because he died, to some degree as a result of World War I, in 1919 when I was hardly six years old.</span> <span id="s12">I lived in the village and went to the grammar school, which then was an all-Jewish school.</span> <span id="s13">Which is interesting because the town, the little villages around Nuremberg had become centers of Jewish life when Nuremberg was not, I mean it was no longer permissible to live in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s14">Nuremberg was one of the so-called principal cities and it was only, I believe, in the middle of the 19th century or early 19th century that the Jews were again allowed to live in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s15">And that is, at that time, when the Jews began to leave these small villages.</span> <span id="s16">When I grew up, the village had a total population of probably 1,200 and a Jewish population of maybe ten families, enough to have a so-called Minion (ph).</span> <span id="s17">But it wasn't long, and I would say it was in my third year of grammar school, that the Jewish community could no longer afford to have the Jewish teacher and also he had doubled as a Huss-in (ph).</span> <span id="s18">A Huss-in (ph) is who holds the prayers on Saturdays and Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s19">Then the Jewish kids were being transferred to the so-called government school, which was in the main, a Protestant school.</span> <span id="s20">We also had a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s21">And I went to, I attended the government school for a period of two years and then, because of the lack of better educational facilities in the village, I moved to a so-called ______________, a boarding house in Nuremberg and from there went to High School.</span> <span id="s22">That for a period of six years.</span> <span id="s23">Thereafter, I took a job.</span> <span id="s24">It is well to mention that on weekends, when I started to work, I would visit my mother and Aunts who lived in the village, twenty-three kilometers away.</span> <span id="s25">Anti-Semitism began to become noticeable.</span> <span id="s26">And I never forget an incident.</span> <span id="s27">Nuremberg had a deep, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s28">______________.</span> <span id="s29">A fortification.</span> <span id="s30">And we played soccer there.</span> <span id="s31">And one guy with a hammer and sickle on his cap came to assist us to, to ward off a bunch of Nazi kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Do you know when this would have been or how old you were then?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s34">I was 11 years old and that would have been in 1924.</span> <span id="s35">Shall I . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Let me ask you about that incident.</span> <span id="s37">Do you remember what the provocation was?</span> <span id="s38">How do you know they were Nazi sympathizers?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: There was no provocation on our part.</span> <span id="s40">It was simply an attack on the part of these Nazi kids who recognized us as being Jewish.</span> <span id="s41">And they stormed upon us and tried to beat us up.</span> <span id="s42">But this lonely Communist beat them off and it's an experience which I will never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: How did you know that they were Nazi kids?</span> <span id="s44">Were they wearing anything?</span> <span id="s45">Did they say something?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: They wore swastikas and they called us dirty Jews, etceteras.</span> <span id="s47">Now the Nazism in certain schools was so strong that it was necessary for the Director of the boarding house to have me transferred to a school that was less stigmatized and coincidentally, the school from which I had to be transferred was near the courthouse in Nuremberg where ultimately the War Crimes Trials took place.</span> <span id="s48">It's, there are so many things that are unusual coincidences in my life, that some, that was in 1924, and I interrogated the Chief of Staff of the German Army, Ky-kle (ph), in 1945.</span> <span id="s49">And he had to get up and salute me.</span> <span id="s50">Also one of the many unforgettable incidences.</span> <span id="s51">To bring us more up to date, beyond the period of time that I had gone to school, and when I started to work for a company in Nuremberg and that was in 1930.</span> <span id="s52">And it was from then on that I would regularly visit my mother on weekends.</span> <span id="s53">This brings us to the time when the Nazi propaganda began to become extremely aggressive and particularly then, in the year 1932, when in spite of the enormous propaganda that was being put over the German people, Hitler's popularity began to shrink.</span> <span id="s54">And there were two elections.</span> <span id="s55">One was in the summer of 1932 and one was in the fall of 1932.</span> <span id="s56">And particularly the election in the fall of 1932 reflected a decrease in the popularity of Hitler.</span> <span id="s57">Which ultimately then, on January 30th, 1933 led to Hindenberg's decision to appoint Hitler Chancellor of Germany.</span> <span id="s58">It was followed up by another election, at the beginning of March of 1933.</span> <span id="s59">Which Hitler won only in combination with all the other parties other than the Social Democrats and the Communists.</span> <span id="s60">And it was so deeply unfortunate that these two left wing parties had failed to really create one common front.</span> <span id="s61">History would have been different, at least my belief.</span> <span id="s62">After the election, when Hitler considered himself in sole power of Germany, then the wave of Anti-Semitism was enormously increased and this was the time when already Jewish stores were being pilfered or destroyed.</span> <span id="s63">And it ultimately led to a very important, personal incident.</span> <span id="s64">On one of the visits in the middle of March to my mother's house, I was hardly at home, when there was a knock on the door and a policeman, the local gendarme, came into our living room and said, "Mr. Schnaittacher, I would like to see you at the police station."</span> <span id="s65">When I arrived at the police station, he very briskly told me that I was under arrest.</span> <span id="s66">And again, it was one of these painful, painful moments when I had to call up my mother, who had a severe cold, and I had to tell her, "Mother, I'm under arrest."</span> <span id="s67">Well, she was shrieking and she came storming out to the police station protesting that a War widow should be treated like this without any reason whatsoever, but obviously it did not do any good.</span> <span id="s68">My village was too small to have a prison of it's own and so I was transported to the County seat of Earl-la-len (ph) where I then, as dusk began to settle, was put into a cell in the police prison.</span> <span id="s69">And I was being welcomed by four or five other prisoners who had already been in there, as a result of having been anti-Nazis, not Jewish, but anti-Nazis.</span> <span id="s70">Shall I continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s72">But I'm curious about a couple of things.</span> <span id="s73">One, was there, did you have any hint when you were taken in, why you were taken in?</span> <span id="s74">You were living in Nuremberg at the time that you were arrested in your hometown of Forth, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: How does that happen?</span> <span id="s77">Did you have any sense of why?</span> <span id="s78">How they would even have known of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: No.</span> <span id="s80">I had no idea why I was being arrested.</span> <span id="s81">However, as I was turned over to the warden of the prison, I requested information.</span> <span id="s82">Why I was here.</span> <span id="s83">And he then, either that night or the following morning, gave me a slip of paper which indicated that I was arrested because of having agitated against the National Socialist Government because of knowledge of secret ammunition depots and liaison of illegal anti-Nazi organizations.</span> <span id="s84">Now, actually, yes I was an anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s85">I was no longer involved in anti-Nazi activities.</span> <span id="s86">So the actual reason was to provide the local populace of the village with a degree of satisfaction, to have me arrested as a Jew.</span> <span id="s87">And another cousin of mine who was the only other young male Jew in the village.</span> <span id="s88">And it was quite an experience.</span> <span id="s89">As I was given the easiest job in the prison, and that was to fill, we didn't have running water in the cells, but each one of us would get a water pitcher.</span> <span id="s90">And it was my job to fill the water basins that we used to wash ourselves with.</span> <span id="s91">And to fill these pitchers with water.</span> <span id="s92">And in doing so, I turned around and there sits my cousin in the adjoining cell.</span> <span id="s93">Well we had a very friendly greeting, and surprising so.</span> <span id="s94">The moment that I had gotten into prison my mother did not rest for a minute and pursued every possible approach in order to have me liberated, as well as my cousin.</span> <span id="s95">And then followed some six weeks later and I was, which would make it the beginning of May, and, no, it made it the end of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Of 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: When I was released from prison, my cousin as well.</span> <span id="s98">And I was on parole for two months, which meant that I had to report to a police station every other day.</span> <span id="s99">Shall I continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Let me take you back just a little bit.</span> <span id="s101">You mentioned that you were an anti-Nazi but weren't involved in anti-Nazi activities.</span> <span id="s102">What did it mean to you at that time, or what kind of activities had you been involved in?</span> <span id="s103">What was sort of the culture of anti-Nazism where you were living, when you were I guess about 20 years old?</span> <span id="s104">With your friends?</span> <span id="s105">What were you talking about?</span> <span id="s106">What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Well we would have seminars to gain an understanding of what it would mean, of what Nazism meant and what it meant not only to the Jews but the people at large.</span> <span id="s108">The total oppression of several areas and after all, when, I want to be sure that is right.</span> <span id="s109">When Germany finally collapsed there were over 300,000 non-Jewish prisoners in concentration camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s110">And the anti-Nazi forces were, they were primarily the Social Democrats and the Communists.</span> <span id="s111">And who really fought Hitler physically and with all the idealism and principal and firmness possible.</span> <span id="s112">But I had the opportunity, after I was released not only from prison but from the parole, to travel as a salesman within limited scope.</span> <span id="s113">Not by car but by train.</span> <span id="s114">And I never forget that some very simple people who had taken the same train I did in the vicinity of Munich, that they expressed without fear when they recognized me as a Jew, that Hitler is the enemy of all of Germany.</span> <span id="s115">By the way, I failed to, when I corrected myself before with regard to the time that I left prison.</span> <span id="s116">And because of the danger of again being re-arrested in Nuremberg, I left Nuremberg and moved with an Uncle of mine in Munich.</span> <span id="s117">And it was May 1st, 1933.</span> <span id="s118">The reason that I am pointing out in this very interesting coincidence, I came back to Munich on May 1st, 1945, as the conquering American soldier after having liberated Dachau.</span> <span id="s119">I'm not speaking of myself but my regiment, my division, and it was to be sure one of the greatest moments in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: You mentioned that you were afraid in Nuremberg, that you would be re-arrested.</span> <span id="s121">Was there a sense that they were watching you?</span> <span id="s122">It seems that if they arrested you when you went home and you didn't live there, they must have somehow known you were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Well, yes, there was the fear that one could be re-arrested and then it would not have been a police prison but it would have meant to be sent to the concentration camp of Dachau.</span> <span id="s124">Now Dachau at that time was not an extermination camp but it was a camp of terror.</span> <span id="s125">And personally violent persecution.</span> <span id="s126">At that time the, a few friends of mine were shot in Dachau.</span> <span id="s127">And the proverb, if you can call it that, was created: shot while attempting to escape.</span> <span id="s128">Now, so I lived in Germany having been relieved from the duty to report to police stations, and I had the goal, as soon as possible, as early as possible, to be able to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s129">And particularly so because on a visit to Nuremberg, not to my village, I had arranged, my mother had arranged to meet me in Nuremberg in order to spend a pleasant weekend together.</span> <span id="s130">When she came home from that visit, she was ordered by the Mayor of the village to come to the village counsel and she was told, Mrs. Schnaittacher, if you have been here today, during the day or yesterday, we would have arrested you.</span> <span id="s131">We give you the opportunity to defend yourself.</span> <span id="s132">My mother had been extremely courageous and she screamed at them that if they wanted to arrest her, they should do so right now because the following day she was going to leave the area to live with her mother.</span> <span id="s133">And that's what she did.</span> <span id="s134">And that, the _________, the precarious actions of my mother, and my Uncles and Aunts, was my never-ending burden and sorrow here.</span> <span id="s135">I had, and that is, goes for so many of the refugees.</span> <span id="s136">We had an interesting, rewarding time here.</span> <span id="s137">Cost of living was extremely low and even though I only earned at the beginning $13.00 a week, it was fully adequate to keep me alive.</span> <span id="s138">And to enable me on weekends to go hiking and we had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s139">It is interesting to note that this now is the late fall of 1933.</span> <span id="s140">My brother had lived here already.</span> <span id="s141">He came, not because of the Nazis, in 1929 at the behest of an Uncle of mine, who lived here, had lived here for some years and had a going business and was not married and therefore didn't have any other children.</span> <span id="s142">And my brother entered his business and later on I joined him.</span> <span id="s143">We lived in the utmost of comfort, earning $13.00, $15.00, $17.00 a week.</span> <span id="s144">On 96th Street and Western Avenue.</span> <span id="s145">Across the street from the, what's the name of the hotel?</span> <span id="s146">The Hotel Paris, which had a swimming pool and we could go swimming every night, for 25 cents.</span> <span id="s147">And it was really a wonderful way of living.</span> <span id="s148">Burdened only by our concern for our _________ in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Can I ask you, before you came over, you sound like you were quite close with your mother, were you having conversations with her about whether you should go?</span> <span id="s150">Did she give you any advice about the climate in Germany and how that should effect your decision to, did you talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes indeed.</span> <span id="s152">There was my mother, two spinster Aunts on my father's side.</span> <span id="s153">There were two brothers of my mother's who were married.</span> <span id="s154">And one of them had three children.</span> <span id="s155">And my mother insisted that I should leave as soon as possible after I was able to get a visa.</span> <span id="s156">And I left with a great deal of reticence because of leaving my mother over there, but she promised that she would visit me.</span> <span id="s157">And indeed she did the following year.</span> <span id="s158">And stayed in America for over six months.</span> <span id="s159">Then because of her love for her mother and the feeling of obligation that she had for her, she came back to Germany in order to take care of her mother.</span> <span id="s160">And it was then, only after the Crystalnaught (ph), after my mother suffered a nervous breakdown, that she and her mother, and Uncles and Aunts and cousins, all ultimately were brought over here.</span> <span id="s161">So we were extremely fortunate that we didn't lose anybody in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">[End of Side 1 of Tape 1]</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: It was that they hadn't lost anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Right.</span> <span id="s165">So this brings us up to 1939.</span> <span id="s166">And when my mother was the first member of the family after myself to then come back in order to remain here.</span> <span id="s167">And we had a small apartment on Western Avenue and 80th Street.</span> <span id="s168">And then we, where some cousins had lived, and myself.</span> <span id="s169">And when my mother came, we rented, no, first she stayed with my Uncle, and then later on when her mother came as well, we rented an apartment on 151st Street and Broadway.</span> <span id="s170">Which is the southern part of Washington Heights.</span> <span id="s171">And at that time it was just a wonderful neighborhood.</span> <span id="s172">You never, day or night, you would never fear of any attack or of any incident.</span> <span id="s173">And so my brother, who by then had gotten married and his wife was pregnant, and I, and my mother and grandmother, we lived in a five room apartment.</span> <span id="s174">And then, when other Uncles and Aunts came, we just doubled up.</span> <span id="s175">There was never any complaint.</span> <span id="s176">There was only the utmost of happiness, to have succeeded in bringing our relatives out of Germany.</span> <span id="s177">And even as far as, which is of some significance with regard to the question that has been raised, the integration of refugees into American life.</span> <span id="s178">There was an Aunt of mine who then was in her late 30's or early 40's, and she didn't have any children.</span> <span id="s179">And she and her husband, through another friend of theirs, started to pull threads out of pieces of cloth in order to separate them.</span> <span id="s180">And they started to do that in our dining room.</span> <span id="s181">And from there they developed a business where ultimately they employed some forty people on 26th Street and Broadway.</span> <span id="s182">And when my Uncle and Aunt ultimately died, they took care of their nieces and nephews, not having had any children of their own.</span> <span id="s183">And that went for ever so many of the people, that no job was low enough as long as they were able to sustain themselves.</span> <span id="s184">Whether young women that worked in households, or in factory jobs, notwithstanding, very good educations.</span> <span id="s185">And this, I think, is one of the unique aspects of this immigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Can I ask you, did your mother and Uncles and Aunts talk much about their experience in Germany after you left, in the years leading up to the time that they _________?</span> <span id="s187">What did they tell you about what was going on and what their experiences were?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Well that's a very good question because it leads me to one of the most satisfying experiences that I had.</span> <span id="s189">As I had mentioned early, I had worked for my Uncle who had a wholesale business of glassware and chinaware located in Munich.</span> <span id="s190">And when he came over here, he told me the following story.</span> <span id="s191">When he approached as it was customary his place of business on the morning of the Crystalnaught (ph), the manager of the business, not Jewish, to whom I had been reported when I worked for him, was standing at the entrance to this business in the uniform of a storm trooper, and said, "Jews are not allowed here."</span> <span id="s192">And my Uncle did not protest because he recognized the threat that was behind him and he turned around, went home, and within a few hours a Nazi knocked on his door and arrested him and took him to Dachau.</span> <span id="s193">And the same thing happened to his brother, who lived some hundreds of miles away from where he lived.</span> <span id="s194">So my two Uncles were taken to the concentration camp and that was in November 1938.</span> <span id="s195">And finally they were able to get out in January of, I believe January of 1939.</span> <span id="s196">The Uncle with whom I had lived, the one who had lived in Munich, because of the totally inadequate clothing that they received in Dachau, suffered severe circulatory problems and that’s what he died from some years later.</span> <span id="s197">But this is the story that he told me.</span> <span id="s198">So now, we go back, or we advance to the year 1945.</span> <span id="s199">Fritz, as a member of the 157th Regiment of the 45th Division, contributed to the conquest of Munich.</span> <span id="s200">And as soon as I had the time to follow up on this story which I told you, I went into my Uncle's place of business which had been bombed out, but people were there.</span> <span id="s201">And I inquired for the name of Hermann.</span> <span id="s202">Hermann was the name of the fellow who had been the manager of my Uncle's business, who was responsible for sending him back home and having him arrested and taken to Dachau.</span> <span id="s203">And so this is now May 1945.</span> <span id="s204">And I finally got information as to where Hermann lived.</span> <span id="s205">And I had the deep, deep satisfaction of locating him, having been an officer I had the privilege of a jeep, and I drove out there.</span> <span id="s206">And people gleefully would point in the direction where Hermann lived.</span> <span id="s207">And there he was.</span> <span id="s208">I recognized him at once.</span> <span id="s209">And he just wore pants and long johns.</span> <span id="s210">And I told him in a not too friendly a manner that he should get dressed.</span> <span id="s211">He didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s212">His wife and daughter protested vehemently.</span> <span id="s213">And I took him to the CIC Headquarters in Munich where I interrogated him.</span> <span id="s214">And fortunately for me, because here I was on a war of my own, and which was not allowed, but I found out that he had been the guard in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s215">Which made him subject to automatic arrest.</span> <span id="s216">Eisenhower had declared the so-called automatic arrest category and you as an American soldier could arrest anybody who was guilty of certain crimes, such as having been the guard at a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s217">I didn't tell him who I was until I finished the interrogation and I said, "Do you know who I am?"</span> <span id="s218">And he said, "No."</span> <span id="s219">I said, "My name is Schnaittacher."</span> <span id="s220">So he said, "But you should know how much I did for your Uncle."</span> <span id="s221">So I said, "Yes, indeed, I do know."</span> <span id="s222">And with that I turned him over to the CIC, who were less humane than I was and at least he was put away in prison for some months.</span> <span id="s223">The uniqueness of my war experience, I don't know whether, should we talk about that now?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Let me ask you one thing.</span> <span id="s225">Did you Uncles, who were now in America living with you, did they talk about their experience in Dachau?</span> <span id="s226">Did they explain what had happened, what it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s228">They weren't beaten at that time, yet.</span> <span id="s229">But there was totally inadequate food.</span> <span id="s230">No heating.</span> <span id="s231">And inadequate dress.</span> <span id="s232">That is what is uppermost in my mind from what I remember.</span> <span id="s233">My Dad, keeping in mind your possible interest in our integration in American life, that this was also the period of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.</span> <span id="s234">And most of us, of course, or all of us, were most sympathetic to the role of the Republican government in fighting Franco.</span> <span id="s235">And certainly, ultimately, in fighting Mussolini and Hitler.</span> <span id="s236">And we participated in the collection of funds to support the International Brigade and to render, I'm reluctant to say every possible support because we could have volunteered to go to Spain, which I didn't and very few of us did, if any.</span> <span id="s237">Now of some significance to my life and the lives of my relatives and my mother, I had become involved in Uncle's business.</span> <span id="s238">And of course it was my proud attempt to support as much as possible my mother, my grandmother, my Uncles and Aunts who didn't make a living of their own at the beginning.</span> <span id="s239">And ultimately they did.</span> <span id="s240">And my mother kept house.</span> <span id="s241">And then I had to assume much greater responsibility because my Uncle died.</span> <span id="s242">And so my brother and I became heirs, only to some degree because we had two cousins who, or three cousins, who shared in the estate in equal shares.</span> <span id="s243">Then we became involved in the war.</span> <span id="s244">The company that I was with produced medical supplies, which were being used in the war.</span> <span id="s245">And most important I met the girl who ultimately I was going to marry.</span> <span id="s246">Her father shared office space with me.</span> <span id="s247">And at a Christmas party, 1941, I recognized, and I told my mother, that that was the girl I was going to marry.</span> <span id="s248">And it was only two and a half months later, two months later, that we got married.</span> <span id="s249">And yes, all the relatives raised their eyebrows and counted the days.</span> <span id="s250">But nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Was she also a refugee?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: No.</span> <span id="s253">Her father had emigrated from Russia around 1900.</span> <span id="s254">Her mother was born here.</span> <span id="s255">And then I was drafted in May of 1942.</span> <span id="s256">And I went AWOL, do you know what that means?</span> <span id="s257">I went AWOL very early on when Dottie visited me in Fort Dix, and we spent the night together.</span> <span id="s258">Then shortly after basic training, which I took in Cancroft (ph), South Carolina, Dottie joined me with a small weekend release.</span> <span id="s259">And it grew to the point where we had a steamer truck and a dog and we separated when I was flown over to Germany, not to Germany, first to Africa, in July of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: So you had been in training for about two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Well the training, after basic training, I was transferred and Dottie joined me, to Florida, to an Ordinance Camp.</span> <span id="s262">And then I applied for OCS and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: OCS being?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Officers Candidate School.</span> <span id="s265">From which I graduated in the spring of 1943.</span> <span id="s266">And then there was an excess of officers so we were being trained in the cooks and bakers school and in an Ordinance Camp, and we traveled from the East Coast to the West Coast.</span> <span id="s267">Until January or February of 1944, when Dottie's brother was killed as a Marine flyer, he was in training in carrier landings.</span> <span id="s268">And I think that probably was February or March of 1944, or February.</span> <span id="s269">And then I was sent to Intelligence Training Schools and ultimately my main effort was the interrogation of prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s270">So in July of 1944, Dottie and I separated.</span> <span id="s271">She went back to New York and I was flown to Italy via Africa.</span> <span id="s272">And in order to participate in the landing in Southern France on August 15, 1944.</span> <span id="s273">And that's where I joined the 157th Regiment and my buddy, Fritzi, who was a Master Sargent, and I had a small intelligence team consisting of Fritzi and a Staff Sargent by the name of Al Magertle (ph), from the Middle West.</span> <span id="s274">And after landing in Southern France and moving quickly up to the vicinity of the Borsch-Mums (ph) where we arrived in early December or late November, in a small town by the name of ________________.</span> <span id="s275">And we were stuck there until we started our offensive that was really thought to end the war.</span> <span id="s276">And that was about March 15, 1945.</span> <span id="s277">Now from then on, or within a week thereafter, there was hardly a town or village that was of significance to my family or myself, that we didn't conquer.</span> <span id="s278">The first experience of this kind was the town of Ah-shaf-en-berg (ph), which is about 100 kilometers from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s279">But the Aunt that I had mentioned earlier, she had originated from Ah-shaf-en-berg (ph).</span> <span id="s280">And I had attended her wedding in 1923 or 1924.</span> <span id="s281">And I, together with Fritzi, as interrogators, accepted the surrender of this town.</span> <span id="s282">And then had some unique experiences in bringing about the surrender of more German outfits by apprehending the fortress commander, putting him in our jeep, and wherever we went, he said, put your arms down.</span> <span id="s283">A unique little story was some days later, when we were approaching a beautiful, mid-evil town, Bumberg (ph), where I had four prisoners in front of me.</span> <span id="s284">And one of them stepped out and said, "Lieutenant, didn't we go to school together?"</span> <span id="s285">And I lifted his helmet, recognized him at once, and said, "Yes, Lesline (ph)."</span> <span id="s286">Lesline (ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s287">"We did."</span> <span id="s288">And he said, "Fritz, let me go home."</span> <span id="s289">I said, "I can't."</span> <span id="s290">If we have time, I could tell a very humorous story which happened the following day.</span> <span id="s291">We had taken Bumberg (ph) and we had probably about 500 prisoners in a churchyard.</span> <span id="s292">We had more information than they did, there was hardly any purpose in interrogating any of them.</span> <span id="s293">I just walked around to hear their voices, to hear what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s294">And out of these hundreds, one of them came up to me, he saluted, and said, "Lieutenant, I come from a village not far from here.</span> <span id="s295">Couldn't you let me go home?"</span> <span id="s296">So I said, "Why, where do you come from?"</span> <span id="s297">He said, "I come from Forth."</span> <span id="s298">Forth is my village, where I knew everybody.</span> <span id="s299">Where I knew every house number.</span> <span id="s300">We didn't have cobblestones, we only had dirt roads.</span> <span id="s301">And I said to him, "But you weren't born in Forth?"</span> <span id="s302">He said, "No."</span> <span id="s303">I said, "How come that you lived in Forth?"</span> <span id="s304">He said, "Because I married a girl from Forth."</span> <span id="s305">I said, "Whom did you marry?"</span> <span id="s306">He said, "Gunta Hause (ph)."</span> <span id="s307">I said, "Gunta Hause (ph)?</span> <span id="s308">She lived in House Number 35."</span> <span id="s309">He said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s310">And I said, "And that's two houses from the little fire house and three houses from the Protestant Church and the ministries, and if you looked across the street there was House Number 52."</span> <span id="s311">And his pupils grew wider and wider, he said, "If American Intelligence has all this information how can we win the war?"</span> <span id="s312">So now you know how we won the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Was it just a coincidence that you were assigned to this division that was in that part of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Entirely.</span> <span id="s315">Entirely coincidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: That must have seemed very strange to you, I would think?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: And a few days later we took Schnaittacher, after which I'm named.</span> <span id="s318">And I visited in the cemetery where my father is buried.</span> <span id="s319">And then two days later we took Nuremberg where I went to school.</span> <span id="s320">And I interrogated the Commander of the town of Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s321">And then we moved on across the Danube and we came to the vicinity of Dachau.</span> <span id="s322">And ultimately liberated Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Let me stop you before we go into that.</span> <span id="s324">When you were talking about the interrogations, what would you be asking them?</span> <span id="s325">What do you remember about the interrogations themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s327">You never ask a question that can be answered yes or no.</span> <span id="s328">You want information and, by and large, what we were interested in was the strength of the opposing forces.</span> <span id="s329">Maybe some names because they would help us in further interrogations.</span> <span id="s330">Gun positions.</span> <span id="s331">Location of mines.</span> <span id="s332">Their plan.</span> <span id="s333">And what I did forget, and what I was being decorated for, on March 15, 1945, we, one of our companies took one of the deep bunkers, fortifications, and as they went in and picked up the telephone, they heard voices but couldn't make out what was being said.</span> <span id="s334">So my Regimental S2, Intelligence Officer, said, "This is beyond the call of duty, but if you want to go up, we would appreciate it.</span> <span id="s335">See what you can make out."</span> <span id="s336">And Fritzi and I, we went up and it was a lively night.</span> <span id="s337">There was a lot of fire . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s338">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: From the moment that I picked up the phone.</span> <span id="s341">If I would have prepared myself in raising questions, I couldn't have done better than the two people who were talking to each other.</span> <span id="s342">One, they were from two German divisions, different divisions.</span> <span id="s343">And one of them gave information such as, that they were leaving the following day in order to move in a certain direction giving coordinates.</span> <span id="s344">And that they were going to establish their ammunition depot at such-and-such coordinates.</span> <span id="s345">A fuel depot at such-and-such coordinates.</span> <span id="s346">If I really would have asked these questions, I couldn't have done any better.</span> <span id="s347">And because we didn't introduce, we didn't make any noise.</span> <span id="s348">We let them talk.</span> <span id="s349">And only at the very end did I try and make an effort to establish contact without indicating who I was, but our voice didn't go through.</span> <span id="s350">So we reported back to the battalion headquarters and he was not interested in this information.</span> <span id="s351">But regimental headquarters was and they recorded our findings, our information to division headquarters and then they send up night fighters and the following day, not only because of the information that we brought, but other information as well, we were able to break through the German lines and advance by over 35 kilometers or miles.</span> <span id="s352">And for that I received the Bronze Star.</span> <span id="s353">And Fritzi received a Bronze Star with clusters because he already had one.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: What was your experience with your fellow soldiers?</span> <span id="s355">I don't know, how many people in your position would there have been, of German/Jewish refugees who were now part of the American army?</span> <span id="s356">Was it a common thing or was it sort of unusual?</span> <span id="s357">How did they treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: It was quite common in that the U.S. Army trained people who had a intimate knowledge of the language and even of dialects and geography.</span> <span id="s359">And the school was in Cambridgy, (ph) Maryland.</span> <span id="s360">That's where the military intelligence training school was and you could be trained, not only as an interrogator, but also in aerial photography and many different aspects of military intelligence.</span> <span id="s361">Of course we thought that our particular branch was the most successful one.</span> <span id="s362">I mentioned we liberated Dachau and one of the gruesome experiences was when I was suppose to interrogate a Brigadier General who claimed that he was transferred against his wishes to the ___________, the army, instead of . . . no, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s363">That he was transferred against his wishes to the SS from the Army where he had served.</span> <span id="s364">And he was, quote, on a rest and recuperation leave.</span> <span id="s365">In Dachau, that's some fine place for a rest and recuperation, and he had come from Dachau, er, from Auschwitz, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s366">And he said, "Now, Lieutenant, if you are enraged as to what you see here in Dachau, here you see a few bodies.</span> <span id="s367">There you would have seen mountains."</span> <span id="s368">And the physically, the worst sight were the freight trains, which were filled with people who had starved to death.</span> <span id="s369">I have some pictures, which I'll be glad to turn over.</span> <span id="s370">Well, the war active combat didn't last much longer and I was then being transferred to a camp near Ludwigsberg (ph), which housed a lot of the automatic arrestees and I had to interrogate them.</span> <span id="s371">And then I was transferred to the War Crimes Commission.</span> <span id="s372">First, near Frankfurt where we were to review the archives of the German Army High Command.</span> <span id="s373">Particularly, my, and the guys who were working with me, my responsibility was to try and find material that was of significance to Yon Mar-shot (ph) who was the economic czar under Hitler.</span> <span id="s374">Unfortunately, we didn't find much.</span> <span id="s375">Or we didn't find anything that was of significance.</span> <span id="s376">During this period of time, whenever I had the opportunity to go back to the village where I had come from, as long as it didn't interfere with the obligations that I had, I would do so.</span> <span id="s377">And this is also a whole chain of unusual coincidences.</span> <span id="s378">It was the first time that I came back to my village.</span> <span id="s379">The village that I was born in, my regiment did not conquer.</span> <span id="s380">It was an engineering company that served the same division as my regiment did.</span> <span id="s381">But I didn't get through there, so it was in June of 1945 that I was able to pay my first visit.</span> <span id="s382">And as I approached the village, as I approached the house that I was born in, shutters began to open and I heard voices saying, Fritz is back, Fritz is back.</span> <span id="s383">I came to my house.</span> <span id="s384">I knocked on the door and a young girl looked down from the room where I was born in.</span> <span id="s385">And you could hear her knees shake because those were the days when an American soldier would knock on the door of somebody, the Germans would be terribly fearful of what could happen.</span> <span id="s386">I didn't recognize her and I asked for her father to come down.</span> <span id="s387">And he too was shaking, until he recognized me and I recognized him.</span> <span id="s388">And he had been a very decent guy, a very strong anti-Nazi and so I said to him, "You can stay in my house.</span> <span id="s389">But tonight my driver and I want to sleep in the adjoining room."</span> <span id="s390">Which he, of course, gladly arranged for us.</span> <span id="s391">And then I drove to the other end of the village because my mother had had a driver who was a radical anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s392">And he himself had served as a prisoner in the concentration camp of Dachau for some months.</span> <span id="s393">And I wanted to see him and, if possible, help him with money or whatever I could do for him.</span> <span id="s394">He had been, he had become a prisoner of war so he wasn't back yet, but his wife was back and I helped her out with some money.</span> <span id="s395">And then I drove back to my house and by then, as coincidence would have it, that the gendarme who had arrested me in 1933 was there to welcome me back.</span> <span id="s396">Of course, I didn't shake his hand and he had, I didn't hold it against him because he had acted on orders, which he couldn't refute in 1933.</span> <span id="s397">Then I drove the following day, no, I ordered the gendarme to bring to me the Mayor and to bring to me other people whom I had suspected that they had removed the last few Jews and had sent them to Dachau, or to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s398">And so the Mayor came and I ordered the Mayor to give instructions to the town crier that all Jewish property that they had stolen should be brought back to the Mayor's office.</span> <span id="s399">Nothing came.</span> <span id="s400">Then I drove to Schnaittacher in order to visit my father's grave and to instruct the Mayor of Schnaittacher to repair the cemetery because many of the gravestones had been used for construction purposes.</span> <span id="s401">And again I drove back to my village and apprehended a guy who definitely had been involved in the Chrystalnaught (ph).</span> <span id="s402">And I turned him over to the CIC.</span> <span id="s403">So at least I found that I had fulfilled some deep, deep wishes of revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Well tell me about that.</span> <span id="s405">What was going through your head as you were doing these things?</span> <span id="s406">What was the motivation for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Revenge.</span> <span id="s408">Deep, heart-felt revenge.</span> <span id="s409">These bastards, without any justification, had brought so much suffering on innocent people.</span> <span id="s410">What I did was unusually mild.</span> <span id="s411">Of course, I could have been subject to military correction, you know?</span> <span id="s412">Because I did not have the necessary authorization to pursue them.</span> <span id="s413">And indeed it came into being.</span> <span id="s414">A friend of mine was at 7th Army Headquarters in Heidleberg (ph) and I had to go to Heidleberg (ph), whether it was on the occasion when I was decorated, or whatever the reasons were, and this friend of mine who had come from the town of Earlong (ph) and who was a German/Jew, and he saw me pass in the car, pass his office, and he called me in.</span> <span id="s415">And he said, "Fritz, you'd better be mindful of the fact that the next time you come to Earlong (ph), the town major is going to have you arrested."</span> <span id="s416">So I said, "Well, look, it wouldn't be the first time.</span> <span id="s417">After all I had been in prison here in Earlong (ph)."</span> <span id="s418">So indeed I was looking for the opportunity to go to Earlong (ph) and I went to the town major's office, American town major, and I said to him, "I understand you are looking for me.</span> <span id="s419">Here I am and it wouldn't be the first time that I have been in prison here."</span> <span id="s420">So he said, "No, no, but you've got to go according to ____________."</span> <span id="s421">So, okay.</span> <span id="s422">I then went to the prison where I had been in prison and the warden was still the same.</span> <span id="s423">And I think he recognized me.</span> <span id="s424">And he said, "Well now a different sort of people are in prison."</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Can I take you back to Dachau for a moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: We went over that quite quickly and I'd like you to tell me, what do you remember about that, what the timing was and when you were there, what you saw, what you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yeah, very good.</span> <span id="s429">You raise good questions.</span> <span id="s430">It was, dust began to settle.</span> <span id="s431">And I was as usual at my regimental headquarters, which wasn't in the camp, it was outside of the camp.</span> <span id="s432">But I received the orders to come to the camp in order to interrogate that Brigadier General.</span> <span id="s433">And as I approached the camp, and there were the freight trains outside of the gate, and as I came to the camp headquarters there were a lot of prisoners.</span> <span id="s434">And the living prisoners looked worse than the dead ones.</span> <span id="s435">And they, some of them had cornered a German in uniform and they really wanted to do away with him.</span> <span id="s436">And I tried to stop them, which I shouldn't have.</span> <span id="s437">Then I went into the camp headquarters where I met with that Brigadier General.</span> <span id="s438">And then thereafter I went back to the headquarters of my regiment.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: What day was this event, do you know?</span> <span id="s440">What day?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: What day?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: What was the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I think it was April 30, 1945.</span> <span id="s444">And then the following day I didn't get into the camp anymore.</span> <span id="s445">But moved on to Munich, and we took Munich.</span> <span id="s446">On the way, I do remember that, a few incidences.</span> <span id="s447">Some anti-Nazis made contact with us.</span> <span id="s448">The impression I had was that they were left wing underground.</span> <span id="s449">Another incident was when I came across a kid who had come out of the concentration camp and he was in the home of some German where we had established a temporary headquarters.</span> <span id="s450">Temporary being only maybe an hour or two.</span> <span id="s451">And there was a woman, and I said, "I want you to take care of this boy."</span> <span id="s452">I asked him, "Where are your parents?"</span> <span id="s453">He said, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s454">I asked, "Where are you from?"</span> <span id="s455">He answered, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s456">And I'm going to show you something.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Tell me what this is.</span> <span id="s458">Can you describe this to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: We're looking at a piece of newspaper, The New York Telegram, of April 4, 1945.</span> <span id="s460">And it reads, "A-shop-en-borg (ph), Germany.</span> <span id="s461">April 3rd.</span> <span id="s462">American powers shattered even the nerves of one of Germany's most fanatical commanders.</span> <span id="s463">A friend of Adolph Hitler and today the last resistance East, in A-shop-en-borg (ph).</span> <span id="s464">After six days of attack, a Nazi Commander, a Major Lambert (ph), immaculately dressed in grey-green ________ cap, neatly pressed trousers and riding boots stepped out together with his command staff of 100 selected officers, many carried white flags.</span> <span id="s465">When they reached the American lines, Major Lambert was sent in a jeep to a school house where a Colonel O'Brien was waiting with two interpreters, First Lieutenant Fritz Schnaittacher, New York City, and Second Lieutenant Fred Kaufmann (ph), Fritzi, Port Arthur, Texas.</span> <span id="s466">The Nazi Commander, his spirit broken, told the Americans, 'You Americans don't fully appreciate the real power that's in you.</span> <span id="s467">We do now, at long last.'"</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Who had clipped that for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Dottie, sure.</span> <span id="s470">And this is a picture of what I once looked like.</span> <span id="s471">And it says, "With the 7th Army, Germany.</span> <span id="s472">First Lieutenant Fritz Schnaittacher of New York City was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for Meritorious Service in connection with military operations against the enemy by Lieutenant General Hi-slick (ph), Commander of the 7th Army.</span> <span id="s473">Lieutenant Schnaittacher is the son of Mrs. Freda Schnaittacher."</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Yes, wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: And what I did want to mention yet, on the lighter side, after we had taken Munich, one of our battalions was headquartered in the apartment of Eva Braun.</span> <span id="s476">And so, of course, we liberated things that had some significance, like letterheads, but somehow they all disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Let me take you back just a bit, about Dachau again, if you don't mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: I'm wondering, obviously your family had had experiences there.</span> <span id="s480">Your Uncles had been in the camp.</span> <span id="s481">You must have been aware that you were entering this place where they had been.</span> <span id="s482">I'm wondering what emotions you might have been feeling at the time?</span> <span id="s483">What were you thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Well as I tried to say earlier in connection with the experience with Hermann, that it was just unbelievable that I should be able to participate in the liberation of this worst German concentration camp.</span> <span id="s485">I think it was worse than Buchenwald and any number of other German concentration camps.</span> <span id="s486">It didn't compare with Auschwitz, so I felt deeply, deeply gratified and I tried to bring that out in the letter that I wrote to Dottie.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Had you heard from the people from your regiment who had gone in the day before what the conditions were?</span> <span id="s488">What did you know about the camp when you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: No, you know, to my best knowledge we were the first ones.</span> <span id="s490">But Dachau made an enormous impression upon me from the very earliest days on, it was the first concentration camp that the Nazis created.</span> <span id="s491">That's where friends of mine were killed back in 1933.</span> <span id="s492">Killed, shot while attempting to escape.</span> <span id="s493">From the personal point of view, no spot could have given me more satisfaction that I should be able to participate in liberating it.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: You mentioned that you tried to intercede with the group of captives . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: What happened?</span> <span id="s497">What did you try to do and what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: It was stupidly humane.</span> <span id="s499">I'm ashamed of it that I should have interceded.</span> <span id="s500">Where do you want to go from here?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: You tell me.</span> <span id="s502">Where would you like to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Well, this is 1945.</span> <span id="s504">Do you want to develop more of the story of German/Jewish refugees living in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Well, yes, we can get to that.</span> <span id="s506">Tell me, just wrap up the rest of your, ___________ a little bit for me on before you came home and all that.</span> <span id="s507">You mentioned the research you've been doing in the archives?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Right.</span> <span id="s509">And that wasn't a, our screening of the archives in pursuit of the case again __________ was not successful.</span> <span id="s510">We couldn't find anything.</span> <span id="s511">On the other hand, I came across some absolutely inhuman documents of a young child who was maybe 13 or 14 years old and he describes the gift that his father gave him, which was arrival in a Jewish prison to do target practice.</span> <span id="s512">We couldn't identify this particular individual, but still that was a letter that we came across.</span> <span id="s513">[End of side 1 of tape 2].</span> <span id="s514">Thereafter, it wasn't too long before a degree of disillusionment began to set in.</span> <span id="s515">Disillusionment from the point of view that we had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s516">And I was stationed in a beautiful part of Germany, Arch-wipe-vah (ph), and there were beautiful spas nearby.</span> <span id="s517">And then the news reached us of the atomic bomb and meant, sort of concluded the likelihood of a military career, unless I would have volunteered to remain in Germany with the occupational force.</span> <span id="s518">Which I didn't.</span> <span id="s519">I wanted to get back to my wife.</span> <span id="s520">She had hoped that possibly there could be the opportunity for her to come to Europe but that didn't pan out.</span> <span id="s521">And then, of course, I had to assume responsibilities in the business that ultimately I became the head of.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: How did you come home?</span> <span id="s523">When did you come home from the war and how did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: By the way, I flew over and I came home by a relatively small boat, and it was a stormy trip.</span> <span id="s525">But it didn't bother me and I think it was either late November or the beginning of December, and Dottie expected me.</span> <span id="s526">And, of course, there was a glorious welcome.</span> <span id="s527">And then not too long thereafter, we took really our first honeymoon by going to Mexico.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Where did you sail from and where did you land, when you came home?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s530">We left from Belgium, from All-vair (ph) and we arrived in the Port of New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: And she was right there?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: No.</span> <span id="s533">That couldn't be arranged.</span> <span id="s534">But let me see, I forgot.</span> <span id="s535">How did I get to my mother's house?</span> <span id="s536">That I forgot.</span> <span id="s537">And from there I made contact with Dottie.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Do you remember where you were when you first saw her again?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: I think she came to my mother's house.</span> <span id="s540">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Let me pause here for a second.</span> <span id="s542">What is that you are reading?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Reading: "Yanks enter Nuremberg, first shelling Lab-sig (ph)."</span> <span id="s544">You know, Lab-sig (ph) is in the east.</span> <span id="s545">"Lab-sig (ph) was expected to fall soon, along with Nuremberg where the 45th Division," that was my Division, "of Lieutenant General Alexander _________ 7th Army was fighting through the heart of the city after a surprise assault from the Northeast.</span> <span id="s546">The Germans had expected Nuremberg to be attacked from the West.</span> <span id="s547">To the North, the _________ Army of Lieutenant General William H. Simpson reached five miles beyond the Albe (ph) mowing down some of Adolph Hitler's personal troops sent to hold the river line.</span> <span id="s548">Other units . . .", let's see, this is of no, this I don't understand myself.</span> <span id="s549">Forth, my village, "11 miles Northeast of Nuremberg and _________, 20 miles northwest were cleared.</span> <span id="s550">To the west, French forces along the Rhine advanced up to 18 miles during the day and took Offenberg (ph)."</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: When you got back, you were living in New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I was living in, no, I was living in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s553">My in-laws had rented a furnished apartment from friends of theirs and that's where Dottie and I had opened up headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: And tell me about how that went, when you came back?</span> <span id="s555">Did you start working right away?</span> <span id="s556">Was she working during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: She was a psychiatric social worker and she worked in Brooklyn for, I forgot the name of the agency.</span> <span id="s558">And I would imagine that she immediately got time off.</span> <span id="s559">And I didn't start working right away.</span> <span id="s560">Maybe I took off a week or two weeks, and then after New Years, we went to Mexico where I had some distant relatives, whom I didn't know, but we made contact and ultimately developed a very nice friendship.</span> <span id="s561">Probably I took three weeks off and I was discharged as a Captain, which was nothing unusual because of a friend's got the same incentive to possibly stay on.</span> <span id="s562">But I really was disenchanted and possibly in retrospect unjustified so, because my feeling was that we were beginning to get into the cold war.</span> <span id="s563">My impression had been that the Russians had done more than anybody else in bringing Hitler to his knees.</span> <span id="s564">And the battle of Stalingrad (ph) was the decisive battle in Europe.</span> <span id="s565">And it was only two years later, well let's see, in May of 1947 we had our first child, Peter.</span> <span id="s566">And Dottie's mother was kind enough to take care of our son and we left for Europe.</span> <span id="s567">We didn't go to Germany, but we left for Europe in August of 1947.</span> <span id="s568">It was a business trip but I had the privilege of taking Dottie with me.</span> <span id="s569">And because Dottie's brother had died as a flyer so her mother prevailed upon us not to fly.</span> <span id="s570">So it was a two-month trip.</span> <span id="s571">And we went to Holland, Scandinavia, Switzerland, France.</span> <span id="s572">In France, we made contact with a relative who had survived the war in France.</span> <span id="s573">She and her husband, but she lost her son, one of her sons whom the Gestapo picked up and who never returned.</span> <span id="s574">That was 1947.</span> <span id="s575">Then my foreign travels were more directed to Central and South America where I tried to build up, and succeeded in doing so, an export business.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: What kind of business?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: We manufactured surgical dressings, gauze bandages, gauze, silk and cotton, adhesive bandages.</span> <span id="s578">Not to say Band-Aids, etceteras.</span> <span id="s579">But in the years to come, our ambition began to grow and we covered Australia, New Zealand, Iran, Lebanon, Israel, Germany.</span> <span id="s580">Not only to sell, primarily to buy from Germany.</span> <span id="s581">And ultimately I sold the business in 1972 and my son, Peter, is still with the company, or what's left of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: You had other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Yes, I have Richard, who is our middle son.</span> <span id="s584">He lives in Richwood (ph), New Jersey.</span> <span id="s585">And he is particularly gifted in many ways and also in difficult languages, like Chinese and Hebrew.</span> <span id="s586">And Paul, who had been a psychiatric social worker like his mother, but got burned out and he has become an excellent photographer.</span> <span id="s587">That's my family.</span> <span id="s588">And I have grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: How many?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Five.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: How much did you talk to your family, to your wife, to your sons, about your experiences during the war?</span> <span id="s592">How important was that in shaping your lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Not too much.</span> <span id="s594">I gave each one of my sons copies of the one that Washington made.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: _________________?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: But before that you hadn't talked about it with them much?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: To a very limited degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Do you know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: No.</span> <span id="s601">You know even though one of my sons had, the photographer, had asked me to write up my memoirs.</span> <span id="s602">And I started to.</span> <span id="s603">Today they have their own lives to live.</span> <span id="s604">But particularly because of the death of Dottie's, I speak to them daily.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Did you remain active in any veteran's groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: At the very beginning there was a progressive veterans group.</span> <span id="s607">What was the name of it?</span> <span id="s608">I could not see myself joining the American Legion or any organization such as this and the veterans group which I did join, that's no longer in existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Is it a strong part of your identity, that you fought in the war?</span> <span id="s610">I mean, does that form a strong part of you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Well it is interesting, I don't have too many friends who had been in the war.</span> <span id="s612">And the ones that had been in the war and that I see, somehow we talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Is it a painful thing to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Tell me about your friend Fritzi.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: I met Fritzi in what we use to call the dust bowl of Naples.</span> <span id="s617">In our regiment, our division was being mobilized for the invasion into Southern France.</span> <span id="s618">And Fritzi, who had been abroad from Africa on, through Sicily, Cer-learn-no (ph), Ansio (ph), he hardly had missed any landing in any campaign.</span> <span id="s619">And experience had taught him that most important is to have food because very frequently during these campaigns the regiment would outrun the kitchen and you had to live off the land.</span> <span id="s620">So he said, "Lieutenant, we've got to keep soul and mind together.</span> <span id="s621">And we are going to go to the ration dump."</span> <span id="s622">The very first day that we were getting ready to go aboard ship in the afternoon, and he said, now you have an interesting story to tell because you only came from America a few days ago, and these guys were guarding the ration dump, anxious to hear this story.</span> <span id="s623">So you keep them fascinated with your story while I go into the ration dump and when I see, by then it had been dark, when I see some boxes that look interesting and promising, I'll whistle, you'll follow my whistle and I'll throw the boxes across the fence.</span> <span id="s624">A very tall fence.</span> <span id="s625">So I followed his instructions and there I can catch one box, two box, three boxes.</span> <span id="s626">And we saw ourselves eat canned chicken for days to come.</span> <span id="s627">We couldn't wait, but we had to wait because you were not allowed to strike a match or a flashlight.</span> <span id="s628">So we couldn't wait until the following morning when we woke up aboard ship.</span> <span id="s629">And what did we get?</span> <span id="s630">The boxes were in our jeep.</span> <span id="s631">We got three boxes of canned peas.</span> <span id="s632">But we lived through it.</span> <span id="s633">And we exchanged the peas for other stuff, as it was customary.</span> <span id="s634">Interesting was the very first day that we were aboard ship, about to land, and he was ahead of me.</span> <span id="s635">And I saw my first German prisoners.</span> <span id="s636">At that moment I could have killed every one of them.</span> <span id="s637">Until I was able to talk to them.</span> <span id="s638">And then that disappeared.</span> <span id="s639">And having been totally inexperienced in the, not just the art of questioning, but what kind of information we wanted to have, I got the most important strategic information, how to end the war within a matter of days.</span> <span id="s640">And, whereas, Fritzi had known the regimental Commander, a Colonel O'Brien, for a long time and he had gained his confidence.</span> <span id="s641">The Colonel came to me and said, well what do you know?</span> <span id="s642">And I told him that.</span> <span id="s643">And, without changing the expression of his face, he turned away from me and said, Fritzi what do you know?</span> <span id="s644">Well, that didn't last long.</span> <span id="s645">I learned.</span> <span id="s646">But I never forget that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: And you two stayed together for much of the rest of the war?</span> <span id="s648">You two were in the same . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Same regiment.</span> <span id="s650">Yes, we were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: You’re still in fairly close contact with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Every Saturday at ten minutes to ten, my time.</span> <span id="s653">Ten minutes to seven his time.</span> <span id="s654">There is a call.</span> <span id="s655">Either I get to him before he will or the other way around.</span> <span id="s656">But it’s a very, very brief conversation.</span> <span id="s657">Particularly because he, his wife is quite sick and he takes care of her.</span> <span id="s658">And its of some significance too, she also worked for the War Crimes Commission.</span> <span id="s659">A very highly intelligent and very interesting woman.</span> <span id="s660">And when we went, Dottie and I, to Europe the first time in 1947, he joined us together with Greta, his wife, and we had to give our consent.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: For them to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s664">Were there other people from the army who you stayed in touch with after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Yes there had been.</span> <span id="s666">But only, no, let's see, two people, two men.</span> <span id="s667">One who became the supplier of printing supplies and we would meet at his printing shop which was close to where our office was in Manhattan, around 28th Street and 5th Avenue.</span> <span id="s668">And the other man, who started to work for me until he passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: And was your mother still alive when you came back from the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: My mother lived to a very ripe old age.</span> <span id="s671">Unfortunately, in her later years, she became senile but she lived to be 96.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: When you came back and saw her again, she was still in New York at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Did you talk to her about going back to your town, going back to Nuremberg and what you had seen and what you had done?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s676">I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Well I don't remember these details but I do remember that she was anxious to know whom I met and my grandmother was alive when I came back.</span> <span id="s679">As a matter of fact she had the joy of having her children in closer proximity to herself then for many, many years.</span> <span id="s680">But it became painful and difficult when my mother had to be taken to a home.</span> <span id="s681">And once when I had to play God when she required the possibility of an amputation and I had to give the okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: It seems like your whole family was able to remain close by and also very close for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: The older generation is gone.</span> <span id="s684">Now I have three cousins on my mother's side, three boys.</span> <span id="s685">And I have one cousin on my father's side.</span> <span id="s686">And we remain in contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Have you gone back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s689">Because of business, I have gone back maybe three or four times.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Ever to your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Once I took the whole family, the boys, to Schnaittacher and to Forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Really.</span> <span id="s693">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Well it was very pleasant, I mean, yes, I think it was pleasant.</span> <span id="s695">And my sons enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s696">And I have a picture someplace where the five of us are standing at a sign, Schnaittacher ________ _________, you know?</span> <span id="s697">Not named after us but it’s the street that goes to Schnaittacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Do you remember what year it was that you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: I could easily . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s700">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: And I think I missed at the end, when was it that you went back, what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: With the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: I would say it, I went back with the family around 1966 or 1970.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: About 20 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: 20 to 30 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Yes, and 20 years after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Was it much changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Not in my village.</span> <span id="s712">Nuremberg had changed a good deal.</span> <span id="s713">Munich had changed.</span> <span id="s714">You know, these towns, Nuremberg had been devastated and it was fully rebuilt.</span> <span id="s715">Munich also had suffered enormous damage and that was fully rebuilt.</span> <span id="s716">And, of course, Germany had made enormous headway, economically.</span> <span id="s717">I might add that in doing business, having bought from Germans, I made it my business, whether I got truthful answers or not that's another question, but I emphasized the fact that I was Jewish and that I would not want to do business with Nazis.</span> <span id="s718">So, of course, they were not Nazis.</span> <span id="s719">You know, I do believe that Germany has made an earnest effort to remove the, not the guilt, but to remove anti-Semitism and to be sure they have the policy that any act of anti-Semitism is punishable.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: That sounds like something you were very aware of as you started doing business dealings?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: How important has Judaism been in your life since the war, with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Well it, early on in my life I had been orthodox and the boarding house that I mentioned where I lived for a period of six years was orthodox, strictly orthodox.</span> <span id="s724">Afterwards, I had lost the belief that God could have sustained or permitted the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: And your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Dottie was not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: And your sons?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: They are not religious.</span> <span id="s729">One of them married a girl from Israel.</span> <span id="s730">And he, formalistically he might be, somewhat.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: But you felt like your loss of faith was tied to the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Is there anything else you would like to talk about before we end?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: No.</span> <span id="s735">Up to you.</span> <span id="s736">If there is anything else that comes to your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: I think I'm happy.</span> <span id="s738">If there's anything else that you would like to say we have plenty of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Not at all, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Conclusion of Interview.</span></p></body></html>
