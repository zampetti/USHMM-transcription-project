I didn't think about the risk involved. . . we were counted on the way out and on the way in. . . I told my brothers the way I'm gone do it I'm gone go with the group, be the last one in the group or one of last and as we pass the building I'm going to jump from the group into the building.</span> <span id="s39">This is the way I was going to get in touch with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">7:10:00 Instead of going to work I just jumped out of my group and got into the building.</span> <span id="s41">I was waiting for the next group which was returning from work and as the group passed by the building I jumped out and joined the group.</span> <span id="s42">7 42 There were a lot of people in secret places like my parents they were hiding then they were joining the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">7:13:30 Then they shipped her out to Treblinka, and that was the end of my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">7:15:02 One day after I took out my sister from the hiding place that happened to them.</span> <span id="s45">That Willie and Jun Allevin (sp) came up to the attic and started talking in Jewish and said 'Jews if anybody's here now's the best time to get out' and of course the Jews heard some Jewish language so they answered. . . .</span> <span id="s46">They took them all out and put them in the</span></p> <p><span id="s47">big synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">7 :17: 03 We stumbled on people over people who were sneaking out of the temple and we couldn't find my parents or his sister so we started to go back to the small ghetto.</span> <span id="s49">As we came. . . the way we got out of the small ghetto was a water channel under a bridge we jumped into that water channel and as we got under that bridge there's a group of people.</span> <span id="s50">As we get close it's my parents and his sister. . . and we took them into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">7 :19: 32 Interviewer: What about your brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">My younger brother was with me and my oldest brother working in the factory making tables.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">7 :19: 50 One day when I came home from work I found they took my father away, they found him, my mother was hiding under the bed with logs in front of her and they didn't move the bed but my father was in the attic and they found him.</span> <span id="s54">.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">they took him again to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">7: 23: 05 Interviewer: You know that your father was shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Well, yes, we knew the following day that they were shot. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s58">we were told by the Pollacks. . . they saw these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">7: 26: 01 Now in September 44 we were all evacuated to Chanceduhullah (sp) . . . another town about sixty kilometers from Ladj.</span> <span id="s60">It was an army manufacturing place.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">7: 27 :12 Now in January I think eleven or fourteen 1945 the Russians came in and we got liberated.</span> <span id="s62">As we got liberated everyone took off and went home. . . .</span> <span id="s63">We found my mother</span></p> <p><span id="s64">there.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">7:28:41 People recognized me, I'm Jewish, and they say "You still alive?"</span> <span id="s66">in other words they not happy to see me alive but they just wondering if any Jews left over. . . it looked like they are very upset about it that we're still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">7:31:17 Her grandparents used to have, used to be very well to do, they had a nice home, a little palace, and she went there.</span> <span id="s68">But the Pollacks around there hated to see her come back and take up the place again.</span> <span id="s69">So one night she was sitting, and a few other people were there, they were sitting in the kitchen and talking and a few bullets came through the window.</span> <span id="s70">Pollacks start shooting in, they were trying to kill her.</span> <span id="s71">She saw that so next day she came out and she came to the place where my mother started Jewish Community Center, so called, and she told her story.</span> <span id="s72">So my mother told her "look you not gone go there any more you come with me and we live closer by in town, we just live in an apartment and that's how I met my wife."</span></p> <p><span id="s73">7:34:57 We left in 1951 (Bergen-Belsen) and we came to the</span></p> <p><span id="s74">States in 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">7:38:09 The first time they took a friend of mine and he was cleaning out certain apartment and he came to a pair of socks and took it in his pocket and evidently that Willie happens to be there guarding them and he saw what he did.</span> <span id="s76">Al he did, he just approached him, took out his pistol and shot him right on sight. . . .</span> <span id="s77">just cause he stuck a pair of socks in</span></p> <p><span id="s78">his pocket.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">7:41:43 I was young but I was strong and I didn't mind work as long as I could get something to eat.</span> <span id="s80">Work was nothing to us.</span> <span id="s81">I guess anybody work was nothing really as long as you were fed or had enough to eat.</span> <span id="s82">Work would mean nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">7:45:40 Interviewer: You said you prayed.</span> <span id="s84">Did you mean</span></p> <p><span id="s85">literally?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Well within our mind, no, I didn't pray then anymore.</span> <span id="s87">No I didn't although I observed the Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s88">At that time, say Yom Kippur, I never missed the fast, even in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">But as far as praying, up to the date where we got into camp, actually where we got out of this big ghetto, I prayed every</span></p> <p><span id="s90">day.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">7:47:50 Interviewer: What happened to your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">My brother, the middle brother, which worked with me got liberated too, the same time from Chezberun (sp).</span> <span id="s93">Now when we got back to town he was already twenty-one at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">7:54:31 Interviewer: How do you feel about having told the</span></p> <p><span id="s95">story?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Well, I feel now a lot easier than I felt before I started the story.</span> <span id="s97">Like I said before I probably have willies tonight because of them but that's part of it and I guess it's going to stay with me the rest of my life and I'm glad I told the story because in the future if somebody wants to look back and see how their father did, the work he did, maybe he's told us most of it but not all of it and if there's something they can look back and find it here and they want to know about it there will be some evidence.</span> <span id="s98">And I'm very happy about it.</span> <span id="s99">It's been a pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">.</span> <span id="s101">END.</span></p></body></html>
