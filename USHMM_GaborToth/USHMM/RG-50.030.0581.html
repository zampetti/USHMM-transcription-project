2010</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial interview with Dr. Joseph Eaton, conducted by Judith Cohen and Steven Luckert on May 27th, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s12">Dr. Eaton, can you start by giving your first name as it appeared originally, as you were named in Germany, your name in Germany and why don’t you give us the names of your immediate family as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: All right.</span> <span id="s14">I was born as Joseph Wexler in Nuremberg, Germany in – not in a hospital, because it wasn’t safe to go to hospital, if you could afford to have delivery at home.</span> <span id="s15">So I was born in Luxfeld(ph) three, across the park.</span> <span id="s16">My father was Jacob Wexler, and my mother Flora Goldschmidt Wexler.</span> <span id="s17">And I have three brothers, Siegfried was his first name, and later he changed it to Shlomo.</span> <span id="s18">Martin to Moeshe(ph) and Herbert to Yitzhak(ph).</span> <span id="s19">And I was born on September 28th, 1919.</span> <span id="s20">After the war, when there was a great shortage of food, and my father had to work very hard to get milk from peasants near Nuremberg, because you couldn’t get enough for a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your early life, pre-Nazi takeover?</span> <span id="s22">Life in the 20s, both your father’s profession, family’s religious affiliation, Jewish communo(ph) affiliation, schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My parents always had to rent a place.</span> <span id="s24">They did not own an apartment and they always looked for a place to rent near a park, so that it would be easy for the children to go there and play.</span> <span id="s25">They were sufficiently well off for my mother to have one or two household helps, because in those days you didn’t have dishwashers, and you couldn’t go to the gr-grocery store and get prepared food, so it was a lot more work to feed four children and a husband.</span> <span id="s26">My father was the first in his family to break away from the pattern of being a petty merchant selling a – running a store to provide clothing and dry goods.</span> <span id="s27">He was able to purchase a factory, manufacturing shaving brushes, something we don’t use any more today.</span> <span id="s28">And he was married in 1912, shortly after the sinking of the Titanic.</span> <span id="s29">And so I still remember in our home, there was a memento to the pi – Titanic, because that was an event that apparently affected a lot of people.</span> <span id="s30">And shortly after he purchased the factory, World War II – World War I broke out, and he and his brothers – he had four brothers – three brothers – were drafted.</span> <span id="s31">And my father served in the German army for four years, and was very upset and resentful over the amount of anti-Semitism he experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Can you describe what sort of anti-Semitism he noticed?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well – well, what I do remember, his telling me about the complaint that too many Jews were trying to get out of serving in the army.</span> <span id="s34">So, the German government decided to have a census of how many Jews were serving in the German army.</span> <span id="s35">When the findings were that the Jews were overrepresented in the army, the results were not published, not until the late 20s.</span> <span id="s36">But – so he was drafted as a private and ended his service as a private, as did most Jews.</span> <span id="s37">I mean, if you were a physician or a dentist, you might become an officer, but by and large Jews were not considered qualified to be in combat, and so he spent his period of time in the transportation system, which meant looking after horses, because that was the main vehicle transportation.</span> <span id="s38">So, I remember these things, I’m sure, not when I was – before going to primary school.</span> <span id="s39">But I had always someone, a – a caretaker, looking after the smaller children, or taking us to an aunt and uncle’s house, who had a child my age.</span> <span id="s40">So this is how I lived in Nuremberg, but I do not recall having any non-Jewish German friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: What sort of school did you attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What sort of elementary school did you attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Well, I went to a parochial school, of which – of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s45">We lived there, nearby, walking distance, and I do remember being attacked sometimes by other kids, ger – who didn’t like Jewish kids, and you had to fight.</span> <span id="s46">And so I went to this school, which was not a very good school; we had, I would say, very poor teachers.</span> <span id="s47">And I was kind of a rebellious, problematic child.</span> <span id="s48">I would talk back to the teachers sometimes.</span> <span id="s49">And at one point, a teacher called me a donkey.</span> <span id="s50">And so I said, well if I am a donkey, you are a monkey.</span> <span id="s51">And the teacher was so upset.</span> <span id="s52">And finally my parents bribed me to apologize, even though I – they agreed I – it was justified for me to talk back.</span> <span id="s53">But as soon as – after four years, I went to high school, gymnasium as in – they call it in German.</span> <span id="s54">And in the middle of that year, that was in 1933, the government decided that no Jewish child should be allowed to go to a gymnasium, and so I was notified that I could not continue, in 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Let me step back a little bit.</span> <span id="s56">Before ’33, how aware of you what – were you of the political unrest that was going on in Nuremberg?</span> <span id="s57">Did you witness any political rallies?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Well, strange is, I do remember being very interested in what was going on, and reading the newspapers.</span> <span id="s59">Now, of course, I had two older brothers, who were educationally very active, so I would say at age eight and nine, I was very much aware of elections, and the propaganda in elections and the Nazi party, and the Nationalists, who were close to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s60">So certainly I have very vivid memories of 1932 and 1933.</span> <span id="s61">But I do not recall ever feeling frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: When the results of the plebiscite were announced in ’32, and they announced that Hitler had won, what was the immediate reaction in your family?</span> <span id="s63">Did people take it seriously?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Well, my father at that point lost his job, because the company for which he w – he had to give up his business because of the depression.</span> <span id="s65">It was based in – a lot on export of shaving brushes to other European countries, and he had traveled a great deal to different countries, and as a result I became a stamp collector.</span> <span id="s66">But he lost his business because in the depression there just wasn’t enough, so he worked for a company selling their c – shaving brushes.</span> <span id="s67">And he lost the job.</span> <span id="s68">And I remember in 19 – you know, in January and February 1933, when Hitler came into power, that this was pretty bad, but we didn’t think it was a catastrophe.</span> <span id="s69">It wouldn’t last, after all, the Nazi party was not a majority, but close to it.</span> <span id="s70">And I remember my father, for example, printing advertisements to announce that he was making men’s suits to – for measure.</span> <span id="s71">He hired tailors to do the work, and he would find customers and take their measurements and sell tailor made clothing, which in those days was a very common thing, I mean, you didn’t have the mass production.</span> <span id="s72">And so he had advertisements printed, and when I was out of school or had a day off, I would take these ads and put them into mailboxes.</span> <span id="s73">My first job.</span> <span id="s74">So he, even though there was a Nazi boycott, he continued to try and sell, although gradually the business stopped, because it was dangerous and counterproductive for Germans to do business with any Jew.</span> <span id="s75">So, in 1934 -’35, he effectively ceased having an income.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Now, did you witness any of the Nuremberg rallies in the first year?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: No, no I – I was aware of them.</span> <span id="s78">I was aware of the Stürmer newspaper, that came out every week, but the Jewish youth groups to which I belonged, a religious Zionist group called Esba(ph) continued to function.</span> <span id="s79">We went on hiking trips and – and at that time, while I do remember the boycott of Jewish businesses on April 1st, 1933, being surprised how many businesses were Jewish.</span> <span id="s80">So this – a friend walking around the city, I said, good God, these are Jew – all Jewish, because they were being boycotted, but I wasn’t have a – didn’t have a sense of fear.</span> <span id="s81">And once on a hike, a group of Nazi SS troops told us we had to break up camp and go back home.</span> <span id="s82">But again, no sense of fear that anything would happen to me.</span> <span id="s83">So, I was spared the frightening experiences of Jews after 1937 - ’38, when there was a great deal of physical abuse.</span> <span id="s84">There were some Jews arrested in ’33, and a few were killed in concentration camps, but I didn’t – my family didn’t know any of them, so that I would say – when I left Germany I never had experienced the sense of physical fear, because that came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Let me go back, when you mentioned that you were expelled from school, can you sort of describe that day, how you found out that you were no longer allowed to attend the gymnasium, how you filled up your days afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Well, that is interesting.</span> <span id="s87">In high school, there was a complete shift, because since I – I was a fairly good student, very good student in fact, but had very bad relationships with the teachers, who found that I asked too many questions and you know, there were all kinds of religious instruction and I wasn’t quite sure, and asked questions.</span> <span id="s88">So, we had problems.</span> <span id="s89">So when I went to high school, everything changed.</span> <span id="s90">I was a good student, the student – the teachers liked me.</span> <span id="s91">When the teachers ran out of booklets for examinations, he would send me to a store nearby to pick them up.</span> <span id="s92">And I remember one time he says, oh you can’t go to this store, because it’s owned by a Jew, you have to go to that store.</span> <span id="s93">I didn’t like that, but – I was well regarded in the school, and one day found out that – that all – not only I, but other Jewish children had to leave, and – well, that’s politics.</span> <span id="s94">The Jewish community – by that time I lived in Berlin, my family had moved to Berlin, and there they had a very good Jewish school, whose teachers, many of them were college professors who had lost their jobs, who later on sometimes became quite famous individually, as scholars in Israel or in the United States.</span> <span id="s95">So, I went for one year to a Jewish high school in the suburb of Berlin called Grünewald, from which, by the way, the Jews of Berlin were deported from that place.</span> <span id="s96">And so I would say I did not, as I said, I – I knew what was going on, because I listened to the news, and read the newspapers and talked to friends about what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q2: Can I just interject a question?</span> <span id="s98">Nuremberg had the odious distinction of having Julius Streicher as the gauleiter, the Nazi leader of – of Franconia, and also the publisher of “Der Stürmer,” and I was just wondering, you know, about how visible was “Der Stürmer” –</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Very visible.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: – and – and what kind of response did it generate among –</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: I mean, since I didn’t have any German friends – I mean, we had a German maid, two German maids, we never talked about that.</span> <span id="s102">I didn’t talk to German – non-Jewish German kids.</span> <span id="s103">You read the fr – crazy, outrageous stories every week.</span> <span id="s104">I mean, I didn’t buy the paper, but I looked at the newsstand, at the front page.</span> <span id="s105">And well, this is Nazi, this is – you s – you s – you grew up, you lived with this as part of the realities of life.</span> <span id="s106">Later on when I studied the history of my family, prior ge – generations also had to sort of take the fact that there was anti-Semitism for granted, the way minorities today live in so many countries where there is governmentally supported discrimination.</span> <span id="s107">But, we talked about it at home, and I think my parents decided, because of the history of all this, that there was no future for us in Germany, as early as 1933.</span> <span id="s108">Whereas so many German Jews thought this would pass the way it had always passed, and they delayed making a decision to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Okay, let’s talk about the decision to emigrate.</span> <span id="s110">Now, who is the first members of your family to leave Germany, and what prompted them to go where they did, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Well, since my father had to go – went backrumpt – bankrupt when the factory could no longer sell enough, we didn’t have the financial means to get an immigration visa from [indecipherable] countries, because in the early 30s there was a depression all over the world.</span> <span id="s112">Nobody wanted immigrants.</span> <span id="s113">It was very difficult to get visas, so it became clear that it would be very unlikely to be able to emigrate.</span> <span id="s114">We actually had distant relatives in the United States who emigrated in the 19th century, but my father didn’t know about them, because they were, you know, three or four generations back.</span> <span id="s115">So my two older brothers decided not to have an academic career, but to become Halutzim or physical laborers and go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s116">And they succeeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: And what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: ’35 and ’36.</span> <span id="s119">And there was an opportunity for children to come to the United States under a special program to finish school, and then return home, hopefully.</span> <span id="s120">And my parent decided, with much discussion in – within the larger family, to send my younger brother, who was 12, and me, who was 14 to the United States under this program where, in foster homes, we would finish our education.</span> <span id="s121">And they were able to emigrate to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about this program.</span> <span id="s123">Can you – a-actually want to go in two different directions, cause I want to talk about your parents’ emigration to Holland.</span> <span id="s124">But first, can you describe the program that you were under; who subsidized it, was this through the Jewish community, was it general, what political ramifications were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Well, we all know historically that President Roosevelt took very little action to help the Jews of Germany.</span> <span id="s126">He had a congress that was not willing to change immigration laws.</span> <span id="s127">And within the Department of State, and in Canada as well, the bureaucracy felt, whatever immigrants we get, we don’t need Jews.</span> <span id="s128">And so they made it especially difficult for Jews to get papers, unless they had very good connections in the U.S. and Canada.</span> <span id="s129">But, under pressure, Roosevelt agreed to commit, I don’t know how many, whether it was 2,000 or 20,000 children from Germany to come to the United States under a guarantee of the Jewish community that they would not become a burden to the welfare system.</span> <span id="s130">It was called the German Jewish Children’s Aid Society.</span> <span id="s131">And I think my younger brother was on the first group, and I came a week later on the second group –</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: What year and month was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: – traveling on the S.S. Harding.</span> <span id="s134">And while it was upsetting, I – I felt, and my parents reinforced this, this was a temporary thing, and that we would be reunited after they got out of the country.</span> <span id="s135">And so I landed the day before Thanksgiving of 1934, in New York, and was temporarily picked up to the home of one of the officers of the German Jewish Children’s Society, a attorney, John L. Bernstein.</span> <span id="s136">And then later on to – went to another foster home.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: I want to come back later and ask you about what it was like living in the United States without parents, but why don’t we jump over to your parents.</span> <span id="s138">After you and your siblings all left, where did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Well, actually, my parents’ marriage was – did not come – it sort of deteriorated as he lost his business.</span> <span id="s140">My mother was an intellectual.</span> <span id="s141">He was interested in things, but really did not share her intellectual interests.</span> <span id="s142">And so the marriage was not a good marriage, but I didn’t know about that.</span> <span id="s143">My older brothers did, and they did divorce and emigrated to Holland separately.</span> <span id="s144">And my father found another girlfriend and they emigrated together, also to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s145">So it was a congenial divorce.</span> <span id="s146">There wasn’t much to argue about in 1936, although emotionally this was a very difficult thing for my mother.</span> <span id="s147">But she got a good deal of support from her family and her sisters.</span> <span id="s148">So – however, there was a tremendous amount of correspondence between members of the family.</span> <span id="s149">I have letters, about this many, with my parents, my mother, my father, my brothers and we kept the letters.</span> <span id="s150">So, over the years, my brothers gave me the letters, because I was the only one in the family who showed interest, and of course, the only one who could read German.</span> <span id="s151">So I have a tremendous collection of letters, and I have to decide what to do with them, because I don’t think I have the time right now to go through them.</span> <span id="s152">But they present a great deal of day to day information of how a normal refugee family dealt with the realities of emigration, adjustment, what – interrelationships.</span> <span id="s153">Today this would never happen.</span> <span id="s154">People might communicate by email, but in those days, letter writing was the only means of communication.</span> <span id="s155">And it meant having – spending money on postage, which for my parents was not easy.</span> <span id="s156">So, most of the letters, th-the – every inch of the paper was filled with words.</span> <span id="s157">In other words, you didn’t have any margins, to save money.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: What was – how late were you able to keep up the correspondence?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Til 1941.</span> <span id="s160">Til Germany and the United States declared war, since the U.S. was – we c – so we couldn’t – I have letters from ’40 and ’41 from Holland.</span> <span id="s161">And we didn’t have the money to telephone.</span> <span id="s162">I didn’t have the money, and they didn’t have the money, because in those days, to make a long distance call was very expensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Let me – oh – Q2: What did your parents do when they got to the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Well, my mother took care of elderly people who needed some support.</span> <span id="s165">So she was basically a health aide of elderly people, and they were all deported, of course, after the Nazis came, although my mother was able to escape to a village, and hid there for a while until a local Nazi gave her away, and they arrested her.</span> <span id="s166">So the – my father learned dry cleaning, he took a course in Amsterdam on how to dry clean.</span> <span id="s167">And even though they had no permit, no working permit, but to be a household aide, you really didn’t need a permit.</span> <span id="s168">That’s – it’s the kind of job that nobody wanted, so my mother could work.</span> <span id="s169">And my father was doing busin – I guess, also extra-legally, but the Dutch apparently didn’t enforce the restrictions with such efficiency, and – I mean, they didn’t have any – much money and they may even have gi – been given some support by the Jewish community in Amsterdam, but I don’t know those details.</span> <span id="s170">They didn’t write about it, and I didn’t ask about it.</span> <span id="s171">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: I want to ask you now, what it was like for a young boy, 14 years old I remember, to live with a foster family that he had never met before, and what was your adjustment learning English, learning a new educational system, learning a new family.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Well, I didn’t feel really comfortable in any of the homes, but felt I had to – I was grateful, and I had to be accommodative.</span> <span id="s174">The first fast – foster home family were – was a wealthy family living on Central Park West in New York City in a big apartment.</span> <span id="s175">They had three daughters.</span> <span id="s176">And so they felt having a boy in the family would be a good idea.</span> <span id="s177">But they were very Orthodox, and I found myself at that time becoming more and more estranged to Orthodoxy, and they noticed that, so I was moved to another family, the son of the Rabbi de Sola Pool, the head of Shearith Israel of the Sephardic synagogue in New York City, who was a sort of son of a famous father who wasn’t doing quite so well, so it was difficult for him.</span> <span id="s178">He was a salesperson for different companies, but never quite made it in the corporate world, and they had one son, a little younger than I, and – almost the same age, and that created problems, because he was doing okay in school, but I was academically outstanding.</span> <span id="s179">And so I think that created problems for Richard Mindas(ph).</span> <span id="s180">I didn’t have any problems with him, but we didn’t become close.</span> <span id="s181">And – but I went first to a New York school, the Jefferson High School in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s182">And there, fortunately, they had a good speech department.</span> <span id="s183">So the speech therapist took an interest in me, and helped me to learn to speak English properly.</span> <span id="s184">So I got a lot of special instruction, and my capacity to speak English and to spell and so on, developed rather quickly, so that when later on, before I graduated, I actually got better grades in English than most of my fellow students, because I had to learn the language and therefore was more careful with spelling.</span> <span id="s185">So actually, I graduated from White Plains High School at the age of 16, because I got credit by taking examinations in world history and European history.</span> <span id="s186">I had to learn American history, I had to learn English, but math and geography, I passed the Regents Exams, so that I graduated early and went to college at the age of 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: And who paid for your college?</span> <span id="s188">Was the German children’s aid still supporting you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: I first went to a free – to the New York City’s high s – City College, because that was free.</span> <span id="s190">But after one year got a scholarship to go to Cornell.</span> <span id="s191">And I also got a scholarship for maintenance from – through the German Jewish Children’s Aid from someone of the Woberg(ph) family.</span> <span id="s192">Because one of their daughters who was active in the Zionist movement met me and I was so knowledgeable about what was going on in the Middle East, she decided to get the family to send me to Cornell.</span> <span id="s193">And I also met the president of Hadassah, because her son went to a summer camp to which I was invited.</span> <span id="s194">So that I had connections, through my knowledge of what was going on in the Jewish world.</span> <span id="s195">I did a lot of reading.</span> <span id="s196">I had a nephew by marriage of my father, who was a professor at the theological seminary.</span> <span id="s197">So I had contacts with the academic world at the age of 15 and 16 and 17 that resulted in my having contacts among the Jewish leadership elite, including Rabbi Pool, whose wife also became president of Hadassah.</span> <span id="s198">And at one point I was invited by Justice Brandeis to meet with him in his home here in Washington, because he was interested in cooperative farming and kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s199">And by that time I had a job to do research in that field.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: What were you studying at Cornell?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: At Cornell, I first thought of becoming a – a physician who was taking care of animals, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: A veterinarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: A what?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: A veterinarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: A veterinarian.</span> <span id="s206">I really had very poor advice, in terms of making choices.</span> <span id="s207">I had no one to talk to.</span> <span id="s208">But when I got to Cornell and took a course in animal husbandry, I came to the dec – quickly to the decision that I was not the right person to help cows and horses deliver their offspring.</span> <span id="s209">And also, I took a course in rural sociology.</span> <span id="s210">And there I wrote a term paper on the kibbutz movement, simply from what you read in the newspapers and knew from my brothers in Israel.</span> <span id="s211">And the professor liked the paper so much – he happened to be the editor of rural sociology, so it got published.</span> <span id="s212">So at – as a junior at Cornell, I was a pub – I had a publication in a – in – in a well-known journal, and that made a big difference in my subsequent career.</span> <span id="s213">And that’s how Justice Brandeis heard about me and whose interest in Palestine and its economic development was a private, but very great interest.</span> <span id="s214">And so I think, through Mrs. Epstein, somehow he heard about me and he invited me to come to see him on a Sunday morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: What was your impression of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Well, he obviously knew an awful lot, and I really didn’t have enough of understanding of the significance of being invited by a member of the Supreme Court, to fully be amazed at this – you know, this was, for me, a normal thing that happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: [indecipherable] I’m trying to do the math.</span> <span id="s218">You came to the United States at 14, you graduated at 16, so we’re talking now – it’s about ’39 – ’40?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: That’s right, I gradu – graduated in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: And I want to ask you, how aware were you of what was going on back in Europe?</span> <span id="s221">What sort of news were you getting about the start of World War II, how much news was filtering?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I was very much aware, I mean, reading Eng-English, being able to read in German, my parents wouldn’t – would write once or twice a week.</span> <span id="s223">I would write back, not often, make copies of my letters, so I – my letter writings not only have their letters, but my responses.</span> <span id="s224">And much of that is also true of my brothers.</span> <span id="s225">So, even correspondence with my grandmother, who remained in Frankfurt because she didn’t think the Nazis would bother an older lady, and so she was not willing to leave the country when everybody else left.</span> <span id="s226">She had a nice home, and so on.</span> <span id="s227">So I was very much aware.</span> <span id="s228">I would say I was more aware of what was going in Europe than most people, and probably as much aware of what was going on as my teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: And was there any mobilization on the part of the American Jewish community at this point, in ’39, after the invasion of Poland, for relief efforts, that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Well, I was aware of the tremendous sense of frustration of the American Jewish community.</span> <span id="s231">But on the other hand, I was aware of the complexities of the leadership.</span> <span id="s232">I mean, like Rabbi Wise, who had good relationship with Roosevelt, and so he had to be very careful in open criticism of the Department of State.</span> <span id="s233">I was aware of the American Jewish committee and their ambivalence about being too supportive of the Zionists, because after all, we Jews are religion rather than a nationality, and I was very much identified with the idea that Jews are both a religion and a nationality.</span> <span id="s234">And so I would say I had a quite advanced knowledge, not only what was going on in the U.S. or in Germany, or in much of the rest of Europe, what was going on in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s235">When I was at Cornell, there was a pretty active communist youth group, and I was among the Jewish kids who were very much opposed to the Soviet Union, because of – even though they seemed to be wi – quite progressive, they were a dictatorship.</span> <span id="s236">And so I was active in the Hillel Society and that group was very much opposed to the Soviet Union, whereas there were a lot of – not a lot, but there was a sufficiently active group of students at Cornell that felt that the Soviet Union had the solution to mankind’s future.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: What sort of activities was your group, the Zionist group at Hillel doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Well, first of all, we were very critical of the Soviet Union; of its dictatorship, the concentration camps, the labor camps, Stalin.</span> <span id="s239">We did not think they are progressive.</span> <span id="s240">There were lots of arguments.</span> <span id="s241">And so, I had friends among the anti-communists, but you know, I did become a Republican as a result, but I was politically active, and one of my friends was a Iraqi Jew.</span> <span id="s242">The only Jew ever sent by the Iraqi government, on a scholarship of the government.</span> <span id="s243">They every year sent over some students to get an American degree, and Mayer(ph) Sofaya(ph) was the only one who was Jewish who they ever selected.</span> <span id="s244">And so we became very friendly, and through him I learned a lot of what was going through the Arab world, and I did – was invited to his wedding in Egypt in 1945, and actually went to the wedding.</span> <span id="s245">I didn’t get there on time, but I actually met him in Cairo, in – at the end of 1945, and that another interesting story, how knowing him enabled me to come to Palestine in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: We’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s247">Now, I just want to check, your official status at this point is you’re still a German citizen, or were you officially stateless?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: No, I was a German citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: And so how did the United States’ entry into World War II, let’s go to Pearl Harbor, what were the ramifications for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Well, you have to keep in mind that when I went to graduate school, I was accepted at the school of social work ka – at Chicago University.</span> <span id="s251">And in the first semester, where I had a job selling clothes in a men’s clothing store, I suddenly was offered a job in New York City to set up a research institute on cooperative farming.</span> <span id="s252">So I left Chicago, and found myself at the age of 21, or – [file break]</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Joseph Eaton, conducted by Judith Cohen on August 31st – August first in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s254">It’s a continuation of the interview begun at the Holocaust Museum in June.</span> <span id="s255">Okay, when we left off with the previous interview, you had finished telling us about your experiences at Cornell and were just beginning your graduate school and about to enter the army.</span> <span id="s256">So let’s start with after you left Cornell and began graduate school in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: After I graduated from Cornell, I had been advised by a professor who Leonard Katrow(ph), who was very friendly towards me and invited me to his home many times, he advised me not to go into academia, because he said Jews didn’t have much of a chance.</span> <span id="s258">And that it would be better off to study the applications of sociology, so I applied to a school of social work at the University of Chicago, which at that time was well regarded, and had a sociological orientation, rather than a psychiatric orientation.</span> <span id="s259">And while I was there, I received a phone call from New York, from Edward A. Newman, a wealthy Jewish banker, asking me if I were interested in conducting a study of cooperative farming in the United States, what our experiences were in that field, because the – Henry Wallace, either secretary of agriculture or vice-president at – I think he had just stopped being vice-president, Truman had been appointed – was very interested in possibly expanding cooperative farming in the United States as a way of helping landless farm workers to become owners, and they were particularly interested in moshavim, because one of the sons of Henry Wallace had been in Israel for a summer, and reported about kibbutzim and moshavim.</span> <span id="s260">So Edward Newman, who knew Henry Wallace, decided to fund a study.</span> <span id="s261">And the reason he called me is a term paper of mine on kibbutzim in the junior year had gotten published in a journal.</span> <span id="s262">And so, I looked like being an expert in an area where nobody else was really better informed.</span> <span id="s263">Not that I really was an expert, because I didn’t speak Hebrew and had never lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s264">So I decided to accept the job and after one quarter at the end of December, went to New York to start the job.</span> <span id="s265">The study was – had to have a organizational sponsorship, and so we set up the rules [indecipherable] institute, and with the help of Henry Wallace, I was able to recruit a board of directors, who were very, very prominent.</span> <span id="s266">Some of them were suggested by Justice Brandeis, who heard about the study and invited me to his home on a Sunday morning to tell him what was happening in the cooperative farming field, especially Palestine.</span> <span id="s267">He obviously continued to have a significant influence and interest, and indeed, had been responsible for the book by Walter C. Loudermilk, the commissioner of social si – the commissioner of conservation in the department of agriculture, who had made a study of why is it that in the Middle East, there is such incredible poverty, when at one time in their history, it was the most advanced and prosperous area?</span> <span id="s268">And he went by car from Morocco, all the way to Iraq and Turkey and then wrote a book in which he pointed out that the neglect and the poverty was due to the way the social structure was operating under Islam, and the only bright light was the Jewish settlements in Palestine.</span> <span id="s269">And he praised them and pointed out the modern agricultural methods and thi – the green line already existed in 1940 when – in ’41.</span> <span id="s270">And when Henry Wallace got the report, he apparently called Brandeis and told him, you should really look at this.</span> <span id="s271">And Brandeis got someone, a woman, to edit the report, publish it as a book called, “The Land of Promise,” and the book was distributed to every member of Congress.</span> <span id="s272">And so, the fact that I was making the study was obviously of interest to Brandeis.</span> <span id="s273">So suddenly, as a refugee, I felt myself interacting with people in the so – conservation service, the agricultural extension service, and wherever I went to study cooperative farming experiences in the United States, I had superb cooperation.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: In this period, when you met Brandeis, and you’re going around looking at the farms, did anybody ever question the fact that you were a refugee, and ask you about –</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s276">Neither they, or any of the officials, very high officials, I mean, you know, third level subcabinet officers, and the – the U.S. government, under Henry Wallace had begun cooperative farms by purchasing large plantations that were going bankrupt, especially in the south, and then hiring farm managers and recruiting impoverished farm laborers, put them on the land.</span> <span id="s277">Each – the land was owned cooperatively by the farm.</span> <span id="s278">They didn’t know much about how to run a farm, so they built a large farm and equipment for large machinery, and the farm manager began to teach the workers and gradually they took more and more responsibility for running the farm.</span> <span id="s279">And so I s-studied the 27 experimental areas, traveling all over the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: And how long did you stay with this job?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Well, until I was drafted.</span> <span id="s282">In the middle of the study, I was drafted.</span> <span id="s283">I had part of a manuscript with me.</span> <span id="s284">I also visited some of the religious collective farms, like the Amish and Amana colonies in Iowa, which were communistic [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s285">But before I finished, I was drafted, but I somehow managed to finish my report and Harper Brothers decided to publish the report as a book, calling it, “Exploring Tomorrow’s Agriculture.”</span> <span id="s286">So after, when I was in basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey –</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: And what year and month was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: That was 1943.</span> <span id="s289">I – I went in the army ’42, but in basic training.</span> <span id="s290">I think it was ’43 the book was published.</span> <span id="s291">And I was a private being trained to be a first aid enlisted man to deal with injured people in the battlefield.</span> <span id="s292">When a package arrived, and I immediately knew when it was brought in by the first sergeant that this was not food from some f-friend or relative.</span> <span id="s293">But he made me open it up, and it was a book.</span> <span id="s294">And he looked at this and says, he expected some food and candy that could be distributed – he said, did you write this?</span> <span id="s295">I said yes.</span> <span id="s296">He said, well, if you can write so well, let’s see how well you are in cleaning pots.</span> <span id="s297">So everybody laughed and for one week I had swep – special duty in the kitchen, cleaning these very large pots, some of them so large that you had to go into the pot to clean it.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Let me ask two questions; one is, do you attribute his response just to the fact that he was disappointed that there was no food, or do you think any of this was anti-Semitic, or anti-intellectual?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s300">I don’t think there was – I experienced no discrimination or reference to my refugee status.</span> <span id="s301">First of all, I spoke English extremely well.</span> <span id="s302">I did better on many tests, including sharpshooting.</span> <span id="s303">I was not outstanding, but you know, did adequately.</span> <span id="s304">So the – within the army, I did not experience any anti-foreignism, or anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: And, let me ask a different question.</span> <span id="s306">What name were you going by at this point, and can you talk about change of name?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: My brothers and I had changed our name in 1940.</span> <span id="s308">After the war had begun, and my brothers, one of them was in the British Army and the other in the Haganah in Israel, and people in Israel anyhow wanted – didn’t want German names.</span> <span id="s309">But one of the special problems we faced is that our parents were living in Amsterdam, and if we were taken prisoner, this might – we were worried that this could cause problems for them as parents of traitors, because we were obviously fighting against the Fatherland.</span> <span id="s310">So we decided to change our name and adopted a name that was suggested by Rabbi de Sola Pool, and – whom – whom I knew, because his wife was president of Hadassah.</span> <span id="s311">And I was one of the people she became interested in because there weren’t many young Americans who showed much interest and real knowledge about Zionism and Israel, which I did because I had been very active in Germany, even though I was only 14.</span> <span id="s312">So, he was very helpful, and he ultimately married Helen and me, even though we were not Sephardim.</span> <span id="s313">So, at any rate, this is how, professionally, I finished a book which Columbia University accepted as my dissertation.</span> <span id="s314">Because at Columbia you had to publish your dissertation, and here I had a book published by Harper brothers.</span> <span id="s315">So my dissertation was approved before I had taken more than one course in sociology at Columbia.</span> <span id="s316">So when I came back from the army, I had to take all the courses and pass examination about substance, but I didn’t have to write a dissertation.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Okay, so now let’s go back to Fort Dix, and you’re working there, training to be someta – medic, and you’re going by the name of Eaton at this point.</span> <span id="s318">And then what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Well, in Fort Dix, when we finished our basic training, I was a sort of middle range effective first aid man, because not being very tall, I had problems carrying these – the what do you call – you carry human beings on – that are injured on a –</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Stretchers?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: On a what?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Stretchers, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: On stretcher, yeah, one stretcher.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: You know, you had to carry the stretcher and – and on battlefields you had to be – keep your head down and so on.</span> <span id="s326">So you had to carry, you didn’t do it by yourself, two people had to carry a stretcher.</span> <span id="s327">But most people preferred others to work with them than me, because I wasn’t as strong as many other soldiers.</span> <span id="s328">So, instead of being sent to a field, to a division, I ended up at a military hospital in Camp Rucker, Alabama, as a clerk.</span> <span id="s329">And it looked like my future would be to be a clerk in a military hospital, and I was very well regarded, because I was among the relatively few people who could handle medical records, with all their special words, and being able to identify diagnoses and to spell them properly.</span> <span id="s330">So I was – my commanding officer thought very well of me.</span> <span id="s331">It might even result in a promotion to private first class, but before that happened, he got a notice from Washington that I was being transferred.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Let me just interject one question, and then we’ll talk about the transfer.</span> <span id="s333">What was your official citizenship status at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I was an enemy alien, and I was drafted as an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s335">And as an enemy alien, I was obviously under FBI surveillance.</span> <span id="s336">I know this because in 1942 I received a postcard from Sweden, from an aunt, saying that they needed money so that they might be able to get a visa to Ecuador for my mother.</span> <span id="s337">And they didn’t have money, could I raise 12,000 dollars?</span> <span id="s338">And within two days or so after I got the postcard, the FBI came to my door and asked me if I had sent any money, pointing out to me that this was trading with the enemy.</span> <span id="s339">Well, I didn’t have any money, I didn’t know anybody I could get 12,000 dollars from.</span> <span id="s340">But I know, obviously my mail was being monitored.</span> <span id="s341">And, you know, the – they did say to me, it’s just as well you didn’t send them any money, because this is just a scam, as far as we know.</span> <span id="s342">But my mail was being censored, without ever being notified.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: So, now as an enemy alien, you’re in the army –</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: So we’re as – but the fact that I was drafted, this didn’t seem to bother anybody.</span> <span id="s347">So it might have meant that I might have been promoted more quickly, that could be a factor, because I was ap – still a private after s-several months in a really important position in the hospital.</span> <span id="s348">In other words, I was in charge of the night shift, and when people came in, they depended on me to keep the records straight, and that had been, apparently, a real problem, simply because it wasn’t always easy to get the right people to do the job.</span> <span id="s349">Well educated people usually were assigned to other jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: And then why did you leave this job?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: So, what happened, and I only learned that later, is that when you’re drafted – in World War II, the army had adopted the IBM technology to keep personnel records, so that every soldier, when he was drafted, had – was interviewed in great detail about their background, and all of that was put on IBM cards.</span> <span id="s352">And in 1942, or was it f – or early ’43, I’m not sure exactly, the U.S. government had decided that when we liberate France, the U.S. would need to govern France.</span> <span id="s353">Roosevelt did not trust de Gaulle, whom he regarded as an extreme nationalist who would undermine the recovery of Europe, as happened in wor – after World War I, when the French were – insisted on the Versailles treaty.</span> <span id="s354">So, he decided he wasn’t going to let the free French govern France, but there would be a U.S. military government of France, then there would be free election, and let the French decide whether they want de Gaulle or somebody else.</span> <span id="s355">So in preparation for the liberation of France, they were going to train a cadre of people to govern France.</span> <span id="s356">And even though I didn’t know French, but becu – my card fell out and they decided I was one of these people, so suddenly I was transferred from Camp Rucker, Alabama to Queens College, New York, to learn how to be one of the military government staff.</span> <span id="s357">French economics, French history, French law.</span> <span id="s358">The f – the – the taxation system and so on, so for six months I learned a great deal about France, and learned enough French so I could go to Columbia and pass my French language exam, because at Columbia you had to have two foreign languages if you wanted a PhD.</span> <span id="s359">They accepted my German and I passed the French exam, I learned enough.</span> <span id="s360">And we were about ready to be shipped over to England to work with the English, who had reluctantly accepted the policy of Roosevelt, when Roosevelt and Churchill met in Casablanca.</span> <span id="s361">And there Churchill convinced Roosevelt that the free French, de Gaulle should govern the occupied France, that with all the problems that de Gaulle might create, it was better than the English and Americans tr – doing the job.</span> <span id="s362">So overnight, about 10,000 bright American soldiers became surplus, and had to be reassigned, and our – overnight, our program was finished.</span> <span id="s363">I mean, you know, when you come to think of it, right in the middle of it, there was no longer any need to train people to govern French towns and villages.</span> <span id="s364">And most of the trainees were reassigned to different divisions.</span> <span id="s365">Many military units had a shortage of people with high IQs.</span> <span id="s366">And this was an opportunity for the army to infuse more people with high IQs.</span> <span id="s367">But a few were given a choice, because the army was trying to fill some special jobs.</span> <span id="s368">And one of them was a unit that would be dropped to sabotage German facilities, dropped over Germany.</span> <span id="s369">And so I was interviewed and told that that was an opportunity for me, but they warned me that the chances of surviving were less than 50 percent, and what would be involved.</span> <span id="s370">And not that I was particularly heroic and wanting such a – a job, but I didn’t feel as a Jew I could say no, so I – I said yes, when I really wa – wished I didn’t have to say yes.</span> <span id="s371">So, as a result, I was sent to Camp Ritchie, the U.S. intelligence training area near Washington, D.C.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Can you tell me about the type of training you got at Camp Ritchie, and who the other soldiers were who you met there?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Well, shortly after I arrived at Camp Ritchie it became clear the govern – the army had decided that the program of dropping people didn’t work, the Germans were too well organized.</span> <span id="s374">So actually I found myself attached to another unit, the psychological warfare division of the U.S. Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Now –</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: – and that psychological warfare division had very interesting responsibilities of providing intelligence at the division, as well as at the supreme headquarter level.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: I want to talk in detail about what you did in PSYOPS, but can you first tell me about who the other people were in your – in the division and in your unit?</span> <span id="s378">What types of people were recruited for this work?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: In the psychological warfare division, the key person was a Austrian named Captain Hans Harber(ph), and he had become important because he – he married the daughter of – the father of Ted Kennedy and the other Kennedys, who had been ambassador to Great Britain.</span> <span id="s380">The way Hans Harber(ph), who was himself a refugee from Austria – he became extremely well-known because of his personal history.</span> <span id="s381">Harbie(ph) was the son of a Hungarian Jew named Baeckeshee(ph), who edited the scandal sheet of Budapest, and who had shot himself in the foot in World War I, so he wouldn’t have to serve.</span> <span id="s382">And Hans had been very ashamed of his father when the war broke out in – World War II, in ’39, he signed up in the Foreign Legion and was taken prisoner by the Germans and escaped, and wrote a book about the whole situation; his service, his family, and it became a best seller.</span> <span id="s383">So this is how, because of the book, he was invited to lecture all over the country and Europe, and this is how he met his future wife.</span> <span id="s384">And then he signed up in the American army, and he dising – distinguished himself in North Africa.</span> <span id="s385">He was a journalist who had studied the history of Hitler and his family.</span> <span id="s386">So he was appointed to head the psychological warfare units, and was regarded by top level executives as a intelligent, sophisticated analyst of what was going on in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Now, before you could b – enter psy – the PSYOPS division, did you have to undergo any security clearances, any other special exams?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: If I did, they h-had all the information about me, so I – I would – I do not recall.</span> <span id="s389">My hunch is they did make the security clearance.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: And what sort of special training did they give you at Camp Ritchie?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Well, the training we got was a a-analysis of how the German army was structured; tactically, strategically, chains of command.</span> <span id="s392">We studied the German propaganda techniques.</span> <span id="s393">We studied the British American policies that Harber(ph) had worked out with the British, which contrasted to the Hollywood approach, that at the beginning had been kind of adopted, a kind of advertising that we have now, in which you oftentime make claims that are not – that are misleading.</span> <span id="s394">The British had decided before Dunkirk, that the only way they could win in Europe is to adopt a policy of always telling the truth.</span> <span id="s395">So at Dunkirk they reported their defeat, the problems of evacuating everybody, the losses, and they broadcast these facts to the Germans over BBC, and the French and so on.</span> <span id="s396">And you know what, they were facing a tremendous loss, had the Germans had succeeded, and continued this policy and psychological warfare had adopted the policy of not using propaganda, they – you know, the way Americans advertise.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: And how did they define your mission?</span> <span id="s398">Did you have a mission statement?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: The mission statement was to get the Germans as – first of all, to believe in what they were being told by the U.S. and by the British, and second, to get the Germans to question their regime, on the basis of what was difficult for the Germans.</span> <span id="s400">In other words, we’d – we – to simply say the Germans were unfair and unjust and so on, wasn’t going to work, because they felt that Germany, in order to survive, had to do some terrible things, that’s war.</span> <span id="s401">We had to focus on inconsistencies in German policies from the point of view of the German public and the differentiation between what was good for the general public, and what was good to the me – for the maintenance of the regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: And did you begin any of the actual work while you were still in the United States –</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: – or was this all pre –</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: We – we wrote leaflets to be dropped.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: While you were in Camp Ritchie?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: While we da – we had to find our way blind, men left all by ourselves somewhere in – in the area.</span> <span id="s408">We had to write reports to headquarters.</span> <span id="s409">It turned out later on, the unit I was attached to was directly attached to Eisenhower’s supreme headquarters, so we were reporting directly.</span> <span id="s410">Ha-Ha-Harber(ph) obviously was given that job, and so the 10 people he had selected automatically got jobs that had actually impact on public policy.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: And when did your unit ship out to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: We shipped out in ’43, and were sent to London, there to work with the British and get trained for British American cooperation.</span> <span id="s413">We had – that time we had not yet attacked Europe at Omaha Beach, but we were being readied for that event.</span> <span id="s414">We knew that sooner or later we would invade Europe, but of course we didn’t know when it would happen.</span> <span id="s415">But that was our training.</span> <span id="s416">And especially writing reports, working with British – actually, we were being investigated carefully by British intelligence.</span> <span id="s417">They didn’t trust – and I learned later that the Americans, our particular unit was sent to a villa in the outskirts of London, which was very comfortable, but of course the blitz was going on.</span> <span id="s418">Any time you got hit by a bomb, that was it, a whole block would be wiped out by one bomb.</span> <span id="s419">And – but the villas were run by women – British women soldiers, who did – who fed us, who looked after our clothes, who woke us up in the morning, who made sure that we had, you know, were properly fed and had all the comforts.</span> <span id="s420">What we didn’t realize, that they also were carefully making notes on all of us, and had conversations.</span> <span id="s421">Their job was to make sure that we would be able to function in a proper fashion.</span> <span id="s422">And then, about five weeks after the invasion of France, we landed at Omaha Beach at a time when it was no longer dangerous, because actually, American troops had liberated Paris.</span> <span id="s423">So we landed and there was a bus waiting, and we drove directly to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Now, won’t you tell me about what your day to day work was?</span> <span id="s425">And I know that you were writing leaflets, but what was the source of information, how did you get the information that you we – based on your reports, and how did you decide what went into the reports that you were writing?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Well, the leaflets had to appeal to Germans.</span> <span id="s427">So what we did is we looked at the tactical situation, and then presented it to the Germans as this is what is happening in the battlefields.</span> <span id="s428">And giving them facts about what was going on, which by 1940 – late 1943 - 1944 was no longer entirely favorable to the Germans.</span> <span id="s429">I mean, we were still incurring losses, but we were beginning – you know, in Africa we actually were able to defeat Rommel and prevent the capture of Egypt.</span> <span id="s430">So, depending on what happened that day, we would write a leaflet, and then we would think of some other things that might make Germans question the policies of their government.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: And how independent were you in terms of what you put in?</span> <span id="s432">Who had to approve these leaflets?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: The 10 men working in teams of one or two or thr – not more than that, would prepare a leaflet, or a news broadcast, and they would be reviewed by Captain Harber(ph).</span> <span id="s434">And he had the authority to say yes or no.</span> <span id="s435">There was a colonel, but the colonel was somebody who had come from the broadcasting industry, who worked well with Harber(ph), but really Harber(ph) was the authority, as somebody who understood what was going on in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: And how did you disseminate these leaflets once you wrote them?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Well, we did nothing, they were just – they were just exercises.</span> <span id="s438">The – I think at times – no, I don’t think, I know at times our products were shown to high officials, probably Patton and Bradley and Eisenhower, to give them an idea what psychological w-warfare we’d be doing.</span> <span id="s439">But it was all practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: So none of these ever made it to Germany, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s442">They – they may very well have been dropped.</span> <span id="s443">Certainly I knew that once we were at Radio Luxembourg, everything we did was being dropped.</span> <span id="s444">I don’t know whether, before we actually occupied Luxembourg, and Radio Luxembourg, and operated from there, whether the British had decided that simply it was enough to have the BBC, simply because to drop leaflets meant to use air power, and every plane we could spare was being used to bomb.</span> <span id="s445">So I sort of doubt that they would drop leaflets, when we had no capacity to occupy, to get Germans to surrender, and so on.</span> <span id="s446">So I’m not sure that – there may have been some tactical use used in the radio brod – broadcast, but – but we didn’t get that kind of feedback.</span> <span id="s447">But I doubt very much that we dropped any leaflets before we were in a capacity to take prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: So when did your unit shift from Paris to Luxembourg, and what was the reason for the shift?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Let’s see, D-Day was?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: June seventh.</span> <span id="s451">June fourth.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: June fourth, so in July, when we went to Paris, and then about a week later, we were shipped to Luxembourg, which the Germans had evacuated in a hurry.</span> <span id="s453">And they left Radio Luxembourg operating.</span> <span id="s454">And so we took ov – the allies took over Radio Luxembourg and turned it into a broadcasting station to Germany, and to Europe, to France, and to many other languages.</span> <span id="s455">So, basically we were stationed in the radio station, which had large administrative headquarters, and also military bar-barracks of the Luxembourg Army, and the population of Luxembourg was very friendly.</span> <span id="s456">After all, they – they were not – had been occupied.</span> <span id="s457">So, it was a pretty secure place from which to operate.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: And were your radio stations just conveying tactical information from the battlefield, or were you doing anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: We had news programs every hour on the hour in German.</span> <span id="s460">And Radio Luxembourg also had a program that claimed to be a – a group of SS dissidents who had decided that the fuehrer needed protection from the corrupt subordinates, like Goering and Goebbels and Himmler, who were really taking advantage of him, and sabotaging his policies, and that there was a need to clean out these traitors, to enable the fuehrer to retake command, to protect the Fatherland.</span> <span id="s461">And that was the approach of the dissident SS group that a program claimed to be, even though it was broadcast over Radio Luxembourg only five minutes a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: And who was taking the role of the SS [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I don’t know, because they never told us that this program existed.</span> <span id="s464">It was so secret that even we didn’t [phone ringing] Okay?</span> <span id="s465">The – this program, which we called the black propaganda, because it was based on a falsehood.</span> <span id="s466">And that unit, I learned later, broadcast gossip that we picked up from prisoners of war, because we were instructed, when interviewing prisoners of war to find out about their home life, what was going on in the cities where they lived, you know, the soldiers who were being taken prisoners were wondering wer – will they be tortured.</span> <span id="s467">And when we interviewed prisoner of war, we first sat them down and says, would you like some coffee?</span> <span id="s468">And we gave them real coffee, and spoke about the fact, you know, Americans still can buy good coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Did any of them question why your German was so good, or suspect that –</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Yeah, the prisoners of war, or did any of them suspect why your German was so good?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: No, th – I – not a single prisoner ever asked me where – how come I spoke such good German, was I Jewish?</span> <span id="s473">They were too scared.</span> <span id="s474">They may have suspected that I was Jewish, and some prisoners, of course, without being asked, told me about how opposed they were to the persecution of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Now, you say there was another unit that was doing the black propaganda.</span> <span id="s476">What – was your propaganda all white and red?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: In other words, part of the information we were asked to provide was for a service that we didn’t know about, because it was so secret, that it wasn’t shared with us.</span> <span id="s478">I think Harber(ph) knew about the black program, but he never shared it with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Now, did you ever get any reports back about who was actually listening to your radio broadcast, and what effect it had?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: We asked people, and – because severe jail sentences; being sent to the front lines, if you weren’t in the front lines; being sent to concentration camp was a possible punishment for listening.</span> <span id="s481">It was strictly forbidden to listen to any enemy broadcast.</span> <span id="s482">And so it was important for us to find out if they had heard, and we found out that a large proportion – I don’t remember statistics – were – had listened at some times, because they wanted to know what was going on.</span> <span id="s483">And the other thing we did do, is to encourage listenership.</span> <span id="s484">We not only provided accurate information to the Germans, of exactly what was happening, we provided them with information of what was happening to bombed cities and villages, to the extent that we could get information.</span> <span id="s485">And about three months before Christmas, 1944, Harbie(ph) convened a meeting of his 10 soldiers and said, you know, we have a problem what to do on Christmas.</span> <span id="s486">Should we broadcast on bri – Christmas we do every day?</span> <span id="s487">Because after all, our broadcasts are very disturbing to the Germans.</span> <span id="s488">The news every day is not good.</span> <span id="s489">And what should we do on – on Christmas day?</span> <span id="s490">How to somehow appeal to them?</span> <span id="s491">And I proposed that we don’t broadcast any news on that day, since it would be bad, but instead interview prisoners of war to send greetings to their loved ones, and broadcast them.</span> <span id="s492">So the decision was we should announce from months in advance, on Christmas day, we will have 1,000 German prisoners of war personally speak to their families.</span> <span id="s493">W-We learned later that this news spread and was a way of making people think about agwa – if they had a prisoner of war, maybe my son is among the 1,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: What sort of greetings did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: We would ask them to – they had about a little less than a minute.</span> <span id="s496">They could say who they are, that they’re a prisoner of war and so and so, and they’re in this and this camp, that they are feeling well, that they’re healthy, sending greeting to mother and father [indecipherable] and brothers and sisters, and whatever they wanted to say and do through that period.</span> <span id="s497">Many of them talked about that they’re getting good food and that they’re not being tortured and th –</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: And where were these POW camps?</span> <span id="s499">Were they all in Luxembourg, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: No, we would go to the front lines and then simply – our unit had trucks, these news – not – l-like any radio – any radio station, or television station, they have a truck fully equipped to interview and to broadcast, so that we would actually interview people, and get them in at broadcast, or sometimes have them repeat it so that it would fit our pattern, and gradually accumulated enough personnel using these mobile broadcasting ca – trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Been talking about the radio, I want to talk about the print aspect.</span> <span id="s502">You mentioned in Paris that you thought that nothing was dropped because of the bombing, but later on it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: And it wa – na –</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: So tell us about the leaflets and how those were sent over Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Not only leaflets, we also had a newspaper, called “The Front Post,” and they would also be dropped.</span> <span id="s506">They were a little larger, had more information and were overstated.</span> <span id="s507">And they were dropped.</span> <span id="s508">I don’t think they may – probably every two or three days –</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: This is all by airplane?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: By airplane, or by artillery shells.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: And where were they targeted, for cities, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: They were targeted on front line units of the German army.</span> <span id="s513">Occasionally I think we also dropped leaflets, “The Front Post,” not the surrender bre – leaflets.</span> <span id="s514">They were only dropped over the German lines.</span> <span id="s515">But we also would drop newspapers over German villages and cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: And were you able to gauge the effectiveness of these leaflets?</span> <span id="s517">Do you know whether people read them or saved them?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Well, we would interview people and we certainly would get feedbacks that they were being read, but I had no access to the comprehensive reports, so I – I don’t really know whether we reached 25 percent or 40 percent or 50 percent at different times.</span> <span id="s519">But certainly the Germans were not effective to completely stop the use of the material that was being dropped.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: And tell me about the content.</span> <span id="s521">I – you mentioned before that it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Well, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: – largely tactical.</span> <span id="s524">Did you talk about any atrocities in these leaflets?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: The British opposed the idea of focusing on the persecution of the Jews.</span> <span id="s526">They took the position that – a-and a correct position – Hitler was again and again reminding Germans that there wouldn’t be a war, except for the Jews.</span> <span id="s527">And of course, Roosevelt was – was – had his name changed from Rosenfeld(ph) to Roosevelt and that if it weren’t for the Jews, nobody would oppose Hitler.</span> <span id="s528">And the British took the position that focusing on the atrocities would only reinforce the idea that this is what the war was all about.</span> <span id="s529">So you had to get special permission to make any reference to the persecution of the Jews on our news broadcasts.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: So were there any times when you looked for that special permission, any events that were covered?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Well, I think there was evi – there was – I think Auschwitz was mentioned, but not every day, not even every week.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: So let me ask about Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: I mean, when we started to liberate camps, then that was announced.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: So what –</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: But that was very late.</span> <span id="s536">But in ’44, you couldn’t touch the Jewish issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: So we mentioned the liberation of Auschwitz, so were you getting information from the Soviets?</span> <span id="s538">Were they sharing inf – intelligence with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s540">No, no, the exchange of information with the Soviets on that issue, I think was pretty good.</span> <span id="s541">Certainly our leaflets constantly showed the Russian front, which looked much – their advances were much quicker than our advances, so we had to focus on, soon you will be occupied by the Russians.</span> <span id="s542">But we didn’t say, put it this way, we simply said the Russians are advancing, and we are advancing, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s543">We showed on the map that they were advancing much more quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Now I understand there was also information about surrender in these leaflets.</span> <span id="s545">Can you tell –</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Surrender.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Can you talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Well, we took the position, say to the Germans, you’ve lost the war.</span> <span id="s551">If you surrender, you will be – this leaflet will – and this was on every leaflet, is a written guarantee of the condi – [coughing] of the following conditions of surrender: first, you will not be tortured.</span> <span id="s552">You will be sent in a prison camp.</span> <span id="s553">You will get three meals a day, identical to the food of the American or British soldiers, which includes; real coffee three times a day; real cigarettes with every meal; meat and fish.</span> <span id="s554">Healthy food, the way allied soldiers are being fed.</span> <span id="s555">You will be allowed through the Red Cross to communicate with your families, so that if you surrender, you will have contact with your families, which now, very often you don’t have, because the German communication system was not very good in ’44 and ’45.</span> <span id="s556">That was the surrender.</span> <span id="s557">And these guarantee, they called it guarantee [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s558">Quite a few soldiers, when they surrendered, pulled them out of their shoes, or somewhere in their clothing, to be sure that they would be treated properly.</span> <span id="s559">And certainly when we interviewed prisoners of war, we did not use the kind of threats or you know, s – intimidation f-for I think many good reasons.</span> <span id="s560">First of all, tactical information you don’t get from soldiers.</span> <span id="s561">You can sometimes get it from officers, but by the time you get it, all a – it often is no longer valuable.</span> <span id="s562">Because what do we want to know is where do you have your artillery, what kind of weapons do you have, does your unit have?</span> <span id="s563">What plans were made to proceed to defeat us, and so on.</span> <span id="s564">That kind of tactical information, for 24 - 20 - 48 hours might be useful, but with advances of the battlefield, it does – it doesn’t become very meaningful.</span> <span id="s565">So at any rate, while – when you interviewed officers, you would try to learn from them what kind of equipment they had.</span> <span id="s566">You didn’t just f – you didn’t focus on that, you also spent a lot of time on their schooling, how they became officers, what their career was, and were they being treated fairly.</span> <span id="s567">What about their families, how they were doing, their children and so on.</span> <span id="s568">And f – on that basis, people often told us things, how life was terrible, what they were fearful of being arrested simply because they wanted to survive, and that they had been dis – badly treated, and that in particular officer in their command had been very mean and they had suffered this and that and so on.</span> <span id="s569">So that kind of information [indecipherable] obviously, did reach the black station, but we didn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Did they talk much about their views toward the Nazi party?</span> <span id="s571">Did any of them have Nazi membership that they denied, or was this simply not covered?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Some did, very few.</span> <span id="s573">Most of the people tried to avoid politically sensitive things, but they weren’t sophisticate always to know what was sensitive.</span> <span id="s574">So we did get useful information, but we were very circumspect of asking them.</span> <span id="s575">We – we did ask them, were you a member of the Nazi party, and most of them were.</span> <span id="s576">And then they would say, well, understand, everybody had to be a member of the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s577">And then we would learn a little bit about their career.</span> <span id="s578">Some of them were willing to talk, because they thought it might improve the way would – the way would be treated, because they were being treated so well.</span> <span id="s579">And if they were resistant, we withdraw and then send them back, and let them tell their fellow soldiers in the prison camp, I didn’t give them any information, but they didn’t do anything to me.</span> <span id="s580">And thereby enhance our reputation among the prisoners of war, because we would not only interview them – we couldn’t interview everybody who was being captured, there were too many people being captured.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Now, I understand that you actually took in one surrender of a general –</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Von Poten, Ernst von Poten.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Tell us about that incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Well, we were always looking for interesting prisoners, so when the city of Treya(ph) was about to fall, I was sent, as I often was, to go there and find out how mili – to write a report on the – how a military government functioned after the first de – day or two.</span> <span id="s585">And see if there were any interesting prisoners.</span> <span id="s586">So when I got to Treya(ph), the captain who – in charge of military government, been maybe there 24 hours and 48 hours, and had found a German who was willing to be a coordinator between the military government and the German administrative system.</span> <span id="s587">And he had apparently not been a Nazi, so the captain had developed trust.</span> <span id="s588">And when I ask about interesting prisoners, he said, well ba – you better talk to – I have the name now, but I don’t remember just now what the name is.</span> <span id="s589">So I came to his office and he said, oh yes, there’s a general who would like to surrender, but he’s afraid of being taken prisoner by some enlisted group, because they might mistreat him.</span> <span id="s590">He would like to be – he’s hiding, hoping to get arrested by officers, and I know where he is and he told me that’s what he would like to do, and if you are interested, I will tell you where he is.</span> <span id="s591">That was kind of a silly, you know – but I got the instructions and so on, and talked more.</span> <span id="s592">He didn’t know much about the general himself.</span> <span id="s593">My driver, who was married, felt this was a trick to get us into the woods above Treya(ph) where there might still be German soldiers that had been roaming around and would attack us, and this is not a reliable story.</span> <span id="s594">But I had become convinced that it was real, at least there’s a good chance, and so I said, let’s go and get him and he had – my driver had no choice, I – I happened to b-be one grade above him.</span> <span id="s595">So, we went with our regular broadcasting truck, and followed directions and drove up into the woods and after about maybe half an hour, I saw a man walking with a – a dog and von Poten had been described to me of having a dog.</span> <span id="s596">And so we stopped.</span> <span id="s597">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: [indecipherable] take a call right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: This time I’m taking [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Okay, this begins the next track with the interview with Joseph Eaton.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Well, a man who looked like the general that was described, and the fact that he was walking with a dog, we stopped the truck.</span> <span id="s602">And I opened the window and said, General von Poten?</span> <span id="s603">He looked up and said, jawohl?</span> <span id="s604">Sort of, yes.</span> <span id="s605">And I said, I understand you want to surrender?</span> <span id="s606">He said yes.</span> <span id="s607">I said, well, I was sent by supreme headquarters to take your surrender.</span> <span id="s608">Thank you, he said, I’m glad how – that you got the message.</span> <span id="s609">And here is, about 200 meters from here is a cottage in which we have been living since I was fired from my post a month ago, or two months ago.</span> <span id="s610">So please, let’s sit down comfortably in my house.</span> <span id="s611">So he walked and we drove and he went into the house and brought out his wife and introduced her.</span> <span id="s612">And so my driver was suspicious, he didn’t go in, and I went into the house and we sat down.</span> <span id="s613">But the small room was crowded with furniture covered with bed sheets.</span> <span id="s614">And we sat down on a couch and started to talk.</span> <span id="s615">He pulled out documents signed by the chief – the commander of the German army, General Keitel, informing him that the fuehrer had decided that the army needed more young people; they weren’t sufficiently aggressive to push ahead, and for that reason, in spite of his good service, he was being retired.</span> <span id="s616">He appealed the forced retirement, but the appeal was denied.</span> <span id="s617">All of this was in correspondence signed by no one less than the counterpart of Eisenhower, the chief commander of the German army.</span> <span id="s618">So, I took those documents and he said he decided, even though he was no longer a soldier, he said, I’m a civilian now, but he decided that as a former general, he might be considered someone to be made a prisoner of war, he hoped this would not be the case, but this is why he let the message be transmitted that he was ready to be in touch with the enemy.</span> <span id="s619">He indicated in conversations about the war, I learned – he and I talked about his career.</span> <span id="s620">So, he said, I became a soldier before World War I, and served in the Austrian army, and he told me the different battles.</span> <span id="s621">And then stayed in the Austrian army and then when Germany occupied Austria, he became part of the German army.</span> <span id="s622">And he was involved in the war against Russia and was in-injured near Stalingrad, and for a year and a half was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s623">And after he had recuperated, the army assigned him to be the governor of the French city of Metz.</span> <span id="s624">And he showed me documents there, his appointment.</span> <span id="s625">And he indicated that he had problems with the head of the Nazi party in Metz.</span> <span id="s626">Metz is a French city, occupied mostly by German speaking people, so it’s part of Alsace-Lorraine that had been transferred after World War I, to France.</span> <span id="s627">And he said, I had problems with the local Nazi leader.</span> <span id="s628">When I got the job, they offered me several villas, but they were all taken from Jews.</span> <span id="s629">And my wife and I didn’t want to live in a house that was full of tears, so we didn’t take them, we went into an apartment.</span> <span id="s630">He may have realized that I was Jewish, but he didn’t ask me.</span> <span id="s631">And then I was in – had trouble with the Nazi party leader, because I took the position that for security purposes, we had to choo – treat the local population well.</span> <span id="s632">So I went to French music events, French theater, not only the German theater, and the Nazi leader felt that was not a proper thing to do, for the commanding general to go to a French theater production.</span> <span id="s633">And he complained to Himmler and asked that he be dismissed, and apparently succeeded; Himmler supported his retirement.</span> <span id="s634">All of this was in documents.</span> <span id="s635">So, I se – I then ask him, well, what you – what would you recommend that Germany do today?</span> <span id="s636">He said, we’ve lost the war, we have to accept unconditional surrender, because every day major German villages and cities are devastated, and we are not gaining anything.</span> <span id="s637">It’s – we’ve lost.</span> <span id="s638">So I said, would you be willing to tell this to the German population if you had a chance?</span> <span id="s639">He says, of course.</span> <span id="s640">And then I told him that he was a lucky man, that he had the opportunity to do this right now, because there was a broadcasting station in my truck.</span> <span id="s641">So he got caught, and I gave him a pen and paper, and I found he had great difficulty writing a script, so I offered to write it, help him draft it.</span> <span id="s642">Well, what are you going to say?</span> <span id="s643">He said okay, and I drafted a speech, thinking in terms of what is he likely to say?</span> <span id="s644">So, you know, he wasn’t advocating to surrender, because Germany had done terrible things.</span> <span id="s645">He – he had no regrets about moving into Russia and whatever he-helped in Russia, and you know, every command was one that he tried to execute.</span> <span id="s646">He simply was willing to surrender because it was better for Germany.</span> <span id="s647">So he modified my remarks, his German was much better than mine.</span> <span id="s648">And then I said let’s – I sat him into the truck doing exactly what you are doing, and we listened to the broadcast.</span> <span id="s649">And then I had him do it two more times, because it didn’t sound as good as I thought it wou – should be.</span> <span id="s650">And afterwards I told him that he should put on his uniform, and asked him if he had any weapons, and the only thing he had was a sword and a pistol, and I took both of those.</span> <span id="s651">And he dressed in his army uniform and I said, well, I have to take you to headquarters to – for them to decide whether you are to become a prisoner of war, or a civilian and could be treated as a civilian.</span> <span id="s652">And so he gave me more papers to document his status.</span> <span id="s653">And put him into a truck late at night, the front seat, I sat in the back because again, I didn’t trust him to sit in back of me, and drove to Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s654">We got there about four o’clock in the morning and I called my commanding officer in his quarters and told him that I got a general.</span> <span id="s655">And Harber(ph), who had a good sense of humor says, Eaton, why don’t you drive more carefully?</span> <span id="s656">And after telling him a little bit more about the general, I said, well, why don’t we h-have breakfast with him, because I think everybody else here would like to meet him.</span> <span id="s657">The Americans had not captured a general up to now on the western front like the Russians side.</span> <span id="s658">And there was a – well, you n – as you know, in Stalingrad a Russian general who actually then organized troops to fight with the Russians against Hitler.</span> <span id="s659">So, at about five o’clock, we – the cook had prepared good breakfast, bacon and eggs and trimmings, and the colonel and majors and captains were all assembled.</span> <span id="s660">There was one thing that I forgot to tell you, I had been told that the general was terribly worried about being taken prisoner by enlisted men, he thought he would be mistreated.</span> <span id="s661">So I decided I would make myself an officer.</span> <span id="s662">That was a risky thing to do, to impersonate an officer in the army.</span> <span id="s663">But you know, we had a great deal of freedom in my cir – in other words, there was nobody telling me what to do when I went to the front lines.</span> <span id="s664">It was my decision to decide where, which camp to go to, whom to interview, which American officers to ask for cooperation.</span> <span id="s665">So, before going up in the hills, early in the morning, about eight or 8:30, I asked Germans where there was a drugstore, and I went to the drugstore, which wasn’t open yet, rang the bell.</span> <span id="s666">The druggist answered when he saw, I guess, the military truck outside and looked worried, of course.</span> <span id="s667">And I said, I need a Band-Aid.</span> <span id="s668">Well, that was an easy request.</span> <span id="s669">So he immediately got a box of Band-Aids.</span> <span id="s670">And ask him for a scissors and I cut two pieces of the rubberized part of the Band-Aid, which is white on the other side, and put it on the helmet and promoted myself to captain.</span> <span id="s671">And so, when I took the general into, you know, custody, I introduced myself as Captain Eaton, who had been sent by supreme headquarters to accept his surrender.</span> <span id="s672">So, you know, he felt sort of pleased that somehow supreme headquarters – and that may have had a fact – an impact on his re-readiness to cooperate.</span> <span id="s673">So I had told Harbie(ph) on the phone what I had done.</span> <span id="s674">And when I arrived everybody treated me as Captain Eaton, and – and my driver was sort of amazed that I – nobody criticized me, and then afterwards a decision was made to clear with supreme headquarters what to do with the general, that we would use him to work for us at Radio Luxembourg, and in the – the day or two that this might take, we put up the general in the hotel, and my job, I was in the same room with him, was to take him for walks, see to it that he got his rations, and talk to him.</span> <span id="s675">And then introduce him, bring him to different officers who wanted to talk to him, for whatever information they were interested in.</span> <span id="s676">And after da – a day or two, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s677">So I was able to talk to Captain Harber(ph), he said well, we are having problems with this man, and I don’t know what’s going to happen, but it doesn’t look good, because some of the senior officials in Eisenhower’s headquarters are concerned over the fact that you took this general in Third Army territory and brought him to Luxembourg, when according to army rules, which you didn’t know and I didn’t know, you f – all prisoners of war have to be cleared through the prison camps.</span> <span id="s678">And you didn’t clear him through the prison camp, you took him directly to headquarters.</span> <span id="s679">And some people are talking about court-martialing not only you, but me and the colonel.</span> <span id="s680">So, it took two weeks before a decision was made not to court-martial us.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: What happened to the broadcast?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Nothing, it wasn’t used.</span> <span id="s683">Apparently, there was enough fear among the upper level staff that Patton would get furious if someone that was captured in his area was not – did not – he did not have the opportunity to handle the whole situation.</span> <span id="s684">And for that reason, rather than get into another controversy between Patton and Bradley and Eisenhower – and there had been many controversies between them, I mean, they – Patton was very egocentric – the decision was made to return the captain to where we had taken him prisoner and then to notify the French, the free French, who had been asked to move into Treya(ph) as the Third Army was advancing, to come up and arrest him.</span> <span id="s685">So my job, they says – an-an – and – and – and they said, we decided you should do the job.</span> <span id="s686">So here was my – I-I was given another driver, and it was my job to find the place where I had taken him prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: I want to shift the focus now.</span> <span id="s688">We’ve been talking about your role as an American soldier and I want to talk about your attitudes as a Jewish soldier, and the war at this point is winding down.</span> <span id="s689">I understand that you took advantage of the fact that you had use of a car to actually explore and see what happened to your own family.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yeah, well, shortly before being sent overseas, apparently army policy was to naturalize enemy aliens, especially people like myself, who had a very high security position.</span> <span id="s691">So I was given a three day leave to travel to Chicago to go before a judge who – I don’t think he ever tested me as normally citizenship people ar – application for citizenship, with being in the army, it – the whole thing was about five minutes.</span> <span id="s692">And the – so I had become a citizen.</span> <span id="s693">The – and I was a citizen in England and – when serving over i-in Germany.</span> <span id="s694">The – obviously w-we all knew what was – that the Germans were murdering Jews in large numbers.</span> <span id="s695">Exactly what was happening, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s696">You heard rumors of Auschwitz, you heard – you knew that in concentration camps many people were tortured, and some people were killed.</span> <span id="s697">But you didn’t know any of the full details at all.</span> <span id="s698">And in my unit of 10 people, I think there were two who were not Jewish, all the others were.</span> <span id="s699">And we didn’t talk about being Jewish.</span> <span id="s700">There were German refugees like myself and Captain Harber(ph), we knew had been born into a Jewish family, but we didn’t know what his sympathies were, that he had been converted.</span> <span id="s701">And none of my fellow soldiers and I ever talked about the Jewish problem.</span> <span id="s702">They didn’t seem to ever talk about it.</span> <span id="s703">And so, it – it’s something you kept to yourself, but I was very much aware, not only of what was – we knew was happening to Jews, that they had been murdered in large numbers in Russia, that – that we had heard.</span> <span id="s704">But I also knew that – what was going on in Palestine, so whenever there was news available, I was particularly interested in.</span> <span id="s705">And so, as a result, I took a special interest in Jews.</span> <span id="s706">And one of my assignments was to enter Germany as soon as we occupied a few villages around Aachen.</span> <span id="s707">And wherever I went, I would ask, are any – what happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s708">And the – Monschau didn’t have Jews, but in Aachen, which we occupied around oc – middle of October, and I arrived there maybe two or three days after occupation, I learned from the public relations officer that one Jew had bi – had survived.</span> <span id="s709">And the army had seen to it that he would get a s – a reasonable quarter, and he gave me the address.</span> <span id="s710">So, I – you know, I – wasn’t difficult to find out where to go, because you asked people, and he was put into a building that had been – the upper part had been destroyed, but the first floor, the four walls were standing, there were no windows, the door could not be closed, but it was better than most, you know, l-living in a cellar.</span> <span id="s711">And he had put a big sign on the door, Jude.</span> <span id="s712">And so when I came in and introduced myself, he was very happy to see me.</span> <span id="s713">He had a chair and insisted I sit on the chair, and he stood, in his warm clothing, he had no gloves.</span> <span id="s714">So I gave him my gloves and a scarf, and we talked about what happened.</span> <span id="s715">And he explained to me that just before deportation, the Germans deported all the Jews from Aachen, but because they had Christian friends, he and his wife were able to move into the suburb and be hidden.</span> <span id="s716">Unfortunately, his wife got caught in the city, and his – was deported.</span> <span id="s717">He – but he survived.</span> <span id="s718">And he described himself as being a member of the B’nai Brith and didn’t know any Hebrew, but he had been to synagogues and knew something about prayers.</span> <span id="s719">And he thought that probably he would be safe now in Aachen.</span> <span id="s720">But – and that’s why he put the sign up, and he felt that he was – he didn’t know of any other Jew who survived.</span> <span id="s721">Well, apparently the people in military government looked after him subsequently.</span> <span id="s722">He was seep – he got a job in military government as somebody who could be trusted, and ultimately turned out to be a member of the city council and became head of a new Jewish community, because there were a few survivors who drifted back to Aachen and so the province decided to facilitate the development of a Jewish community, and he actually became its head, I think, for the rest of his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Did he have any details on where people were deported to, and what happened to them after they were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: He knew they were deported, he didn’t know where.</span> <span id="s725">He knew about Theresienstadt, but he didn’t – the details were not known to him, it’s ju – they had disappeared, and he was really worried that they might not come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Now, you mentioned Theresienstadt; you yourself visited; you talk about that visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: The visit to Theresienstadt that you made.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s730">Now, when Buchenwald was liberated, by that time much of my work was to – well, nearly all of my work was to visit different cities or villages or camps that we had liberated, to write reports for supreme headquarters.</span> <span id="s731">So I decided I would go to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s732">All I had to do was tell Captain Harber(ph) I’d like to go to Buchenwald, he said fine.</span> <span id="s733">I got orders [indecipherable] you know, within a few hours, and a driver, and off we went.</span> <span id="s734">So that’s how I got to Buchenwald, to write reports.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: What were your main impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Well, it was impossible to describe.</span> <span id="s737">I mean, you drove into a camp, and you were greeted with piles of corpses, maybe up as high as this – the ceiling here.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: About how many days after liberation was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: That was five, six days.</span> <span id="s740">When I arrived, I inquired how – how the former prisoners were being dealt with, and I quickly discovered that Jews had succeeded to be in a special barracks, even though originally, the Americans had decided that prison – the people liberated, Poles would go into a barrack and Yugoslavs and Germans, pris – inmates, and then they discovered that the Jews didn’t want to be with the Poles and didn’t want to be with the Yugoslavs, and they simply refused.</span> <span id="s741">So, the local commander said okay, I’ll give you your own barracks.</span> <span id="s742">And – and that happened within – on the first day.</span> <span id="s743">So I went to the Jewish barrack and introduced myself, and we sat down, I said, what are the problems?</span> <span id="s744">Are you getting enough food?</span> <span id="s745">And they said, well, we’re getting our share.</span> <span id="s746">And – but they were complaining about the administrative problems they had of getting recognized as a nationality.</span> <span id="s747">So we discussed the political aspects, pointed out to them that the British government had a strong, vested interest in preventing the establishment of Jews as a separate nationality, because of what was th – their commitment in Palestine, that they had made a decision that they made a mistake in 1917, there were many more Arabs than Jews, and they didn’t – they didn’t want to lose support of the Muslims, and so they had made an agreement, and until that can be overturned, the British were pushing very hard to oppose recognition of Jews.</span> <span id="s748">But on the other hand, Jews shouldn’t be worried, and simply, they had the power to refuse.</span> <span id="s749">They should insist on whatever they want, because there was strong political support of their position in the American Jewish community, and to some extent in the British community.</span> <span id="s750">So they had done the right thing and they should be very assertive and so on.</span> <span id="s751">So we talked about that, basically was mos – much of the time.</span> <span id="s752">In addition to getting information for my reports, that was the focus of my visit.</span> <span id="s753">After all, I only spent maybe four or five hours in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Now, I know that one of your reports was on the children of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s755">Did you actually go into the children’s barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: And can you talk about your reaction when you saw it?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Well, ah – the – first of all, many children were with adults, either because they were related, and I couldn’t quite understand how they survived, or because they were being looked after by adults who wanted to protect them, and so on.</span> <span id="s759">So, the children and [indecipherable] adolescents lived for – with the – with the adults.</span> <span id="s760">I don’t recall that there was a children’s barrack.</span> <span id="s761">There were not many children.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: And did any of the Jewish prisoners ask you to take messages back?</span> <span id="s763">Did they put [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Well, a few, even in Buchenwald would give me letters, but not many.</span> <span id="s765">I wasn’t there long enough.</span> <span id="s766">It wasn’t like in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s767">And so the – I think I got two or three letters in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s768">I was there for a very short period of time, because you know, I had to bring back reports to headquarters.</span> <span id="s769">For all I know, those reports were shared with upper level command.</span> <span id="s770">I couldn’t tell you exactly who read them, but you know, like any reports coming in from the ground, sometimes they will reach – I’m sure some of them were read by Eisenhower.</span> <span id="s771">And I did talk in these reports not only about conditions in the – and how the prisoner of war were organized and how they had been able to kill some of the guards, but I also talked about the fact that there were special problems with Jews who didn’t want to be with Poles, and certainly didn’t want to be with Germans.</span> <span id="s772">And those reports went to upper levels, whatever their impact – impact might have been, but certainly the American high level command became aware of the fact that this was a very touchy problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: And then what other camps did you visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: I – I visited Buchenwald, and I was at Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s775">And Theresienstadt was very unexpected, because when Theresienstadt was liberated in late April, and the news came across, it was in the Russian zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Before we get there, let me just ask one question en route.</span> <span id="s777">At this point, what information did you have about your parents?</span> <span id="s778">When did you – where they had gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: I kn-knew nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: So did you know that German Jews were sent to Theresienstadt, or was just –</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: There was a possib – I knew that many German Jews were sent to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s782">So the possibility that they might have gone to Theresienstadt was there, and we knew Jews had survived there.</span> <span id="s783">So, as soon as that happened, I went to my commanding officer and told him I’d like to go to Theresienstadt to get the names of the liberated people.</span> <span id="s784">Did he think this was a good idea, even though it was in the Russian zone?</span> <span id="s785">And he thought it was.</span> <span id="s786">And so, within hours I had orders, I think they were signed by General Bradley, to go into the Russian zone, to the libera – to Theresienstadt, to carry out the instructions of the theater commander, that was Eisenhower, that f – were my orders.</span> <span id="s787">Had a ja – had a driver, and went to the commissary and stocked up with gasoline and food to the hilt, and off we went.</span> <span id="s788">I had been, as a child, in Marienbad, or Mariánské Lázně, which in Czech.</span> <span id="s789">So we drove through that community, where I remembered the f – you know, a few places, and got to Prague.</span> <span id="s790">We didn’t encounter any Russian troops, because Theresienstadt was pretty close to as far as the Russians got.</span> <span id="s791">The Americans – Patton had actually gotten to Prague, and then later had to withdraw from Prague because of an agreement that Eisenhower had made with Stalin that Czechoslovakia would be turned over to them, so – but at that time, the first time we encountered Russians was in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s792">And we were not allowed to enter the camp, because – the explanation was there was a typhus epidemic, and we would have to wait until it was under control.</span> <span id="s793">So for about two days, we found a place to sleep, we waited til the camp was open, and then over to Theresienstadt and ask for the commanding officer.</span> <span id="s794">Well, being the only American I’m taken immediately to the right place, and was invited into the barrack where he was sitting, a room like this.</span> <span id="s795">And he’s surrounded by a few people talking Russian.</span> <span id="s796">And I showed him my orders and he called over a translator to look at my orders and tell him what they were, and saw the signature of my officer.</span> <span id="s797">So, pat me down, and then said [phone ringing] – so, it’s easier to talk on the phone without the hearing aid, because apparently they interfere with each other.</span> <span id="s798">So, b-before he answered me about the information, he said, through this interpreter, why are the Americans killing Russian soldiers?</span> <span id="s799">I said, that’s impossible, they are our allies, they liberated, th-they – he said, well, I read it in “Pravda.”</span> <span id="s800">I said, I certainly will check into it, and we [indecipherable] headquarters [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s801">I didn’t ask him for a copy of the report in “Pravda.”</span> <span id="s802">It didn’t – after that exchange, he dropped the matter.</span> <span id="s803">And he said, I s – I – I’m sending somebody to talk to the head of the Jewish community, so they will get ready, to get the names ready for you.</span> <span id="s804">And he poured a glass of liquor and offered me a big glass like that.</span> <span id="s805">And I realized that I could never keep up with him, so I cur – it occurred to me how to get out of it, I said, I – I have a very sad problem.</span> <span id="s806">He says, what’s the problem?</span> <span id="s807">I have a ruptured thorax, and alcohol will irritate it, I can’t drink anything.</span> <span id="s808">Well, he felt very bad about me, but he wanted to drink.</span> <span id="s809">And the whole table had been filled with bottles.</span> <span id="s810">I mean, the alc – the conc – the alcoholism among the upper level command was apparent.</span> <span id="s811">And underneath the table were radios that had been confiscated, so he offered me a radio, which I explained to him I had one, so I didn’t want to deprive others of the radio, so I didn’t take a radio.</span> <span id="s812">But then I was taken by a Russian soldier to meet Leo Baeck, who was in charge of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s813">And we sat down on his bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Did you know who Leo Baeck was ahead of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s816">I knew who he was.</span> <span id="s817">I didn’t know he was the head of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s818">I didn’t know had – he had survived.</span> <span id="s819">I knew about him as a Reform rabbi in Berlin, but I knew nothing else about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Tell me about your meeting with Rabbi Baeck.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Well, the fact that he survived was almost incredible.</span> <span id="s822">He said, well, the Germans apparently decided I should live.</span> <span id="s823">Because so many other people were killed, some – some rabbis were sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s824">They obviously thought I was – would be of use to them.</span> <span id="s825">And he was describing a little bit of how the camp was organized, that Jews were doing all the work, they been paid for the work, and with this money they would get their very limited rations.</span> <span id="s826">And they could use that money and I – I got some, you know, samples of the money.</span> <span id="s827">And he had a register of all persons who had ever been there, including information when they were deported or – or murdered.</span> <span id="s828">And I got a copy, which I took with me, and delivered to headquarters.</span> <span id="s829">And I presume this may have been used to evacuate the liberated people, which happened very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Did you have a chance to go through the names?</span> <span id="s831">Did any sound familiar to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Oh yes, I mean, I saw – the only one I saw was my grandmother.</span> <span id="s833">She had been there, and I learned from somebody who knew her, when I mentioned this, that she starved to death, she died of malnutrition.</span> <span id="s834">She was 72 years of age.</span> <span id="s835">As did many other people.</span> <span id="s836">If they didn’t have good jobs, where they could steal food, they had real pro – survival problems, because the rations were rations that did not susta – allow you to sustain normal health.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Tell me, what was Leo Baeck’s reaction when you came in – and I assume you identified yourself as having been a German Jewish refugee coming back with the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Well, I mean, he – Leo Baeck at that time said he wasn’t sure what would happen, but he – he didn’t want to go back to Berlin, because he knew the community, he was among the last to be deported, so he – the synagogues had been burned or destroyed; the Jewish community center, there was – there was no community, so he had – he didn’t want to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s839">And he said, that’s true of most of the German Jews here.</span> <span id="s840">But some did want to go back because they had property and so on, but he had nothing left in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Did he ask for your help with anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Did anybody else that you meet there ask for –</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: The only thing people ask for is to deliver letters.</span> <span id="s845">They recognized apparently that – I explained to people how I got there, I said I was – that the Russians were willing to let us take the names, but it was – the Russians were in charge, so they realized I couldn’t do anything, since it was the Russians.</span> <span id="s846">And apparently the Russians had treat – treated them – allowed them to organize the camp – well, the camp was already organized under the Germans, but now they treated them with great respect, and they looked after the sick.</span> <span id="s847">And Russian physicians would be available to provide treatment, to provide medicines.</span> <span id="s848">In other words, they wa – they were being given services by the Russians within the limits of what the Russians had, which was damn little.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Now, well, let’s go back.</span> <span id="s850">When you mentioned that the registrar, that register that Leo Baeck had, mentioned dates that people were deported, did he know himself where the deportations were going?</span> <span id="s851">Did he know that these [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yeah, he knew – he knew they went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: And did he know the ramifications?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Yeah, he knew they went to Auschwitz and he knew that they would – they would die there.</span> <span id="s855">I mean, he said, this was – the Germans tried to misrepresent the Red Cross, that this was a – a Jewish community, self-governed by the Jews to – while they should not be in Germany, they could be in a community of their own, but this was just a showpiece.</span> <span id="s856">And so he – he certainly outlined this, and that the – the Nazis would punish Jews severely if they violated any of the rules and some Jews were – were hanged or shot.</span> <span id="s857">And when the camp became overcrowded, they would deport some people to make room for others to come.</span> <span id="s858">And as far as he was concerned, there was no future for German Jewry.</span> <span id="s859">That he did say.</span> <span id="s860">And he later on made that statement publicly, in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: So how long did you remain in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: In Theresienstadt, I think I was there for a day.</span> <span id="s863">We did not spend the night there.</span> <span id="s864">My job was to get the information, go back.</span> <span id="s865">And they were pretty quick in give – giving us the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: And when you got back, and you presented the names in the register, did – was there any reaction among the people in your unit when they saw all the lists of deported, and that?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Again, while there were many Jews in the system, they were all afraid to talk about the Jewish problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: And they weren’t looking on their own in private to see if their families were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s870">I’m sure they were interested.</span> <span id="s871">I mean, I am sure my commanding – I’ve never discussed it with Harber(ph), how b – when I – but when I think back of it, how come any time I wanted something, I got it?</span> <span id="s872">I was a sergeant, but I could get anything from Harber(ph), and because of the fact that he personally was very sympathetic.</span> <span id="s873">But again, to protect himself, he didn’t want to be viewed as a spokesperson for the Jews, especially since officially he wasn’t even Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: And at this point –</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: I mean, later on, 20 years later, he wrote a book about Palestine, a very positive book about king – about how Palestine was working and so on.</span> <span id="s876">But this was the first time that Hans had ever even officially discussed his Jewish background.</span> <span id="s877">And later on I did meet him socially, and he spoke very openly about the fact that he – his father had converted out of purely op-opportunistic purposes, but he certainly got no Jewish background, other than what he acquired later on as he grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: And at this period of time, just as the war was ending, were you able to communicate – correspond at all to your brothers who were in the Jewish brigade?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Well, in the army I was able to use military mail to write to my brothers.</span> <span id="s880">There was no longer any possibility of writing to my parents after 19 – after December seventh – no, no, that’s not ri – eighth, 1941.</span> <span id="s881">And I wasn’t in the army at that time anyhow, but there was no mail between the U.S. and Germany.</span> <span id="s882">But there certainly was mail between the U.S. and Palestine.</span> <span id="s883">So I corresponded maybe once a week with my brothers in Palestine, and we continued to correspond through army mail, which was pretty efficient.</span> <span id="s884">So I knew that my oldest brother had been stationed in Rome in 1944, in the Jewish brigade, and I knew his address.</span> <span id="s885">So I would send him copies of some of my reports about what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s886">And our reports, I think in today’s army would, at least for weeks or months be considered confidential or secret, but security concerns didn’t exist at that time, so I had no qualms about sen – taking a report and sending my brother a copy.</span> <span id="s887">And then he translated the report in Hebrew and it got published in “Haaretz,” because in addition to being a soldier, “Haaretz” had asked him to be a – what – you know, a – a part time correspondent.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: So which reports of yours, on what topics, were republished in “Haaretz?”</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: I don’t – I would have to look at the – at the actual reports.</span> <span id="s890">I think the report about Buchenwald, and I think the report – I mean, part of the report on Theresienstadt, and I think Frankfurt, which had some Jewish content.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Now we – go back to the list of names.</span> <span id="s892">At this period of time, I know the Jewish chaplains were collecting names and trying to reunite families.</span> <span id="s893">Did the list ever make it to the Jewish chaplains?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Oh, I’m s – I’m sure they – I mean, I don’t know what happened to the list, but considering the efficiency of the army, and considering, for example, what happened to one of my mother’s cousins that survived in Auschwitz – I mean in – in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s895">The various allied governments were very quick in evacuating the [indecipherable] to Belgium, to Holland, to France, to Italy, you know, where you could – naturally, you couldn’t send – Jews didn’t want to go to Poland, Jews didn’t want to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s896">So – and most Russian Jews were able to claim that they were Polish, and maybe they were.</span> <span id="s897">At any rate, I don’t remember that Jews were among those forced by the allies to go back to Russia.</span> <span id="s898">So, I can’t tell you what happened to the list.</span> <span id="s899">But keep in mind, we had what, two or three – Rabbi na-nad – Nadich, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Oh, Judah Nadich?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Nadich, and maybe one – one or two other, that’s all the rabbis were available in the whole district.</span> <span id="s902">And they were very busy men.</span> <span id="s903">They had to conduct services, and they were part of high level of command.</span> <span id="s904">So they had problems getting around, as I did.</span> <span id="s905">And so my hunch is that when the means became available, they were transmitted to them.</span> <span id="s906">But I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Now, after V-E Day, your job changed a bit –</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: – with the occupation.</span> <span id="s910">What was your new job?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Well, after V-J Day, and even before ge – V-J Day, once we entered Germany in October ’44, the newspaper of Aachen and the newspaper later on of Cologne was shut down.</span> <span id="s912">And Harber(ph) convinced Eisenhower that we should establish a free press in German, which ultimately would be turned over to the Germans, after they saw how a free press functions.</span> <span id="s913">And that was approved.</span> <span id="s914">So he had approval to establish 10 German newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: And why did they select the number 10?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: And they selected them in different cities, to cover whole regions.</span> <span id="s917">So there were two in Bavaria, one in Munich, and the other one in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s918">But when we occupied Regensburg, we didn’t find a printing plant that operated.</span> <span id="s919">So, i-it had to be moved to Straubing, but it was published as the Regensburger(ph) Post.</span> <span id="s920">So, in – the Munich press ultimately became the Süddeutsche Zeitung.</span> <span id="s921">It – It was, I think [indecipherable] but later on it became – when it became German, they changed the name.</span> <span id="s922">It is today Germany’s – one of Germany’s top newspapers, like “The New York Times.”</span> <span id="s923">And Hans Harber(ph) actually stayed in Germany after occupation ended and the Germans took over, to remain as editor of the Süddeutsche Zeitung for two or three years to get it going.</span> <span id="s924">So Harber(ph) decided he – he had 10 men, so each of us was given a newspaper.</span> <span id="s925">And I think two people had occasionally written articles for newspapers, but none of us had been editors of a newspaper.</span> <span id="s926">But that’s how ha – Harbie(ph) operated, so overnight I suddenly became editor of a newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Now, were you this – just the editor?</span> <span id="s928">Were you also the only staff writer?</span> <span id="s929">Was there anybody working for you, or [indecipherable] operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Well, I had no staff, I was sent to Straubing to-together with a administrative staff, there were two officers and three or four enlisted man whose job was to, first of all, find living quarters, and to have a kitchen of food for the four or five men and the – and me, as the editor.</span> <span id="s931">Basically, that unit existed to make sure I had transportation and food and able to run the newspaper.</span> <span id="s932">So my – I decided that it – that the building of the press was well preserved, the editor had an apartment there, a very big apartment.</span> <span id="s933">And I decided that I might as well live right in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s934">And my commanding officer thought that, you know, it was a good idea, so I didn’t live with the other enlisted men in quarter that they had established; I had my own quarters in the newspaper, so I could be on top of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: And how often did the paper come out?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Once a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: And where’d you get the articles?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: So – so the articles, the – the press was based on a very small staffing, because we didn’t have much, all we had is this one – the editors.</span> <span id="s939">So what was done is that all 10 newspapers would get the national, international news, which was produced by Harber(ph) and his staff in Bad Nauheim.</span> <span id="s940">So, since each of the newspapers was four pages, there were three pages of national and international news, and a local page.</span> <span id="s941">As editor my job was to get information for the local page.</span> <span id="s942">And I decided what goes to the local page.</span> <span id="s943">Harber(ph) didn’t have time to even look at the local pages.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Do you remember the types of articles –</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: – subjects of any of your articles?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: So, it was up i-in – the other three pages would be speeches by the president [indecipherable] speeches by Eisenhower, speeches by Churchill and major news about what was going on in Russia and so on, but was all written in Eisenhower’s headquarter.</span> <span id="s948">And this was the first time I di – I flew, because they sent a helicopter to Bad Na – to Straubing, pick me up, take me to Bad Nauheim to get the material on Wednesday for the Friday’s newspaper, fly me back, just for that purpose.</span> <span id="s949">And it was a big scary, because these Piper Cubs are not well put together.</span> <span id="s950">I mean, you – when you sit in the Piper Cub there are two seats, the pilot and me.</span> <span id="s951">And you can look down on the side of your seat because it was open, so you can look down.</span> <span id="s952">And you flew very low.</span> <span id="s953">The Piper Cubs don’t go up high – very high, so we were very close to the ground.</span> <span id="s954">And so that happened every week, and I think once I was asked to drive in the Jeep, and I drove myself.</span> <span id="s955">And so at any rate, that’s how they got the – the main contact.</span> <span id="s956">Now, the local c-contact, that was entirely up to me.</span> <span id="s957">So you had to think of stories that would appeal to the Germans.</span> <span id="s958">And so I would have stories about food rationing, I would have stories about local military government.</span> <span id="s959">I would have stories about opening of schools.</span> <span id="s960">I would have stories about some interesting hospital case.</span> <span id="s961">I also – I learned that there was a Jewish girl who had been hidden by Germans, by 20 different Germans.</span> <span id="s962">So I – when I heard about it, I looked for her and I found out where she was.</span> <span id="s963">Her name, I think, was Sonja(ph) Navay(ph), and she was 16 years of age, and she had been blonde.</span> <span id="s964">Her mother and father were taken away.</span> <span id="s965">She didn’t know where they were.</span> <span id="s966">But friends of the family had hidden her and then turned her over to others because they felt it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s967">So 20 different German families, so I made that a feature story.</span> <span id="s968">And it was on my page, and then Harber(ph) decided that was a good story, so that became – was reprinted in all the other newspapers.</span> <span id="s969">So some of the stories I wrote were copied, and I came to the conclusion that the German governor of Bavaria was not too sympathetic towards Jews, because he urged that the policy that had been adopted that Jews would get double rations, because they had been so deprived and emaciated, he felt that was unfair.</span> <span id="s970">And he lobbied in favor of giving Jews the same amount of food as everybody else.</span> <span id="s971">So I decided he has to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Did he ne –</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: So, I mean, I – I wrote articles that criticized his policies, and I don’t know whether that’s why he ultimately was fired, but he was fired.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Did anyone at Straubing know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Did the Germans know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: By that time they knew wa – they – they knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s978">First of all, the editor that I replaced was a smart German, a Swiss German.</span> <span id="s979">And, you know, when people asked me, I told them, so – so I didn’t go into many details about my family, anything else [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s980">So th-the second reason why it became clear I was Jewish is because I featured stories about ous – the Jewish – the reorganization of a Jewish community in Degendorf, where there has been no Jews, but DPs and how they were operating, or marriage of Jews in – of a Jew in some community.</span> <span id="s981">And the fact that it turned out that the secretary that had been found for me, somebody who was very good in German, turned out to be a German Jewish woman who hu – who’s – had been a Polish nationality deported to Poland, and there she was able to hide that she was Jewish and survived as a Pole.</span> <span id="s982">And she was hired as a Pole, but when she discovered that I was very interested in Jewish affairs and wrote reports on the subject, she confessed that she had been hiding her Jewish identity because she really didn’t think that the – didn’t think you could trust the Americans, since she had some early interactions with American officers who tried to pressure her to sleep with them, and she felt they were just like the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Now, this time when you were in Regensburg and said that you also visited Hitler’s birthplace, and start to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Well, that was – when Braunau was occupied by the Americans, I immediately said, I gotta go there and do a story about Hitler’s birthplace, so I drove there and just went to the military government headquarters and there I met a Mr. Fagas(ph), who looked a lot like Hitler, but he had been a socialist, had never been in the party.</span> <span id="s985">He was appointed acting mayor.</span> <span id="s986">So I talked to him for a while and asked where – where’s Hitler’s birthplace?</span> <span id="s987">He took me there.</span> <span id="s988">It was a lib – public library, had been a public library.</span> <span id="s989">So I went into the building and there were a lot of books and also the local newspaper had been published there, so they had a photographic division, a lot of German photographs.</span> <span id="s990">So I took a lot of the photographs that I thought would be of interest, many of which I gave to, you know, delivered in Bad Nauheim, but I kept some that interested me.</span> <span id="s991">And I also took some books of Hitler that – like a copy of “Mein Kampf” and photographic books of the fuehrer that came from his library.</span> <span id="s992">And I had the printing office make me a printed message that it was taken from Hitler’s birthplace.</span> <span id="s993">And then I met with the – Mi-Miss Fagas(ph), and said, what are you going to do with Hitler’s birthplace?</span> <span id="s994">He says, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s995">It’s certainly something you have to deal with.</span> <span id="s996">I said, I have an idea, let’s make it into a museum of the outra – atrocities of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s997">He liked that idea, and so he said, all right, we’ll do it.</span> <span id="s998">And, what are you going to exhibit?</span> <span id="s999">Well, he said, that – we have to get information of things that could be put there, like maybe the Nuremburg laws, and some of the info – illustrations of Nazi’s atrocities.</span> <span id="s1000">And I offered to get some placards that could be exhibited, and when I went back to Straubing, I got ahold of the local Catholic priest and told him that there was a museum, and I was wondering where there were some Biblical phrases that he could think of that would appropriately describe the evil of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1001">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: What – what sort of phrases did he come up with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: He came up by – in my – the material I gave you, the actual text from the Bible was selected, and I had them print it up on a large placard, and then took the material and they framed it, they – I think they framed it for me in Straubing.</span> <span id="s1004">The – the Germans who had been running the Nazi printing plant became my employees, because there was no one else.</span> <span id="s1005">In other words, we didn’t replace them.</span> <span id="s1006">And they were very cooperative.</span> <span id="s1007">I never – no one ever asked me about being Jewish, but I’m sure they all knew, and because you know, obviously, I spoke such good German, and my secretary, who was bi – by that time was known she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1008">And there also was a incident, my fa – my secretary, after she was freed, she had to fill out a questionnaire and she was afraid to reveal that she was not Polish.</span> <span id="s1009">She didn’t trust the Germans, the – our officers.</span> <span id="s1010">So she filled it out according to her false papers, not realizing that she was providing false information.</span> <span id="s1011">And when she openly admitted that she was of German background and of Jewish background and not Polish, the – one of the – the sia – the security people decided she had violated the law, she had falsified her identity, and charged her for having done so.</span> <span id="s1012">I talked to them, and they says, we have no choice, she did it, and we have to prosecute.</span> <span id="s1013">So I wrote up a defense and there was a trial, so this was public.</span> <span id="s1014">The other thing that surely made clear to people that I was Jewish was the fact that I found out that there was a synagogue in Straubing.</span> <span id="s1015">And so they showed me where it was.</span> <span id="s1016">It was dirty and had been used as a storeroom, but it hadn’t been burned in Kristallnacht because it was a building in a whole row of buildings, undistinguished, and if you had tried to burn it, you would have burned others – places down.</span> <span id="s1017">So I decided it needed to be restored, and went to the German – th-the – well, I think the mayor actually came to my office when I asked for it.</span> <span id="s1018">I told him this – we had to clean up the synagogue, and I ask him also that this be done by people who had damaged it, if their names could be identified.</span> <span id="s1019">And he was not a Nazi, he had been put in the office.</span> <span id="s1020">So he was able apparently, to find out who did it, and so the members of the family, who had been in the SS or SA and had damaged the interior of the building, had to come with brooms and paintbrushes and clean up the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Did you cover this in your newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: And that I put in the newspaper as a story, and again it was published all over Germany.</span> <span id="s1023">And the – the interesting part was that one of the rabbis I just met now, in – I th – I think it was the rabbi in Nuremburg, actually had been – there is a Jewish community now in Straubing, and it is operating.</span> <span id="s1024">It’s not very large, but the synagogue is being used.</span> <span id="s1025">So these kinds of things, I could do, simply because I had the authority to select what things to write about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Now I understand that you were also doing some things in a different capacity –</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: – that you were working together with the Bricha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Now, because my brother was in the Jewish Brigade, and knew my address, and knew my telephone number, and he could tell people in the Jewish Brigade, who were being released temporarily by the brigade, to organize the rescue of Jews in eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s1030">The brigade just had enough autonomy to arrange their – the mission – the execution of the missions that they had, mostly transportation.</span> <span id="s1031">They had trucks to move from Italy to Holland and Belgium, and they did a lot of transporting.</span> <span id="s1032">So what they did is they organized their crews so that about two-thirds did the work and one-third were released to – given ex-extended leave to go into eastern Europe to either visit the s – village or city where they came from, and to help Jews to organize, in order to get to the American zone, because th-there was no future for Jews in eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s1033">And in order to increase the number of Jews who wanted to go to Palestine, you had to first bring them to Germany.</span> <span id="s1034">And so there were agents of the Jewish Brigade, whose job it was to go into Czechoslovakia and Poland, and Straubing is close to the Czech border.</span> <span id="s1035">So they had my name and telephone number so they could call me from Munich and say they needed my advice, could I see them?</span> <span id="s1036">And I wo – of course always would say yes.</span> <span id="s1037">And this way I became well-known, apparently, on this group of underground workers, and they would come to Straubing and they needed a place to sleep at night, which I could provide, and food.</span> <span id="s1038">And then I would get them to the Czech border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Did anybody notice that you had these guests coming, mysterious guests, or were you able to keep it a secret?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Nobody paid much attention to what I was doing.</span> <span id="s1041">That – the Germans didn’t pay – you know, I had no one check on what I was doing and it was perfectly legitimate for the editor of the newspaper to interview anybody.</span> <span id="s1042">So, it was reasonable for me to interview visiting dignitaries.</span> <span id="s1043">The fact that they ca – happened to come from Palestine – my commanding officer wasn’t interest – I mean, the – he was not my commanding officer, because he had no authority over the newspaper.</span> <span id="s1044">He – he was responsible for making sure my Jeep was operating properly and that I had the necessary fuel and food.</span> <span id="s1045">He wasn’t at [indecipherable] the newspaper was not his job, so he didn’t intervene at all.</span> <span id="s1046">I’m not sure he even looked at – at the paper I put out.</span> <span id="s1047">He had a German girlfriend, and had a wonderful time, you know, had nothing to do, so I don’t think he ever once ever asked me about my work, because my command was not – he was not – I was not under his command.</span> <span id="s1048">My commanding officer was, by that time, Major Hans Harber(ph) in Bad Nauheim, or in Frankfurt, where supreme headquarters were located.</span> <span id="s1049">That was my command.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: And how long did you remain in Straubing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Well, my job ended when the newspaper was turned over back to a German editorial board, about November ’45.</span> <span id="s1052">By that time, nearly all the newspapers, maybe with a week or two difference, were turned over to the Germans, and the program of U.S. operated German newspapers came to an end.</span> <span id="s1053">And I had accumulated enough points to be sent home.</span> <span id="s1054">But because of the fact that there was a army program that permitted soldiers in Europe to visit relatives if they were available, I decided to take advantage of that, and I went, I think to Bad Nauheim, and asked to meet with my brother in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1055">And that was approved, but a few hours later, while waiting around, I was told sorry, Sergeant Eaton, Palestine is closed.</span> <span id="s1056">The British have closed Camp Litwinski, near Tel Aviv, a recreational facility for American sailors and soldiers, and ask all Americans to leave.</span> <span id="s1057">There’s no way for you to go to Palestine because there were several generals who wanted to go to Palestine for Christmas, but who were refused.</span> <span id="s1058">So I f – thought quickly, and said, but could I meet my brother in Cairo?</span> <span id="s1059">If you can get transportation.</span> <span id="s1060">So I gave them the address of a school friend at Cornell University, a Jew from Iraq, who had moved from Baghdad to Cairo, and I knew his address because he had sent me an invitation to his wedding in Cairo.</span> <span id="s1061">So I got permission to go [indecipherable] I wanted to see my brother, and so they approved it.</span> <span id="s1062">And when the orders were printed, they were printed like all other orders, to carry out the instructions of the commander, without specifying anything except I was put on detached duty for two weeks in Cairo to carry out instructions of the theater commander.</span> <span id="s1063">That was Eisenhower.</span> <span id="s1064">So, my commanding officer, who knew why I was leaving, what I went doing, said that’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s1065">I don’t care how long you stay, because when you g-go back, you going home.</span> <span id="s1066">We don’t need you any more.</span> <span id="s1067">So again, I’m not sure every commanding officer would have taken that position.</span> <span id="s1068">So, I had to find my way to go to Cairo.</span> <span id="s1069">Well, there was no – I didn’t get orders, transportation orders, because there was no way to get to Cairo from Straubing, Germany.</span> <span id="s1070">So I packed up a duffel bag and hitchhiked to Rome, because I knew in Rome we had an air force base, and I had found out that we had planes flying from Rome to the Middle East.</span> <span id="s1071">So when I got to Rome, I found out that there were no planes going to Palestine, there were no planes going to Cairo, but there were a lot of planes going to India, and they had to stop off in Baghdad to refuel.</span> <span id="s1072">So, showing my orders, I got orders to fly to Baghdad and then I would find a way of going to Cairo from Baghdad.</span> <span id="s1073">Nobody told me how I would do it.</span> <span id="s1074">I got to Baghdad, and in Baghdad a British officer looking at my orders said, you are very lucky Sergeant Eaton, we have a plane going to Cairo in an hour.</span> <span id="s1075">But I didn’t want to go to Cairo, I want to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1076">So I said, well I can’t go to Cairo now, I have to go to Baghdad first.</span> <span id="s1077">He said, it doesn’t say in your orders.</span> <span id="s1078">I said, I have to go to Baghdad first.</span> <span id="s1079">And, I can’t let you go to Baghdad, it’s does – not in your orders.</span> <span id="s1080">So I said, would you put in writing that you’re refusing to let me go to Baghdad?</span> <span id="s1081">He didn’t want to do that, so instead, he accepted my request and he issued a voucher for me to go to the best hotel in Baghdad, where the British officers were staying, to get a room at British expense.</span> <span id="s1082">And I said I would find a way of getting to Cairo by bus.</span> <span id="s1083">And I did.</span> <span id="s1084">I got ahold of a bus, there were bus service every few days from Baghdad to Damascus.</span> <span id="s1085">And from Damascus I got a ba – a bus to Ruspina.</span> <span id="s1086">And then I spent three and a half weeks in Palestine, in American uniform, knowing that under British rules, I’m not supposed to be there.</span> <span id="s1087">No one ever stopped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Just stop you one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: And the French really were willing to be part of a new Europe, but it was the Jews who prevented this.</span> <span id="s1090">So that as a – an – and this was also in ’45 already.</span> <span id="s1091">In ’46 the British felt they could not change the policy in Palestine, and therefore actually you had a rebellion of Jews against the British.</span> <span id="s1092">And the whole uncertainty of what would happen to all these displaced persons, the ba – of course, after my newspaper was over, and I no longer had a position, I – I was offered a job in military government in Germany by the U.S. Army, with a pro – with a promotion to captain.</span> <span id="s1093">But I didn’t want to live among Germans, and I wanted to finish my academic career, so – and I didn’t really like the American policy in general, which was to work very closely with the lower level German officials, which I didn’t particularly like, although today I realize that if we had done what we did in Iraq, of dismissing the infrastructure of Saddam Hussein, we really didn’t have the means to govern the country.</span> <span id="s1094">And so we really didn’t have much of a choice, except to use a great many officials in the same positions that they had occupied under the Nazis, as long as they had not been excessively active, and known to have been – have – have en-engaged in atrocities.</span> <span id="s1095">So major anti-Semites, judges who convicted too many people to death for stealing food, or for racial fo – fo – disapproved sexual relations or things like that, they lost their job.</span> <span id="s1096">But most judges, most Nazi judges stayed as Nazi judges.</span> <span id="s1097">And so by the time I could have become maybe the governor of this or that city in Germany, I would have had to deal with these kinds of officials, so no, I wanted to finish my PhD.</span> <span id="s1098">So that – the – but certainly the – one other thing is, once I started to go back i – go into teaching, my focus was on my professional career.</span> <span id="s1099">So I had research ideas, and I got adequate funding for research.</span> <span id="s1100">So I focused on research, I didn’t return to my army days or take a look at my extensive files of what happened in World War II.</span> <span id="s1101">I didn’t think of myself of somebody who was a historian of Germany, World War II.</span> <span id="s1102">I had lots of interesting records of things I did, and they were put in boxes, and these boxes got transported from this home to that home, and I was always too busy to really look at them, of what was in there, because I had many other interesting professional challenges, until after my retirement, I started looking at the material.</span> <span id="s1103">And I’m now engaged in writing a history of how my family interacted with the German culture over many centuries.</span> <span id="s1104">Because one has to face the fact that historically, Germany was never just a country of Germans.</span> <span id="s1105">There was always an existing minority that had a very important function, namely the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: And when you look at all the documents that you accumulated when you were in the army, you’re looking at them fresh after so many years, is there anything that surprises you, that you view differently in retrospect than you did at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1108">The – I mean, for hundreds of years, on both sides of my family, they remained Orthodox, even though a large proportion of the German Jews became Reform Jews.</span> <span id="s1109">On my father’s side they were quite conservative.</span> <span id="s1110">On my mother’s side, they took advantage of modern secular education, but they remained Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1111">I had relatives as far back as 1835 who went to Palestine, because they wanted to live there.</span> <span id="s1112">I – on my mother’s side, I had people going to Palestine, 1882.</span> <span id="s1113">The – so that my family was clearly Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1114">Two of my brothers remained Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1115">My oldest brother and I, especially under the influence of the Holocaust, I became convinced there is no superior po-power looking after exactly what’s happening to any of us.</span> <span id="s1116">And that if there is some rational power that explains the incredible complexity, and the – the uniformity of many things in nature; the fact that we have DNA that we shor – share with earthworms and with butterflies.</span> <span id="s1117">There’s s-some incredible rationality that somehow has developed an evolution for which I have no explanation.</span> <span id="s1118">But I don’t think there is a god who decides that I’ve been a good person, or I have had significant faults, on the basis of which my afterlife would be.</span> <span id="s1119">So, I – I am not an Orthodox Jew today.</span> <span id="s1120">And – but I am identified with the Jewish community for ethnic reasons.</span> <span id="s1121">So from that point of view, I had an opportunity to do things during those unusual periods of time, which the only other time I was able to express my interest in being Jewish is when I took a job for five years to establish a school of social work in Haifa University, and they needed an outside person who was not involved in Israeli politics.</span> <span id="s1122">And so they brought me in because university wanted to establish a school that would compete with Hebrew University and have a different ideology, so I took that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1124">Well, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1125">This concludes
