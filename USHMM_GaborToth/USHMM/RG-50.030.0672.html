And I went to school there till, till I finished eighth grade.</span> <span id="s36">And after that, I went to the Har-Brack High School.</span> <span id="s37">And then, from the high school, I was drafted into the Army.</span> <span id="s38">And I had, I had a dull life, you know, just we played around.</span> <span id="s39">And I went, when the war ended, you know, I was excited.</span> <span id="s40">I wanted to join.</span> <span id="s41">And I did go to try to join the Navy.</span> <span id="s42">And I was turned away because I was colorblind.</span> <span id="s43">And that's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: What's your first memory from when you were growing up?</span> <span id="s45">What's the first thing that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Oh, my first memory when I was growing up, oh boy, that was a -- it sticks out in my mind that I was on a, on the boat.</span> <span id="s47">It was dark.</span> <span id="s48">And there was a steamboat coming down the river.</span> <span id="s49">And we always liked, as kids, go on the end of it, this steamboat.</span> <span id="s50">And here, I was pushed over.</span> <span id="s51">And I must have been about maybe five, six years old.</span> <span id="s52">I don't know.</span> <span id="s53">And they couldn't find me.</span> <span id="s54">And finally, the waves of the steamboat, I guess here I was underneath the boat bopping up.</span> <span id="s55">And the steam waves, the boat from the steamboat pulled me out from that boat underneath the boat.</span> <span id="s56">And they found me because I was up, and my hand was waving in the air like saying good-bye.</span> <span id="s57">And that's how I was found.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Can you tell me what your first memory was when war broke out?</span> <span id="s59">What what's the first thing you remember about World War II?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: World War II, I remember, oh, I was out playing in the alley with my buddies.</span> <span id="s61">And we heard the, you know, we heard from the newspapers, there was come by, "Extra, Extra," they had.</span> <span id="s62">It was right after that, and then it was saying about the war, we broke out, we were at war.</span> <span id="s63">And I must have been, I don't know, 13 years old.</span> <span id="s64">And that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: What do you remember about being drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well, when I was drafted, I assumed that I would not go into the service because I was turned down from the, from the Navy from being colorblind.</span> <span id="s67">And when I went, when I went to the draft board, I know the people thought I was too young to be there.</span> <span id="s68">I mean, I had a couple guys saying, "This is people going into the Army."</span> <span id="s69">They couldn't believe that I was there is going in because I was so young looking.</span> <span id="s70">And skinny and small.</span> <span id="s71">And I did go through the, for my physical.</span> <span id="s72">And I passed it, to my surprise.</span> <span id="s73">And then, when I was drafted, I went to Camp Gordon.</span> <span id="s74">I had 16 weeks of basic training.</span> <span id="s75">Oh, the next, when I was drafted, the May, I think the next day, Germany surrendered.</span> <span id="s76">Okay.</span> <span id="s77">And then, when I was in my basic training, I was on my last couple weeks of training, when Japan surrendered.</span> <span id="s78">And then, we thought we were all going to go home.</span> <span id="s79">But instead they, they shipped us to New York.</span> <span id="s80">And we shipped out to go overseas to, to France.</span> <span id="s81">And we were out at sea maybe two, three days.</span> <span id="s82">And all at once, there was a big hump, a big thump.</span> <span id="s83">And here, I thought our boat stopped just to have Mass on the deck.</span> <span id="s84">That's because they announced we're going to have Mass on the deck.</span> <span id="s85">And here it was, here we hit a little boat.</span> <span id="s86">It was one of our little boats out there.</span> <span id="s87">And I remember them picking up some survivors, and keep the survivors away from us.</span> <span id="s88">They were mostly, you know, not living.</span> <span id="s89">They were dead.</span> <span id="s90">And then, we came back to New York.</span> <span id="s91">And we stayed in New York another 30 days doing nothing until we got another ship.</span> <span id="s92">And I shipped over, and I landed in Le Havre, France.</span> <span id="s93">And I remember that because we have to stay in, in Le Havre, we stayed in little tents for about seven days till they put us on the, in boxcars.</span> <span id="s94">They called them forty-and-eights.</span> <span id="s95">And we were on that boxcar for, I think it was seven nights and seven days.</span> <span id="s96">We stayed in that boxcar until we got to Nuremberg, Germany.</span> <span id="s97">And that's how I got to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: And what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Oh, what year?</span> <span id="s100">It was 1945.</span> <span id="s101">I was drafted May the 7th, I think, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: And how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Was that your first trip to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: What were your first impressions?</span> <span id="s107">What were your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: My first impression, oh, it was in Le Havre, France.</span> <span id="s109">And I couldn't believe I heard, "Boom, boom."</span> <span id="s110">And said, "I thought the war was over."</span> <span id="s111">And here, they were, like, demolishing you know, out in buildings because they were not secure.</span> <span id="s112">And to me, when we were docking, and we had French people, little boys begging for cigarettes and candy.</span> <span id="s113">That's what got me the most, how they were begging for cigarettes and candy.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: And what was your first impression of Germany when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Oh, well, I went through Germany, like I told you, seven days and seven nights.</span> <span id="s116">And then, we, we didn't see anything, you know.</span> <span id="s117">We just kept going.</span> <span id="s118">And we, we ate just our rations, our K-rations that we were, you know, that we had.</span> <span id="s119">And one day in Germany, they stopped for a hot meal.</span> <span id="s120">And I would not give it up.</span> <span id="s121">I would not give up my space in the boxcar, you know, so I missed the meal.</span> <span id="s122">And it was, like, in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s123">And so, what I seen of Germany was just, you know, just the land.</span> <span id="s124">Nothing around it.</span> <span id="s125">Then, my first impression when I got to Nuremberg, wow, I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s126">I don't think there was a house standing in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s127">And every house was down to the ground.</span> <span id="s128">And, you know, and it was a little shocking.</span> <span id="s129">And then, when they put us in these SS Kasernes, I remember, and they had no mattresses.</span> <span id="s130">And that's, we slept in our sleeping bags we were issued.</span> <span id="s131">And, I don't know, we didn't have those bags long until we did get mattresses.</span> <span id="s132">And we were, like, a high priority because we were going to be at the Nuremberg trials, you know.</span> <span id="s133">So, we got mattresses sooner than most other GIs, I guess.</span> <span id="s134">And our windows were fixed.</span> <span id="s135">And that's my impression of Nuremberg, the first time I got to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Do you remember about what date it was that you got to Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: The day I got to Nuremberg, geez, well, I -- it was May the 7th, I was drafted, and I don't know.</span> <span id="s138">I spent 30 days waiting for a ship.</span> <span id="s139">And then, when I got to Nuremberg, it was, I don't know, it had to be about maybe a month or two after I was drafted.</span> <span id="s140">No.</span> <span id="s141">After I, I landed in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s142">But I don't know what time I got there.</span> <span id="s143">Is that what you asked me?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s145">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yeah, I got to Nuremberg, well, I know it was in November.</span> <span id="s147">It was cold, you know.</span> <span id="s148">But I don't know the exact date right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did you interact much with the German population when you got there, or did you go straight to the site of the trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s151">We were in, situated in our Kaserne, and we stayed there for, like, 30 days.</span> <span id="s152">And we had orientations until what we were going to do at the, at the prison, you know.</span> <span id="s153">And because they told us we were going to be prison cells in the cell.</span> <span id="s154">And we were going to guard walls.</span> <span id="s155">And we were going to secure doors.</span> <span id="s156">Entrances to the, in the prison.</span> <span id="s157">But not at the Palace of Justice.</span> <span id="s158">And -- what?</span> <span id="s159">Oh, what did you want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: If you interacted at all with --</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: No.</span> <span id="s162">With the Germans, no.</span> <span id="s163">We didn't speak to them at all.</span> <span id="s164">You know, because, you know, the only time I would speak to German was when I would be, they would, like, take our clothes and wash them for us, you know.</span> <span id="s165">We had, like, one woman, she would been coming around, you know, to do our laundry.</span> <span id="s166">And that's the only one I would speak to.</span> <span id="s167">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: And did you speak any German?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No.</span> <span id="s170">None at all.</span> <span id="s171">None at all.</span> <span id="s172">And then, like I say, right near where our SS Kaserne was, it was close to, to the, where Hitler used to parade his field.</span> <span id="s173">And I think they called it Soldiers Field.</span> <span id="s174">And I spent a lot of time there while I was awaiting to get, you know, you know, to get, to get our jobs in, at the prison.</span> <span id="s175">And I think I learned how to drive a Jeep there.</span> <span id="s176">That's what I was doing.</span> <span id="s177">And then, after we got orientation, I think my first time I went to the prison, it was very eerie.</span> <span id="s178">And, and we worked, we had to be there for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s179">We would guard, we would guard them, we would be on guard for two hours and off four.</span> <span id="s180">And I will never forget my first one I had was, oh, I think it was Sauckel, Sauckel.</span> <span id="s181">My first prisoner I ever guarded was Sauckel.</span> <span id="s182">And I remember going on maybe, like, I think it was 2 o'clock in the morning, and I relieved my man.</span> <span id="s183">And I looked in there, and he was sleeping.</span> <span id="s184">And, you know, I was nervous.</span> <span id="s185">I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s186">And we were told, we were there, they can't escape.</span> <span id="s187">But we were there just to keep them alive, you know, to, you know, so they can go through a trial.</span> <span id="s188">And I would look in there and watch him.</span> <span id="s189">And he wouldn't be moving.</span> <span id="s190">He was sleeping soundly.</span> <span id="s191">And I didn't hear anything.</span> <span id="s192">And I thought he was gone, you know, and I'm scared.</span> <span id="s193">And all at once, I'd see him move or breathe, and I would feel so relieved.</span> <span id="s194">That was my first experience with that, with a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: I want to go back for just a moment.</span> <span id="s196">You talked a little bit about how you were briefed and trained before you, before you actually started to guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Could you tell me a little bit more about your job and your position was explained to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Well, all I can remember is we were, like, we were had, like, squads.</span> <span id="s200">And I would go in my squad.</span> <span id="s201">And we would have a guy come up there, and he would just tell us, you know, what we're doing.</span> <span id="s202">And who these people were.</span> <span id="s203">And, you know, to me, 18 years old, I didn't know what, who they were at all.</span> <span id="s204">I didn't, didn't faze me at all.</span> <span id="s205">And, and that's all they said.</span> <span id="s206">Our main job was to just to keep them alive.</span> <span id="s207">You know, and that's about it.</span> <span id="s208">And then, they told us that we're going to be on different, you're going to be on a cell guard for maybe, like I say two hours, and I'll be off four.</span> <span id="s209">And then, they put you, they say maybe we would go get an entrance of some kind to guard.</span> <span id="s210">And they would be off another four.</span> <span id="s211">And then, maybe you get on a wall.</span> <span id="s212">They just kept changing around 24 hours.</span> <span id="s213">And we did that just every, every day.</span> <span id="s214">We went to, we went to the prison.</span> <span id="s215">And then, we'd be off 24 hours, and we'd go back on 24 hours.</span> <span id="s216">That's all.</span> <span id="s217">That's was my routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did you know anything at that point at age 18 about what had gone on Europe in genocide, about these mens' role in -</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: No, I didn't know anything like that.</span> <span id="s220">I had no ideA: But as I stayed there, you know, I'd hear a lot of people talking.</span> <span id="s221">And I realize that we had, who we were guarding.</span> <span id="s222">And I guarded, we had 20, 20 prisoners we guarded.</span> <span id="s223">And they were in the cell all by, all by themselves.</span> <span id="s224">And the ones, they would take them out, I think it was one day for one hour out to have, for their exercises in the exercise yard.</span> <span id="s225">And you would just follow your prisoner out to the yard.</span> <span id="s226">And you had to keep your eye on your prisoner.</span> <span id="s227">And all of us guards, 20 of us, I guess, was just all around surrounding him, just watching your own prisoner.</span> <span id="s228">And they were good.</span> <span id="s229">They knew what they had to do.</span> <span id="s230">We didn't have to do anything, you know.</span> <span id="s231">And it was very routine.</span> <span id="s232">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Can you tell me what the prison itself at Nuremberg was like?</span> <span id="s234">What it looked like?</span> <span id="s235">How many prisoners were there total, what the cells looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Oh, what the prison looked like?</span> <span id="s237">Well, we'd go in, and we slept in the, in the cell.</span> <span id="s238">You know, for the 24 hours we were there, and it was just like a regular prison.</span> <span id="s239">I mean, it wasn't very nice.</span> <span id="s240">They had wooden doors with a little hole in it.</span> <span id="s241">You know, and that's where we used to put our light when they went to sleep, on the prisoner.</span> <span id="s242">We had, we watched them for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s243">But the prison was just like a regular prison.</span> <span id="s244">It had three stories, three tiers, you know.</span> <span id="s245">And on the first tiers were all the 22 prisoners we had.</span> <span id="s246">And that's it.</span> <span id="s247">And then, like in the, then, well, just imagine the prison like a, like a wheel.</span> <span id="s248">The prisoners had one, one block.</span> <span id="s249">And we had another block of a spoke-like.</span> <span id="s250">And we, and that was for us.</span> <span id="s251">Then, they had another spoke, it was just for the witnesses.</span> <span id="s252">I think there were like, you know, their wives and somebody in there.</span> <span id="s253">And, but they were allowed to walk in and out of their cells up to 10 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s254">And then, in one other spoke was the military police, you know.</span> <span id="s255">And, and the wall was a round wall.</span> <span id="s256">And we'd have to walk that wall.</span> <span id="s257">We'd get that sometimes, to walk the wall.</span> <span id="s258">And so, you know, just like a regular prison.</span> <span id="s259">But it was, you know, not very nice looking.</span> <span id="s260">It was old.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: So, did I understand you correctly, when you were guarding, when you were on your shift for those 24 hours when you were guarding a particular prisoner, were you in the cell with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: No.</span> <span id="s263">We were outside the door.</span> <span id="s264">And like I said, we had a hole in the door in a, a little hole.</span> <span id="s265">And that's where we would put our light, you know, we had a portable light there beside the door.</span> <span id="s266">And we would shine it on them at, when they went to sleep.</span> <span id="s267">And the door was not locked.</span> <span id="s268">It was just latched because they told us in case you see them doing anything, we'd have to go in quickly.</span> <span id="s269">And that's just the way it was.</span> <span id="s270">And we were only allowed to, oh, I think we were only allowed to, people that entered that cell would be a, it was a doctor.</span> <span id="s271">But he was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s272">But he was a, I don't know, he was a, I guess they trusted him, trust a doctor.</span> <span id="s273">And he was allowed in there.</span> <span id="s274">And barbers, get their hair cut.</span> <span id="s275">And one other guy was there.</span> <span id="s276">Oh, he was our commander.</span> <span id="s277">Andrews, I think his name was.</span> <span id="s278">He was the head of the, the guards and that.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: And were you allowed to interact with the prisoners at all, or you were strictly guarding from the outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Well, I did not interact with them because, you know, most of them just would not speak to you.</span> <span id="s281">You know, and I, and they told us not to speak to them.</span> <span id="s282">But I seen a lot of guards do speak to them.</span> <span id="s283">And the only prisoner that I spoke and had a conversation with was Albert Speer.</span> <span id="s284">And that's because they came to me, and I was guarding him.</span> <span id="s285">And they asked me to take him to Room 55.</span> <span id="s286">And he was going to see his lawyer.</span> <span id="s287">And all I had to do is sit between them and watch that they didn't pass any sharp things to each other, like, a pencil or something sharp, you know.</span> <span id="s288">And his lawyer was a little late, so I got to talk to him a little bit.</span> <span id="s289">And he, to me, sounded like a real, you know, gentleman, good guy.</span> <span id="s290">And he was, I think he was Hitler's architect.</span> <span id="s291">And then, he was a pleasant guy.</span> <span id="s292">And then, I remember then maybe a couple weeks later, I was on the, I had the duty of walking in with the barber to, for them to get their hair cuts or whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s293">When I walked in Speer's cell this one time, he still remembered me.</span> <span id="s294">I remember him fixing his bunk, so I could have a good seat.</span> <span id="s295">But as far as, and I talked to maybe, you know, like, if, if they were in -- they had a commode in there.</span> <span id="s296">If they were in there, stayed in there too long, well, then I would have to go in and see what was going on because they had one guy commit suicide doing, on the commode.</span> <span id="s297">And that was while I was, when I just got there during the time I was on orientation.</span> <span id="s298">And the 26th Infantry was still guarding him.</span> <span id="s299">And then, and I think his name was Ley or something like that.</span> <span id="s300">And after that, that's when we were told to watch them when they go into the commode.</span> <span id="s301">And that's the time, I think, they put a, one guard on each cell.</span> <span id="s302">And that's how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Can you tell me what you talked about with, with Albert Speer?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Well, I didn't say much to him, but he was telling me, like, he only got -- I don't think they hung him.</span> <span id="s305">He got, like, 20 years or something.</span> <span id="s306">And he said like, you know, he knew that, that, you know, he did wrong now and all that.</span> <span id="s307">And he was, like, you know, and he felt sorry.</span> <span id="s308">As the other ones would not even, you know, mention to do that.</span> <span id="s309">And, and then when, then he asked me, you know, how long I had been there, and I told him, you know.</span> <span id="s310">Stuff like there.</span> <span id="s311">And then, his lawyer came, and they spoke German.</span> <span id="s312">And I didn't know what they were speaking about.</span> <span id="s313">And after that, I just took him back to his cell.</span> <span id="s314">Oh, I, interaction with the prisoner?</span> <span id="s315">I had one, Herman, Herman Goering, I, I was on his cell when he had to go take his shower.</span> <span id="s316">You know, they got one shower or two showers a week or something like that.</span> <span id="s317">And I was on his cell, and I took him down.</span> <span id="s318">And that was downstairs in the basement.</span> <span id="s319">I took him down.</span> <span id="s320">And, and I had to go into the place where he was going to take his shower.</span> <span id="s321">And only, I only had a blackjack on me.</span> <span id="s322">No weapon.</span> <span id="s323">And he complained about something to me, and I didn't what he was complaining about.</span> <span id="s324">So, I called the sergeant of the guard.</span> <span id="s325">And here, he was complaining about the door being open because the draft was getting him.</span> <span id="s326">And here, the sergeant of the guard, you know, told him the door had to be open because we had another soldier there walking up and down the corridor with a weapon.</span> <span id="s327">So, and that door had to be open.</span> <span id="s328">So, finally, he asked for another towel, and he got it.</span> <span id="s329">And he, instead of taking a shower, he took a bath.</span> <span id="s330">And that's the only reaction I had with him.</span> <span id="s331">But I was on his cell a lot, you know.</span> <span id="s332">And he just set there.</span> <span id="s333">And they just read.</span> <span id="s334">They're looking through papers, and that was about all.</span> <span id="s335">Some of them, before when they get up in the morning, Julius Streicher, I think, he was across from the, Goering.</span> <span id="s336">I had him one time, and he would get up, they were supposed to get up, I think, 7:30.</span> <span id="s337">And he would get up maybe a little earlier, 7, and he did exercises in his cell.</span> <span id="s338">And what I couldn't believe what he did, they didn't have any running water in the cell.</span> <span id="s339">So, he flushed his toilet a few times, and he took the water and like put it over his shoulders and that to cool off.</span> <span id="s340">And then he would get, ask for his clothes.</span> <span id="s341">We had their clothes in another cell away from them.</span> <span id="s342">And we would bring their clothes in for him to get dressed, and he was ready for, for court.</span> <span id="s343">That's about it.</span> <span id="s344">That's all I can, and I know I was in a lot of other cells and that.</span> <span id="s345">And I walked the walls.</span> <span id="s346">That was, I didn't like walking that wall.</span> <span id="s347">It was night, you know, and on the wall, we had a, a weapon.</span> <span id="s348">It was an automatic weapon.</span> <span id="s349">And, and we had, and then, we used to guard the doorways.</span> <span id="s350">You're coming into the cellblock, or you're going out, we had to check them with their IDs.</span> <span id="s351">And we had to see them around.</span> <span id="s352">We had to know them.</span> <span id="s353">And we also, then later on, we would out to, passwords like, like New York, and he would say Yogi Berra.</span> <span id="s354">And that was the one for the day.</span> <span id="s355">And every day it was different.</span> <span id="s356">When we went through a doorway.</span> <span id="s357">And that's and what else I had to do there.</span> <span id="s358">Oh, there was a witness wing.</span> <span id="s359">It was on the third floor.</span> <span id="s360">And there was only one guard there.</span> <span id="s361">One guard.</span> <span id="s362">And the witnesses were allowed to walk in and out of their cells, you know, and mingle.</span> <span id="s363">But at 10 o'clock, they had to be in their cells, you know, time to sleep.</span> <span id="s364">And I'll never forget this.</span> <span id="s365">My job was, I was there on a New Year's Eve.</span> <span id="s366">It must have been '45, 1945 New Year's Eve.</span> <span id="s367">And the, there was women, she was in charge, like, a lieutenant, and here she said she was going to leave early because she's going to a party.</span> <span id="s368">And, you know, once they get in their cells, they'll be okay.</span> <span id="s369">And here, throughout our, throughout the, you know, our ranks and throughout the prison, there was a story about one of these women, they wore, she wore riding clothes.</span> <span id="s370">And what she would do, and I don't know if I should tell you this.</span> <span id="s371">This was what, the word was out that she would strip, and you'd give her a candy bar or something.</span> <span id="s372">You know, and then she would report the time, you know, the day, and the soldier was, would be disciplined.</span> <span id="s373">But when I got there, so I was nervous of her.</span> <span id="s374">I didn't know who she was or what.</span> <span id="s375">And then, I had one girl.</span> <span id="s376">And I guess it was her.</span> <span id="s377">She kept coming into the office and wanted to see the lieutenant.</span> <span id="s378">And I told her the lieutenant is going to be gone.</span> <span id="s379">You know, she come in a couple times.</span> <span id="s380">And I finally had to tell her that she had to stay in her cell.</span> <span id="s381">And that's the last I seen of her.</span> <span id="s382">And that's, that's about it.</span> <span id="s383">And everything else was routine.</span> <span id="s384">Oh, we had another post.</span> <span id="s385">Oh, I remember now.</span> <span id="s386">It was at the courtroom, you know, inside the courtroom when it was empty.</span> <span id="s387">They just had one guard in there.</span> <span id="s388">And all he had to do is make sure nobody got in there.</span> <span id="s389">And I just really had to just walk around in there for two hours.</span> <span id="s390">And that's all I did.</span> <span id="s391">I was just amazed at the, you know, how small it was because all those people were in it.</span> <span id="s392">And you know, I looked at there, and I seen this one machine there.</span> <span id="s393">It was a stenotype machine.</span> <span id="s394">I remember I was really fascinated with that machine.</span> <span id="s395">And then, when I got home, and I got discharged, I went to school for that, for the same machine to study the, you know, and I knew how to operate that.</span> <span id="s396">But I never used it.</span> <span id="s397">Maybe for a couple weeks, and that's all.</span> <span id="s398">That's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Did you ever get to observe a day in the courtroom itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Once.</span> <span id="s401">And I would, and the reason I wouldn't do it again is because it was too hard.</span> <span id="s402">And I had to go through a lot of paperwork even though I was a guard.</span> <span id="s403">They put you through a lot to get, to get a seat in the courtroom.</span> <span id="s404">You know, and when I was there, they were talking about Admiral Doenitz, you know, what he, what he has done.</span> <span id="s405">And it was really, I was amazed the way it was.</span> <span id="s406">I had a headset on.</span> <span id="s407">And if you would turn it to one, number one, he might, you would think he was speaking English.</span> <span id="s408">You turn it to number two, then he was talk, speaking Russian.</span> <span id="s409">You know, it was really funny to me.</span> <span id="s410">To listen to that trial that way.</span> <span id="s411">But that, yeah, I did go one time in the courtroom.</span> <span id="s412">And the other time I was in there was just when I had, that was one of our posts.</span> <span id="s413">But it was empty.</span> <span id="s414">But to, you know, just to go there as a spectator, I did go once.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Can you tell me specifically what they were talking about that day that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: That day, I remember it was about the sea, Admiral Doenitz.</span> <span id="s417">Was that Admiral Doenitz?</span> <span id="s418">Yeah, I think it was him.</span> <span id="s419">Yeah, kind of was a commander.</span> <span id="s420">Yeah, Admiral Doenitz, and he was the one on the stand that day.</span> <span id="s421">And I can't remember what they were speaking about.</span> <span id="s422">But, you know, I was just so amazed, you know, because I kept playing with those dials.</span> <span id="s423">But, but it was just like a courtroom as usual.</span> <span id="s424">They were asking him questions, and he would answer, you know.</span> <span id="s425">And that's all I can remember about that date.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Do you remember anything specific about his testimony or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Anything specific about his testimony or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: No.</span> <span id="s430">I have no idea what he spoke about that day.</span> <span id="s431">That's been so long.</span> <span id="s432">And I was just amazed how it was.</span> <span id="s433">And like I say, I was playing mostly with those dials.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Did you ever overhear or understand any conversations that the prisoners had amongst themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Well, the prisoners were, only time they were together was when they went out for their exercise.</span> <span id="s436">We had an exercise yard, they call it.</span> <span id="s437">And at first, we took all 20 of them out together.</span> <span id="s438">And whatever guard, and our, the guards just stood around the exercise yard and watching your prisoner.</span> <span id="s439">And as the court, as the court was going on, you know, the proceedings were going on, we noticed that we were just given so many prisoners go out, not all together.</span> <span id="s440">Like, maybe 18 or 15, you know.</span> <span id="s441">And that was because, I think they were, somebody said they were, you know, talking about the other prisoners.</span> <span id="s442">They were against them.</span> <span id="s443">And they became enemies.</span> <span id="s444">So they wouldn't take, send them out together.</span> <span id="s445">And I just remember how it started at the beginning with all 20 was out.</span> <span id="s446">Then, there was like 17.</span> <span id="s447">Then, it would, I can remember one time, we only had maybe ten of them out there.</span> <span id="s448">But, and they said that's because in the courtroom, they were blaming each other.</span> <span id="s449">So, that's all I know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Did you notice anything about their behavior, either when they were in their cell or outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Oh, well, yeah.</span> <span id="s452">Well, Goering, he was very, he was always just a nice guy, you know.</span> <span id="s453">He slept and read.</span> <span id="s454">And Hess was in the next cell to him.</span> <span id="s455">And to me, Hess looked like he was a crazy guy.</span> <span id="s456">I mean, he just didn't speak.</span> <span id="s457">And he had this, and all I know about him, he had his window really open, and the draft would hit you right in the face when you come to his cell.</span> <span id="s458">And I never took care of his cell.</span> <span id="s459">It was dirty.</span> <span id="s460">And, like I say, most of them, like, you know, and they just didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s461">They played cards.</span> <span id="s462">They had a little table, a card table there.</span> <span id="s463">Not a table, a weak table there.</span> <span id="s464">They didn't have cards per se.</span> <span id="s465">They had homemade cards they would make.</span> <span id="s466">And they would play games with that, play a game with that.</span> <span id="s467">But they were always separated.</span> <span id="s468">They never were together.</span> <span id="s469">So, and like I say, I never spoke to them because I just followed orders.</span> <span id="s470">I was afraid, you know, I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s471">But I seen some guys speaking to them, you know.</span> <span id="s472">But I did not.</span> <span id="s473">And it's, and it was all the same, you know -- oh, I told you about the guy that took, he did the exercises.</span> <span id="s474">They would give his clothes for court.</span> <span id="s475">And then, every time he went to court, he always asked the guard for some chewing gum.</span> <span id="s476">No matter who was, who was, who, who was his guard that day.</span> <span id="s477">And, yeah, and like I say, they just, they just read.</span> <span id="s478">They didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s479">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: You've said a couple of times that you were, you were afraid at certain points.</span> <span id="s481">Was that because it was a new situation, or were you afraid of the actual process of guarding them?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Well, you know, after you're there, and I heard who they were and all that stuff, then mostly my afraid was I didn't want my prisoner to die on me.</span> <span id="s483">Because that was so stuck in our heads.</span> <span id="s484">That's what I was afraid of mostly.</span> <span id="s485">When I had him for those two hours, I just wanted him to be alive when I left.</span> <span id="s486">And that's the only thing I was afraid of.</span> <span id="s487">But really, after that, they were like nothing.</span> <span id="s488">You know, it was all just routine.</span> <span id="s489">And like I said, sometimes you would get into the cellblock maybe for one prisoner.</span> <span id="s490">And the rest of the time, you were on the wall, walking the wall.</span> <span id="s491">Or you were out guarding a doorway.</span> <span id="s492">So, you know, they changed us around a lot.</span> <span id="s493">For not to get, I guess it was because they didn't want you to get too familiar with a prisoner.</span> <span id="s494">And that's what I heard they said.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: And had a, a suicide of a prisoner happened not too long before you got there?</span> <span id="s496">Was that part of the, the fear of making sure that, that one of them didn't die on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yeah, that, that was my fear.</span> <span id="s498">You know, I didn't want none of them to die.</span> <span id="s499">Or, you know, commit suicide while I was there.</span> <span id="s500">You know, because we, all that we were told, "They're there to be hung."</span> <span id="s501">That's all.</span> <span id="s502">To, you know, once the verdicts are out.</span> <span id="s503">And I was there from the beginning of the trial, the trial.</span> <span id="s504">Till the end of the trial.</span> <span id="s505">And then, after, when the verdicts came out, I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s506">And then, when it was the hanging, I was on my way home.</span> <span id="s507">So, I missed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: So, some of the prisoners that you had guarded were being hung as you were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Some of the prisoners who you had previously guarded were being executed as you were leaving?</span> <span id="s511">As you were coming back to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Oh, there was, geez, who, the people that were executed, I think they had -- oh, God.</span> <span id="s513">It's so hard to remember, 12?</span> <span id="s514">And the ones that got the death sentences, I remember was Frick, I can remember.</span> <span id="s515">Goering.</span> <span id="s516">And Goering committed suicide a day, the night before his hanging.</span> <span id="s517">And I always said, I was, I was on the ship coming home, and I said, "I'm glad I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s518">And Alfred Jodl, he was a really weird guy.</span> <span id="s519">He died.</span> <span id="s520">He was hung Kaltenbrunner was died, he was hung.</span> <span id="s521">And like, Hess, he got life.</span> <span id="s522">I think he, he was the longest living prisoner.</span> <span id="s523">And Ross, Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s524">My first prisoner I guarded was Sauckel.</span> <span id="s525">He got the death sentence.</span> <span id="s526">And there was some people that a got acquitted, like, Schacht.</span> <span id="s527">I remember him being acquitted.</span> <span id="s528">You know, it's, it's hard for me to remember now.</span> <span id="s529">It's so many years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Can you tell me at what point you started to realize who these people were, and what they had done?</span> <span id="s531">You mentioned that before you came to Nuremberg, you really didn't have a good sense of what had gone on in Europe during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Was there a moment that you remember that perception changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s535">It changed on me when I started hearing stories about how who the people we were guarding, you know.</span> <span id="s536">The guys were talking, and then I just realized, "Oh, my God, I got some, you know, high, high officials here I'm guarding."</span> <span id="s537">So, you know, that put me on alert more and made me a better guard.</span> <span id="s538">But that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Did you have any family in Europe at that time, at that time during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: No, I didn't have anybody.</span> <span id="s541">Well, my mother's sister was there in Poland, you know, but that wasn't too familiar with her because I, because we did, I remember us sending packages and maybe once every six months or so.</span> <span id="s542">That's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: And did she remain in Poland throughout the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Did she remain in Poland –</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: -- throughout the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And what did she do after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: What did I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: What did your mother's sister, did she remain in Poland the rest of her life, or did she --</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: My mother's sister, yeah, she left her, she stayed there the rest of her life.</span> <span id="s553">Once my mother died, we lost contact with her at all, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Can you tell me about your last day as a prison guard at Nuremberg?</span> <span id="s555">Is there anything in particular you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Oh, my last day, geez.</span> <span id="s557">Oh, God.</span> <span id="s558">Oh, let me see now, because I know we were happy we were getting off because there was only two infantry divisions that guarded them, I think.</span> <span id="s559">Because when I got there we guarded, it was the 26th Infantry we relieved.</span> <span id="s560">And I was in the 18th Infantry.</span> <span id="s561">And then, when we got the word we were going to be leaving, we were all so happy you know, just getting out of there.</span> <span id="s562">And then, the 26th, and then, the 26 Infantry relieved us again.</span> <span id="s563">They relieved us to go home.</span> <span id="s564">And my, my last day there, oh God, I remember being on a doorway, you know, and I was guarding a door.</span> <span id="s565">And I just was so happy, you know, that I'm leaving.</span> <span id="s566">And I know I left a lot of guys through, or I didn't ask them their pass, you know, the word for the day was.</span> <span id="s567">But no, I was just happy to get out of there.</span> <span id="s568">That's all.</span> <span id="s569">Just something new, you know.</span> <span id="s570">Then, I went to Amberg, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: And what did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: In Amberg, I became a squad leader.</span> <span id="s573">And then, they needed a company clerk.</span> <span id="s574">And my sergeant asked me if I'd be a company clerk, you know, to help them out.</span> <span id="s575">I said sure.</span> <span id="s576">But when I was, I was anxious to get my sergeant stripes, you know.</span> <span id="s577">And I wanted to move up.</span> <span id="s578">And I knew as a company clerk that I was a corporal, and that was all I'm going to stay.</span> <span id="s579">But then, the sergeant said no, he was going to put me in for a sergeant because I'm only acting as a clerk.</span> <span id="s580">And my real job is a squad leader.</span> <span id="s581">But then, this was after the war.</span> <span id="s582">And then, when he put me in for sergeant, I was denied.</span> <span id="s583">And that was because we had a lot of people coming in, you know, coming back from the, you know, the war.</span> <span id="s584">You know, and there were a lot, a lot of sergeants.</span> <span id="s585">So, they didn't give anybody anymore, you know, promotions.</span> <span id="s586">So, I come home as a company clerk, my last job, and as a corporal.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: And how long were you in Amberg, Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: In Amberg?</span> <span id="s589">Oh, geez, I don't know.</span> <span id="s590">I wasn't there too long.</span> <span id="s591">I was maybe there, oh, maybe a few months.</span> <span id="s592">And I, well, what we did there, we, it was weird because that's when the war was over.</span> <span id="s593">And the people, the soldiers that were married were allowed to bring their wives over.</span> <span id="s594">And what we did, we had to go guard a home, one of the Germans' home, and somebody would mark the, the contents of the house.</span> <span id="s595">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s596">Give my water a sip.</span> <span id="s597">They would mark the contents, like, the chair, they would have underneath it, would have a mark, and that wasn't allowed to leave that building, you know.</span> <span id="s598">The only people, stuff that wasn't marked was allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s599">And that was what I did in Amberg.</span> <span id="s600">Until, until I got my discharge.</span> <span id="s601">Then, I went to, I think -- I didn't get discharged there.</span> <span id="s602">I went to Copen, no.</span> <span id="s603">I forget where I, I come -- I come in Le Havre, and I went out someplace else.</span> <span id="s604">I can't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: And who lived in those houses that you were guarding?</span> <span id="s606">Or were you guarding the houses themselves in Amberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: We were just guarding, they were, they were empty.</span> <span id="s608">And I guess some kind of Germans lived there.</span> <span id="s609">And they were saving those houses for the wives that are coming over.</span> <span id="s610">Officers mostly.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: And at that point, when you were in Amberg, do you remember anything about interacting with the local population or any survivors, or was it really just you and your company?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s613">I relaxed.</span> <span id="s614">I, I remember going swimming there, and I was really, you know, it was in the summer.</span> <span id="s615">I went swimming.</span> <span id="s616">And I talked to a girl.</span> <span id="s617">That's about it.</span> <span id="s618">And, well, and then, we had like a house club.</span> <span id="s619">We had a beer only.</span> <span id="s620">There were some Germans there.</span> <span id="s621">But that was, like I said, I was shy.</span> <span id="s622">I was 18.</span> <span id="s623">And I just stayed away from them mostly.</span> <span id="s624">I had interactions once.</span> <span id="s625">I was in a bomb shelter.</span> <span id="s626">I was selling cigarettes, the carton of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s627">I didn't smoke.</span> <span id="s628">And I remember we got $50.00 a carton.</span> <span id="s629">And it was from some kind of, I think it was some Polish people coming through there.</span> <span id="s630">And we were dealing with the, I was dealing with this one Polish guy in a, and here somebody come into the bomb shelter, had a light, a flashlight.</span> <span id="s631">And I got scared.</span> <span id="s632">I thought, "Uh-oh," and here it was my buddy.</span> <span id="s633">And I got my, I got $50.00 a carton for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s634">And that lasted me because then I saved my pay.</span> <span id="s635">And he paid me in marks just like the same marks that we got paid from the Army.</span> <span id="s636">But I didn't, I didn't interact too much with Germans.</span> <span id="s637">But I remember, like, in our club there, we had a house, and I remember dancing with the Germans.</span> <span id="s638">You know, but that was like too young for that.</span> <span id="s639">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: What do you remember about when you came home to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: When I came home to the United States?</span> <span id="s642">Well--</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Well, when I came into the United States, the, I got home, and I went to work.</span> <span id="s645">I worked for a PPG Company, Industries.</span> <span id="s646">And I started to work.</span> <span id="s647">And I stayed there for 40 years.</span> <span id="s648">And I retired from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: And what was your profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: What was your profession?</span> <span id="s652">What was your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Oh, I was on the shipping, shipping department, you know.</span> <span id="s654">And sometimes, I would be a foreman.</span> <span id="s655">When my foreman would take vacation, I would take his place.</span> <span id="s656">And that's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: So, looking back, what stands out the most during your time as a guard at Nuremberg?</span> <span id="s658">Is there any experience or --</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Well, yes, you know, because when I was, you know, in Natrona, I lived.</span> <span id="s660">And then, I moved to Carlisle.</span> <span id="s661">And in Carlisle, they got a War College here.</span> <span id="s662">And, a lot of my friends were retired colonels, you know, like I was a member of the Knights of Columbus.</span> <span id="s663">And that's where I met all these officers.</span> <span id="s664">And, you know, we'd talk about, you know, about the war, and you know, Army.</span> <span id="s665">And I told them where I was.</span> <span id="s666">And they thought that was really big history, you know, that I, you know, I should stop by.</span> <span id="s667">I never did.</span> <span id="s668">I just, you know, forgot about it.</span> <span id="s669">I said, "Naw, I'm not going to do anything."</span> <span id="s670">Until, and, until, and there is a Dickinson College here.</span> <span id="s671">And I used to go swimming there and use the gym.</span> <span id="s672">And I got to know the girl at the desk there.</span> <span id="s673">And I told her my story.</span> <span id="s674">And I think she knew somebody at the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s675">I forget her -- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Her first name is Bonnie Way, or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yeah, Bonnie, she's the one that worked at the college.</span> <span id="s677">And she called somebody at the Holocaust and give them my name.</span> <span id="s678">And then, I got a call from her.</span> <span id="s679">And that was, like, oh, maybe a year or two ago because she wanted me to come down there and record my story.</span> <span id="s680">And I fell off the roof, and I was laid up.</span> <span id="s681">Like, when I learned how to walk again and all.</span> <span id="s682">And I just forgot about it then.</span> <span id="s683">And then, it came up again.</span> <span id="s684">And I guess this is when I got in touch with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: So, it's been, it's only been fairly recently that you've really thought of your story as something that's historically significant that you, that you should tell someone about?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s687">Well, a lot of people in Carlisle, these Army guys, you know, they thought I should, you know.</span> <span id="s688">And because in all the time I lived in Natrona, I don't know how many years, 20 years, you know, after the war probably, and I just forgot about it.</span> <span id="s689">I didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s690">Until I came here.</span> <span id="s691">And like I said, I met a lot of Army people here.</span> <span id="s692">They got this War College, and they go there and retire from there.</span> <span id="s693">And they stayed here, and, and we became friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: And what do you, what do you remember the most?</span> <span id="s695">What's your strongest memory from when you were a guard at Nuremberg?</span> <span id="s696">What sticks out the most?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: What sticks out the most when I was a guard at Nuremberg?</span> <span id="s698">Well, I would say the time I took Albert Speer to Room 55.</span> <span id="s699">That would be the thing.</span> <span id="s700">Because I got my biggest scare when I was walking behind him because, like I say, I was only 5-6, 145 pounds or something.</span> <span id="s701">And while I was taking him to his room, he turned around.</span> <span id="s702">His, like I got so scared, I froze.</span> <span id="s703">And he just turned around and kept on walking.</span> <span id="s704">And like I told you, once he got in a room, his lawyer wasn't there, and I started talking.</span> <span id="s705">We started talking.</span> <span id="s706">And I thought he was pretty nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: What did you talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Well, he talked mostly about his, you know, his, his life in Germany, which he thinks, he knows he did wrong.</span> <span id="s709">And, you know, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s710">And he did not, he did not -- he wasn't hung.</span> <span id="s711">I think he got only ten years or 20 years.</span> <span id="s712">So, he wasn't, he was pretty nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: And he spoke in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s715">Yeah, that's another thing why, because, you know, a lot of them wouldn't speak English, just German.</span> <span id="s716">And I would, you know, we wouldn't talk to them.</span> <span id="s717">But I was surprised.</span> <span id="s718">He did it.</span> <span id="s719">He, and I spoke to Schacht.</span> <span id="s720">He was another guy spoke really good English.</span> <span id="s721">But I think he was acquitted.</span> <span id="s722">He was a financier for Hitler.</span> <span id="s723">And he was acquitted.</span> <span id="s724">And he spoke English pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Are there any other specific prisoners who you remembered that you –</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Other prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: -- that you would like to tell us about?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Stand out?</span> <span id="s729">Oh, God, they all did the same thing.</span> <span id="s730">They all went to bed.</span> <span id="s731">Well, and like I said, Jodl, that exercise thing he used to do in his cell.</span> <span id="s732">That stood out to me.</span> <span id="s733">And, no, I, just, and like I said, it was all routine.</span> <span id="s734">We would go to guard there for 24 hours, and 24 hours we would be back at the SS Kaserne.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Is there anything else about your, your either your experience at Nuremberg or looking, looking back now when you started to realize it was important?</span> <span id="s736">Is there anything else you would like to tell me about, either specifically what you did at the prison or about how you sort of think about it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Well, when I talked about the prison, I just remember when I used to walk the wall, it was cold.</span> <span id="s738">Very cold.</span> <span id="s739">And, you know, we had these overcoats in the Army.</span> <span id="s740">And you would never wear them.</span> <span id="s741">But I used to wear that on that wall.</span> <span id="s742">And I remember we had to go, you know, we had our post from one post to another post walking.</span> <span id="s743">And I think we had three, three men on the wall guarding.</span> <span id="s744">And I was always a little frightened when it was dark because I was always thinking somebody from the outside is going to crawl up there, you know, and grab me, you know.</span> <span id="s745">Like I say, I was young.</span> <span id="s746">And, and the guarding the cells, you know, it was just all routine.</span> <span id="s747">We'd come in there, do our two hours, off four, maybe go someplace else.</span> <span id="s748">And then, you come back to the cell.</span> <span id="s749">But what, you know, while you're guarding them, they're either doing some kind of paperwork or sitting or sleeping, you know.</span> <span id="s750">It was nothing to talk about really.</span> <span id="s751">And that's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Is there anything that I haven't asked you about that you'd like to tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: That you haven't asked me about?</span> <span id="s754">Oh, God, let's see, well, I -- we had guys, you know, like, I was a cell guard.</span> <span id="s755">And we had a couple guys from our place, it was a couple guards in our place that had the job in courtroom, you know, stood behind the prisoners.</span> <span id="s756">And they had the white helmets on, you know, and the white belts.</span> <span id="s757">Whereas we had, you know, just the green helmet on and the, and the dark belt.</span> <span id="s758">And I just looked up to them, that's all.</span> <span id="s759">I thought they, they had a neat job.</span> <span id="s760">And they looked good.</span> <span id="s761">And while I was in Amberg, I remember that I had, got R&amp;R, seven days off, like, a vacation.</span> <span id="s762">And I went to Berchtesgaden.</span> <span id="s763">And up in the, and I thought that was something, you know, on that trolley up in, up in the mountains there, and you're up above the clouds.</span> <span id="s764">I thought that it was so pretty.</span> <span id="s765">You know, and I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s766">And then, we had tours that, I think it was Hitler's, some kind of cave I was in in Berchtesgaden.</span> <span id="s767">And where Hitler lived, you know, we went around there as a, just as a tour.</span> <span id="s768">And that's it.</span> <span id="s769">I can't remember.</span> <span id="s770">My job was very routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Have you been back to Germany since that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: No.</span> <span id="s773">I would love to go back, but it's so expensive now.</span> <span id="s774">I would love to go back and just to see the prison, you know.</span> <span id="s775">And my wife and I were talking about, it was a cruise.</span> <span id="s776">And this cruise was going to stop in Germany, Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s777">And we inquired about it, and they told us that you could go into the courtroom.</span> <span id="s778">There's a, they had people take you through the courtroom.</span> <span id="s779">But through the prison, it was locked.</span> <span id="s780">They would not let you go through there.</span> <span id="s781">And that's, that was my big thing.</span> <span id="s782">I wanted to go in and see the prison, you know, and the places where I was.</span> <span id="s783">The places where I stood.</span> <span id="s784">But they said that was, they did not give, you know, tours in the prison except only in the courthouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Why did you want to go back to the prison specifically?</span> <span id="s786">Why did you want to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: I just, why did I want to go back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s789">Why, why did you want to revisit the prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: I just want to back and relive the life I lived when I was there because after, now, I know it was such a historic thing I did.</span> <span id="s791">And, you know, it's just nice to go back and see it.</span> <span id="s792">See what it's like now.</span> <span id="s793">It's different, you know, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Mr. Gardner, is there anything else that you would like to tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: No, I cannot think of anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: I want to thank you very much for your time.</span> <span id="s797">And on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, thank you very much for your testimony.</span> <span id="s798">I will now stop the recording.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
