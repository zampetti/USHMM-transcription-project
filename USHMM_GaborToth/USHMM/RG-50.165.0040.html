Mauritania, my uncles greeted me.</span> <span id="s15">They bought me a banana split.</span> <span id="s16">I couldn’t believe the whole thing was for me.</span> <span id="s17">I wanted to share it with my uncles.</span> <span id="s18">I still remember to this day the way the ice cream tasted.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">WH: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">RH: I went to Elway City at the age of 17.</span> <span id="s21">My brothers were there in business.</span> <span id="s22">I married an American Jew.</span> <span id="s23">I married him for all the wrong reasons and I knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">WH: So why did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">RH: Because I wanted a family.</span> <span id="s26">I had lost my parents.</span> <span id="s27">Then I wanted to get out of it after two years but my brothers wouldn’t let me.</span> <span id="s28">They said: ‘A Gross doesn’t get divorced.’</span> <span id="s29">So I stayed for sixteen years.</span> <span id="s30">The fact of the matter was that he used to humiliate me.</span> <span id="s31">He called me “Greenie.”</span> <span id="s32">He and his friends were American.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">WH: So why did he want to marry you in the first place?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">RH: I was young and beautiful and looked exotic (Even today she looks 15 years younger than she is.)</span> <span id="s35">But it was a mistake.</span> <span id="s36">And I feel that all the survivors would have benefited if they had had psychological counseling when they came.</span> <span id="s37">When I married, after all, I realized that you can’t bring back your lost family, the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">WH: What happened after you divorced him?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">RH: I had two children and then I met and fell in love with a Polish survivor.</span> <span id="s40">He was a professor, an intellectual, and I thought I had finally found happiness.</span> <span id="s41">We moved to Galveston, Texas, where my husband was a professor at the University of Texas.</span> <span id="s42">Then he hired a young woman from Germany, a graduate student, to be his assistant.</span> <span id="s43">She needed a job.</span> <span id="s44">And then, after a while I saw that he was always coming home late.</span> <span id="s45">And pretty soon it became clear to me that he was having an affair with her.</span> <span id="s46">One time I got so mad that I wanted to go over in the middle of the night and paint swastikas on the door of the place where they were.</span> <span id="s47">She wrecked 5 marriages before she left.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">WH: What happened eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">RH: I divorced him too.</span> <span id="s50">What could I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">WH: What’s your situation today?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">RH: I’m looking forward to meeting someone maybe, but I haven’t yet.</span> <span id="s53">But isn’t it amazing that first I lost my family to the Nazis in Auschwitz and then I lost my husband to the Germans in America?</span> <span id="s54">I mean have you ever heard a story like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">WH: No.</span> <span id="s56">But what’s even more amazing to me is that after all you went through, you’re looking forward to meeting someone new.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">RH: If I and my brothers would have had education we could have communicated better with each other.</span> <span id="s58">When I talk to my brothers about it, they’re too busy, they say, they don’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s59">Why is my brother so involved with these Holocaust activities?</span> <span id="s60">Because it’s an escape.</span> <span id="s61">They don’t want to communicate because they don’t know how to communicate.</span> <span id="s62">He gives these talks by rote</span></p> <p><span id="s63">WH: What about your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">RH: My children have chosen a path radically different from mine.</span> <span id="s65">My son married someone who’s not Jewish.</span> <span id="s66">They live in South Africa.</span> <span id="s67">They’re coming next month.</span> <span id="s68">I’m going to see them and the baby.</span> <span id="s69">But my brother doesn’t want to hear about it because she’s not Jewish.</span> <span id="s70">That’s the way they are.</span> <span id="s71">And my brother is the kindest, most gentle human being in the world.</span> <span id="s72">But ever since he lost his wife.</span> <span id="s73">She was raped and murdered, he’s not the same.</span> <span id="s74">And I was very close with her.</span> <span id="s75">I think he can’t feel anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">WH: So what did you learn from all these experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">RH: I feel pretty alone.</span> <span id="s78">But I learned from the Holocaust that you have to be able to be on your own.</span> <span id="s79">I trust people today.</span> <span id="s80">Acts of kindness make me trust people.</span> <span id="s81">You have to believe in the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">WH: How do you feel about religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">RH: There was a long time when I didn’t believe in God.</span> <span id="s84">Now I do.</span> <span id="s85">But I don’t think there’s anything after you die.</span> <span id="s86">But there has to be a God.</span> <span id="s87">If there’s no God, there’s no point to living, there’s no purpose to anything.</span></p> <p><span
