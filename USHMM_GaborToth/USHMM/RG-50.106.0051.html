HARRY GLIJCKMAN Let me add here as said</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Gluckman Family this newspaper clipping indicates July 1939.</span> <span id="s124">It was not too long after that that Germany attacked Poland and Britain had declared war on Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN Of course that was the beginning of our save to save some of the family and we have even notes and letters from the lady as she tried very hard also to get our son over.</span> <span id="s126">It would have maybe been possible month or two later.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">But in the meantime we have tried to arrange 10 everything possible to get out ourselves and we found what 11 will explain later maybe to you funny or strange way to 12 get an affidavit in America and to find way to get here.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">13 We didnt get any other possibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">14 THE INTERVIEWER Mrs. Gluckman when you sent 15 Marian and packed her suitcase and kissed her goodbye well 16 what was what was what you were thinking Can you tell us 17 All right.</span> <span id="s130">Well you must have been very 18 worried for your son.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">19 MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN think it was the worst 20 day of our lives when we put her into the train as you can 21 imagine.</span> <span id="s132">Not even four yet three and half years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">22 When wesaid goodbye we didnt know if we would 23 ever see her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">24 THE INTERVIEWER My question is why did you 25 have to split the family up Why did you have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Gluckman Family 10 MRS. GLUCKMAN Save the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">THE INTERVIEWER You knew already that you -- MRS. GLUCKMAJ Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">THE INTERVIEWER needed -- MRS. GLUCKMAN Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">THE INTERVIEWER And that was one reason you</span></p> <p><span id="s139">wanted to MRS. GLUCKNAN Yeah.</span> <span id="s140">We wanted to get the children out and have them safe.</span> <span id="s141">What happened to us we 10 had our life before so we were not too worried but we were 11 trying to go illegal and we could not take those small 12 children.</span> <span id="s142">He was nine or ten years old and the little girl 15 MR. HARRY GLUCKNAN Let me add something here 16 because think anyone who who hears this has to understand 17 clearly why people were not getting out -- because of the</span></p> <p><span id="s143">18 Catch-22 situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">19 And think it has to be understood that the 20 Germans in their clearly diabolical way wanted the Jews out 21 but didnt it was go but dont go and thereby there was</span></p> <p><span id="s145">22 number system.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">23 think what also has to be understood what 24 hasnt been said in the United States often enough is that 25 the major criminals in Germany at that time were the</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Gluckman Family 11 American consuls who were dealing in Jews were dealing the American consul in Stuttgart who was an appointee of Franklin Roosevelt became one of the wealthiest men in all of Europe as result of this.</span> <span id="s148">And think thats what needs to be said here.</span> <span id="s149">It was said in some of the later things that were written about Roosevelts time.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Therefore if you had very hicth number -- it was lottery you had high high number that you drew where your time would come up to apply and to possibly be 10 allowed to leave there was no hope.</span> <span id="s151">And consequently 11 people were dealing in these numbers.</span> <span id="s152">If you had very low 12 number well you were going to go and your chances of 13 getting out were good.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">14 THE INTERVIEWER Now youre talking about -- 15 what time period are you talking about 16 MR. HARRY GLUCKNAN From 1936 until the gates 17 slammed shut in 1940 or thereabouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">18 mean well come to that later but we were 19 amongst the last that were.</span> <span id="s155">able to get out in quasai legal</span></p> <p><span id="s156">20 way.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">you backtrack and tell</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">little bit how their 25 parents got out with this baby</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Gluckxnan Family 12 SECOND INTERVIEWER Yes thats very interesting how they got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN Well that think my mother and father will have to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN Let me.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">MRS. GLUCKMN Let him talk.</span> <span id="s164">Let him talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN We tried very hard to find way as mentioned before.</span> <span id="s166">Just more or less by coincidence we found Gluecksmann in New York who was 10 willing to give the affidavit as you know kind enough 11 to take the responsibility to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">12 THE INTERVIEWER How did you find this</span></p> <p><span id="s168">13 Gluecksmann 21 its characteristic of the desperation at that time to do</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Ui 22 almost anything to get out because it meant you didnt get 23 out unless someone in this country was willing to give an 24 affidavit and vouch for you as it still exists today.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">25 And most people wanted another affidavit under</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Gluckman Family 13 the table that that released them from the legal document which is also true in our case.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">But- THE INTERVIEWER Thats fine.</span> <span id="s173">Inaudible</span></p> <p><span id="s174">MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN We wont mention the names but my father through friend who had immigrated earlier with whom he played cards in Germany was able to search the telephone directory in the community where he was living for name that appeared to be similar similar enough to have 10 been changed with the umlaut dropped and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">11 And there are many versions of our name.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">12 Is there something wrong with that Im not 13 going to identify the party probably hes been dead for many 14 years in any ase but okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">15 He was willing to give -- 16 MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN No it was little 17 different.</span> <span id="s178">We ourselves my father tried very hard to help 18 us out as we tried even our children out 19 ITy father and divided the number of 20 Gluecksmanns we found in the telephone book from New York 21 and the book led us to think about 30 or 4Opeople.</span> <span id="s179">On 22 these letters we only got two answers two Gluecksmanns 23 answered and showed certain interestand what my son 24 just mentioned one friend who immigrated before us from 25 Stuttgart went after them and he found one willing to give</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Gluckman Family 14 the affidavit to help us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">And from this point on we found legal way what my son mentioned by the American consul to get the paper little by little.</span> <span id="s182">First we got the number -- THE INTERVIEWER When did that happen it was 40 already or end of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">GLUCKMAN 12 got the number from the consul and the numbers were very very 13 wide open you know until we got it it was beginning of</span></p> <p><span id="s184">14 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">15 As my wife said in the meantime was ordered 16 by the government to the Jews organization to work on street</span></p> <p><span id="s186">17 street 18 MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN Construction project.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">19 MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN Construction project.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">20 And so if wouldnt have gone probably they 21 would have put me in concentration camp or so 22 But this was all before what didnt mention 23 or.what we had not mentioned at all yet that was lucky 24 enough not to be called to concentration camp because once 25 when the Nazis came it was in the famous Kristal Night.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Gluckman Family 15</span></p> <p><span id="s190">MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN November 38.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN And even second time -- THE INTERVIEWER You were in the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s192">Can you tell us little bit about it</span></p> <p><span id="s193">MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN Oh yes.</span> <span id="s194">Only too well reiuember because when the Nazis came in the front of the house jumped out of the window in the back and this probably saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">And by the secondtime when they came looking 10 for the Jews my father who still lived with my mother in 11 Breslau even came by train from Ereslau to us in Stuttgart 12 but we were living in another house with friends not to be 13 caught.</span> <span id="s196">So -- 14 THE INTERVIEWER Non-Jewish friends or Jewish 15 MR HAPRY GLUCKNAN Jewish friends where the 16 husband had already been taken away to concentration camp 17 so there was some feeling that they wouldnt come back to</span></p> <p><span id="s197">18 that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">19 THE INTERVIEWER At the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">20 MR. HARRY GLUCKNAN At that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">21 MR WALTER GLUCKMAN So one has nothing to do 22 with the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">23 Of course going back further this hour 24 didnt want to be too too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">25 MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN No thatts what were here</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Gluckman Family 16 for but were -- while were on the subject of Kristal Night lets talk about that for just second because have recollection that Ive never shared with anyone and think it might might well be on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">And you mentioned what you did.</span> <span id="s205">Maybe you ought to take break and let me talk for just minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">remember and Ive written about so its very clear in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">As small boy and very impressionable boy 10 came out of the house that that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">11 MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN In Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">12 MR.

WALTER GLUCKMAN Excuse me one thing and have to interrupt because that might be important.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN Thats fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">MR WALTER GLUCKMAN As said before in the 10 meantime the war had broken out so we even lived through the 11 war.</span> <span id="s328">already in Stuttgart and were.witness already from the 12 bombing Of the English planes in Germany and already in 13 Stuttgart we had to go to the basement to the cellar to live 14 two nights where the bombs -- 15 MR HARRY GLUCKMAN And stand on the roof and 16 cheer the British planes when they were able to get through 17 which was delight Yeah 18 MR WALTER GLUCKMAN So but if it is if it 19 is worthwhile if it is worthwhile to mention or is it do 20 cut you off now 21 THE INTERVIEWER Go ahead 22 MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN And even in the last week 23 we had -- we left Stuttgart think it was yeah it was 24 must.</span> <span id="s329">have been end of August for visit to my parents in 25 Breslau to say goodbye knowing most.probably that we will</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Gluckrnan Family 25 not see each other anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">And as said before when our daughter left it was hard day but it might have been even harder.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">And from Breslau we went to Berlin and put stay there in socalled pension for the last week because we had to stay there as we only there got our several visas.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">had gone from Stuttgart before even for few days to Hburg where got hold of some of the necessary visas and the last week where we stayed in Berlin.</span> <span id="s334">beginning of 10 September we were there from this week think it was about 11 eigh.t or nine days we stayed every night in the cellar 12 because the English planes came.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">13 And the only the only night when my wife think 14 it was not necessary to take to qo to bed or anything 15 the only time was when the English planes did not come</span></p> <p><span id="s336">16 So- 17 MR HARRY GLUCKMAN think getting back to 18 the the trip the fact we were able to get the papers 19 think what has to be understood also is that there were 20 few companies still willing to buy and sell Jews for Deutsch</span></p> <p><span id="s337">21 Marks 22 And one of the provisions of this this able to 23 get out was the fact that the entire trip from departure to 24 arrival in San Francisco Harbor had to be paid in advance in 25 Deutsch Mark.s or you didnt go.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Gluckrnan Family 26 That dont know.</span> <span id="s339">Maybe my father would.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">But along with what youre saying dont know what the cost of it was but we were allowed Jews at that time were allowed to take out with them per person ten Deutsch Marks which at that time was worth about little more than three dollars per person.</span> <span id="s341">So was it fourtwenty Okay missed it little bit But was going by because we all remember that we arrived here with just little bit between the three of us little bit over three dollars 10 was it $2.40 or was it three dollars and something dont 11 remember.</span> <span id="s342">But it was around three dollars that we arrived</span></p> <p><span id="s343">12 here with.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">13 MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN inaudible 14 MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN But -- well we were going 15 to talk about the trip and my father just sort of glossed 16 over it because the enormity of the trip is hard to</span></p> <p><span id="s345">17 understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">18 When one boards the the first of all we 19 crossed what had been independent countries and had already 20 become part of the Nazi empire and part of the Russian 21 empire because we went through Latvia and Estonia and</span></p> <p><span id="s347">22 Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">23 We were welcomed 24 THE INTERVIEWER inaudible.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">25 MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN Yes.</span> <span id="s350">You want to</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Gluckman Family 27</span></p> <p><span id="s352">backtrack little bit</span></p> <p><span id="s353">MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN have it here in front of me we left oh yes we left Berlin on the evening of the 11th of September 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">And when the train left Berlin tthe same time the English bombers bombed Berlin and we heard the following days that they were kind of successful.</span> <span id="s355">They had even bombed the famous Brandenburg Tor in Berlin.</span> <span id="s356">It was the very same night when we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">10 On the 12th of September we came in the 11 morning to Kcnigsberg and to the German border in Eitkow.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">12 And think the three of us will never forget what happened 13 there because ---now it comes all back to my memory too 14 things you didnt want to think anymore and remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">15 went out of the train on this frontier correct in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">eah was was going 18 to talk about that too.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">19 MR WALTER GLUCKMAN And the frontier -- 20 MR. HARRY GLUCKNAN The the -- 21 MR WALTER GLUCKMAN -- station because we 22 had little bit more money in our pocket and at least 23 wanted to send this back and some postage stamps and so on 24 to my parents as they were not too well off anymore either 25 MRS. GLUCKMAN The food stamps.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Gluckman Family 28</span></p> <p><span id="s363">MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN Food stamps too.</span> <span id="s364">That is right.</span> <span id="s365">My wife remembers better than do.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">MR.

WALTER GLUCKrAN Ration coupons.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">7.</span> <span id="s372">MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN Yeah.</span> <span id="s373">Its little different in the modern vernacular.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN And when came back 10 wanted to go back to the train there came Nazi in uniform with very hard looks of course Where did you Jew go 12 And saw my wife and my son standing in the 13 train at the window as white as here th.is piece of paper 14 because they were afraid and so was that he would never 15 let me go back to the train 16 But another came was more conductor of the 17 train said Oh let him go Let him go And was 18 fortunate enough could enter the train again And there 19 we went on to No Mans Land for us 20 dont know if should go so much in detail 21 MR HARRY GLUCKMAN No But think we have 22 to explain that we crossed we crossed Germany -- when we 23 left Germany we crossed Russian occupied territory now all 24 part of Russia of course and we were welcomed with what 25 was left of the remnants of the Jewish community in -- what to Pinsk.</span> <span id="s375">-- my recollection of it is is very vague and its sort of like deep dark dream.</span> <span id="s376">as small boy lonly recall some of the little the little rooms that they put me to sleep in were which were wooden shacks.</span> <span id="s377">remember wooden sidewalks and the the -- really what guess you could describe is the the old Steti paintings 10 that one sees of Lithuania and Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">11 THE INTERVIEWER Had you ever been to</span></p> <p><span id="s379">12 Lithuania before 13.</span> <span id="s380">MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN German Jews didnt go to 14 Lithuania and Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">15 MR WALTER GLUCKM1N have written down 16 lady from the interest committee came and ordered another 17 MR HARRY GLUCKMAN They locked us up in the 18 train with.</span> <span id="s382">the lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">19 MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN Orders another train</span></p> <p><span id="s384">20</span></p> <p><span id="s385">21 22 explanation of that.</span> <span id="s386">You have to let let me clarify 23 that little bit before we deal with that because we were 24 locked in these these cattle cars for reason and the 25 reason was that the the good will agreement between Stalin</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Gluckman Family 30 and Hitler had about run its course and the Russians knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">And they were rushing troops to the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">The trains were literally running 20 to 22 hours day through the day and night rushing troops to the front to stem this tide that they knew was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">So people going the other way tourists or refugees going in the other direction were shunted off through railroad siding and had to sit.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">And since the trains were needed they could 10 only put us in those cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">11 Youre going to change tape 12 What were doing are you in operation there</span></p> <p><span id="s393">13 Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">14 Because Ithink one has to understand the 15 enormity of this trip because in those days -- dont 16 know if youve ever taken train across the United States 17 as did once and it was four days and four nights but when 18 one gets on the Siberian Express in Moscow one spends 21 19 days and nights.</span> <span id="s395">We were three weeks on that train across 20 Russia.</span> <span id="s396">And that gives little bit of the enormity.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">21 think my father might mention some of the 22 towns that we -- think after Minsk and Pinsk my 23 recollection of it is that we went around the largest lake 24 in the world Lake Baykal.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">25 MR. WALTER GLUCKN In Moscow --</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Gluckman Family 31</span></p> <p><span id="s400">MR.

HARRY GLUCKMAN The Moscow subway.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">14 MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN Moscow subway.</span> <span id="s408">It was 15 very impressive and one of the highlights of the otherwise 16 not so very pleasant trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">17 MR.

WALTER GLUCKMAN Then in the train 21 have written down we were 113 people 100 Jews immqrants 22 some nonJews an English couple and six Japanese And there 23 started big trouble with the meals in the train as the 24 people even fought themselves -- is it right to say 25 And this time had to go over and divided</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Gluckman Family 32 them in groups that they didnt fight each other who comes first and who didnt get so much anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">There was very nice locating city Novosibirsk and of course dont want to go too much in detaU...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Fromallthe places whenever possible we send telegrams to both parents my parents in Breslau as well as to Telaviv where my wifes parents were living.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">And then came the pretty famous city of Irkutsk and had very tough luck because sprained my ankle on the 10 station there and then we moved along what Harry started to 11 say already on the very beautiful Baykal Lake and we found</span></p> <p><span id="s416">12 out 19 MR HARRY GLUCKMAN Makes Lake Tahoe look like</span></p> <p><span id="s417">20 duck pond 21 MR WALTER GLUCKMAN That is not only that we 22 always talk from the very cold weather because it was there 23 very beautiful some of it.</span> <span id="s418">But we of course had no 24 possibility to witness in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">25 But in the train in the meantime about it</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Gluckman Family 33 was the 22nd already almost two weeks we came in Manchuria to the well-known city of Harbin.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">And the coincidence was that there cousin of my wife was living former former dentist in Breslau and think we had written to him that we came.</span> <span id="s422">And so he took care of the three of us for the few hours we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">He took me some place what never forgot in this ricksaw to go someplacei.I dont remember exactly where it was and took us the three of us to his home where we 10 finally after so many days got chance to have shower or bath and clean up little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">12 And he tried to even talk us into not going 13 along any further and staying there with him maybe we would 14 maybe find some other chances but we didnt want to do it 15 go to any risk 16 So on the same night we went out on with our 17 train trip and came to the border 18 MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN have to interrupt here 19 because therewas pretty frightening experience arriving 20 at the train station and having missed the train missed the 21 group that we were with and now here you are the only non 22 orientals in this whole damn city and not able to read or 23 speak or anything.</span> <span id="s425">Ill never forget that.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">24 Did you want to say 25 THE INTERVIEWER This was in Manchuria.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Gluckman Family 34</span></p> <p><span id="s428">MR.

WALTER GLUCKMAN When our shin arrived -- when our ship arrived in Hawaii that was of course for us the first the first light of Heaven because we saw there the first American flag.</span> <span id="s587">And what this meant we will not 10 forget because it meant finally freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">11 And there it was kind of very nice and amusing 12 for us too.</span> <span id="s589">We had to swim in the ocean there what was 13 big earn to us From there it was still -- today you make 14 it in four or five hours by plane but from there it was 15 still think another week to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">16 And finally we arrived in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s591">And</span></p> <p><span id="s592">17 when -- 18 THE INTERVIEWER inaudible 19 MR.

WALTER GLUCKMAN Those were the words what my wife said Here am and here stay.u And that is still today what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">On the same afternoon we were greeted by the Committee by the --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">MR. HARRY GLTJCKMAN No.</span> <span id="s598">It was the the -- and Ill be forever grateful to the Council of Jewish Women.</span> <span id="s599">MR. WALTER GLtJCKMAN Council of Jewish Women.</span> <span id="s600">MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN Who welcomed us and -- 10 MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN They welcomed us on 11 California Street in their home for some coffee and cake or 12 whatever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">13 MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN And got deathly ill 14 because we couldnt handle the rich food.</span> <span id="s602">Wed never -- Id 15 never eaten some of these things 16 MR. WALTER GLUCKMAN And the lady from the 17 Council came around to serve us to help us and she found 18 out that we are coming from Stuttgart She said Oh wait 19 moment.</span> <span id="s603">have cousin here who was living in Stuttgart 20 coming on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">21 humanly possible7 We never</span></p> <p><span id="s605">22 heard anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">23 was bowling together with him in Stuttgart 24 but he had seen in the newspaper what came out around noontime 25 as my son mentioned already San Francisco News that had got</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Gluckman Family 46 out already in the newspaper picture from us Jewish refugees because reporter came ahead onboard of the ship and they put this picture already in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN Incidently can interrupt to talk little bit about this article First of all think it its it should be clarified that the group that was -- the group of refugees that was on the train on the Trans-Siberian Express the majority of them were not aslucky as we and they had papers 10 only as far as Shanghai and that was back to all the -- 11 yeah from Mukden they then headed north to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">12 With with the ship however it indicates 13 that there were hundred and sixty refugees aboard the 14 HaiyoMaru Phonetic half of whom and Im quoting the 15 article here half of whom were to debark here and in Los 16 Angeles and the others at Mexican and Latin American ports.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">17 And at the end of the article last part of the 18 article says The vessle was due to continue her voyage to 19 Valparaiso Chile tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">little bit because</span></p> <p><span id="s612">inaudible Yeah and the majority of 24 themr in mosb cases at that time did go on to Latin American</span></p> <p><span id="s613">25 ports</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Gluckman Family 47 You want to talk about --</span></p> <p><span id="s615">MR. WALTER GLUCKAN dont know inaudible</span></p> <p><span id="s616">MR. HARRY GLUCKMAN Okay.</span> <span id="s617">Lets stop for second.</span> <span id="s618">Just lets put this on tape and let me preface it to say that this really is -- this yeah but want to say something here because its important to to future students of of the Jewish society in America and how it was shaped by the immigration of of the European Jews the the preholocaust the refugees like us who came out literally 10 five minutes before midnight before the gates were slammed</span></p> <p><span id="s619">11 shut.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">12 And it has lot to do with with where we are 13 today in the United States as Jews politically and socially 14 and economically because in those early days the the very 15 reason that not many Jews were saved who could have been 16 saved by the the the lack of political clout of political 17 strength of the Jewish community and the devisiveness of the 18 Jewish community at that time It also had lot to do with 19 the attitude of the Jews who had come earlier who were not 20 willing to accept refugees into their midst who were not 21 prepared to assist in any way because it endangered their 22 social and their economic position and this has been true 23 of every immigration to this country over the years.</span> <span id="s621">Its 24 evident now in the lack of welcome for the influx of the 25 orientals and the separation and think with that we get</span></p> <p><span id="s622">G.uckman Family 48 into where we were when we arrived here with $2.40 for the thiee of us and somebody said well here you are and the Jewish community and would put community here in quotes and underlined because it really wasnt community it just sort of it just happened here.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">There was the Jewish Family Service which in those days we endearingly called the Eureka if youve ever been there you know the words over the door they were of some assistance and did help us in getting located in terms</span></p> <p><span id="s624">10 of loaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">11 But think we ought to talk little bit and 12 let my father talk and maybe my mother as well about the 13 the difficulty of reestablishing life here and finding 14 way because it didnt begin in this house with with nice 15 furniture and and it began lot different and really 16 dont want to continue talking here because my recollections 17 are quite different 18 Id like to come back and Id like my father 19 to take over here and talk about that that start because 20 for me it was very easy.</span> <span id="s626">went to school and learned -- 21 in three weeks learned the English language because because 22 was fortunate enough to have couple friends.</span> <span id="s627">But lets 23 lets the the starting over and the finding of job was 24 an.</span> <span id="s628">extremely difficult thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">25 .</span> <span id="s630">.</span> <span id="s631">And just want to say one other thing on that</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Gluckman Family 49 and then Im going to let my father take over and Ill rest</span></p> <p><span id="s633">my voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">think its important that we record how difficult it was.</span> <span id="s635">One of the one of the requirements for getting number visa to leave Germany it was requirement of the.</span> <span id="s636">American in addition to the affidavit which meant that someone here would vouch for you and that you would not become burden on the state or on the country was that you had trade with which you could support 10 yourself when you arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">11 My father mentioned earlier that he worked for 12 firm in which his father had started as an apprentice in 13 his youth and had gone all the way to the the chairman of 14 the boardof president or whatever large firm.</span> <span id="s638">But its 15 one trade which my father learned as an apprentice and 16 and worked all Of his working days in Germany but not 17 particularly marketable commodity in the United States because 18 if youre familiar with what veneer is it just isnt used 19 too much since since the advent of vinyl and plastics and 20 all the other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">21 So it meant not having trade when he arrived</span></p> <p><span id="s640">22 here.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">23 Before we left Germany1 my father retrained 24 as baker and confectioner and that -- the hope was that 25 this would provide employment and Sustenance when we</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Gluckman Family 50</span></p> <p><span id="s643">arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">And he paid someone who who came to our home our our apartment in Stuttgart and they bought machinery and bowls and all sorts of mixing equipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">And every night remember as kid used to hate the sound of these damn machines running these these whipping whipped cream and mixing.</span> <span id="s646">used to say God why do we have to live it was like living in boiler factory And while its amusing now looking back in 10 retrospect it meant the difference between getting these 11 papers and havinga viable trade when we arrived here.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">12 So having said that think its important 13 that nOw we hear from my father what happened when he 14 learned this trade and try.ing to break into job here now.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">15 San Francisco of course was in those days 16 blessed with not only the Langendorf bakery but the 17 Waxman Bakery and the Ukrain Bakery and in those days there 18 were fourteen major Jewish bakeries.</span> <span id="s649">And Im underlining 19 Jewish here Jewishowned and Jewish-operated bakeries.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">20 Now my father is wrinkling his nose which 21 means hes going to take over the microphone so Ill rest 22 MR.

HARRY GLUCKMAN Lets put that on tape 19 please because think this is very important because at -- 20 first what were talking about what were discussing is is 21 getting my sister to rejoin the fajnily here after four or five 22 years and obviously young girl she was then not yet ten 23 years old was not allowed to travel alone and would have to be 24 accompanied by an adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">25 So my parents moved Heaven and Earth and wrote</span></p> <p><span id="s733">58 they read in the newspaper that some performer was going to England to enter tam the troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">And among others well first were performers who were regular travelers back and forth by ship and we have letter to pleading letter that was written to Deanna Durbin who was at that time scheduled to entertain troops in England and pleading with her to perhaps bring my sister to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">10 There was an exchange of communication with the 11 wife of President Roosevelt Eleanor Roosevelt who had 12 become somewhat of world traveler and was scheduled to 13 travel to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">14 And an answer back not from Mrs. Roosevelt 15 but on her behalf from the United States Department of State 16 indicating that this would be impossible.</span> <span id="s737">If you read between 17 the lines the reason it was imDossible is because it was not 18 desirable on the part of the Democratic party for the wife 19 of the President to bring Jewish child along during an 20 election campaign for the presidency.</span> <span id="s738">mean thats thats 21 parenthetic note think it needs to be said however 22 dont know if theres anything else to say on 23 that subject except that finally my parents made -- did make 24 contact with someone in England who was planning to make 25 trip to the United States and then did well dont shake</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Gluckman Family 59 your head.</span> <span id="s740">Correct me on the tape</span></p> <p><span id="s741">MR.
